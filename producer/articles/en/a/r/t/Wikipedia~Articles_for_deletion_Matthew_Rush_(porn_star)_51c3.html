<p>Very very very strong keep. He is a very important star. The article itself is well written and should not be deleted. GB</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> . mtxoracle 04:00 22 May 2006 (PST) Matthew/Greg is very notable, the mark of AfD is silly. He is very notable, given that WikiP keeps a list of pornstars and has many holes in that list, as a resource for free information and a compendium of said information it stands to reason that this article should not be deleted or altered outside of furhter updates or corrections.... now i hope i did this right.</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> . UBopp 01:04, 8 June 2006 (UTC) Unless Wikipedia is instituting across-the-board censorship policies, there can be no argument for deleting this article without advocating a major reduction of freedom of speech as it is permitted in the rules of Wikipedia. That wouldn't be very conservative, now, would it?

<li><b>Comment</b>, <i>"...freedom of speech as it is permitted in the rules of Wikipedia"</i>? Sorry, there is no inherent "freedom of speech" on Wikipedia, or any other website for that matter. Deleting this article would not violate "freedom of speech" if you are referring to your constitutional rights (presuming you are American), because the 1st Amendment only guarantee's that the government will not abridge your right to "free speech". It says nothing about the media, or society at large, moderating you, I, or anyone else. Just ask the <a href="../../../d/i/x/Dixie_Chicks_777c.html" title="Dixie Chicks">Dixie Chicks</a>... Besides, Jimbo's executive actions on some articles Brian Peppers should be proof enough that there is no absolute "freedom of speech" on Wikipedia; all articles are subject to removal by executive action if Jimbo et. al. deem it so. But, enough of a civics lesson for today... If you are speaking about <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a> that may occur by deleting this entry, you may have a point. In that case though it would be beneficial for anyone with the opinion of "Keep" to post some <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources proving that this individual meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>. I have not idea if he meets those criteria, hence no opinion on it. Opinions for deletion or rentention should be based on those criteria though.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:33, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - it's not true that "Every porn stars have their article even if they are not specifically 'notable'" - lots are deleted right here at AFD. <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> is a proposal for formalizing what makes a porn star notable. Can one or more of the people voting Keep explain exactly what makes Rush "one of the more popuar gay porn stars"? Is there some kind of ranking of relative popularity we can reference? <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 18:07, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. The criteria in <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> are clearly not met, or no mention of their being met is made. I also wonder precisely why there are so very many "strong keep" votes, which are otherwise rather rare, by so many users who are either anonymous or lacking userpages? Having investigated as much during the writing of this comment, I have found that a few of them are extremely new, with very few edits. I have nothing against new users, mind you, but could some be sock puppets? Ubopp, for instance, has made all of one edit - to this page. Mtxoracle has made only one edit to article space and two to this page. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcon_Kirtaran_c435.html" title="User:Falcon Kirtaran">Falcon</a> 23:21, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> criterion the <i>keep</i> "votes" are being cast under would apparently be #8, <i>notable performer in niche</i>, where "gay porn" is the niche. Again, I'm not "voting" one way or the other, but I would really appreciate if someone who does know about the niche state what specifically makes him notable in the niche. Note that <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28erotic_actors%29_1be2.html#Gay_porn_stars" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (erotic actors)">this specific issue</a> (that 100 films was probably too high for gay erotic actors) was the very first comment on WP:PORN BIO. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 13:06, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: If the article can be cleaned up and actual information (other than physical attributes, etc.) can be uploaded, then Matthew Rush is a good candidate for keeping around. Mr. Rush's career, according to the aforementioned proposed outline for adult film stars that <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcon_Kirtaran_c435.html" title="User:Falcon Kirtaran">Falcon</a> alluded to, is a valid Wikipedia entry. He won an AVN (Gayvn Award to be specific) award in 2002 for Best Newcomer, and as it has been mentioned before, he has what seems to be an exclusive "lifetime" contract with the higest-grossing gay film company in the country. If any of the editors who have voted "strong keep" can update this information, it might be worth it in the long run.<a href="../../../o/v/e/User%7EOverdrive10_c173.html" title="User:Overdrive10">Overdrive10</a> 04:51, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think that <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> has appropriate criteria for gay pron stars. I would try to add some but I'm not sure exactly what they should be myself. Someone with broader experience than I should look into adding something to the proposal. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 20:46, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Matthew Rush is definitely among the more notable porn stars in the industry, due to his appearance in high-profile Falcon films and in the touring play. I was pretty surprised to see that a well written article about him is being considered for deleltion. --DavidK93 04:06, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> article is well written and factual.

<li><b>Keep</b>.
