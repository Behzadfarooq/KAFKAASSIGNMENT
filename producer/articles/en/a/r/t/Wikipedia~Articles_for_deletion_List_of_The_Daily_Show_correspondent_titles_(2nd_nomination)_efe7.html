<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscrimante collection of information, for the reason articulated very clearly by Sjakkalle. If there were something interesting about some of the entries in the list, then that can be mention in a "Trivia" section of the main article on the show.

<li>Comment: There is no "Daily Show space". Sub-pages are a bad thing. They are sometimes used for structural reasons on project pages but we have intentionally disabled their use in the article space.

<li><b>Delete</b>. A few mentions of memorable titles are appropriate in the main article. Attempting to create a comprehensive list of every such title is beyond the scope of even a paperless encyclopedia. This list is so large (and will continue to get larger as long as the show continues) and the contents so trivial that the list can not be effectively protected from subtle vandalism such as the introduction of plausible but inaccurate information. Yes, in theory it could be protected. But in practice, we have a continual shortage of informed and responsible editors. "Merge and redirect" is, in my mind, unnecessary since the contents of this article came from the main article. History of the original attribution is already preserved there. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 16:34, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I share your concerns, but if "likely target of subtle vandalism" was a deletion criterion, we'd have an awful lot of deleting to do. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 19:35, 13 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: The standard is not "likely <i>target</i>" of vandalism but whether the article will draw enough informed editors to protect it from the <i>inevitable</i> vandalism. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> is among the most vandalized pages on Wikipedia but we have lots of reputable editors with deep and specific content knowledge who <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerify_dc11.html" title="Wikipedia:Verify">verify</a> recent contributions and are able to quickly find and revert the vandalism. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I listed it the first time, and my opinion hasn't changed. One quick question, did I screw up some policy somewhere that prevented the original VFD from getting listed in all the appropriate places? AFAIK, everything was done properly.
