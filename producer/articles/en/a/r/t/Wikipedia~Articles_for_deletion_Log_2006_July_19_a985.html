A writer's group whose members achieve such notability is notable itself, because the group's purpose is directly related with the members' field of notable achievement. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpiondollprincess_f1a6.html" title="User:Scorpiondollprincess">Scorpiondollprincess</a> 13:22, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, I fear. My primary concern is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> -- the only references I can find on the web are Wikipedia mirrors and a brief one-sentence mention on Erin O'Brien's personal homepage, which is in the form of a link to Wikipedia. Regardless of the notability concern, keeping this would require someone to locate and cite some reliable sources that could be used to verify the article's claims.<br />
With regard to notability, I strongly disagree with Scorpiondollprincess's claim that the group derives automatic notability from the notability of its members. I do not dispute that at least some of its members are notable, but the article does not claim that membership of the group has verifiably contributed to their success, nor that it forms a defined literary circle with an identifiable style or influence, and I'm not sure what other grounds there could be for claiming that it is of any significance whatsoever to non-members.<br />
Let me reiterate, however, that notability concerns are secondary; if no sources can be found to verify the article, notability becomes moot. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 15:50, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I concede the point on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, Haeleth. You are right and this article does violate verifiability. I still maintain a group composed of persons notable for X and organized around the subject of X is notable. I don't suggest "automatic notability." If a group of notable writers formed an organization to discuss fishing or woodworking, that's not notable. But if notable persons form a group about the subject that made them notable, then their organization is notable as well. Regardless, you are correct -- the article lacks proper citations. I modify my position to a <b>Weak Keep</b> if <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources can be provided. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpiondollprincess_f1a6.html" title="User:Scorpiondollprincess">Scorpiondollprincess</a> 19:00, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b>. I am compelled by the argument that these articles should not be grouped together into a single AFD discussion, as they represent significantly varying levels of notability/usefulness/game-guide-ness, and varying levels of quality. It is likely that, if the same contributors were discussing individual articles in this list, many would be deleted while others would be kept. This is NOT a precedent-setting decision and the individual articles involved in this discussion can certainly be nominated in smaller groups or separately right away. The only thing people should take from this is to be careful how you group nominations - it's tempting to say that these are all related because of the game, but they differ too much to get any clear consensus out of the deal.

Undoubtedly, if articles were repeatedly re-nominated for deletion within a short period of time, a "consensus" for deletion might eventually be reached during one of the AFD's purely by chance; however, I claim that it is improper to subject articles to "double jeopardy" by re-nominating them for deletion less than two weeks after a consensus was reached to keep them. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 23:06, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong delete all.</b> I have always thought that these articles are utter trash.

"Not a game guide" is not a strong enough argument to remove the pages as there are over 30 articles in the <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everquest.html" title="Everquest">Everquest</a> series. These pages need to be adopted by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Computer_and_video_games_662f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games">Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games</a> which should help cull much of the cruft that they admittedly contain. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoehorn_e4cc.html" title="User:Shoehorn">Shoehorn</a> 20:54, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - My justifcation is all the 20+ articles are (in the most part) very similar. Going through each of the 29 articles, pointing out all the bad points and justifying what's wrong would be /incredibly/ time consuming (unless you want me to explain how long it took me to put all the articles onto AFD as it is) and would clog up AFD. That said, feel free to justify any pages where my initial points don't apply. On top of that, you argue that the pages are tantamount to manuals and fansites (which, y'know, could be referenced - both are online with RuneScape), which teach how to play the game, almost proving my point about Game Guides and instruction manual. I don't understand where the justification for strong oppose came from in the above argument. Also, existance of 30 kludgy EverQuest pages is in no way an indicator that this is good practise... although I would point out that the Everquest pages have 23 pages about different expansions, different releases of the game (EQ1, 2, West etc) and related games (such as a PS2 game), most of which were commercial-released to retail, which makes it easy to justify that they need their own page so it's nowhere near in the same league. In practise, there's about 15 pages actually about the game. On top of that, it could be argued that EverQuest was a lot more influential as a game as possibly the first hugely successful subscription-model MMORPG which caused dozens of other games to be created, but I agree, the amount of pages there is also OTT and should be trimmed. I might do that next. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 23:03, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Laziness is not a virtue. Clogging up AFD is not an issue. This discussion should focus on what should and what should not be included in WP, it is clear to me that one Runescape article would not be sufficient, especially given the history of the articles. I oppose deletion, as I said above, primarily because you are unwilling to examine the articles based on their individual merits/significance. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoehorn_e4cc.html" title="User:Shoehorn">Shoehorn</a> 00:11, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd really rather not be called lazy, thanks - <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. Also, putting all 28 pages on AFD would artifically discourage people from contributing (bringing in a clear "non consensus", or keep, bias), they all have similar reasons for being deleted, and really would clog up AFD with the same reasons again and again when the process has been specifically designed to allow multiple deletions specifically in cases such as this (From WP:AFD, they're designed for - <i>An article about a video game/book and related articles for characters within it.</i>). I have good reasons for grouping these nominations. Putting 28 nominations would also represent 20%+ of a days AFD traffic, which I feel would not be good karma and would, indeed, clog it up. -<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 00:32, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>We have the following situation: Nominating 28 individual articles for deletion would likely exhaust the attention of most casual participants, resulting in an unevenly argued consensus about which pages to keep/merge/delete. Probably half of the articles would be deleted, the rest marked for merge or cleanup. If instead you group all 28 articles together, glossing over individual problems/merits, you are going to get an easy consensus to delete all of the articles, as is the case here. So grouping all the articles together is simply a rhetorical tactic to avoid a fair evaluation of the individual articles. I think this is fundamentally unfair to the individual articles in question, <i>many of which have successfully undergone AfD votes on previous occasions</i>, and submit that this is an <b>invalid nomiation</b>. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoehorn_e4cc.html" title="User:Shoehorn">Shoehorn</a> 05:56, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I believe this is very much scraping the barrel as to why the articles should stay here, and that you are trying to invoke a "default rule" and I'm really struggling to believe this isn't done in bad faith as to avoid an overwhelming delete vote. Fact is that sending 28 /very similar/ articles to AFD isn't going to result in anything but overwhelming beauracracy and not a full and frank discussion, and I would no doubt be told I shouldn't have grouped the nominations and that THAT discussion wouldn't be binding by someone who wants to keep the articles. If there are any articles which you honestly think what I stated didn't apply, give your opinions, otherwise I stand by my comments completely. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 15:25, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This isn't a vote, and we have moved far beyond the point where an "overwhelming delete vote" could be taken as consensus to delete these articles.

<dd>I am not suggesting that this AfD should be bound by previous discussions. I am saying that given the varied history of each of the 28 articles, some of which have been marked for merge/cleanup, as well as other articles from this category which have successfully been deleted through a valid AfD process, each of these articles is distinct enough to merit an individual AfD. Some of the subpages are organic extensions of the main article; others are indiscriminate collections of cruft that should be trimmed. Which pages deserve which fate cannot be determined by a grouped AfD. People are jumping on the "delete all" bandwagon because they think they can resolve this situation in one fell swoop, but I doubt any of them have reviewed all 28 pages. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoehorn_e4cc.html" title="User:Shoehorn">Shoehorn</a> 19:54, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Heh, what's the point in improving an article if by next week it could be deleted? This AfD has really put me off improving the articles until this is over. Although the nominator has thrown them all together in one AfD, I do not agree that they should all be dealt with as one article. Most articles don't even have a reason--the nominator has only listed seven reasons for twenty-eight articles. On that note, I wonder if the nominator has even reviewed all of these articles. It appears to me that this list has simply been copied from <a href="../../../r/u/n/Template%7ERuneScape_ec3d.html" title="Template:RuneScape">Template:RuneScape</a>; even an errant &lt;br&gt; tag exists after the construction article in a list otherwise empty of them, and this uses the exact same [[x|y]] wikilink format. Up front I'd like to call a <b>malformed nomination</b>.

<p>Just because I say <b>keep</b> doesn't mean I think the articles are FA-status, perfect, or even good. They may have a lot of cruft, but to get rid of it, we don't have to delete the whole series; we just have to clean out the cruft. Anyone can do this. After all, if your house is dirty, you clean it up, you don't burn it down. <a href="../../../h/y/e/User%7EHyenaste_70a2.html" title="User:Hyenaste">Hyenaste</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../h/y/e/User_talk%7EHyenaste_720f.html" title="User talk:Hyenaste">(tell)</a></sup> 02:42, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The problem lies deeper than just cleaning out the cruft. First off, the only reason the articles exist is because of the fancruft.

So cleaning them up doesn't <i>solve</i> the problem. A non-Runecraft player in passing, doesn't need to know about every intricate detail of the game. Rather, they can read an overview of the game, with the basics laid out, and then they can follow the links to other information repositories. The house must be demolished, because it was <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">illegally</a> built to begin with. --<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorqin_0917.html" title="User:Porqin">Porqin</a> 03:05, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>; whatever happens, <b><a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> needs subpages.</b> This is an absolutely monumental subject, so even putting the briefest of overviews into a single page will have people complaining about the length, and dooming the GA effort to failure. Unfortunately, the current subpages have gotten out of control, being too numerous to keep track of, letting the (inexplicably numerous) vandals and crufters run riot. However, it would save time and make the task of cleanup easier to move these to Portal subpages, where worthwhile information can be extracted and placed into brand new, less numerous and therefore easier to control subpages. The old subpages can then be speedied when they are no longer required. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainVindaloo_b7ba.html" title="User:CaptainVindaloo">CaptainVindaloo</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainVindaloo_30b8.html" title="User talk:CaptainVindaloo">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CaptainVindaloo_0228.html" title="Special:Contributions/CaptainVindaloo">c</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CaptainVindaloo_40b4.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CaptainVindaloo">e</a></sup> 03:25, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongest possible keep</b>. The subject is too great to fit into one article. We also worked very hard on them, and fancruft alone isn't a good enough reason for deletion. Since the last time they all went up for deletion, we created a portal (which also went up for deletion with a keep result) to oversee and organize the articles. Some of them, such as the monster articles, could be merged. But if you have to delete them, I challenge you to go and delete every single piece of fancruft on Wikipedia. That includes video game and movie characters, locations, and monsters. And they <b>are</b> researched. A lot of the information is taken from the Knowledge Base and fansites, as well as the game itself. We could do with more references, and we have a policy about external links. Anyway, I've posted notices on the main article and portal page. If you're planning to delete articles, at least let the maintainers know.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> We had a single article before, just the RuneScape article. It was one of the longest articles on WP and needed serious shortening. Because there is so much information on RuneScape, the only way to shorten it was to have sub-pages. These sub-pages are all well written, well maintained and frequently checked through to make sure they conform with WP policy. We have been down this road before, a number of times. There is simply too much information to merge, and at least 90% of it is needed, so you cannot simply remove it. It is extremely useful to thousands of people and is factual. The portal serves as a great portal and a go-between on all the different pages.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>- During the past few months there has been a "crusade" of sorts to delete anything and everything having to do with RuneScape. Several people have put up arguements about this being an encyclopaedia and not a game guide. Well...you're wrong. Have any of you heard of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Computer_and_video_games_662f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games">Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games</a>? There are long articles about skills, locations, affiliations, and such dealing with the RPGs Everquest, World of Warcraft, Dungeons and Dragons, etc. Is Runescape any different? At 10:00 PM the game has about 150000 people playing. There are as just as many players i9n WOW and EQ. Should we delete them, too? Not a strong enough arguement? Well according to your mindset, Wikipedia is also not a guide to comicbooks or theological information either. Now view <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Comics_b2cf.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Religion_dd65.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Religion">Wikipedia:WikiProject Religion</a>. The truth is that numerous Wikipedians have dedicated their precious time resaerch and write "guides" to these subjects asper Wikiproject guidelines. Forgive me, but when someone just waltzes in and requests a deletion of everything in this series (without even giving a clear explanation why!) I consider it a slap in the face to all those dedicated reseacers and scribes out there. These articles are sanctioned by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Computer_and_video_games_662f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games">Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games</a>. If there is a problem with these articles, FIX THEM, DO NOT DELETE THEM FOREVER AND MAKE IT SO THEY CANNOT BE REWRITTEN IN THE FUTURE!!!!-<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerlin_Storm_72ec.html" title="User:Merlin Storm">Merlin Storm</a>
<ul>
<li>While this is one of the first reasons someone has proposed to keep the articles, there seems to be a minor flaw.<br />
Most Notably:<br />
<i>Articles on computer and video games should give an encyclopedia overview of what the game is about, not a detailed description of how to play it.</i><br />
<i>A general rule of thumb to follow if unsure: if the content only has value to people actually playing the game, it's unsuitable.</i><br />
<br />
This is directly from the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Computer_and_video_games_662f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games">Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games</a> page, and is exactly what these articles are violating. --<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorqin_0917.html" title="User:Porqin">Porqin</a> 05:14, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is kind of hard to explain what a game is about without explaining how to play it. However, if you feel that you are capable of doing so, please do it so that these articles need not be deleted. Otherwise, do not insult the writing abilities of other Wikipedians. This is a free encyclopaedia and not everyone has the skill of Hemingway. Also, to further my arguement, I suggest that you examine the deletion vote for construction. You will notice that in the course of a week, another user has used another lame excuse to try to get a large amount of RS articles deleted. We have moved from "I don't think they deserve their own articles" to "I think they have poor writing quality". Heres a tip! If you don't like the writing, and you can edit it, DO IT! I am under the impression that you have some beef against RuneScape,Halo, otherwise you would just fix it, other than destroy it all together.-<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerlin_Storm_72ec.html" title="User:Merlin Storm">Merlin Storm</a></li>
<li>Please give all and any evidence of me ever showing "any beef against RuneScape" in any of my edits. I have absolutely no opinion about RuneScape, having never played it. I really don't have any "beef with RuneScape", but I really do "have a beef" with pointless, overly long articles that don't belong here, hence the AFD. RuneScape is possibly the biggest offender, but yes, it also applies to other games - but this doesn't mean that those articles belong here either (I've also explained why the Everquest articles aren't as bad). I also think rather than making it personal, maybe you should respond tothe points in the AFD? You haven't given a good reasosn why these articles should not be deleted (except possibly Skills, which I can accept could be expanded without overcruft). <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 15:13, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If you have never played RuneScape before, Halo, how do you know that these articles are "fancruffy"? It seems to me that the best person to write an article about a subject is someone knowledgable about the subject (hence "fans"). Which would would you rather read- an article about JFK by a historian or Random Joe? In your logic, a man fom Uganda could get on the computer and argue that the JFK article is only valid to Americans and not to the rest of the world. Which means that someone with no knowledge about the entire subject, can come in and request it to be deleted with some lame excuse thats only half true. How can someone with no knowledge of RuneScape possibly know the value of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Black_Dragon_e61c.html" title="King Black Dragon">King Black Dragon</a>? This is why I am inclined to think you have a beef against RuneScape. You, someone who has "never played it" before waltzes in saying how these entire articles are pointless and of low quality? I don't buy it. How in <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amaterasu.html" title="Amaterasu">her</a> name would you know that these are pointless if you have no knowledge of any thing in the game? I they are "overly long articles" then take advantage of the fact that this is an encyclopaedia that anyone and everyone can edit! But by no means are these articles "pointless". They have just as much point and relevancy as any other game article series. Can we please stop the argueing-<i>this deletion is not valid</i>.-<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerlin_Storm_72ec.html" title="User:Merlin Storm">Merlin Storm</a></li>
<li>An encyclopaedia is supposed to explain something to someone who hasn't played the game or doesn't know about a subject - it's not supposed to tell you everything about every topic ever in existance. I don't know about the subject, therefore I am the INTENDED audience to these articles... you've basically confirmed my point in saying that these articles are only relevent to people who play the game therefore they ARE <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">fancruft</a> which isn't wanted here. Articles that are only relevant to a small amount of enthusiastic fans (people who play RuneScape) don't belong here. Game, set and match. An article about JFK I'd want written so that if I didn't know who he was, I could find out about it, each point explained to me. I would not want an individual page about JFK's toilet habits though, which is what these pages are akin to. These articles are useless to non-RuneScape players. All these reasons have already been explained, and you've explained no reasons why my nomination is "invalid" according to any policies. Long rants are not going to change the fact that you seem to be blinded by some sort of bias towards the game rather than taking it independently, such as I did, and realised these articles did not belong here. Maybe you should go to the Runescape Wiki, where these articles will be actively encouraged? <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 17:03, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Strong Keep All</b> Top 10 reasons to keep: One: Merging is <i>Not</i> an option, all the bigger articles are too long. Two: RuneScape is the 6th or 5th most edited article on wikipedia, meaning all those smaller articles are big-ticket items despite their size. Three: I don't see many other MMO games getting attacked, these AFDs seem to be of a personal dislike, and not for any professional reasons. Four: All comments are researched and factual, per in-game and the runescape knowledge base. Five: RS has a minor impact on real life, as despite RS rules, people sell RS gold, accounts, "cheats" on <a href="http://www.ebay.com" class="external text" title="http://www.ebay.com" rel="nofollow">EBay</a> Six: Another Real Life part is the fact that most likely, 2m people have played at one point in time. Seven: The game has several historical referances in the form of descriptions. One example is items from Monty Pithon stuff. Eight: I still don't see how this qualifies, as it does <b>NOT</b> violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENot_131e.html" title="WP:Not">WP:NOT</a> or any afd policy. Nine: Really no physical need to get rid of articles. Ten: The RuneScape articles attract many new editors who raise the amount of information on wikipedia. <b>If you have a problem with a comment I made, put it</b> <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoorleno_7a6c.html" title="User:Poorleno"><b>Here</b></a> <b>with the subheading of the reason's number, as well as below.</b> Thank you, <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoorleno_7a6c.html" title="User:Poorleno">p00rleno</a> 16:56, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>1. I agree, merging is not an option. Deletion is. There's too many articles, too much information that doesn't belong here that needs to go.</li>
<li>2. The amount of edits do not mean anything.</li>
<li>3. I'm not "attacking" any games. Very few games have almost 30 articles written about the most intricate details, and they don't belong here.</li>
<li>4. Not all comments are researched. Out of all the articles, only 3 or 4 actually have references.</li>
<li>5. I don't understand the relevance of the point. I'm not here arguing RuneScape doesn't deserve a page, I'm arguing it doesn't deserve more than two or three pages at most.</li>
<li>6. The fact 2 million people have played it is fine. That's why <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> itself deserves an article. Not 28 detailing the intrinsical details about everything involved, things that don't stand alone... then it becomes <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">Fancruft</a> and game guides which don't belong here.</li>
<li>7. I don't understand the relevance of the point.</li>
<li>8. Wikipedia is not a Game Guide. "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", there's no references in most of the articles. The articles don't estabilish notability of themselves.</li>
<li>9. I understand Wikipedia is not paper. This DOES NOT mean that Wikipedia is "indiscriminate collection of information"</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> These articles are not original research, as the game itself serves as a valid primary source. Articles on books or movies with few or no references beyond the works themselves are not deleted as "original research" -- a similar standard should be applied here. The massive popularity of this game clearly establishes notability for all of the articles listed. Finally, it hasn't been demonstrated that the deletion of the Runescape articles would improve Wikipedia. A few articles in Wikipedia have been so badly written, so massively biased, or concern such frivolous subjects that their presence is an embarrassment -- for example, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Instant_music_0e25.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Instant music">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Instant music</a>. The Runescape articles, however, clearly don't match this description, and are valuable to readers who want to learn about the details of Runescape. Thus, retaining these articles offers significant advantages, but no significant disadvantages. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 21:14, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Er,... 'Runescape is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG)in which players, shown on the screen as customized avatars, can see and interact with each other. Players can set their own goals and objectives, deciding which of the available activities they wish to pursue. They can increase their experience (train) in any of the available skills from runecrafting to construction, complete quests, develop skills, merchant, or just hang out and chat.'

The articles, while providing extremely detailed descriptions of the minutia of Runescape, do not, in general, seem to provide "advice... suggestions, or... 'how-to's." The overall focus seems to be on providing information about the game, not on explaining how the game is best played. To the extent that some of these articles do provide some amount of instruction, the proper solution would seem to be to remove the offending passages, not to delete a large number of articles that are mostly consistent with Wikipedia policies. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 02:20, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - My comments are accurate. The policy does not use the term "video game guides" in the context of "Wikipedia is not a video game guide". Instead, "video game guides" is used merely as an example to illustrate the general principle that "Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice ( legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain 'how-to's". The context in which the term "video game guides" is used necessarily affects its meaning. If the policy stated that "Wikipedia is not a video game guide", one might justifying in claiming the following:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>(a) These articles treat video games in extensive detail.</dd>
<dd>(b) Articles which treat video games in extensive detail are video game guides.</dd>
<dd>(c) Therefore, by (a) and (b) these articles are video game guides, which are prohibited by policy.</dd>
<dd>However, since the term "video game guides" is used as an example of "instruction manuals", it should be recognized that "video game guides" that are not "instruction manuals" are obviously not being given as examples of "instruction manuals". Therefore, it is reasonable, in this context, to limit the construction of "video game guides", so that the term only describes articles that are, in fact, "instruction manuals". It would follow that if an article is not an "instruction manual", it cannot be a "video game guide." Since "video game guide" is, abstractly, a fairly vague and uncertain term, I have chosen to focus on the policy statement that "Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice ( legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain 'how-to's". I believe that I am correct in my claim that these articles are not largely comprised of "advice... suggestions, or... how-to's". To take "video game guides" out of context, and state that "Wikipedia is not a video game guide" seems to miss the point. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 06:04, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - You completely overanalyzed, and twisted the words to make them read exactly as you want them to. But you seemed to go through some convoluted logic proof, that doesn't accurately take the policy for what it is. It clearly states that "<i>advice ( legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain 'how-to's</i>" are forbidden, and the following are not permitted as being a subset of the aforementioned policy (("<i>This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, <b>video game guides</b>, and recipes.</i>")). This list isn't fully inclusive of every violation of the policy, but the ones listed are <b>definitely</b> in violation of the policy. Also, I think it is fairly well established that these articles do go into great detail. However, giving the level of detail, and the meaninglessness to any non Runescape gamer, that it can be concluded that these articles are indeed in the video game guide category.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Despite the claim that "An encyclopaedia is supposed to explain something to someone who hasn't played the game or doesn't know about a subject - it's not supposed to tell you everything about every topic ever in existance...", Wikipedia actually contains numerous articles about a number of highly specialized subjects that are only useful to readers who have a significant quantity of background knowledge. For instance, consider our article on <a href="../../../m/e/a/Measure_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Measure (mathematics)">Measure (mathematics)</a>. Would this be characterized as "mathcruft" since it is written so as to be incomprehensible to readers without the necessary mathematical background? Is <a href="../../../m/e/a/Measure_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Measure (mathematics)">Measure (mathematics)</a> going to be subjected to repeated AFD filings?

<li><b>Comment</b> Mathematics is a <i>field</i> of knowledge. Fields have many components. The article about measure simply explains what measure is. This is not "mathcruft" because the field of mathematics encompasses several unique encyclopaedic topics. Runescape is not its own field of knoowledge. If you want a mathematics example, think of it this way: <a href="../../../i/m/p/Improper_integral.html" title="Improper integral">improper integrals</a> merit an explanation. A page discussing a specific improper integral, or, say, "Skills and techniques used to solve improper integrals," or something to that degree, would, in my opinion, be "mathcruft." In a similar sense, Runescape merits its own page, but specific aspects of it do not. GassyGuy 17:40, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I waited to even read this AfD and the associated articles because I wanted to see what everyone had to say, but most of the folks voting for keep are either doing so because they don't believe these articles are game guides (which addresses only one of the points raised in the nomination) or are making arguments that demonstrate the notability of RuneScape, but not the articles actually being discussed. Therefore, I have to conclude that, while RuneScape is certainly notable, all of these skills are not and do not belong in a general encyclopaedia, especially when there is a wiki specifically set up for this kind of content. GassyGuy 08:05, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I looked at many high-quality articles, and I noticed they usually have 5-10 short sections which summarize aspects of the article topic, with full articles covering each aspect in greater detail. We don't want the RuneScape article to become too long, do we? The sub-artixles may be a little crufty, but that can be fixed. And WP:NOR is always used as an excuse to delete useful information. Finally, with the amount of vandalism the <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> article receives, I have a slight reason to doubt the good faith of this AFD. --<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHildanknight_74fc.html" title="User:Hildanknight">J.L.W.S.

<li><b>Keep</b> I cant see reason to delete these articles as a group some topics may be better served by being merged into more general subtopics. What I do have an issue with is that this is creating precedent to change Wikipolicy that should be discussed in a wider forum. The deletion of these as a group will justify the deletion of other articles, on topic where they appeal to a small band of editors and readers <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 12:23, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge similar topics into larger, single articles</b> since many of these articles are well written yet small (or contain much non-notable info). It would be a shame to see so many well-built articles which help people who play this game disappear, so merging things like monsters, enemies, and gods into one thing such as characters. Please note that I haven't ever played this game, so someone more familiar with the information would do a better job at streamlining this idea. I know this game is quite popular with the younger demographic on the internet, and I see that a large amount of these keep/delete votes are correlate with age and familiarity with the topic. Well, just because a person does not know of a topic very well, or because it plays to a younger age group, does <i>not</i> mean it is any less important than someting else in the encyclopedia. Things that cater towards older teens and adults such as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate.html" title="Stargate">Stargate</a> (another topic I don't know outside of this encyclopedia) seem to have a large amount of information) as well as information like <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methus.html" title="Methus">this</a> from <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andromeda_%28TV_series%29_2ef3.html" title="Andromeda (TV series)">Andromeda (TV series)</a> usually escape the fancruft pogroms.....which is wonderful! They all should. If wikipedia is the encyclopedia for everyone, built by everyone, why base what is notable canon and non-notable canon off of traditional literary ideals? And to delete a series because of <i>vandalism</i>? Articles can be semi-protected if it is becoming <i>that</i> bad. While deletion of certain unneeded portions of information is in order, it is quite ludicrous to delete thousands of edits off of a few wikiessays and complaints about vandalism. <a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_fe3b.html" title="User:Ikiroid">The ikiroid</a> (<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_4fb8.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid">talk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_Desk_5611.html" title="User:Ikiroid/Desk">desk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_Help_Me_Improve_8caf.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid/Help Me Improve">Advise me</a>) 15:53, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP ALL - VERY STRONGLY STATED - KEEP ALL</b> There are a lot of passionate pleas, accusations, answers, and crap in all that mess above here, but it all comes down to this. If Wikipedia is the encyclopedia that anyone can edit, then the people who edit are going to write about the things that they (1) love or (2) hate. In the case of <i>RuneScape</i>, it is usually written about by those who love it and then vandalized by those who hate it. Some have a marginal ability to write; some are mere children who do their best. To go in and wipe out all that work, all that time, and all that effort would devastate some of those people, to the point that many may never return. How can driving off who knows how many editors, good or bad, be good for this endeavor? Yes, I agree, these articles need a lot of work. I have spent a lot of time editing them myself. I spend part of almost every day cleaning up the messes that people inadvertently or purposefully make of them. I am a lover of the game (and just for the record, I am not a child or a teen - I am an adult woman with children of my own, teens who also play the game), and for that reason, I would like to see the articles remain with the chance to finish the cleaning up, merging, and transwiking that need to be done and that has been being done for several months now. One of my goals in editing these articles has been to decrease the amount of game guide information slowly, so that there is no culture shock as the articles are transformed into the best set of informational articles ever written on this, or any other, game. It isn't easy to keep all "instruction" out of an article about a game, but we are getting there. We just need more time to get it right. I hate to assume bad faith, but it seems that someone or a group of someones, has taken a dislike to the <i>RuneScape</i> articles and set out to destroy them or to distract those of us who edit them away from improving them with this series of AFD's. I say to the admins <b>KEEP</b> all the articles at this time and let us finish the merging that is already planned, and to the deletionists, <b>get a life</b> that doesn't involve the destruction of countless hours of work by many people, especially since these articles aren't hurting you or anyone else and do not violate any Wikipedia policies in any <b>material</b> way. <a href="../../../x/e/l/User%7EXela_Yrag_73eb.html" title="User:Xela Yrag">Xela Yrag</a> 06:33, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This AfD appears as more a dislike of articles that have any association with fancraft. Yet there are larger projects on Wikipedia that being harassed like RuneCraft articles are. He is another wikiproject based on fancraft for comparison.

<p>There is currently a proposal to delete all articles for <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> as they are based on fancraft and therefore inappropriate for Wikipedia. As this extensive project and its articles can also be considered as fancraft I have utilised for comparison only a selection of 4 categories and approxiamately 60 articles from your project to demostrate the scope of what is being proposed.</p>
<p>This discussion is taking place at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_RuneScape_armour_%282nd_nomination%29_e232.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/RuneScape armour (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/RuneScape armour (2nd nomination)</a>.</p>
<p>None of the articles from your project mentioned in this discussion are proposed for deletion, this notice is only to advise interested parties of these article that these pages have been referred to at AfD. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a></p>

<li>Several things to say here. First and foremost: irrelevant. We're not discussing the merits of Star Wars. Second: There has been some Star Wars stuff put to AfD, and more of it has survived than I think should have. However, the argument that the existence of some unencyclopaedic content means we have to allow all unencyclopaedic content is fallacious. However, you are welcome to nominate any Star Wars or other articles which you think merit deletion, and I'm sure you'll get some agreement. I would move that this entire discussion be moved to the talk page of this, as it has no real bearing on the AfD at hand. GassyGuy 05:19, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not irrelevant as the basis for deletion is fancraft articles this is an example of another project substancially larger than RuneScape that would also be a potential AfD target of deletionist based purely on the arguements being presented here. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 05:28, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This isn't a debate about unrelated WikiProjects. If there are other bad articles out there, they, too, should be examined. But thats unrelated to this AFD.

</li>
<li>I would like to note that there is a concerted effort at the Star Wars Wikiproject to de-cruft <i>Star Wars</i>-related articles. The project has recently had three articles promoted to featured status. I would also like to point out that several <i>Star Wars</i>-related articles were recently deleted because of cruft. My suggestion to RuneScape folks is to become intimately familiar with <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Fiction on Wikipedia</a> and especially <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">Writing about Fiction</a>. <a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDmoon1_9743.html" title="User:Dmoon1">Dmoon1</a> 06:38, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong oppose</b> I really don't think it's right to lump all the articles together like this. Giving examples from a select bad few does not justify deleting the whole lot. These articles vary in quality enormously. Some are bad, but some are very good. I've supported deleting individual fancrufy articles in the past, but can't support an overly sweeping move like this, as some of the articles in this set are fine. Taking the example of the "Kalphite Queen page" which isn't even the easiest to defend, and addressing each of your points in turn:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Have no relevance outside the game whatsoever". If you wanted to find out about roughly what RuneScape is about then info about some of the major original characters (which can be understood without having played the game) is surely relevant. You don't have to be a RuneScape player to be interested in how different games structure their economy, story line, or characters. If you're not interested then how did you even get to the page?</dd>
<dd>"Completely unresearched. There's no references in any of the articles". Just because there's no references doesn't mean it's unresearched! If you want references add some, it's not a reason to delete the article. Ironically some people in this same AFD are arguing the articles should be deleted because all the info can be found elsewhere anyway. This is the easiest to defend because these articles are really really blantantly not original research, they just need more references.</dd>
<dd>"These are /most definitely/ game guides". No they aren't - using the "Kalphite Queen" example again. The page in question tells you what the kalphite queen is, why it's notable, but DOESNT give any tactics on how to kill it at all! If it were a game guide it would surely be focussed on the best way to defeat it, not the environment in which it resides.</dd>
<dd>"A quote from RuneScape dungeons:". Quoting a bad section from an individual article does not justify deleting all 28. It proves nothing with respect to your sweeping AFD.</dd>
<dd>"Look at the articles themselves". Good idea - why don't you?</dd>
<dd>"They don't attempt to establish notability". Another sweeping remark with no basis in fact. Yet again using the RuneScape monsters examples, only the 6 strongest monsters in the game have a page. The article clearly establishes that those are the most notable on the basis of being the 6 most powerful and hence the 6 most iconic, and relevant to non players. If a RuneScape film or book were made they would surely be the most likely to feature. If pages were made for every monster in the game ala pokemen then I'd agree, we wouldn't want a "runescape chicken" page, but this section at least clearly establishes which facts are most notable, only writes about those, and does so in an encylopedic style rather than a gameguide style.</dd>
<dd>And IMO that's not even using the best examples, pages like RuneScape skills, and RuneScape economy are even easier to defend. It seems to me like you are trying to get rid of articles which have previously been voted keep in AFD, by lumping them together with some less good articles. Hence I feel this nomination is invaild.</dd>

<li>This is about all fan based articles to select one group then continually AfD their articles with the reasoning its fan craft is creation of new wikipolicy and that once the precedent is set all other article will AfD for exactly the same reason. To hide behind erroronous statements of unknown copyright violations is mallicious and unfounded. What is being discussed here is where fan/web sourced articles are part of this community encyclopedia and all affect article needs to assessed not just one small group. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 06:52, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>First off, the talk about WikiProject as a whole is not what this discussion is about, and this is taking up a ridiculous amount of space on this page. I still say this belongs on a talk page. However, consider this: Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia. True, it's not paper, but it's still not an indiscriminate collection of information. So, consider notability. Is <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> notable? I would say yes. I imagine most would say yes. That's probably why <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> has not been nominated. The rest of these, however, have no real general interest notability. If a person is looking for information about Runescape in a general encyclopaedia, they should find an article about what the game is. All of this other stuff is outside the realm of this resource and much better suited for the Runescape wiki. I am not saying that one or two subpages are not viable, but, for the most part, these topics do not merit coverage. As for all the rest of this stuff about the philosophy of wikiprojects, the merits of requesting deletion, etc., this really isn't the proper forum. GassyGuy 06:58, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with GassyGuy that this isnt the proper forum to delete a complete project and all its articles(except one), but this is where the subject was raised. That the reason being given for the deletion equally applies to all similar projects and that the scope of whats being decided and the affects of this decision must be part of the consideration. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 07:12, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

While I am not the biuggest fan of hip-hop, Public Enemy, Tone Loc and K.R.S One all got their start at Fresh. Jive Records started out as a hip-hop label as well (they just blew up instead). I have no idea who Play Dead is (was or whatever), but Fresh was ALL about hip-hop. They were based in New York City. But I guess thats the problem. Since they were around before the Internet, there isn't a lot of information left about them. I found a link to an album review [<a href="http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/BTTL_strictbiz.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/BTTL_strictbiz.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] and also a search in Amazon (under Popular Music) for Fresh Records will find a whos who of East Coast '80s rap, before N.W.A desecrated it with that gangsta shit. Oh well, off my soapbox I go <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares33712_1845.html" title="User:Antares33712">Antares33712</a> 14:47, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares33712_1845.html" title="User:Antares33712">Antares33712</a>, please add that information to the article! If what you say is true (that Public Enemy, Tone Loc, KRS One got their start at Fresh), then this is certainly notable. Yes, it's sad that it's not recognised but reading the article as it stands (small record label, now defunct) I would come to the same opinion. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 16:17, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b>. Personally, I am more swayed by the delete opinions than the keeps; there are many award categories out there for schools to win, and the little notability it has would be better served in the school district article. However, by a simple count, the delete and keep counts are almost the same, and there are some valid points on the keep side. Having watched the "school debate", I feel that schools may be at the front line of incrementalist reform on Wikipedia... If said articles can be well-maintained and verifiable, I say, go for it. (That is a very big if, though.) This should be revisited in the future as the status of the school changes (which it probably will.) <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="red">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="green">ka</font></a> 03:28, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. First of all, there is <b>absolutely no policy</b> that says that schools are inherently notable.

Anyway, this would fall short of the "around 100" requirement and is not sufficently encyclopedically notable if it was 100. (PORN BIO is a proposed guideline not an established one).

<li><b>Comment/Question</b> Can anyone come up with verification that this porn star has done around 100 movies or even 90 movies.

<li><b>Question</b> - Where do you see any of these sub-culture publications/reviews? I'd like to see some reliable sources used in the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - in my grumpier moments (like, now) i look at articles like this and almost conclude the writer <i>wanted</i> to get the article deleted. It's written in such a fashion as to obscure what facts there are, much less provide citations and sources for those facts. I started with the same questions of this being a hoax or not. The group does exist, but you have to search through the <a href="http://scs.student.virginia.edu/~bhoos/home_flash.php" class="external text" title="http://scs.student.virginia.edu/~bhoos/home_flash.php" rel="nofollow">University of Virginia's</a> website to find it, and apparently the 12 albums <a href="http://scs.student.virginia.edu/~bhoos/music.php" class="external text" title="http://scs.student.virginia.edu/~bhoos/music.php" rel="nofollow">exist</a> but were produced privately, and they aren't for sale on Amazon (wow, what a concept). This isn't helped by the fact the CARA website didn't make it easy for me to finally find <a href="http://www.casa.org/index.php?option=com_casaawards&amp;Itemid=155" class="external text" title="http://www.casa.org/index.php?option=com_casaawards&amp;Itemid=155" rel="nofollow">award-winners from 2005</a>, but I eventually verified that bit. I take away three lessons here: One, editors should be aware that Google and Amazon are not the final arbiters of notability, which should be judged in context of all notability requirements; Two, writers should at least read an encyclopedia before trying to write one, and; three, I'm far too grumpy to care if this article sinks or swims, and shall therefore not vote at all. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 18:54, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Seriously, every university has an a capella group that goes around singing <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Nylons_5fb2.html" title="The Nylons">The Nylons</a> tunes and whatnot. They are always popular because they are crooners. They usually record and sell albums (which is something that anyone can do, having a publishing/distributing deal is the real business), and they are usually hired to sing all over the place. But, why is that notable? They don't usually write their own songs, even - their albums are all cover tunes. --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 03:47, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Most of the problems with lists don't apply here. Many lists are POV, or inherently not complete or comprehensive. Doesn't apply here. I don't know why half a dozen of the volumes are missing, but that seems easily remediable. I don't see a problem with keeping these lists, even if the process of blueing the links is only 10% done in ten years. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 02:59, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The more I think about it, the more it seems to me that this project is, in fact, encylopedic in a very real sense, and these may be quite useful, even if only one or two notable cases in each volume ever get blue-linked. Looks like these are a framework. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 02:44, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the volume number is the reporter volume reference number; since the actual lists are obviously products of public institutions I'm not sure why there is a copyvio inference. The list would appear to be a working list that is actively being worked to fill; I'm sure many of the entries are more than notable. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuru_b024.html" title="User:Kuru"><font color="#CD853F"><b>Kuru</b></font></a> <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKuru_f68a.html" title="User talk:Kuru"><font color="#F5DEB3"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 02:53, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. There is no copyright violation here and the content is encyclopedic. The volume refers to the <b>public domain</b>, U.S.-government published <i><a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Reports_afaa.html" title="United States Reports">United States Reports</a></i>, the official <a href="../../../c/a/s/Case_reporter.html" title="Case reporter">case reporter</a> of the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_b835.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court of the United States</a>. Far from "indiscriminate," listing the cases decided by the highest court in the United States is clearly an encyclopedic venture, and organizing them by the manner in which they were published is one of many sensible ways to do this. I've already used these lists as an aid in writing articles. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_U.S._Supreme_Court_cases_43a5.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject U.S. Supreme Court cases">Wikipedia:WikiProject U.S. Supreme Court cases</a> is organized and active to address how to better improve and maintain these lists, including changing the titles. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 03:13, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Postdlf. There is no copyvio as this is a work of the US government and is thus not covered by copyright (the Court has several of the newer volumes, though not this particular volume, freely accessible on their website, for goodness sake). Given that the reporters, indicated by the volume numbers, are essentially chronologically ordered, this is basically a "portion of a chronological list of SCOTUS cases." Far from an indiscriminate collection of information. · <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">j·e·r·s·y·k·o</font></a> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 03:51, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: No. When I nominated it, I was not aware that there were 50-80 articles more just like it (which should be deleted also). Why there needs to be a list of Supreme Sourt cases is beyond my scope. They should be turned into a category at best. The entire article is filled with <i>no information</i> other than a list of court cases which 1, arent even notable, and 2, arent even articles. I fail to see how this is encyclopedic, or how it helps Wikipedia. I wont be withdrawing my nom. Plus, I never said it was a copyvio, but that it might be. It reads like it was copied directly from a source. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">SynergeticMaggot</a> 04:22, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I've never liked these lists full of redlinks when we already have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases_1987.html" title="List of United States Supreme Court cases">these lists</a> full of bluelinks, but I'm persuaded by Postdlf's arguments about use as a research tool and for identifying repeated case names. The relevant wikiproject's coverage of cases heavily trends toward recent cases; if there were a list like this for volume 541 (from two years ago), it'd be full of bluelinks. Eventually we may extend our coverage to cover important older cases, but we haven't yet. I also think the nominator is misapplying WP:NOT. It says "While there is a continuing debate about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries, current consensus is that Wikipedia articles are not:" and then goes on to list eleven specifics. Claiming an article that isn't one of those eleven specifics is an indiscriminate collection of information does not make it so.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 04:36, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not misapplying it. I didnt point to a statement in the header "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", I quoted the statement and pointed to the policy page. Because this is a clear statement none the less. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">SynergeticMaggot</a> 04:45, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's a clear statement, but the policy specifically applies in eleven limited areas. This article is none of those eleven. Which specific section of WP:NOT are you asserting this is in violation of?--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 04:50, 19 July 2006 (UTC) I think the confusion is that I was quoting from the preamble for the header you mentioned.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Personally, I think this is terrific, and it seems to me the easier thing to do is to make the list first and then work on the individual cases. Not everyone who wants this kind of information can afford <a href="../../../l/e/x/LexisNexis_2d15.html" title="LexisNexis">LexisNexis</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westlaw.html" title="Westlaw">Westlaw</a>. While WP obviously can't compete with those services (and shouldn't), this information is useful to those who need it. If a list of SCOTUS cases isn't encyclopedic, neither are the lists for the anime characters, or the professional wrestlers, or the video games, or movies that start with the letter 'B', and on and on. It can't be written overnight, either. There are some editors who can thoughtfully analyze these cases and many more who can't, but at least it's a start. Just my two cents. - <font color="darkblue"><b>Baseball,Baby!</b></font> <font color="red"><sup><i>balls</i></sup></font><font color="darkblue"><sup>•</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BaseballBaby_1aec.html" title="Special:Contributions/BaseballBaby"><font color="red"><sup><i>strikes</i></sup></font></a> 04:59, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a multiple nomination for a bunch of furry webcomic characters from the Webcomic <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newshounds.html" title="Newshounds">Newshounds</a>. The articles nominated are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alistair Katt</li>
<li>Ferris the Rat</li>
<li>Kevin J. Dog</li>
<li>Lorna Dilbrook</li>
<li>Renata Fayre</li>
<li>Rochelle O'Shea</li>
<li>Sam Shepherd (Newshounds)</li>
<li>Wolfram Blitzen</li>
</ul>
<p>Newshounds is a long running webcomic hosted on <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a>. I am not discussing its notability or encyclopedic value at this point, but that of their characters. Whereas I'm sure factual nuggets such as how Kevin J Dog met his bitch at a Rowan Atkinson autograph session, I absolutely fail to see how it is encyclopedic. How many professional sources have written about the characters of Newgrounds? What kind of influences have they had over other works? I'm sure actual journalists working in the real world have written extensively about <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asterix.html" title="Asterix">Asterix</a>, and the nature of <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobbes_%28Calvin_and_Hobbes%29_991b.html" title="Hobbes (Calvin and Hobbes)">Hobbes (Calvin and Hobbes)</a>. What they haven't done is comment on how Wolfram Blitzen was worried about not having a shoetree for his shoes. This is a textbook example of fancruft, appeals to only those entrenched in the series already. I am NOT proposing a merge, as I believe that <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newshounds.html#Characters" title="Newshounds">Newshounds#Characters</a> covers the characters in suitable depth already. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 01:32, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Reply</b> As <i>Newshounds</i> is one of the longest running webcomics, their characters are some of the most in depth. Thus, I believe that there is enough information about them to justify their own articles. It also makes it easier to extract information from each character rather than searching through the main entry. <a href="../../../i/s/d/User%7EISD_262f.html" title="User:ISD">ISD</a> 08:21, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is exactly how most articles branded "gamecruft" are being deleted; by people who aren't even looking at articles. (<s>but <b>delete</b> anyway</s>) I'm switching over to <b>Keep</b>ing per Ace. Considering how many obscure stub article games exsist on this site, we might as well keep this one. Espeically since it's beyond stub status (and more could be written about it).

This year the tournament has corporate sponsership from toyota and is giving away over 80,000 dollars in prizes.

I think I was being overly <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilawyering_a5b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilawyering">wikilawyerish</a> in accepting the subject's notability due to an arguable meeting of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria. I accept GassyGus's view of the situation (expressed below)--a kid did something bad and was caught. The MySpace tie-in is incidental and isn't incredibly significant. To bring up my analogy below, if he had used Geocities instead, would he still be notable? Does the fact that he used MySpace automatically confer notability?

<li>I was thinking about that earlier...my view is that the Legal section of the <a href="../../../m/y/s/Myspace.html" title="Myspace">Myspace</a> article primarily focuses on issues where MySpace is one of the major parties involved in a legal dispute. In this case, though, MySpace was merely a conduit for this kid's actions, and was never really held liable that I can see.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Unfortunately, being an AIDS victim is all too common to make one notable. However, the Herbie films are notable, and <i>The Thorn Birds</i> is very notable.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I don't see how his cause of death from AIDS is anymore relevant then if he was a man who died from Breast Cancer---of which there are thousands.

Was prod'ed, but tag removed with the comment <i>Uncivil remarks are uncalled for on edit comments, admin notified</i> -- apparently "middle management" is a dirty word to that particular editor. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:33, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Teamwork is a large part of City of Heroes. Players can form supergroups (similar to other MMORPGs' guilds) reminiscent of classic comic book groups such as the X-Men or Justice League of America. Supergroups pick a name, a motto, an emblem and two colors. Heroes can then enter 'Supergroup Mode' and change the colors and emblem of their normal avatar to those of their supergroup. Players can also form teams with other players to go on missions and fight villains together.</td>

<p>Was speedied twice for having no claims to notability; the most recent post has what could amount to a claim (that the group's songs were featured on a TV show); I don't feel that's quite enough to satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.

<li><b>Leave As Is</b> check allmusic.com for past band name Epoxy Ruin - they are in fact a notable band with history. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Theshape (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Theshape_9c1b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Theshape">contribs</a>).</small> <small>User's only edit</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article should've stated that <i>Epoxy Ruin</i> was the former name of the band (the article only mentions an album by that name). Using that info, the only press mention I could find was <a href="http://www.nsnews.com/issues04/w103104/111104/artent/104304tw7.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nsnews.com/issues04/w103104/111104/artent/104304tw7.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> from a local independent magazine. The allmusic entry helps (although it is a minimal entry), but I can't find any verification that the band in any incarnation is well-known outside of Victoria. <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Dahle_700f.html" title="Kurt Dahle">Kurt Dahle</a>, who the article says is the current drummer, is notable, but I get zero Google hits when I search for "Kurt Dahle" + "The Philharmonic". <b><a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie">OhNo<font color="#D47C14">itsJamie</font></a> <a href="../../../o/h/n/User_talk%7EOhnoitsjamie_2359.html" title="User talk:Ohnoitsjamie"><sup>Talk</sup></a></b> 23:55, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Save all</b>.</s> First of all, good work for whoever added this as an AfD, you did it incorrectly. It was previously nominated for deletion, and obviously it was kept. Because you repeated the process instead of making it a 2nd article for deletion, that record is now gone. To address individual points... First, you can't delete something for being "Fancruft". <a href="../../../f/a/n/WP%7EFancruft_4a77.html" title="WP:Fancruft">WP:Fancruft</a> is an opinion essay, not a guideline or policy, and the sources it cites such as <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EImportance_ffbd.html" title="WP:Importance">WP:Importance</a> are frequently only <i>proposed</i> thus not universally agreed upon. If you want to delete the articles for being Fancruft, first you have to get Fancruft established as a reason for deletion; until then, your argument is without merit. As far as the "Original research, no references, and highly unencyclopedic." accusition goes, they're false. There is no original research; stats and background histoy of the units can be found in technical game manuals, the games themselves, or else online. While it is true that about half of the pages in question do not have external sources listed, you should keep in mind that these articles are currently undergoing overhauls by <a href="../../../a/w/e/User%7EAwesome_Username_1f96.html" title="User:Awesome Username">Awesome Username</a> and myself, being worked on daily to improve quality and add sources. As far as being "highly unencyclopedic" I'd like to point out that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a>. "This means that there is no practical limit to the number of topics we can cover other than verifiability and the other points presented on this page." The information being presenting in these articles can be verified, and the articles don't violate any of the other <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENot_9dd0.html" title="Wikipedia:Not">Wikipedia:Not</a> guidelines. No, we're not providing How-To's so don't wave that around either. Back to nomintating this for deletion, you have utterly no basis for it. The category with criteria for deleting it would most likely include: Is not suitable for Wikipedia (already addressed, doesn't violate anything); Original research, including the coining of neologisms (no original research is presented); Vanity page (obviously not applicable); Advertising or other spam (not applicable either); and Completely idiosyncratic non-topic (N/A as well). If the quality, sources, and sizes of the articles are problems, then put in the appropriate templates to bring attention to them so they may be addressed (although chances are I will fix up all the articles eventually anyway). If you don't think that the articles themselves are information worthy of being on Wikipedia, I'd ask what the defining line between permissible and non-permissible is; I for one have spent hours at a time reading about the various weapons, vehicles, characters, etc in works of fiction such as games and movies, and I find it hard to believe that nobody else does. I will point out that for "minor characters" in works of fiction the general guideline seems to be to combine them into one article called "List of minor characters in ____" but this wouldn't work so well for Homeworld stuff: First of all, the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Ships_of_Homeworld_dcdd.html" title="Ships of Homeworld">Ships of Homeworld</a> article (equivalent to a list of minor characters) is already quite long, if every article were to be a length such as <a href="../../../k/u/s/Kushan_Scout_8f7c.html" title="Kushan Scout">Kushan Scout</a>, <a href="../../../k/u/s/Kushan_Mothership_af6a.html" title="Kushan Mothership">Kushan Mothership</a>, and <a href="../../../k/h/a/Kharakid_Scaffold_1e1d.html" title="Kharakid Scaffold">Kharakid Scaffold</a> then as you can imagine the page would become quite large, certainly more than the &lt; 30 KB target size. Although I suppose that's really not an issue, as you didn't propose merging, and you want to delete the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Ships_of_Homeworld_dcdd.html" title="Ships of Homeworld">Ships of Homeworld</a> page entirely. Really, I don't know what you're trying to accomplish or what point you're trying to make. There are articles entirely dedicated listing the names of TV show episodes, for example, and I actually do use those regularly. Lists can be quite useful. "Non-notable minor characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be merged with short descriptions into a 'List of characters.' This list should reside in the article relating to the work itself, unless either becomes long, in which case a separate article for the list is good practice. The list(s) should contain all characters, races, places, etc. from the work of fiction, with links to those that have their own articles." So you see, we actually are following Wikipedia guidelines here... for more reasons why keeping "cruft" articles can be useful, I point you to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Individual_Counter-Strike_maps_3142.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Individual Counter-Strike maps">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Individual Counter-Strike maps</a>. --<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwile_6fe4.html" title="User:Twile">Twile</a> 17:05, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't see how these articles are not relevant to the game. The articles subjects are objects found in Homeworld games. Furthermore, the articles were created to serve the player of Homeworld computer games. IMO, the articles are very game guide-ish. <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 17:59, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>These articles are absolutely not game guides. If they were, we would've included sections like "Tips for usage" and such. The only such information provided is in the Roles section of the template, which more or less says what the ship is used for (Anti-fighter defense, for instance). Take a look at <a href="../../../k/u/s/Kushan_Heavy_Corvette_d3ac.html" title="Kushan Heavy Corvette">Kushan Heavy Corvette</a> to see what I mean. Eventually all the articles will be akin to that, providing a brief historical background, technical details, etc. The articles were <b>not</b> "created to serve the player of Homeworld computer games" as you put it; the Game of the Year Edition of Homeworld (which has been retailing for 5-6 years, thus the only one that someone might realistically come across) comes with a strategy guide telling how to use everything. A player would be better suited reading the provided material for "how to" and "game guide" content. Let me put it this way: If there's an article on cheese, does it mean you should nominate it for deletion because it's a recipie? No. Even if it talks about how cheese is used in cooking, unless it provides recipies that are aimed at instructing how to specifically use cheese, it's not a "how to" article on cheese. --<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwile_6fe4.html" title="User:Twile">Twile</a> 18:19, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi again! Per your further explanation of the nature of the articles natures, I've revised my deletion reasoning a bit.

The articles are on minor objects in a computer game, which are hardly notable enough to warrant articles in an encyclopedia.

For the smaller ship articles, mainly things that aren't Mothership-class, I can see how the conclusion reached for one would be the same for all of them, and I'd rather not have to defend every one of them constantly. However, for things like the Kushan Mothership and Somtaaw Explorer, those are some of THE big ships in the game, the equivalent of Major Characters in a work of Fiction. Those do get their own Wikipedia article regardless of whether you think a minor character should or not. Funny that the large ones were the ones initially nominated for deletion. --<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwile_6fe4.html" title="User:Twile">Twile</a> 20:50, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

And even if they were, the nom ha seen fit to submit that page for deletion as well, which flies in the face of every other "listing of minor characters" page. Maybe they should be merged together into sections- a page for fighters, a page for corvettes, etc. But the impression that I'm getting is that most of the people here are not looking at the articles, they're just reading the opinions of others written here and voting "delete per nom" or per above.

<li><b>Transwiki</b>. I'm revising my stance. Everything up until now, to me, seemed to indicate that such a thing as these articles were entirely permissible on Wikipedia; however, the in-universe stuff is something I can't contest. While it would be nice for Wikipedia to be a one-stop shop for all your information needs, if the relevance of that information in regards to the here and now must be stated, there really isn't much for the majority of the Homeworld series ships. Here's what I propose: Leave the articles alone. Every one of them. Especially significant ships, such as the Flagships of the various races, and the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Ships_of_Homeworld_dcdd.html" title="Ships of Homeworld">Ships of Homeworld</a> article, will be left more or less as they are now. I will oversee the transfer of information from Wikipedia to the Encyclopedia Hiigara wiki, and change all Homeworld-ship-related Wiki links to point to the new pages there instead. Likewise, on the Ships of Homeworld page, the links will be changed to point to the new pages on the alternate Wiki. Current articles, such as <a href="../../../k/u/s/Kushan_Scout_8f7c.html" title="Kushan Scout">Kushan Scout</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somtaaw_Recon_d2c6.html" title="Somtaaw Recon">Somtaaw Recon</a>, which cannot be meaningfully be changed to reflect an outside-universe opinion, will become redirects to the Ships of Homeworld page. This way, the information that I and others have poured over for hours will not be lost, and will find a place where people won't complain about its relevance. How's that sound to people? --<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwile_6fe4.html" title="User:Twile">Twile</a> 23:44, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - The problem is that, upon further inspection, many of the articles in question do not fit with Wikipedia's Writing About Fiction policies. They would have to be kept if they had information told from an "outsider" perspective, such as commenting on how a certain ship design was inspired by a particular real life aircraft, or how the <a href="../../../k/u/s/Kushan_Mothership_af6a.html" title="Kushan Mothership">Kushan Mothership</a> appears on the game box of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeworld.html" title="Homeworld">Homeworld</a>, or things along those lines. Wikipedia doesn't let you write about Fiction from an inside perspective (talking about the article from the perspective of being inside the series) or from an outside perspective if you're giving advice, such as recipies or game guides or FAQs. I do think Wikipedia has made an error with this policy, because although it's good to have an outside perspective for some things, if you require that you limit the sorts of articles you can have, and the intelligent, useful linking. For example, while most of the information about the <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryo_Trays_0b9b.html" title="Cryo Trays">Cryo Trays</a> is in-game and shouldn't be there according to present guidelines, if you were reading about <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryogenics.html" title="Cryogenics">Cryogenics</a> and wanted to see some examples of where it was in fiction, it might be interesting or useful to see how multiple places implemented it. If the article were limited to "This is a large orbital tray holding cryogenically frozen people" it would be of utterly no use, whereas the "gamecruft" material that people seem to hate so ferverently might be useful to the individual interested in Cryogenics. --<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwile_6fe4.html" title="User:Twile">Twile</a> 16:28, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and/or condense</b>. Deleting all these articles at once seems like an overtly hostile gesture. Furthermore, it establishes a dangerous precedent. If we were to delete all in-depth articles from video games, that would require us to delete most of the articles in <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_2_3a2a.html" title="Half-Life 2">Half-Life 2</a>'s entry, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Elder_Scrolls_f72c.html" title="The Elder Scrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a>' entry, and so forth. Really, that seems a bit overstepping, don't you think? 72.234.85.122's comments above more or less get at this. However, taking Wikipedia's Writing About Fiction policy into account (I disagree with its current iteration, but we'll save that for another time), these articles could use some condensing, or perhaps being merged into one of those "big list" articles on a faction basis. More importantly, that bit about 'Outsider perspective' or what have you should be satisfied. Simply deleting them because they don't quite fit a specific policy, especially when said articles are well-written, quite useful, and wholly salvageable, strikes me as being thick-headed, and Wikipedia cannot abide thick-headedness.24.161.191.234 19:08, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I assure you I have nothing personal against Homeworld. If you have read my nomination along with my comments on other game-related AFDs, you will see that I am simply trying to implement Wikipedia's policies of verifiability and no original research as well as keeping Wikipedia a source of encyclopedic content. I would ask you to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. I want what is best for Wikipedia as I am sure you do as well.

<li>I thought we'd gone over this before. There is NO original research, the information can be obtained from reading manuals or playing the game. If that's original research, then so is reading <i>anything</i> or watching, say, a movie. Furthermore the information is verifiable, as it's not original. Yes, it's not all cited, but it can and will be cited eventually, and might I point out that a great number of Wikipedia articles lack citations and those aren't instantly AfD. Thus your only point is what's "Encyclopedic" which is a highly debatable point. I'm willing to admit that many of these articles do not conform to the Writing About Fiction guideline (which I again feel is highly flawed, "Luke, I <i>am</i> your father" is an important bit of information that can't be conveyed easily or at all from an outside-universe perspective), however, I won't stand by while you restate incorrect grounds for deletion. Don't tell people to assume good faith either; it's not exactly good faith to nominate articles for deletion because they have fixable shortcomings. Tag them for improvement, citations, etc instead of automatically trying to get them deleted by the hundreds. If you don't try to see them improved first, it looks like you're aggressively deleting them for the sake of deleting them, not because of what they actually are or may become. Factoring in your past attitudes towards game "cruft" related articles, it doesn't look like <i>you're</i> assuming good faith, and that you just have a vendetta against such articles. Since you <a href="../../../t/w/i/User_talk%7ETwile_5d9e.html#Impressed" title="User talk:Twile">hold me in high regards</a> why not humor me and consider revising <i>your</i> ideas based on the input of others? --<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwile_6fe4.html" title="User:Twile">Twile</a> 14:39, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Although this is an interesting feat, he appears to have no historical connection to the professional game.

It might be something worth including in the <a href="../../../n/h/l/NHL_records_4905.html" title="NHL records">NHL records</a> article under a heading like "Most points, one game," though that article is currently a listing of career records, rather than game/season ones. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoogie2K_5a8e.html" title="User:Doogie2K">Doogie2K</a> <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoogie2K_8e79.html" title="User talk:Doogie2K">(talk)</a> 17:05, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Its nice but you got to draw the line somewhere. What's stopping me from creating articles like <b>Most assists by Left wingers while shorthanded</b>. Like Doogie2k said, a single game record section in an overall <b>NHL records</b> article might be a better solution. That section should only list the actual record instead of a top 10 list. <a href="../../../c/c/w/User%7ECcwaters_bc8b.html" title="User:Ccwaters">ccwaters</a> 22:39, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> There are tonnes of useless lists on wikipedia. I would like to see all the lists of people that belong to certain religous groups (such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Jews_93a3.html" title="Lists of Jews">Lists of Jews</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Roman_Catholics_4800.html" title="Lists of Roman Catholics">Lists of Roman Catholics</a> and the like) all turned into categories and i would like to see lists of people from countries (such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Canadians_f329.html" title="List of Canadians">List of Canadians</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Americans_f877.html" title="Lists of Americans">Lists of Americans</a>, and the like) turned into cats as well. I mean, what value do those lists have when a category will do the same or better job? The list here in question does not stand alone very well (in my opinion) but could be turned into a category. The information contained in the list is worthy of note. I suggest merging this info into another article and/or turning it into a category. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 02:58, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>V.

The bulk of the edits made to the above 5 articles have been from either <span class="plainlinks">Stefan1 (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStefan1_54e9.html" title="User talk:Stefan1">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stefan1_4b11.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stefan1">contribs</a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">page moves</font></a> • <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Stefan1_0d9c.html" title="Special:Blockip/Stefan1">block user</a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">block log</font></a>)</span> or anonymous accounts from the IP range of 66.81.0.0/16 whose edits almost never stray from the above 5 articles. This strongly points to Stefan alone writing his own articles on Wikipedia which has led to the article resembling a resume rather than a biography with blatant embellishments such as <i>He is revered among his colleagues as "the master of the multiverse."</i> <b>Fails:</b> <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_guidelines_9511.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines">Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Further doubts as to his notability as a physicist are raised when attempting to review the references cited in the article.

<p>Amazon does list 44 books for the author V.Stefan (though all of them are published by Stefan University Press). Stefan's novel Doctor Faustef is listed, but is currently unavailable on Amazon and no sales numbers are listed which raises the question of whether the novel is notable enough to have an article written about it on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>All five articles have massive conflict-of-interest problems since they all seem to be self-writen with the purpose of raising the profile of Stefan and his business interests of selling self-published books via his self-run online "educational institute" Stefan University. <b>Fails:</b> <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:Spam</a> -- <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><i><b><span style="background-color: #003333; color:White">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></i></a><b><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</span></a></b></span> 20:16, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b>, if hoaxes can be speedied. I'm pretty damn sure it's a hoax: the URL for the website is "masavolvo", which makes me think it's South African: "ma se ..." (pronounced "mah sa", meaning "your mother's...") is a common preface to an insult here, and I can only assume "volvo" refers to vulva. Which means someone is no doubt being funny (and I love the humour), but it is not really debatable whether it should be in an encyclopaedia as a real organisation or not. Get rid of it. If it becomes a renowned and appreciated hoax, maybe it can come back in an article about hoaxes. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 10:40, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> I do not feel that your evidence to support a deletion of this page is valid, therefore, a deletion would conflict with the rules and guidelines of the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a>. I suggest that you further review your accusations before making such rash decisions. This "masavolvo" to which you refer can simply be explained by the fact that it is MASA and Volvo. Two separate entities. MASA refers to the name of the organization while Volvo refers to the claimed sponsor. Byrgenwulf, you seem to be using your own opinion as opposed to true evidence to have this page considered for deletion. I can also assure you, Dhartung, that this page has never been entered into any blogs as a discussion prior to this. Also, the information on this article has much to do with the claims and stories from the website. It is sourced, and therefore none of you have any real grounds to propose deletion to this page. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendand_3736.html" title="User:Brendand">Brendand</a> 8:58, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nice try. It's "sourced" from a Geocities webpage. Which mentions nothing about Volvo (I clicked on all the links, listened to the sing-a-long, and had a good laugh). Maybe masavolvo is over-interpretation on my part (if not, I do find it funny), but what does this lot need money for? What projects have they undertaken? <i>Why, if Volvo is giving them money, can't they even afford a couple of bucks a month for proper webhosting</i>. I love the joke, I really do, but a free webhosting page which reads like a joke is not a verifiable source. Anyway, guidelines to deletion for vanity require third party sources; this page mentions none. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 13:05, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>DO NOT DELETE Scorpiondollprincess, it cannot be assumed that the site is not a reliable source based solely on assumption. That has to do with the author. What is this about media coverage? What you say is completely opinionated and should not be treated as a factor to the deletion of the page. There are plenty of pages on Wikipedia with a link to a single page. And as for these "google hits". There is only one hit, and it does not even go anywhere. So why should that even be considered? I will answer that.

<dd>Brendand, I shall preface this by saying that field theory in mathematics is not an area in which I am an expert. However, is there a reason you changed "the central concept" to "the hellocentral concept" ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Field_theory_%28mathematics%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64471465" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Field_theory_%28mathematics%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64471465" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> )? Is "hellocentral" a particular term in this field of enquiry, that I don't know about? I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of changing it back to normal English. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 15:58, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - the point is that the article needs to be referenced. I've gotten 3,500,000 hits on Google for an article name that was eventually deleted because all those hits in the end were referring to other things.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think "head of the theatrical department" for TV Kultura is a very remarkable claim of notability. Theatre is a very big deal in Russia and it's pretty much the reason for TV Kultura's existance.

<p>I am nominating all the articles in the "Category:Robot Wars competitors". They are all about individual contestant robots in Robot Wars (all, I think, are from the UK series), an undoubtedly notable TV programme. My contention, though, is that the robots themselves are no more notable than competitors in other game shows; ie unless they achieved significant fame outside of the framework of the show (eg <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Jennings_ed15.html" title="Ken Jennings">Ken Jennings</a>), they are not in themselves notable. None of them, as far as I know, is known to the average "man on the street", who had not watched the show; this is one acid test of their notability. I am sorry there are so many of them; if they are all deleted, obviously, I will nominate the category for deletion too. Most of the articles have not been touched for months; <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypno-Disc_4ee5.html" title="Hypno-Disc">Hypno-Disc</a>, one of the more complete articles, was last seriously edited in April and May. Most if not all have {{stub}}, {{wikify}}, {{verify}} and other such tags on them, again, many for many months. I can see a possibility of creating a Winners of Robot Wars UK article, with some content merged from the winners articles, but apart from that, I am not sure what a merge would achieve. Accordingly, I regretably (people have put a lot of effort into these articles, which, if I get my way, will in a sense have gone to waste) have to urge people to vote delete.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure that the slippery slope leads to the Robot Wars article itself. A TV program is notable and verifiable by more than just it's existence and people watching it. The component parts of a program may or may not be notable, in this case I and some other editors do not think they are notable enough for their own article but they might be notable enough to have a collated article. However, the slippery slope could easily lead to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Francis_%28Robot_Wars%29_33ba.html" title="George Francis (Robot Wars)">George Francis (Robot Wars)</a>. The work so far is not currently wasted as it wouldn't be too hard to copy the information as it is now (prior to any deletion/merge) and take it to a new website or wiki. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 13:32, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm hoping to do some major work to the Robot Wars articles on here over the summer, but I think the best option with the incredibly jumbled competitor articles is to <b>merge</b> Roadblock, Panic Attack, Chaos 2, Razer, Tornado and Typhoon 2 into Winners of Robot Wars UK, <b>merge</b> other definitely notable but perhaps less successful robots such as Hypno-Disc (first fly wheel weapon, second in series 4) and Diotoir (covered in fur - 'nuff said!) into another article (Notable Competitors on Robot Wars UK, perhaps) and to <b>delete</b> anything that remains, such as Derek. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECountdownCrispy_c3f0.html" title="User:CountdownCrispy">CountdownCrispy</a> 16:28, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into Competitors on Robot Wars UK Afterwards, it is up to the editors of that page to determine which robots should remain, and which should be deleted. (Perhaps a table of all robots by series might be appropriate.) It might be necessary to create a couple of pages in the future, but for ease of closing this debate, I would suggest merging into a single page. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluap_751b.html" title="User:Bluap">Bluap</a> 18:02, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep some</b> - per Whpq. Also, these mass deletions are getting out of hand.

<li><b>Keep all</b> until broken into smaller AfDs. The winners of the competitions are certainly notable, but I believe that some non-champions would also qualify.

<li>Keep all, such a blanket deletion is not suitable in this case. Minor stuff should probably be merged into one article in any case, but this should be worked out on talk pages, not AFD. <a href="../../../z/o/n/User%7EZoney_0cf9.html" title="User:Zoney"><b>zoney</b></a> <span style="color:green; font-size:larger">♣</span> <a href="../../../z/o/n/User_talk%7EZoney_bef0.html" title="User talk:Zoney"><b>talk</b></a> 20:37, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> to Competitors on Robot Wars UK. They cannot really be considered ficticious characters as the robots were the cummulation many hours work by engineers and enthusiasts to take part in a nationally know competition that did give a degree of recognition in their field. Deletion would be to belittle the hard work of a competitor. Their name and acheivement/final ranking should be recorded and also links to the builders site (if they have one), but just one page should be sufficiant. The round by round ranking is probably unnessecary. Also, if it is copied&amp;pasted from a fansite, does that not have potential copyright/attributation implications? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinCarmody_2db4.html" title="User:KevinCarmody">KevinCarmody</a> 02:20, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The article is badly written and needs to be redone but there is no way to argue that the song is not-notable. Compare it to thousands of songs listed here on Wikipedia.

<p>excessively promotional, redundant, notability marginal</p>
<p>The O'Farrell Theater is a strip club that is actually quite well known (at least locally); article doesn't cite references but some probably exist. It's best known for one of the Mitchell Brothers (founders/owners) shooting the other one to death in the early 1990's. The incident, and some info about the theater, is already documented at <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitchell_brothers.html" title="Mitchell brothers">Mitchell brothers</a>. I feel this article is excessively detailed about the theater's facilities and hours (<a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>) and that the encyclopedia doesn't need separate articles about the theater and the Mitchell Brothers (the remaining one of them still owns the theater, I think). An attempt to trim back the article resulted in a revert.</p>

<p>This club is the best (POV that many agree with) in California, and probably in US. It features the highest quality adult entertainment, most who visited it would agree. It's top-notch in it's industry. Strippers all over California just dream to work there, and many come from out of state (from Seattle, from Florida). I am not affiliated with the club and am not promoting it. I just feel that it deserves the separate Wikipedia article due to the club's exceptional quality. Or else all the articles in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Strip_clubs" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Strip_clubs" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Strip_clubs</a> should be deleted the same way since they are of the similar nature.</p>

Tourists have flocked here for live, nude girls and dirty movies since 1971, when porn star Marilyn Chambers followed her performance in a Mitchell Brothers' film by becoming an Ivory Snow model.

<li><b>Comment</b> some of the other strip club articles do look dubious; however, none of them, as far as I can tell, already have separate articles about their owners. Any that do should probably be merge-able too. I'm ok with merging the content of the <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitchell_brothers.html" title="Mitchell brothers">Mitchell brothers</a> into the article about the O'Farrell theater instead of the other way around, if that helps. IMO, the current state of the theater article is still too much like an advertisement either way, though. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 11:15, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Was discussed back in October 2005 and kept, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Daniele_Geltrudi_7283.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Daniele Geltrudi">the old AfD discussion</a>. However, I do not think the basic premises expressed back then still hold. To me, this is a clear case of advertising and vanity. I get only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%2B%22Daniele+Geltrudi%22+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%2B%22Daniele+Geltrudi%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">33 Google hits off-wikipedia for him</a>. Being a member of some architects' society in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Como.html" title="Como">Como</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> and having built some building isn't enough for me. That's what architects do usually, after all, and there are thousands, if not millions more who have comparable achievements. Furthermore, the article has not improved since then; it's still completely unsourced, written in some variant of "Inglis", and the (nearly sole) editor is User:Geltrudi. Also note that the article at the Italian Wikipedia that was mentioned in the old AfD discussion does not appear to exist, see <a href="../../../../it/d/a/n/Daniele_Geltrudi_9270.html" class="extiw" title="it:Daniele_Geltrudi">it:Daniele_Geltrudi</a>, and a search over there also came up empty. <b>Delete</b> as nn-bio, vanity. <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 10:52, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: While this article is pretty hopeless, I feel like we really ought to have an article on 'Head of Household', or at least on the social structure of a household.

There is no verified assertion of notability (even the Penthouse Pet bit is unsourced, though presented in another article), and no reliable source for the information presented (IMDB is not acceptable as a reliable source). It's my belief that in its current form, the article should be deleted; however, I think there's room for community discussion, so I brought it here. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 12:38, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> It shouldn't be taken as gospel, but given the sheer <i>size</i> of the porn industry, we need to have a standard for inclusion. Around 100 films (plus or minus 10 is a good figure) is a very decent standard. The biggest problem with this article is the lack of reliable sources - where are they? I've looked (still trying to bleach out my mind from that search) and have not found any. As for the claim that "we keep worse articles, so we should keep this one," that is an <i>argumentum ad mediocritum</i>, which is a very weak argument. Those other articles should probably be deleted as well, unless they're cleaned up to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 14:51, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In that case, what about the rest of the article? Verification of the fact that she's a Penthouse Pet would give her a mention in the List of Penthouse Pets - which she already has. Absolutely everything else in the article is unsourced, if you discount IMDB (which we should, although I will concede that it is acceptable for providing information on the movies she's been in). At present, there does not seem to be enough information on her from reliable sources to leave this as anything but a perpetual stub, unless the contributors to the article would like to provide sources. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 21:03, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>(2) LukeIsBack.com is the site of <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Ford_6a4b.html" title="Luke Ford">Luke Ford</a>, "Porn's Gossip Columnist", "the most hated man in porn", etc.. While I entirely agree the organization and HTML of his site is lacking, the substance of the site is notable, mostly for the guy's dedication. He's a published author on this subject ("History of X", others), and has been doing "porn journalism" for a living for years. He can be (and has been, in print, see the article) compared to the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Drudge_c363.html" title="Matt Drudge">Matt Drudge</a> of this particular industry. He's a fairly reliable source, which can be shown, ironically, by the fact that he has been sued by porn stars several times over the years for revealing information they didn't want to be revealed. For this case, however, his article on the star is fairly skimpy, admittedly. As for the others, what can I say that I didn't say before with the "not New York Times" comment? Porn just isn't a subject that lends itself naturally to peer-reviewed university study. However, given there is no serious controversy about any of the issues dealing with the subject, I think they should suffice. Note that 90% of our articles that are not about porn don't have cast-iron quality references either, that doesn't mean they have no verifiable references and should be deleted. Write articles about porn, and your sources are going to be porn magazines, there is no way around that - but even porn magazine published articles are not blogs and forum posts. (1) I had to run after posting the 3 refs, I entirely agree they should be footnoted or otherwise cross-referenced with actual facts in the article, and even more should be added, but give me a bit of time to do that, please. (Or feel free to help, of course, I don't own the article.) I even think there are more sources that can be added; however this should be enough to make people vote Keep to give me that time.

<li><b>Comment</b> Be very, very, very careful about accusing people of being biased; I perceive in your comment a not-very-thinly-veiled accusation of bias on my part. I brought this article up for deletion for the reasons stated in the nom. You may feel free to examine my contributions if you believe that I am somehow biased against porn actresses (some of my votes in recent AfDs will surprise you).

<li><b>Observation</b> BlackAsker, please don't take this the wrong way, but I believe you've missed the entire point of the nomination. The main reason for the AfD was because the article did not have valid sources (and no one came up with them, despite repeated calls by myself and other editors on <a href="../../../v/i/c/Talk%7EVicca_b034.html" title="Talk:Vicca">Talk:Vicca</a> to get the piece sourced). The AfD is to delete the article in its pathetic, unsourced form (and that's putting it fairly mildly); it's not about the inclusion of Vicca herself, but the uncited <i>article</i> itself. -- <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Beaudoin_Jr._f03b.html" title="User:Joe Beaudoin Jr.">Joe Beaudoin Jr.</a> <sup style="font-variant:small-caps;"><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoe_Beaudoin_Jr._eb69.html" title="User talk:Joe Beaudoin Jr.">Think out loud</a> — <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO?</a></sup> 02:49, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Per my comment above and IMDB content. From <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>: <i>Sources should also be appropriate to the claims made.</i>.

<li>Keep it, obviously. There is a serious level of delusion at work here. IMDB is a much more reliable source than Wikipedia. Submissions are moderated, as anyone who uses these resources knows. Here it is catch as catch can and political, witness Joe Beaudoin's view of certain porn stars. He's made himself an editor and he has a personal hobbyhorse. Vicca was a major contract porn star with VCA and nearly Penthouse Pet of the Year, among other things. I finally grew tired of jousting with the personalities here, who never did answer my repeated questions about the technical issues of properly posting and discussing and so forth. Meanwhile, I look at many other entries and see nothing like the contentiousness generated by a couple insiders. Elihu1951

I hope the crank who made a federal case out of this is very happy. Oh, yes, IMDB is far more esteemed for accuracy and non-crank behavior, as it is moderated and relatively checked, than this monstrosity.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, sorry that's not what I meant at all. The meaning in the UK currently relates most strongly to the aftermath of the July 7 terrorist attack on London and is related to the belief that life must continue as normal and that we must not give in to grief or fear despite the risk of terrorism. It is an attempt to evoke the no-surrender blitz mentality and so has resonance in the UK.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is claimed on usenet that this author is being singled out and everything he writes removed. Looking at this article, I can't see any justification for deletion.

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't think being a VP of FIDE or president of a national chess federation (especially a minor federation) reaches Wikipedia's standard of notability all by itself. They are just functionary positions. We don't have articles about vice presidents of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Basketball_Association_2e33.html" title="National Basketball Association">NBA</a>, which is a much more famous organization than FIDE. And organizations like the Malta Chess Federation are so obscure that even an article about the organization itself (much less one of its functionaries) would be of dubious notability.
<p>If Borg actually does something notable sometime, then we can put up a new article. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 23:55, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment To Drkirkby</b>: there's no vendetta; Sloan has put up several dozen articles on Wikipedia (some of them wildly inappropriate) and only half a dozen or so of them have been deleted, either for non-notability (campaign biographies of obscure chess people who were running for FIDE office, speedied for copying from the campaign web sites) or ridiculous attack articles full of baseless charges (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tom_Dorsch_c0b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tom Dorsch">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tom Dorsch</a>). Other articles of his that were full of nonsense (see the edit history of <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_G._Winter_8323.html" title="Edward G. Winter">Edward G. Winter</a> for example) have been cleaned up by other editors, and Sloan refers to that as "vandalism". Please try to understand what you're dealing with before coming to Sloan's defense. <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Polgar_5ac3.html" title="Susan Polgar">Susan Polgar</a>'s recent remarks <a href="http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com/2006/07/serious-issues-with-uscf.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com/2006/07/serious-issues-with-uscf.html" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> might give you an idea. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 23:55, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>My name is Włodzimierz Holsztyński (to avoid any suspicion of an anonymous action). In my opinion the wikipedia posts should be adorned by a weight parameter, which would make it easier to search both for the relevant and irrelevant information. On a scale from 0 to 1000 (one thousand), biographical posts about Archimedes, Newton, Gauss, Galois, Niels Abel, Riemann, Poincare, Hilbert and Einstein would have weight 1000 (one thousand, the max). The weight of a biography on Geoffrey Borg can be maximum 1 (one), granted that it is well researched and well written. Then I would vote for keeping it (providing that weight=1 would be attached to such a post). But there is no need for a sloppy version of an article of such a low importance and quality. To be specific, the article doesn't say since when Geoffrey Borg is holding any of the mentioned positions. This should be clearly stated (and not left to a reader's deduction process). The information about Geoffrey Borg being a FIDE VP, and about his candidacy for the treasurer post, is a confusing combination, which should be clarified by an explicit description of what has happened.</p>
<p>To allow this kind of junk on Wikipedia creates a danger that ninety or more percent of entries will be equally poor, rending Wikipedia unusable. Certain minimum should be assumed even with the understanding that an article might be improved later on.</p>
<p>Let me stress that my view is constructive; I consider wikipedia to be a (potentially) outstandingly useful source of information. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.81.66.34 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.81.66.34_227e.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.81.66.34">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep on Condition</b> that only notable/ fairly common license types are compared. Knowing Is Half The Battle 19:58, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> because any comparison will be misleading. Compatibility of two licenses is dependent upon the interpretation of the license by the copyright holder. A collective work covered by two licenses may or may not be distributable, and this article cannot reliably shed any light on that situation. -<a href="../../../r/u/s/Russ_Nelson_0c2a.html" title="Russ Nelson">Russ Nelson</a> <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussNelson_13b7.html" title="User:RussNelson">RussNelson</a> 22:13, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>You are assuming one particular sort of comparison, namely that of saying whether one licence is legally compatible with another. Please read our <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_filesystems.html" title="Comparison of filesystems">comparison of filesystems</a>. Legal compatibility with one another is <i>only one</i> of the ways in which software licences could be compared in an article such as this. We could compare them by publication dates, by authors, by whether they have had approval by various organizations (such as the FSF, the OSI, and so forth), (possibly) by how many softwares are licenced thereunder, and by other criteria. <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_filesystems.html" title="Comparison of filesystems">comparison of filesystems</a> should give an idea of how an article such as this could be written.
<p>The major question is that of sources. Do sources exist from which such a comparison article can be written? A comparison article that comprises a table with two columns, "FSF approval?" and "OSI approval?", can definitely be written, using the sources that this article already cites. If we have no sources on the matter of legal compatibility, then that doesn't mean that a "comparison of" article cannot be written. It only means that the comparison article cannot have a "X compatible with Y" matrix.</p>
<p>The real question to address is whether the aforementioned table is better placed in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_software_licenses.html" title="List of software licenses">list of software licenses</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:37, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Why is my article listed for deletion? Could you please advise me of this before erasing it? This is an article on a series of stories I have written, they are original material and are not copyrighted by any fashion, the article had a descent length and I hope to expand on it further in the future. Please tell me what's wrong with it so I may correct this?

<li><b>Delete and response to above comment</b> - The problem is that the information is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> (which is the absolute #1 requirement of Wikipedia), and that there's no reason to believe that these stories are <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">important</a>. If they're widely recognized as important, where are the critics with commentary on your work? Where are the Amazon sales ranks for paper-published versions- or, failing that, the huge number of Google hits for electronic-published versions? Until there are enough sources available that we can discuss it from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral Point of View</a>, there's no way we can have it on the Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> There has been an enormous amount of news coverage regarding the crime and his execution. Unfortunately the only place on the web to get a good synopsis of the story is Wikipedia. Other websites, such as answer.com have the info, but they are only copying Wiki. The crime was notable (one of the most horrific in Shelby county history), the execution was notable (only the second one in Tennessee in 45 years), and the fact that there are still questions about his guilt or innocence is notable. The DNA evidence was never tested, and the Shelby County prosecutor's office still refuses to hand over the evidence for testing. Also, the crime was a major part of the book "Journey into Darkness" by John Douglas (former FBI profiler). This is a good article, and it will continue to evolve.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>, are you insane? The article is part of a series of articles describing nationally standardized high school courses.

<li>Questioning the nominator's sanity is not an effective way to win her over to your view. It's rather incivil, as well. Frankly, there were reasonable arguments both ways in the last AfD.

<li>...<b>Strongest Keep possible</b>. There is one link that doesn't go to the College Board... which makes the test. The other link adds helpful information - an appropriate single link for the external links section.

Does not fail the single test available in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, which is C1 under "products and services." The sole portion of <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> relevant is the first criterion, and I see no evidence of that.

<dd>Also, this junk-ladened website is not The College Entrance Examination Board that provides standardised testing services (like entrance examinations to institutes of higher education.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The articles were started with the criteria that those listed be party members (based on either running for office, party activism or personal statement), but the titles were changed because contributors believed that was too restrictive and hard to verify. Now, of course, the attitude is the opposite – that the criteria should be <i>more</i> restrictive, and that party membership <i>should</i> be verified. I was never in favor of including individuals with more tenuous connections to the various parties, but other users believed that was a useful component of the lists. If decision is to delete, please userfy articles under my page to allow for data retrieval; these are reasonably old articles with substantial contribution histories. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfitToys_23f7.html" title="User:MisfitToys">MisfitToys</a> 18:13, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Gosh - an AFD!

(Yes, a deputy High Court judge is a more junior judge who occasionally sits as a High Court judge.)

<p>Wikipedia is not a guide to mountain climbing. It is not an indiscrimintory collection of information. It is not a soapbox. The article is not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../h/b/d/User%7EHbdragon88_4994.html" title="User:Hbdragon88">Hbdragon88</a> 17:37, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I would tend to agree Hbdragon88. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoofyheadedpunk_6175.html" title="User:Goofyheadedpunk">goofyheadedpunk</a> 17:56, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>well, could you suggest a way of changing it to be acceptable and adhere to Wikipedia guidelines? Jshurak 19:04, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>How is this article different to <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossary_of_climbing_terms.html" title="Glossary of climbing terms">glossary of climbing terms</a>? Is there anything to say in general about the techniques listed in <a href="../../../c/l/i/Category%7EClimbing_techniques_2c16.html" title="Category:Climbing techniques">Category:Climbing techniques</a> that warrants an overview article distinct from <a href="../../../c/l/i/Climbing.html" title="Climbing">climbing</a>? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:34, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Those are definitions. This article is a how-to guide, something which (if I understand correctly) is generally not allowed. For instance, <a href="../../../c/v/g/WP%7ECVG_903f.html" title="WP:CVG">WP:CVG</a> doesn't allow walkthroughs to be posted on video game articles because that is of no interest to the casual reader; interested and advanced players will go to <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_b5e0.html" title="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a> or someplace else to get that info. I think that the same reasoning should apply here: okay to define some common terms, but not to actually give tips and a how-to. <a href="../../../h/b/d/User%7EHbdragon88_4994.html" title="User:Hbdragon88">Hbdragon88</a> 20:05, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I suppose the difference between this and a glossary of climbing terms is that these are terms that have to do with technique.
<ul>
<li>i.e. Belay Device will not appear in this article. Jshurak 20:40, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Someone not familiar with rock climbing terms would not know what to look for in the glossary of climbing terms.
<ul>
<li>Say someone needs to write an article on climbing techniques (for health class or a term paper or something like that), this person would essentially have to read every single definition in the glossary of climbing terms to find which pertain to techniques. Jshurak 20:40, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This article is <b>not</b> a how-to guide to rock climbing.
<ul>
<li>A how-to rock climbing guide would include when to use these techniques(something which has been removed from here.)</li>
<li>A how-to might also include proper rope usage or how backstepping is very useful in conjunction with the side pull to reach a high hold. Jshurak 20:40, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When I wrote this article I had the idea of a glossary in mind. Jshurak 20:40, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossary_of_climbing_terms.html" title="Glossary of climbing terms">glossary of climbing terms</a>. A small amount of description of when a technique is used doesn't make this a HOWTO. A comment in <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a> explaining that people tend to <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punt.html" title="Punt">punt</a> in 4th-and-long doesn't turn that into a strategy guide... -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think the most recent changes constitute techniques. They seem to be more forms or types of climbing. An overhang climb is not a really a technique as it is a type of route. I think the old page should be reinstituted. Jshurak 13:59, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is wholly unencyclopedic plot summary, written from the (<a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">in-universe</a>) perspective of a fictional custom pistol. The article fails to give any reason why this pistol is particularly important, and it's not really an important plot device in Resident Evil 3 (which is the only game I've played in which it appears). I don't see how this is encyclopedic, and I don't see how it could be made encyclopedic or how any article could benefit from a merge.</p>
<p>Bonus problem: the article fails to mention what games it's talking about, other than mentioning the Resident Evil series (with its dozen-plus games) as a whole in the first sentence.</p>
<p>There is relevant precedent in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Weapons_in_the_Resident_Evil_Outbreak_Series_3931.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Weapons in the Resident Evil Outbreak Series">this AFD</a>, in which two lists of weapons from the same game series were deleted. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 20:54, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This item appears in Resident Evil: REmake, Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil: Nemesis. The term "Samurai Edge" does not define the weapon to readers and must be elaborated. The glossary decription is far too brief and narrow, not to mention wrong. We shouldn't make articles for every weapon in every RE game, but this weapon is a staple piece. Information mentioned above by MIB is already available in the main article from which the Samurai Edge article branches and the addition of said information would merely be a repeated effort. A merge would be appropriate, however, this is impossible as all viable pages have been deleted. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamer_Junkie_f015.html" title="User:Gamer Junkie">Gamer Junkie</a> 21:23, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm proposing that we delete this article as an unmanageable hopeless spam magnet. The whole idea of having a list of famous hotels is inherently both problematic in terms of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality</a> and of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. Just today I've removed an entry of a hotel <i>to be built</i> in Kuwait! There already exists a <a href="../../../h/o/t/Category%7EHotels_a89f.html" title="Category:Hotels">Category:Hotels</a> which should be able to play this role. I recently proposed some <a href="../../../h/o/t/WP%7EHOTELS_989b.html" title="WP:HOTELS">guidelines for the notability of hotels</a> which have not yet generated enough feedback for me to claim that they represent any kind of consensus but per <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDP_6910.html" title="WP:AFDP">AfD precedents</a> hotels that have no claim of notability beyond their actual touristic purpose should only find a place on Wikitravel so the ones that end up with articles (and hence in the category) should be <i>famous</i> at least in some reasonnable sense. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> (<a href="../../../p/a/s/User_talk%7EPascal.Tesson_b5ec.html" title="User talk:Pascal.Tesson">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pascal.Tesson_0a6f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pascal.Tesson">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> There is no article on Famous hotels, because Famous hotels is not an encyclopedic topic; in general there should not be a "list of X" if there is no article on X. There are no criteria for inclusion. No references are cited at all, and almost none of the entries say anything to indicate that the hotel is actually famous. This list does nothing that would not be done better by a category. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:25, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article seems to be totally unintelligible to some mathematically astute WP editors, I have serious concerns about the history of edits of this article (some major contributions by 'Cruise' or 'David Cruise' and links to external sites which mention 'D.

That that is how the material should be apportioned among the article titles is obviously required by simple common sense. So a question arises: Should this AFD tag be put on <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity_%28statistics%29.html" title="Homogeneity (statistics)">homogeneity (statistics)</a>? I've only superficially glanced at the material; it appears to be one of those things used in statistics applied to psychology that are better-known among statisticians in psychology departments than anyone else.

<li><b>Confused issue</b> Hmm - I think that has somewhat muddied the waters, and I am not sure that moving an article in the middle of an AfD discussion was best thing to do. The material which I think is utter gobble-de-gook, and which caused the original AfD is now at: <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity_%28statistics%29.html" title="Homogeneity (statistics)">homogeneity (statistics)</a>. I am a reasonably competent mathematician, and have taught statistics for many years, but this article seems to be almost meaningless pseudo-maths, and has already been described by other editors of maths articles as "whacky" and "... like abracadabra ... ". What is the next step? should I tag <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity_%28statistics%29.html" title="Homogeneity (statistics)">homogeneity (statistics)</a> as AfD? <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmath789_8910.html" title="User:Madmath789">Madmath789</a> 14:57, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> probably simplest to withdraw this AfD and start a new one for <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneity_%28statistics%29.html" title="Homogeneity (statistics)">homogeneity (statistics)</a>.

</ul>
<p>I have some <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> problems with this nomination. Wikipediatrix has been engaged in a heated argument on the Chuck Cunningham syndrome talk page, arguing that no one knows what it is (although <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Chuck+Cunningham+syndrome%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Chuck+Cunningham+syndrome%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">13,000 Google hits</a> would seem to demonstrate otherwise) and that therefore it should be renamed (despite no good alternatives being available). Is this nomination just a way of trying to gain some advantage there? There are a few other descendant articles (Lazarus Cunningham) whose titles might need work but don't really fit in to the main CCS article; I don't see though that they merit deletion. I really wonder if Wikipediatrix is trying to get the whole thing deleted; <s>his</s> her rather abusive language (either "contrived" or "made-up" would make the point alone) in the nomination tends to suggest that.</p>
<p>I don't see how this "definition" can never be proven (and how do you "prove" a definition anyway?): A character is suddenly introduced into a TV series without explanation, yet treated as if he or she has always been part of it. Is it any less clear-cut? Any fan of <i><a href="../../../1/9/9/Space%7E1999.html" title="Space:1999">Space:1999</a></i> can't argue that's not what happened with Tony Verdeschi, and didn't happen with Maya. Ditto with Sondra Huxtable. I am not familiar with many of the other shows listed, but assuming the information given is correct it meets the definition. I really have no idea what Wikipediatrix is talking about when <s>he</s> she says it would be a dumping ground for any information anyone wants to put there, or even what <s>he</s> she could be talking about.</p>
<p>I really think both of the above editors might want to reconsider their votes. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 18:25, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Let's stick to the point. I don't see that there is any element of OR to this article - it merely describes a known phenomenon. I can also make no sense of the objection that the definition cannot be "proven" - in fact this is a bit like complaining that there's no OR! The same could be said of any article about non-empirical phenomena (there is no "proof" of a definition of <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_bomb.html" title="Google bomb">Google_bomb</a> for example, but it's a valid article). It's also quite clear what the term does and doesn't describe, so I don't see how it can be a dumping ground for irrelevant information.</li>

<dd>I don't see a connection between original research and a reader's ability to understand something after having it explained to them. I think if I made up a bogus "syndrome" article called Fried Bacon syndrome and applied it to any TV show where characters ate bacon, the average reader would understand that too. But that doesn't mean that my "syndrome" had any validity. Even if my "syndrome" became a popular meme and people started mentioning it in their blogs, that still doesn't make Fried Bacon syndrome any more real. Nor would it automatically infer any validity to anyone who made up Reverse Fried Bacon syndrome one day in <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">school</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 15:18, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you created Fried Bacon syndrome and applied it to any TV show where characters ate bacon, you would find three things occuring: your contributions to Wikipedia on the subject would be deleted without discussion, you would find that people looked at you funny whenever you brought it up in conversation, and you would find that people would go out of their way not to talk to you. I don't mean anything personal by this — this is just what happens when you start talking about a topic that those around you do not believe exists. I've seen it happen when someone brings up ghosts, bigfoot, Scientology, etc., in a group that is not even remotely well disposed to these subjects. To make up a syndrome based on a false observation would produce similar results. You cannot spontaneously create a concept on an arbitrary basis and expect the culture to agree with you as if they were sheep. However, if you applied a logical (or at least catchy) name to something that everyone knows exists if only in vague terms, then there is a chance that the name might stick. The <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Cunningham_Syndrome_bb3f.html" title="Chuck Cunningham Syndrome">Chuck Cunningham Syndrome</a> (CCS) existed as a name &amp; concept before it appeared as an article in Wikipedia to desribe phenomena that likewise existed before Wikipedia. It has at least one major variation, a reversal, with examples found throughout decades of television history. The article on the subject contains none of the chaos that would ensue if a cabal of contributors had faked up a concept and tried to shoe-horn it into Wikipedia through falsification and brute force. Clearly, Reverse CSS exists just as CSS exists. Maybe it's the name that rubs you the wrong way. If you have another way to describe the phenomena in a manner that you think better adheres to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, please let us know. I am against this information being deleted, but I am not against it being renamed or rewritten. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus71_15e9.html" title="User:Proteus71">proteus71</a> 17:15, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(If another term is also used, then a descriptive term might be used for the name of the article, and "Reverse Cunningham" <i>might</i> redirect to it. I <i>don't</i> think this particular term is even used among serial drama fans; but, even if it were, a redirect to CCS or whereever it ends up would be appropriate.)

<dd>I can see your point for merging. In fact, I think it's a good idea. However, the reason <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> exists is to prevent single, isolated opinions from being represented as fact. Now, consider the case where someone writes a book and claims, "I had a private meeting with the late such-and-such celebrity or political figure. No one else was present." Because of this person's credentials, his or her book gets printed; so, we have what WP considers a reliable source even though we have only the word of the author. Compare that situation to this, where several thousand independent witnesses watch the same TV show and note that some new character is being treated as if he or she had been around from the beginning when this was not the case. How exactly is this original research in the sense that it is an isolated opinion? Are not several thousand independent witnesses better than a single witness, whether or not he or she can get a book published? (And we are talking about <i>independent</i> witnesses, not members of a cabal attempting to rewrite history.)</dd>

<dd>CCS is all over the web. Since RCCS is not, your point to merge the two articles is well taken. However, RCCS is a subtype of an existing concept, so with a little rewriting (calling it "a type of reverse Chuck Cunningham Syndrome", for example), there should be no problem.</dd>

<li><b>Keep and revert/merge <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">non-notable</a> biographies</b> (My discussion also applies for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_KYW-TV_Personalities_c10f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/KYW-TV Personalities">KYW-TV Personalities</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_WCAU_Personalities_0376.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WCAU Personalities">WCAU Personalities</a>.) While you think your life would be easier separating the various people from the personalities page, instead, it may get worse if this AfD goes through. What Pressure Thirteen has done is <s>broken up</s> split the page into its constituent people. The trouble is some of those people are currently not notable enough to have their own article on Wikipedia. Those articles may be ripe for deletion, perhaps even <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">speedy deletion</a> for vanity. For example, <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Freeze_c196.html" title="Amy Freeze">Amy Freeze</a> (which I picked out at random) is a meteorologist. Sure, she is one of 20 women in the world to be a Certified Broadcast Meteorologist. But her article could be thrown out because it might be construed as vanity. (This doesn't mean that I support deleting the article, and I will not AfD it.) If she ends up being deleted, I bet you'll regret breaking up the original article.<br /></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Most reporters are even lower on the totem pole of notability. People such as Lu Ann Cahn, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Bucci_89bb.html" title="Steve Bucci">Steve Bucci</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/e/Drew_Levinson_4fcd.html" title="Drew Levinson">Drew Levinson</a>, and John Rawlins (reporter). Nothing against them, (and again I will not suport deletion before this AfD is closed) but those articles do not assert notability, and you are more likely to battle AfDs for these kinds of articles (collectively or individually) IMHO. Even if they are stubbed, I feel they will not achieve notability to be sufficient as <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">bios</a>.<br /></dd>
<dd>I am from <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, and my comparable TV stations to the Philly stations are <a href="../../../w/a/b/WABC-TV_f943.html" title="WABC-TV">WABC-TV</a>, <a href="../../../w/n/b/WNBC_15c0.html" title="WNBC">WNBC</a>, <a href="../../../w/c/b/WCBS-TV_0a03.html" title="WCBS-TV">WCBS-TV</a>, and <a href="../../../w/n/y/WNYW_048a.html" title="WNYW">WNYW</a> among others. When you see those articles, and other stations for other major markets, there are many redlinks for reporters, sports reporters, anchors, and meteorologists. For WABC-TV, Scott Clark, Sarah Wallace, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Evans_%28meteorologist%29_c973.html" title="Bill Evans (meteorologist)">Bill Evans</a>, and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Bartelstein_8824.html" title="Steve Bartelstein">Steve Bartelstein</a> have been with that station for a long time and contributed a lot, but they don't have articles yet. It's not that the articles can't be created, but no one has come up with an assertion of notability on these people yet. I am not an expert on the TV news industry, and I would not want to be responsible for creating those articles, especially if the source is from the station's website. (This is also a reminder of <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECopyvio_e1c3.html" title="WP:Copyvio">copyvios</a>.)<br /></dd>
<dd>"Hard to manage" and "clunky to maintain" are rather weak excuses for deleting this article. I don't think there is another alternative to this article, and merging it into the parent (in this case, <a href="../../../w/p/v/WPVI-TV_8e05.html" title="WPVI-TV">WPVI-TV</a>) would be counterproductive. The article serves a purpose. Perhaps you may have trouble with its format, maybe you need to become familiar with the Wikipedia interface, I don't know. But from what I've seen in the past edits, the article structure actually seemed to do well.<br /></dd>
<dd>I suggest most <i>notable</i> anchors would be deserving of their own article. The others (reporters, sports anchors, meteorologists, etc.) have to be on a feel-by basis for separate articles, but they would be appropriate for this personalities page, which is separate from the station article.<br /></dd>

<li>Here is a suggestion: Eliminate this article, as "Personalities" really is an inaccurate description and degrades the fact they the people are journalists and not entertainers, create two new pages with capsule bios, <a href="../../../w/c/a/WCAU-TV_Anchors_b262.html" title="WCAU-TV Anchors">WCAU-TV Anchors</a> and <a href="../../../w/c/a/WCAU-TV_Reporters_1183.html" title="WCAU-TV Reporters">WCAU-TV Reporters</a> while keeping the list on the main <a href="../../../w/c/a/WCAU_5d13.html" title="WCAU">WCAU</a> page to have a one stop place with the list of former station employees in the full context of the station article. This would be a more accurate categorization of the talent instead of the generic and inaccurate "Personalities". A side benefit is the pages would be smaller and make vandalism easier to spot. Hell', I'll even do it. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKramden4700_b9a0.html" title="User:Kramden4700">Kramden4700</a> 23:34, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My inclination is to <b>delete</b> all of the bios that don't assert encyclopedic merit; failing that, <b>merge</b> them into articles such as those suggested above by Kramden4700 and <b>delete</b> this article. Individual reporters are usually of questionable notability; I only found this AfD after having deleted a few of their articles without being aware that they were part of a larger picture (as a side note, if consensus leads to a merge and you need my help with undeletions, drop me a line and I'll be glad to do what I can). <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass">¡Épa!</a></sup></b> 07:09, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I don't see how this could be considered an encyclopedic topic. A handful (and a very small handful) of people on that list have some very limited notability. The rest are just TV-cruft and many of the articles listed there would be candidates for speedy deletion. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 07:46, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
