<li><b>Weak delete</b> appears to be a just-about-verifiable but insignificant diploma mill. Absent evidence of notable "alumni" claiming status of degrees from here, we probably don't need to give it the oxygen of publicity (or indeed take on the inevitable headache of policing neutrality). <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 14:02, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> There is nothing notable or verifable. I can set up this type of "school" and promote on wikipedia in a similiar way.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Is it unaccredited? I originally sourced it that way in the article because I couldn't find proof it was. I have seen nothing from any source other than the founder and operator of the school. How is this wiki worthy? How many students attend? How many have graduated? What degrees are offered? <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 04:48, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for lack of independent reliable sources needed for verifiability. Without such sources, there's only two potential outcomes for the article: it has unverifiable promotional material for the school, or its used to included unverifiable attacks against it. Neither is acceptable. Currently we're using "source by omission", which means a Wikipedian (in violation of core policy) makes factual claims based on the *absense* of information. This is unacceptable. We can only state something (like say something is an "unaccredited school") if a reliable 3rd party sources has made such a statement. We can't do original research, without violating <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">policy</a>, which sadly we've done by labelling this "school" as we have. The reasons for deleting this, are somewhat similiar to the ones for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Johnson_C._Philip_b30f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Johnson C.

<li><b><s>Keep</s></b>. There is ongoing debate on this school which makes it very interesting to watch. From what I see the school has special accreditation with the Indian government. The information that some have brought makes this legit in my view. It can be verified very easily. Just contact the people in India rather than making spurious attacks. One may not like what they offer but it is not enough to remove the information. Looks like some have a personal axe to grind. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.160.71.152 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.160.71.152_ce11.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.160.71.152">contribs</a>).</small> 28:35, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> There are hundreds of unaccredited schools in California alone. Without notablity or verfiablity, an unaccredited school article will become a bastion for unverified POV. I started the article because I thought the school was legitimate, but it turns out people with ties to it were simply spamming wikipedia. If this were accredited it would not need notable because we know students attend and it is verfiable. Without accreditation we need notablity to take that slack.<a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 05:22, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, considering just what DOES pass for Wikipedia articles on games, I'm not sure delete is the answer. As it stands now, it's horrid, looking more like a blurb on a companies webpage ('Check back for more info later, etc), but that doesn't mean it doesn't have enough warrent to exist as a page.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Though I have some doubts about the Slovaks. The lady who came second claims on her website that she would like to sing professionally. Er, so she is not and it is not what is supposed to happen when she graduates from school? And Tomas here does not seem to look at the first page of his website a lot (anymore?), there is someone there using it to offer special services and the ads on his page are doubtful too. But they have a contract, and they were 2nd and third, so I guess what is sauce for the goose ...--<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 22:24, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> BigHaz makes the good point that rules for notability ought to be similar across countries. I don't know a thing about Slovak singers or TV shows, but that's not a reason for me to oppose this article. This guy isn't very important, even in Slovakia, but Wikipedia with 1 million + articles has plenty of room even for those who fail to win <i>Idol</i> competitions on TV.</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> For me, to say that she passes <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> in multiple ways is a gross overstatement. I don't consider Pop Idol to be a major music competition, though it may come close, and arguably she was placed. I'd say she on the cusp of notability, so I wouldn't press too hard for a deletion but having been signed by Sony, and has just released her debut album, she will soon have name recognition per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (through marketing and promotion) in this small country and possibly quite a few neighbouging ones too. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:09, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, what kind of articles will you be working on or new pages would you like to submit? When I first signed up here at Wiki, it took me a while to find the AfD’s, etc. AfD “voting” is the bulk of your edits. Not that there is anything wrong with that officially. I am not the only one who has noticed this. If <b>I</b> were contributing nothing but AfD “votes”, some might suspect that <b>I</b> was a sock. <i>But that is my thought on the matter</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> The film is notable for its structure. The director has decided to abandon the conventions of film-making and split the film into 11 minute segments. If any other film has a structure like this, I've certainly not heard of it. I don't know whether it has a distributor or not but I really don't see what that has to do with notability. There are many articles about films on Wikipedia that have not been distributed, many not even completed. I think we should be more interested in uniqueness rather than how many people have seen it. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox">Mallanox</a> 03:38, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Splitting a movie into segments is hardly a groundbreaking innovation. In any event, a technical innovation still wouldn't make a film notable unless it had verifiably influenced more notable filmmakers. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 03:50, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Splittling a movie into exactly equal segments is incredibly unusual. Film making is as other artforms tend to be, organic. This is a complete departure. As a film student myself, I would expect to find a film that is organised in a unique way to be in an encyclopaedia. Also, how can a film made in 2006 be shown to have influenced anyone else? Are we to ignore the unique because it hasn't been copied yet? <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox">Mallanox</a> 04:40, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not really unusual at all. Playing around with time structure is one of the simplest student-film tropes. Dividing a movie into 11-minute segments of one shot each is exactly the sort of thing I'd expect from an independent or student filmmaker, even if nobody's done <i>precisely</i> that before. Besides, just doing something <i>new</i> without making any actual <i>impact</i> on filmmaking <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTFILM_6ee5.html" title="WP:NOTFILM">does not satisfy notability</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 05:04, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is not a student film, this is an established director. Please refer me to a film on Wikipedia that is an example of a film split into equal segments. Unless there is another to be an example of such a film making type, the notability comes from the fact that there isn't another. I ask again, do we ignore the unique because it hasn't been copied yet? <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox">Mallanox</a> 12:33, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I never said this was a student film, I said the concept is not far removed from the sort of thing student filmmakers would do. And it's not by an "established" director, but by a director who is not mentioned in any issues of the 72 film journals and entertainment news sources I searched on LexisNexis. There are countless films that play around with the structure of the narrative. And yes, as I said before, Wikipedia ignores an "innovative" film technique if it has not been the subject of imitation, influence, and critical examination. Recognition is what matters, not newness. It has to be <i>recognized</i> by the film community as unique. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 16:00, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I appreciate the friendliness, and I am sure you understand that I have nothing personal against you or your contributions to Wikipedia. The fact still stands that the film has not made even the smallest impact on the world of film, and even if it <i>does</i> represent a unique approach to film, then no critics, film journals, or film scholars have taken notice. It needs to be recognized as innovative and discussed in the media; until then, it is not even close to meeting <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTFILM_6ee5.html" title="WP:NOTFILM">WP:NOTFILM</a>.

<li>Have any of these actors ever done significant work, though? The lead actor, Ian Michaels, only shows up as having held credited roles in a few other shorts - his only parts in significant movies and TV shows were bit parts like "Stoner #1" and "Guy in Chem Lab".

<dd>Whyever not? Popularity is an indication of notability. I actually found this deletion debate when looking to see what astyle's article looks like (there's a redirect there; make sure we get that too if this ends up deleted). The votes so far are "This is not SourceForge." Does that mean that all SourceForge projects are automatically excluded? If not, what is the criteria for inclusion or exclusion, and how is SourceForge relevant at all? Another vote is that "there's not enough for a real article." This article seems to have been created a month ago, and it's not surprising it's pretty sparse still. It's "not a significant development tool"? I'm not even sure what that means. What's significant in this context? Can someone point out a more popular or significant C++ pretty printer? Deleting this article won't offend me, but so far I don't really see any content to any of these votes. Compared to those statements, I think a statement that this is a popular tool is at <i>least</i> as relevant. -- <a href="../../../s/d/f/User%7ESdfisher_d82c.html" title="User:Sdfisher">Steven Fisher</a> 16:31, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The criteria that are used to determine if software is notable enough to be included in Wikipedia are laid out in <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. One of the main content principles is to have <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> of article content via <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable secondary sources</a>. That frequently isn't possible for things that fail the notability criteria. Something that is verifiable can be notable even if it's obscure and/or not popular. Similarly, something that is popular may or may not be notable. My comment that "Wikipedia is not Sourceforge" is only intended to point out the difference between the two sites - Sourceforge will accept any project no matter how insignificant (or even non-existent), while Wikipedia will not. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValrith_e155.html" title="User:Valrith">Valrith</a> 18:38, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> This point ought to be explained clearly somewhere for future reference. I often read the argument "this prof is notable because he edited a book". Now, as people familiar with academic circles can all confirm, this is very much commonplace and definitely not a sign of notability. Tons of conference proceedings or books gathering a series of articles on a given topic are published every year and all have two or three editors whose job is to run the peer-review process. This is an important task but it is a technical one and I have personally attended conferences in which the cited editors include students who were generous enough to help with that job. Bottom line is: being the <i>author</i> of a book published by a prestigious academic press is indication of notability, being the <i>editor</i> means that there are other academics who are grateful you volunteered for the job. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 20:46, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Academic achievements seem to be well under the bar for notability, but when you add in the controversy, can he squeak in?

<dd>I apologize if my nomination of this article came across as being in bad faith, but that was not my intention. If you look at the 9/11 "Truth" Movement articles on wikipedia you'll see a gazillion stubs of people and books who are not notable. For example, books that are owned by fewer than forty libraries in the world, films that are released only on the web to almost no press coverage, individuals who have no claim to notability other than a few one sentence quotes in newspaper articles, etc. How could any of these articles ever become encyclopedic and NPOV? It is entirely reasonable for a user browsing this section of wikipedia to feel like we're promoting, legitimizing and popularizing complete nobodies who have a viewpoint many find offensive. I have no problem with Striver personally - his contributions to articles pertaining to Shi'a Islam seem to have been highly praised - but I don't want wikipedia to become a soapbox for every self-promoting nobody with an idea.</dd>
<dd>As for this specific article, please remember that we're talking about an academic who fails the "professor test" (i:e is not any more notable than the average professor). The only way this article might be encyclopedic is if the controversy is encyclopedic, but will anyone remember it a few months from now? Although it just started a week ago, a google news search for "William Woodward" reveals only 35 unique articles related to the controversy, with a number of these being very brief mentions, blog posts and letters to the editor. Nobody will remember this guy in a month. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 23:32, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I've had to put a bit more thought into this afd, than some of the other nn 9/11 truth articles. I was the one that came up with most of the first paragraph, taking it from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Woodward_%28psychologist%29&amp;oldid=73238653" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Woodward_%28psychologist%29&amp;oldid=73238653" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Woodward_%28psychologist%29&amp;oldid=73245937" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Woodward_%28psychologist%29&amp;oldid=73245937" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. Pretty much the most notable thing I found was "In the Fall 2006 semester, he wants to teach a class that explores 9/11 "in psychological terms". With this AFD, I've done more searching to try and find out what's come of this class he wants to teach? But, it seems the news headlines have died down since then (despite the 9/11 coming up soon). This is evidenced by searching the Union Leader (NH) website <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22william+woodward%22+site:unionleader.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22william+woodward%22+site:unionleader.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>.

<dd>I am glad that we have established that this source is mentioned 17 times, in: NYTimes, CNN, The independent, USA Today, even the ultra conservative freerepublic.com. You can spin that fact anyway you want, but the idea that this person is non-notable fails. "I bet you you have more quotes out there from the spokesperson of the department of motor vehicles." What does the motor vehicles have to do with this article? Clever analogies do not prove your point, therefore the person is notable, and therefore the basis of this AfD is questionable. I suggest this article be <b>Speedy kept</b>, since the one policy reason for the AfD have been shown to be fallacious at best, malicious at worst.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I was impressed by the apparent size of this article, but after looking through it, it's apparent that it's largely fluff. The citation of "sources" is misleading. Most of the articles linked only mention the subject's <i>son</i> and not the subject of the article himself. Of the ones that do mention the subject himself, two are effectively listed twice: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/03/05/elec04.prez.main/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/03/05/elec04.prez.main/index.html" rel="nofollow">A</a> and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/03/05/main/" class="external text" title="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/03/05/main/" rel="nofollow">A Prime</a> are two different links to the same article, and so are <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0412/17/lt.01.html" class="external text" title="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0412/17/lt.01.html" rel="nofollow">B</a> and <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0407/22/pzn.01.html" class="external text" title="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0407/22/pzn.01.html" rel="nofollow">B Prime</a>. The stories by the major news outlets mostly give Bob McIlvaine 1-2 sentences of vague exposition. Most of the rest are links to articles on the websites of obscure political fringe groups. It's apparent to me that Striver just googled the guy's name without doing much checking of the content behind the links that popped up. In short, this guy would be notable if his views were getting a significant amount of play, but I'm afraid at this point his views are mostly relegated to obscurity. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 18:45, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>COMMENT</b> Striver would like you to think that, but it really isn't true. If you look in detail at the many articles Striver mentioned you'll see that he is usually a tiny quote in a large article. <i>The Independent</i> article for example (not accessible online) contains SIX PAGES of rememberences from a number of people. The 3/5/2004 CNN article has a one sentence quote from McIlvane and he is one of four 9/11 family members quoted. I can't find the 3/18/05 CNN article but the selection quoted on the website Striver is using as a source doesn't mention Mcilvaine. The BBC article has a one sentence quote from him and he is one of six people quoted. The NYTimes article is a one sentence "Quote of the Day" feature and only says that he attended a 9/11 commission hearing. None of these are notable. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 21:13, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am glad that we have established that this source is mentioned 17 times, in: NYTimes, CNN, The independent, USA Today, even the ultra conservative freerepublic.com. You can spin that fact anyway you want, but the idea that this person is non-notable fails. The person is notable, and therefore the basis of this AfD is questionable. I suggest this article be <b>Speedy kept</b>, since the one policy reason for the AfD have been shown to be fallacious. I would also like to bring up the fact that the person who initiated this AfD.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Mcilvaine&amp;diff=74257365&amp;oldid=73944276" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Mcilvaine&amp;diff=74257365&amp;oldid=73944276" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> Did not follow the suggested guidelines of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion</a> suggested guidelines state, in the very first two sentences: "Before listing an article for deletion here, consider whether a more efficient alternative is appropriate."

<li><b>Delete</b> (and let the sockpuppet party move to another 9/11 conspiracy AfD debate) The links given in the article do not constitute coverage where McIlvaine is the "primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works". Pretty much anyone involved in the 9/11 associations will eventually turn up as quoted in various places. The whole list of references should be trimmed of all such references. Not much would remain, especially since at least two of the articles listed there do not contain his name. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 20:59, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Nomination for Deletion</b> A tragic story, but no encyclopedic notability is asserted, nor, I think, can it be asserted. There are thousands of new murder/non-negligent manslaughter investigations around the world every year, a large chunk of which go unsolved (in 2004, there were 16,137 cases in the United States, of which 62.6% were solved<a href="http://ask.yahoo.com/20060531.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://ask.yahoo.com/20060531.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>). What makes this particular case so special? It happened on a cruise ship (so it got more media attention than the average killing because it reminds people of an <a href="../../../a/g/a/Agatha_Christie_45ad.html" title="Agatha Christie">Agatha Christie</a> murder mystery), and it happened on the victim's honeymoon (an even better news story for readers or viewers relaxing at home). Plus the widow got upset with cruise line and caused a public relations crisis for them. That's about it. <s>Even</s> Taken separately from the investigation, none of the people involved are encyclopedically notable in their own right - they are not even notable on a local newspaper level. If the case was extraordinarily more horrible and infamous than the average or it led to some new law or change in police techniques or an important book - these effects would be encyclopedically notable. But it did not. Wikipedia is not a police records archive and it is not a news report database or an echo chamber for whatever the news media is reporting (much of which is not encyclopedically notable.). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 03:30, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Rebuttal</b> Actually I did <b>not</b> claim that. I said that the people taken out of the context of the investigation (that is, if the disappearance/killing had never happened), those people would not be notable even on a local newspaper level. (my poor use of "Even" as a sentence starter may have beeen a little confusing but still I don't see how it leads to the claim that Pinkkeith says I made) The missing person/victim ran a liquor store with his father. And please note my emphasis of ENCYCLOPEDIC notablility - Wikipedia's <b>primary purpose</b> is to be an encyclopedia. Wikipedia is NOT a news report database. Again, newspapers, TV news shows, news websites - even ones with international scope and reputation (- carry much news (including news which is simply chosen for its sensationalistic qualities (Pinkkeith uses examples from MSNBC, CBS and CNN (Larry King Live!!) - US news networks are especially prone to sensationalism ) and non-news which is not encyclopedically notable. Media coverage is not sufficient cause for inclusion in Wikipedia. Can you tell me why this story is encyclopedically important? or even, why is it notable for major channel news coverage beyond its sensationalistic qualities? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 05:05, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.</i> - I believe the key phrase here is <i>non-trivial</i>.

<dd>You make some very sound and reasonable arguements. You are deleting this article based on notability of the individual. The real question is what makes one notable and what doesn't. It is all opinonated in my eyes, even the word "trivial" is an opinonated term. There are many articles that are based on information taken from media reports, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Irwin_a65f.html" title="Steve Irwin">Steve Irwin</a> being the most notable and recent example. I don't think that what the source is and what the readers opinon of the source ought to be grounds to delete an article. In my eyes, if a story is reported by multiple national sources, it makes it notable. I would like to withdrawl my vote to keep and vote <b>neutral</b> on this nomination. I think it is notable but it is boarderline. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 11:25, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Just because the media reports it (because they choose to endlessly milk every mile out of tearjerkers rather than newsworthy stories say about genocide in the Sudan, or war in Uganda, or u.s. troops building schoolhouses and repairing sewers in Iraq) , doesn't make it or the person involved notable. Like JonBenet Ramsey (who was 1 of like 6000 girls gone missing and killed in 1996), George Allen Smith's death might be regrettable and worth mourning, but he's one of tens of thousands...he's a mere statistic and despite the sensationalist hype, he won't amount to much more than a statistic. Therefore, <b>delete.</b> —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 06:51, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I sympathize of course with ExplorerCDT's view of the JonBenet case though I would also note that that case generated a substantial cultural criticism (still sensationalist) discourse which led to JonBenet being used (justifiably or not) as an icon of the ills of American society. This probably generated enough material for encyclopedic notability (one could argue that JonBenet is related to certain trends in US cultural commentary) - but in any case, far far more material than has been generated there than for the George Allen Smith case. I don't see how the Smith case has much potential at all for JonBenetesque commentary - the decline of morals in international waters? the crime rate on cruise ships? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 13:57, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b> The story is a sad but intriguing one. However, the article is full of speculation and conjecture, and thus is not encyclopaedic. If you laid out the pertinent facts end to end, you are down to about five lines:</li>

<li>Mr Smith disappeared on his honeymoon cruise.</li>
<li>Mr and Mrs Smith had an argument during the night of his disappearance</li>
<li>Blood was found in the couple's cabin and foul play is suspected</li>

<li><b>Further Comment</b> Most of the "51,000" hits are either regenerations of blog entries or AP-wire postings.

<dd><b>Reply.</b> I don't think it's right to say he achieved "notoriety." According to <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=notorious&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=notorious&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" rel="nofollow">dictionary.com</a>, "notorious" means</dd>
<dd>1. widely and unfavorably known: <i>a notorious gambler</i>.</dd>
<dd>2. publicly or generally known, as for a particular trait: <i>a newspaper that is notorious for its sensationalism</i>.</dd>
<dd>I don't think either of these applies to Smith. Neither does "renown" (also mentioned in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>), which <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=renown&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=renown&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" rel="nofollow">means</a> "widespread and high repute; fame." <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 12:02, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am going to have to vote <b>Keep all &amp; reorganize</b> here. This is a useful resource for someone who wants to look into the history of the show, and as someone pointed out above it really isn't any different than all the TV shows that have articles on individual episodes. Author should find a way to source the articles, however, even if it means simply listing the episode in question as a source. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 19:24, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Disclosure: big wrestling fan, big TNA fan. But... <b>Delete</b> - this is taking things pretty far in considering that this is an encyclopedia. Consider that these results are pre-scripted each week, unlike other sports, and the storylines in pro wrestling are far less deep than other television shows, and I think the need for constant and continuous tracking of results in an encyclopedia is very slim. Episodes of shows like Lost, etc., have long-running and deep storylines that might be hard to track, and it would make sense to have a summary available (though if they came up, I'd opt for deleting those too, as I think that's kind of silly to include in an encyclopedia). <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 20:18, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I honestly have trouble understanding the concept of an encyclopedia that wants to exclude knowledge of this depth just because it can. Yes, it's fairly trivial knowledge, and Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of knowledge, but these articles are <i>not</i> an indiscriminate collection--they're nicely organized, formatted and compartmentalized, and will only get more so as they live on. Even Wikipedia's definition of encyclopedia mentions the word's origin as "the idea of collecting <b>all of the world's knowledge</b> into a single work". M-W says it's "a <b>comprehensive</b> reference work". Why limit ourselves to the length encyclopedias have been in the past? If Wikipedia isn't meant to be a true encyclopedia, then that's fine too, but I haven't seen the Wikipedia is not an encyclopedia page yet. -- <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrevyn_1951.html" title="User:Trevyn">Trevyn</a> 21:31, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This was not my initial reaction, but upon consideration: regardless of whether you look at this as "sporting results" or as "television episodes", deleting these would leave a large number of articles behind which are no more notable or encyclopedic. I can't seem to find even a proposed policy on TV episode notability - I think it would be best to try to hash one out before singling out articles for deletion whilst plenty of other articles on episodes of TV shows I've never heard of remain. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormie_b829.html" title="User:Stormie">Stormie</a> 23:37, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, Seperate pages for each bout would be a total nightmare if it becomes policy. Take WWE for example: 3 shows a week, average 3-6 matches per show. That's a potential 18 new articles per week now let's take this back over several years. I'm also abstaining from the vote as I am suffering a conflict of conscience between episode guide and listcruft. –– <b><a href="../../../l/i/d/User%7ELid_b8c5.html" title="User:Lid">Lid</a></b><sup><small>(<a href="../../../l/i/d/User_talk%7ELid_6320.html" title="User talk:Lid">Talk</a>)</small></sup> 06:03, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I believe it would be fancruft to keep this on a general interest encylopedia.

<li>Indeed, it is not official policy, but it's a sensible set of guidelines which I'm in broad agreement with. Seems pretty clear from this discussion that there is a solid consensus that granddaughters of emperors <i>are</i> notable, as <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28nobility%29_072d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (nobility)">Wikipedia:Notability (nobility)</a> would have it. —<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormie_b829.html" title="User:Stormie">Stormie</a> 09:40, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, we have notability guidelines to ensure that we're writing about people prominent enough to meet verifiability and avoid original research. As a member of the current royal family and subject of media attention, she seems to meet that standard. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 07:35, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think there is an inherent notability attached to royalty, namely because of the media attention that is attracted by it.

It wouldnt exist if each AfD didnt compare articles and make comparisons. What i want to ask though: Has she done anything notable? Has she recieved any press (ie. not fly by as in "There new son is the brother of Keiko and Meiko et cetera") - Where they in mass press when they where born? There son is inheritley notable being the first male to the line in x years and for being in press.

<li><b>Keep</b>, It may not be surprising, but my reasoning is for keep, and I’ll explain why. The article is notable as the subject has aired consistently over the past 10 years with approximately 500 shows. There are many shows that have aired more and many that have aired less, but I’d like to suggest that there is a large enough presence to justify the need for an article. There is the notion that this is a vanity/promotion page – which is perfectly understandable, but I believe may be merely a gut reaction. During the show’s 10 year run it has had a rotating panel of hosts, none of which are still involved with the show after their term, and dozens of cast members who likewise graduate to new projects unrelated to the program. While this may not eliminate the fear of vanity page, I believe this weakens the idea that anyone would benefit greatly by using this for self-promotion or narcissism. While I have been the heaviest contributor to the article so far (also reasonably taken as evidence of non notability) we should take into consideration that the article is new, the show is about begin its newest season, and that more edits and searches by Wikipedians should be expected in the coming months (assuming no one is dissuaded to “waste their time” on an article marked for deletion). Some of those who have commented for deletion have remarked that it is unlikely that anyone knows about the show outside the Rutgers Community, and that they themselves haven’t heard of it until after graduation or being pointed directly to it. While that may seem like a logical argument for deletion, we are all aware that there are numerous articles on subjects we were not personally aware of – and that personal non-notability does not translate over the universal non-notability. Also, many years have passed since the nominator may have been peripherally aware of the show, and as such it has expanded considerably and become far more popular under the control of subsequent hosts. With regard to the idea that few outside Rutgers would be aware of the show, please note the number of articles depicting campus life elements that have become popularized throughout the state and country (i.e. Grease Trucks) - while this precedent does not make for a solid rule of inclusion, it hopefully will encourage others to think twice before marking for deletion based on a “potential lack of public knowledge as interpreted by personal experience”. Finally, while merging and redirecting with WRSU is an understandable alternative to deletion, I feel it would only serve to divert attention from the other aspects of the radio station – which is far more then a paragraph on broadcast range and three paragraphs on just one of their many shows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from rebutting the argument for deletion, I would like to make another argument for keep. The nature of the collegiate setting makes for a constantly rotating student body, which has experienced 10 graduating classes since the premiere of the show. As a result, no one currently involved with the show, and few people who currently listen to the show, were around for the history of the series. Incoming freshmen were eight years old when the show premiered, and are unlikely to have been fans from the start. It is for these people (who will undoubtedly use the popular free encyclopedia to discover more about the show) that the article was written – to do exactly what Wikipedia articles are designed to do – inform and educate the masses.</p>
<p>When reviewing articles for deletion me must be positive in outlook, not merely assume the worse. The negative assumption here is that the article will be useless to any Wikipedian and that it could only serve to promote those behind it – the positive assumption is that it is a neutrally drafted article that contains information that may be useful to individuals curious enough to research a program that is new to them.</p>
<p>Of course, you are all free to make up your own minds as you see fit. Good luck! <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParticularlyEvil_80e9.html" title="User:ParticularlyEvil">ParticularlyEvil</a> 19:10, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> (<i>to <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParticularlyEvil_80e9.html" title="User:ParticularlyEvil">User:ParticularlyEvil</a></i>), your argument is circular in nature in that in conflicts with Wikipedia's policies about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is Not</a>, namely advertising, a predictor or crystal ball (i.e. "maybe these people will be interested to find out more and then this show will become notable...) and it's an argument begging for an exception to be made despite admitting entirely that this article should be deleted/redirected/etc. because it doesn't meet Wikipedia's guidelines and policies meriting inclusion. Just because something lasts for 10 years does not make it notable, important, or encyclopaedic — three attributes that each subject receiving an article on wikipedia needs to be. Despite your poignant appeal, an argument to keep this article based on <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">logical fallacies</a>, (i.e. an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_pity.html" title="Appeal to pity">argumentum ad misericordiam</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_consequences.html" title="Appeal to consequences">ad consequentiam</a>, an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_flattery.html" title="Appeal to flattery">Appeal to flattery</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misleading_vividness.html" title="Misleading vividness">Misleading vividness</a> and an <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proof_by_verbosity.html" title="Proof by verbosity">argumentum verbosium</a> ) is, quite frankly, a bad argument. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 19:35, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> (<i>to <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">User:ExplorerCDT</a></i>), Let’s be civil here. In my own comment I noted that I was the majority contributor to the article, I am not sure further edification was necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, perhaps unintentionally, your use of quotation marks imply that I stated "maybe these people will be interested to find out more and then this show will become notable...” These were never my words, but merely your interpretations of my words.</p>
<p>The argument is not circular, predictive, nor begging for a special exception for this article. Nor does it admit it whole or in part that the article should be deleted/redirected or anything short of kept. I rebutted your <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opinions.html" title="Opinions">opinions</a> and stated my own interpretation on them. Furthermore, if you feel running off a list of logical fallacies backs up you argument, then I suppose your comment was worthwhile to you.</p>
<p>It is clear your vote remains with delete, which I respect, and mine remains with keep, which I hope you will respect in kind. Rather then keep the momentum this has developed as a debate between two users, I think it is best to sit back and let others voice their opinions with both our standpoints here to look upon. I would like to see if the article will survive on its own merits. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParticularlyEvil_80e9.html" title="User:ParticularlyEvil">ParticularlyEvil</a> 20:16, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Rockhopper78 00:45, 9 September 2006 (UTC)I'd like to add my two cents here. Once again, full disclosure; I am one of the people mentioned as a member of the Non-Productive show cast in the article. I was not a contributor to the wiki article, but heard about it through another party. I vote that the article be kept. I disagree with the notion that the show is non-notable. I was part of the show's early cast and crew. After graduation, I lost contact with the show and had assumed that the show no longer existed. In the not-too-distant past, I learned that the show was alive and well, having passed through the hands of many different hosts, cast members and crew throughout the years. Non-Productive has now been a part of the Rutgers community for approximately a decade, and it appears to have picked up enough self-sustaining steam to remain a part of that community for well beyond the forseeable future. It is, has been, and will be the result of the combined efforts of a wide spectrum of diverse contributors and will continue to an assest to the local community for a long time to come. It does not nor has ever required any outside promotion, and I do not believe that the article was written in that vein. Rather, I interpret the article (ackowledged to still be in its infant form) to be a growing record of this collaborative effort.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Note that I have no prejudice against the site as such; but claims to notability like ~3000 visitors a day or references on international blogs and image boards are simply inadequate in the absence of awards or published references. My own homepage gets more visitors than that and has also been referred to on a number of international blogs and forums, but if anyone created an article on it, I would nominate it for deletion myself. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 11:32, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Haeleth mentioned non-cited sources, but sourcings to the foriegn sites and a stat tracking page for pokejungle.net have been provided to give published accounts to the claims. More coming soon, like I said, I'm pretty busy at the moment so please be patient. This article is simply "Under Construction" and not finished yet.

<li><b>Comment</b> Unfortunately, primary sources (as in the subject of the article) cannot be used to verify information (they're not neutral, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is one of the central policies of Wikipedia.) Blogs and forums cannot be used to verify information either, they're not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>. "Under construction" is not an excuse because we're supposed to place things on Wikipedia only after they're established, not before. That being said, the site design looks clean and I hope you keep up the good work, but Wikipedia is not a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">web directory</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 15:57, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> My site is established...the article is still in the rough though. And forums/blogs ARE reliable if you're claiming to have been sourced on international sites, such as forums or blogs. Do you want a newspaper sourced when you're talking about blogs? That is ridiculous. "International blog" I source a blog, which thouroughly verifies the claim that it was sourced in an "international blog". And the hits were definitely sourced by a third party script that's built soley to accurately track stats. And I realize this isn't a website directory, but it is a user-based article compilation on all subjects and matters. I think that if an article is well written, it documents what it needs to, AND I can finish sourcing everything, it should be fine. The Wikipedia's gotten a bit too strict on 'what qualifies' as far as articles go. If there's information to document, and (a) good writer(s), then what's the problem? Is this article degrading to the Wikipedia? BlackxxJapan 14:19, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b>: this is the article in whch the club presents itself. That it was linked from the homepage of the University isn't strange at all and does not indicate anything but that the club exists (which no one doubted).

<li>The story about the Penn Art Club was not simply a link to the site, it was a featured story. While the story about Penn Art Club was featured, other--equally as significant--stories ran: such as discoveries in blot clott physiology, uncovering of ancient tombs in Egypt, new initiatives of the University, abd breakthrough research on the relation of the brain to the eye. "Doesn't indicate anything but that the club exists"--every club is linked to on the clubs page, but no other had a story on the front page. Penn Art Club embodies a novel movement, an intellectual progression towards academic freedom in the sense that, indeed, universities not only produce knowledge and truth, but also contribute to the health of democracy.

<dd><b>Comment</b> This contest was always going to take place at some point in the future. That was never an issue. The problem is, this article assumes the leadership contest will take place in 2007. Tony Blair has said the he will step down in the next 12 months. Now, he could either a) Step down tomorrow. This would mean that the leadership election would take place in 2006, or b) decide to continue on as PM. He has said he will only resign if the timing is right for the country. Therefore, he still could remain Labour party leader after 2007. And that is the problem with looking into the crystal ball. If the page could be moved to a name like, Upcoming Labour Party (UK) leadership election, a lot of problems with crystal balling would be solved. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Th</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_Esperanza_d8f6.html" title="User:The Halo/Esperanza"><font color="green">ε</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Halo</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Halo_8994.html" title="User talk:The Halo"><b>Θ</b></a></sup> 17:01, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't think there's anything gained by moving it to another name. If the date changes, then the article can change to reflect that.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, and the article will contain too much crystal-ballism until we have a set date and more than one announced candidate. I also point to the entry for 26 July 2007 under 'future milestones as to why.

<li>Indeed. In particular, it states "Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place", and both of these criteria are clearly met. It also says "Individual items from a predetermined list or a systematic pattern of names, preassigned to future events or discoveries, are not suitable article topics", and it is not such a thing. Finally it states "Articles that present extrapolation, speculation, and "future history" are original research and...inappropriate", but it does not present those things: it merely states the dates which have either been put forward or been speculated about by politicians or the media; there is no original research. OK, saying "The last day of Tony Blair as Prime Minister" doesn't conform to the conditions, but that's just an anomolous statement which needs rewording, and is unrepresentative of the rest of the artcle, so certainly isn't cause for its deletion.<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreg_Stevens_51c4.html" title="User:Greg Stevens">Greg Stevens</a> 20:58, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sure, individual sentences can be excised, but that's not really an issue for AfD. Otherwise, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> goes out of it's way to say <i>Events widely anticipated and at least somewhat planned for are not violations of Crystal Ball</i>.

It is also sad that just because 'established' Wikipedians don't recognize it, it should be deleted. Furthermore, having been coined within the year is hardly a reason to delete it. Is there a law that states "all laws coined within a year are not laws?" Maybe there should be. I'll call it theprez98's law.

Two years ago, "9/11: The Road to Tyranny," a real documentary by Alex Jones, had most of the "facts" Moore uses in his scatter-shot diatribe. Jones, who is less interested in making money than the self-aggrandizing Moore, released his film for free on his Web site www.infowars.com, where it drew legions of new fans, including producer Curt Johnson, who is hiring Jones as a consultant on a political action thriller titled "Wake Up."</i> "road to tyranny" has 153 hits, although the majority are not Jones related. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalwatch_8ce9.html" title="User:Calwatch">Calwatch</a> 07:04, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Edit</b> - Peephole...why am I not surprised? Sorry if you don't believe in a world where there are men out there who want to threaten the population and go so far as to kill for their own slice of power. Anyways, the article needs a few more citations, clean-up on the table of contents, and expansion to the External Links section. Other than that, if it's publically available and can be cited beyond the original publisher, then it's okay. Also, it must be POV to be deleting films made by Alex Jones; I'm seeing articles of two other films of his that aren't being considered for deletion, and yet they have less content than this article. Now, how hypocritical is that? I say edit first, then decide to keep it or not.

<dd>While I appreciate Marc Shepherd´s comments very much, I must quite respectfully disagree with a few of his assertions. While not as notable as some, I have enjoyed some public success as a recorded composer, and my CD is commercially available. Additionally I have been critically well reviewed by legitimate publications (American Record guide, Tampa Tribune, Allentown Morning Call). Mr. Shepherd´s assertion that the pages were repeatedly BLANKED were simply due to me trying to start over in order to get the article right. I didn´t know this was a violation of policy. Lastly, it is untrue that there are no verifiable sources, as other users were able to create links to outside sources jordanwaring 15:20 7 September 2006</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately many of the articles about me and about the music are available online in ARCHIVE form only. I have copied the review from the August 8th 1998 edition of the <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tampa_Tribune_99da.html" title="Tampa Tribune">Tampa Tribune</a>. I would also submit that not only should this article not be deleted, but additionally should not be considered autobiographical, since I did not write the majority of the things there, only copied and pasted it into wiki. The fact that I entered it doesn´t necessarily mean it´s autobiographical.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is from the Tampa Tribune, by Kurt Loft, 8 August 1998</p>
<p>"Here's a look at a handful of other important new recordings, all of which should be available or can be ordered from book and record stores:</p>
<p>Christobal de Morales, "Missa pro Defunctis," Gabrieli Consort directed by Paul McCreesh (Deutsche Grammophon Archive). A 16th century Spanish priest and singer at the Sistine Chapel, Morales made important contributions to the liturgy for the dead and developed a fluid, intoxicating style capable of lulling any listener to a higher plane. His Requiem for Philip II is an hourlong tour de force in 15 sections, and its bold clarity alone influenced other composers well into the high Baroque. Anchoring the disc is Alonso Lobo's short but hauntingly beautiful "Motectum," which disarms criticism.</p>
<p>Jordan Waring, "Tears of Sarajevo," Piano Concerto, "Mountains of Tolima," Moravska Philharmonic under the direction of Nicolas Smith (MMC Recordings). Born in New York in 1964, this young composer-stockbroker shows tremendous promise as a member of the so-called neo-Romantic school of tonality and a solid grasp of large-scale structure. Better yet, here's a composer writing about contemporary issues, in this case, the war in Bosnia. Dedicated to the victims of that country's holocaust, "Tears of Sarajevo" is plaintive, introspective and a candidate for live performance in concert halls.</p>

<p>This is a Wikipedia article about a specific (albeit irritating) class of computer bugs. No seriously catastrophic bugs have been placed in this category, and while compiler bugs are one of the subtlest and most diffuclt to debug nuances of programming, they are not significant enough to warrant a page on Wikipedia. The article is linked from no mainspace pages as of this writing, and its one link is from, ironically, a list of orphaned pages.

<p>The result was <b>delete.</b> Debate-wise, the delete arguments have gone relatively unanswered except for Servand's, but Servand's comment seems to suggest that Lyon's <i>websites</i> are notable, not Lyon himself.

<li><b>Keep</b>, This is a notable entry, and I believe there's a bit of a conspiracy to delete the article. First, the person who orginated this vote for deletion falsely says that the article is self-promotion. Mark Lyon didn't originate the article, nor edit it. He suggested things to add in the discussion, which is proper. Then, he votes for his own article to be deleted, probably because he doesn't want the publicity, and that's not a reason for deletion. In fact, that's so out of the ordinary that it's suspect.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) Has the subject won one of 8 <i>American</i> awards. Can the editor please give the names of the <i>Japanese equivalents</i> to these American ones, and show how he searched to show that the model has won none of these?</dd>
<dd>2) Has the performer been a Playboy Playmate? Japan has a Playboy, has the editor checked all these?</dd>
<dd>3) "Performer has made unique, noteworthy contributions to his or her field." A subjective criteria. How has the editor determined this model does not pass this?</dd>
<dd>4) "Performer has been successful in crossing over into other fields" Many of these Japanese AV actresses appear in mainstream media, television, radio, musical CDs, etc. Has the editor checked the model's career for evidence of this, or the lack thereof?</dd>
<dd>5) "Performer has been the subject of a noteworthy news piece or controversy" What media outlets has the editor checked to confirm the model does not pass this test?</dd>
<dd>6) "Performer has appeared multiple times in notable mainstream media outlets" See #4 above.</dd>
<dd>7) "Performer has been notable or prolific within a specific genre niche." What Japanese database has the editor searched?</dd>
<dd>and finally:</dd>
<dd>8) "Performer has been in 100 or more movies (resource: <a href="http://www.iafd.com" class="external text" title="http://www.iafd.com" rel="nofollow">iafd.com</a>)." This is apparently a good and thorough database for <i>American</i> adult performers. I have searched even the most well-known of Japanese performers and found not <i>one</i> hit. The editor claims Japanese performers must pass <i>this</i> test, or <i>the Japanese equivalent</i>. Please show us the Japanese equivalent of this database, as I have some interest in the subject and could really use a great resource like this. In lieu of such a useful database, I have been using a mainstream Amazon search. Unlike her American counterparts, this model shows a strong presence here.</dd>
<dd>Now, if there are no Japanese equivalents to the above tests, the the editor has made a statement in bad faith, and the <i>proposed American</i> test <i>cannot</i> apply to Japanese models, because of the vast differences in the industries, the cultures, and the availability of easily-searched databases.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> A quick Google search turns up nothing notable in terms of mainstream work, awards, or magazines, in Japan. The question remains - how is the actress notable? The number of Google hits is an invalid test, and an arbitrarily assigned number of DVDs, like "24 DVDs" or "35 DVDs" is no grounds for a notability criteria when <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> says 100, and there is no special test just for Japanese porn actresses specifically. The only tests we have are <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>. Now, this article has already been through an AfD (result was Delete) and also a Deletion Review, yet nothing notable has been found on the actress. It's time to delete the article. All of the assertions made for keeping the article had not been valid and verifiable evidence that she's actually notable. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 18:48, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

As for your specific argument, I would point out that there are not 490,000 Google results for her Japanese name: there are 490,000 <i>estimated</i> results. Note that this translates into just 421 unique results when you try to view them all. Observe how these figures can be used as an argument for or against keeping the article!

<li>Thanks for the advice, Haeleth. I will try to follow that, as I have been trying, with considerable difficulty, with this editor. My belief is that Wikipedia's rules and procedures are put in place for us all to follow, in order to maintain a productive environment-- not as weapons to be used against other editors, but followed at one's own whim. As for the straw-man Google argument, once again, I did not bring it up.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Actually, I'm trying to be culturally lenient to the fact that this porn actress, and others as well, are Japanese. The only tests we have for notability are <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>. If you wish to invalidate a Japanese equivalent of <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>, we can always directly apply the test instead. Unfortunately, <i>there is no other tests for notability</i>, and this actress would fail both <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> if directly applied. Some editors won't even use <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> because it's a proposed test. Being Japanese doesn't mean that automatically guarantees a person an article. Japanese people can still be non-notable, and throughout all the discussions, no evidence of verifiable notability has been shown for this particular person. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 20:54, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The 100-film notability test is given at <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> with a database clearly designed for the <i>American</i> adult industry. As far as I can tell, there is no comparable database for Japanese adult industry, nor are there awards comparable to the American ones listed. It's a different country, a different culture and a vastly different industry, it requires different notability criteria. In lieu of an imagined, comprehensive database of the Japanese adult industry comparable to the one given at <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>, I searched the global, mainstream outlet, Amazon, and found 19 DVDs and 7 VHS tapes for <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/503-7893750-4147133?__mk_ja_JP=%83J%83%5E%83J%83i&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=%89%C1%93%A1%82%E4%82%E8%82%A0&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/503-7893750-4147133?__mk_ja_JP=%83J%83%5E%83J%83i&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=%89%C1%93%A1%82%E4%82%E8%82%A0&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" rel="nofollow">加藤ゆりあ</a> (Yuria Katou) listed there. Models who have shown similar levels of notability (see: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Shoko_Goto_ae72.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shoko Goto">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shoko Goto</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hikaru_Koto_2_c0f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hikaru Koto 2">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hikaru Koto 2</a>) have recently failed AfD nominations. For a comparison on an American adult entertainer, I searched <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traci_Lords_8a29.html" title="Traci Lords">Traci Lords</a> at Amazon, and found a grand total of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/104-4171786-9975109?url=search-alias%3Ddvd&amp;field-keywords=%22Tracy+Lords%22" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/104-4171786-9975109?url=search-alias%3Ddvd&amp;field-keywords=%22Tracy+Lords%22" rel="nofollow">0 DVDs</a>. Yuria Katou is more visible at a mainstream Japanese outlet than Traci Lords is at an American one. Does this make Traci Lords non-notable? I have very little interest or knowledge in the American adult industry, but even I have heard of her. Japan and the United States are different countries with very different cultures. To strictly apply a test clearly designed for the American adult industry to models of other countries is to promote cultural bias and/or censorship at Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 22:26, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Traci Lords is not exactly a good comparison. She was a big part of a child pornography controversy in the U.S., and articles like <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/actors/traci-lords/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/actors/traci-lords/" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> can be found easily on the web. If there's a Japanese porn actress that's a big part of a Japanese national child pornography controversy, you'd be damn right she would be notable enough. The question for <i>this</i> particular porn actress remains - <b>how is she notable?</b> And is the evidence verifiable? What makes 19 DVDs notable? Does a Japanese porn actress with <i>18 DVDs</i> mean she's not notable then? How about <i>17 DVDs</i>? We have no criteria here. We only have <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>. So where is the threshold for notability of Japanese porn actresses if we do not use these tests or the Japanese equivalents of these tests? Until some specialised notability test is set up for Japanese porn actresses, <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">User:Dekkappai</a>'s reasoning here would mean every single non-notable Japanese actress deserves an article. I totally understand that Japanese people's notability can't be measured with American media outlets, but throughout this AfD, the first AfD, and the deletion review, the question has not been answered - how is this person verifiably notable? She's notable because she has 19 DVDs listed on Amazon...? Japanese or not, who made up that rule? If she is not notable, then the article should be deleted. It's very simple. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 04:11, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as per above comments. Frankly I'm getting pretty annoyed at the systemic bias towards US-related subjects around here. You cannot generalise criteria for American porn actresses to Japanese ones, especially with things like "awards" which don't necessarily have ANY equivalence whatsoever elsewhere in the world. If the American Porn Association sent American porn actresses an amount of golden donkey statues every year based on their fame and importance, would we delete porn actresses from every other country in the world because none of them have received a single golden donkey?

<li><b>Comment</b> - Then I ask again, what <i>does</i> make her notable? How does "19 DVDs" on Amazon make her notable? What if a Japanese porn star has <i>18 DVDs</i>? <i>17 DVDs</i>?

<li><b>Comment</b> - First off, the proposed PORNBIO guideline is culturally biased, because not all cultures treat their "porn stars" in the same way. In the US, you would be hard pressed to find Traci Lords or other names in mainstream retail outlets like Amazon. In Japan, there is not such a distinction. What makes her notable is the same thing that makes other actors or models notable. Namely (from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>):
<ul>
<li>Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions. Notability can be determined by:
<ul>
<li>Multiple features in popular culture publications such as Vogue, GQ, Elle, FHM or national newspapers</li>
<li>A large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following</li>
<li>An independent biography</li>
<li>Name recognition</li>
<li>Commercial endorsements</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So, the fact that there is multiple DVDs on sale at mainstream outlets with her name in the title qualifies her for notability in my book, no matter the type of movies, and no matter the classification as a "porn star". <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 22:46, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I'm undecided at this point, but the term "Design Classic" appears to be a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a> ripped from "Phaidon Design Classics". From the talk page it appears this originated as an attempt to reprint the Phaidon Design Classics list here, which in my opinion is a completely unacceptable concept. Still, there are other entries in this list that have different sources, but most of this list is completely unsourced and I think the criteria is weak and arbitrary. If kept, at minimum it needs a move to a better namespace and some good hard editing and sourcing.

<li><b>Comment</b> If its being kept, it requires some heavy editing and citations. Ought to be renamed- "design classics" is too open to POV and bias. No parameters for evealuating if a product is a "classic" or not Amsi 08:59, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> In response to the article's title being taken from Phaidon's Design Classic this isn't so. The article was created in 2002 (not by me) but Phaidon's book wasn't published until April 2006. The only reason there are so many refferences to Phadon's book is because a few weeks ago someone posted a template requesting sources. I went through the list quickly one day and tried to cite sources for some of the objects and Phaidons book was the main refference book I had to hand - but I also cited sources to the BBC/The Design Museum and MoMA. I dont have a lot of time I can give to Wikipedia, so the "citing" is not technically perfect but I really do think the article should stay. I am the one who was proposing a Wikipedia version of Phaidon's book but I did not mean to do it here with this article. I meant some kind of portal.I believe if I had the time (and broadband) I could find more varied sources to cite. The article needs a lot of work but I dont think thats a good enough reason to delete it. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrounce_e433.html" title="User:Trounce">Trounce</a> 18:32, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Almost uncontestably strong keep</b>: I had great fun writing this article and I have great fun on Wikipedia; deleting this entry would just make me cry. To be perfectly honest, I didn't understand the policies of verifiability or notability, however since reading them I now see that the article probably has little reason for being here and I apologise for wasting your respective times with it. I don't see, however, what harm it is doing; it isn't misleading or advertising, it's not a vanity page and I think it's just a rather nicely written article about a gaming clan. I would suggest that if almost no gaming clans are notable - and there are some notable clans out there - then perhaps the rule is flawed. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELorD_2121.html" title="User:LorD">LorD</a> 20.18, 7 September 2006 (BST).</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I forgot no such thing, I was highlighting how meaningless it is to say 'we have no rules... except for these ones, but otherwise we have no rules. No rules whatsoever... Except those ones over there.' Fifth pillar just there to make up numbers, is it? The mainstream image that Wikipedia has is that it's a vast source of mostly-inaccurate information on almost any subject. It's a given that there will be inaccuracies, people accept that about a print encyclopaedia, they are more likely to accept that about an online encyclopaedia, especially one whose sources are the online version of the tabloids. It's going to be inaccurate throughout its entire existence owing to its nature; on one side you could have an article on <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet_Shop_Boys_772d.html" title="Pet Shop Boys">Pet Shop Boys</a> telling of how they were slating <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robbie_Williams_6008.html" title="Robbie Williams">Robbie Williams</a> for not being able to concentrate while recording in the studio for his new album, <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudebox_%28album%29.html" title="Rudebox (album)">Rudebox</a> and you could cite Victoria Newton's column in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sun_e3a1.html" title="The Sun">The Sun</a> as the source, but then you could cite the <a href="http://www.petshopboys.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.petshopboys.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Pet Shop Boys site</a> as the source vehemntly denying this claim. Where subjectivity comes in is if you're a fan of Victoria Newton or if you're <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobic</a> and choose sleazy <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabloid.html" title="Tabloid">tabloid</a> 'journalists' over <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_relations.html" title="Public relations">PR</a>-concerned artists. Someone will always believe one side and someone else will always believe the other, thus such a project like Wikipedia is fundamentally flawed in the aspect of accuracy. Where you could let people help out is to fill in the gaps of subject matter; "...information on almost any subject". It doesn't have to be almost. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELorD_2121.html" title="User:LorD">LorD</a> 12.51, 9 September 2006.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Yes, there are plenty of list articles. But the list articles that exist generally either don't duplicate categories, or add some value that the category doesn't. For example, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ERP_vendors_f205.html" title="List of ERP vendors">List of ERP vendors</a> at least attempts to add value beyond what a category would provide, since it sorts the vendors by sales volume. (It lacks data for many vendors and doesn't cite its sources, but at least it's trying.) The other common reason to use a list as opposed to a category is to allow external links or redlinks to be included in the list. But since the editors watching the previous version of this article took a very hard line against allowing such links to be included (since they were often spam), that justification went away too. We're not judging the value of lists as a class; we're judging the value of <i>this</i> list in particular, and it simply doesn't give the reader any value that <a href="../../../c/u/s/Customer_relationship_management.html" title="Customer relationship management">Customer relationship management</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/m/Category%7ECRM_software_660f.html" title="Category:CRM software">Category:CRM software</a> doesn't already supply. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 15:06, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or change it's definition: As long as this is only an alphabetic list, there is hardly any added value compared to a category. If the list gets another ordering criterium like for example revenue or market share, I could see value in it. And yes, it <i>was</i> a spam magnet before. But one other point to consider: I've created those list articles at times myself to relief the main article from the spam pressure. This often resulted in fewer changes to the main article which could then be better reviewed compared to ignoring changes to an article because one knows it's probably just spam again. This might be a reason to keep it. --S.K. 09:36, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as advertising. Looking at the contributions for user:SCM, the author of this article, they're all Merck-related ads. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=SCM" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=SCM" rel="nofollow">For instance</a>, SCM puts in a link in a healthcare article for "Your Health Now" magazine, which turns out to be a Merck publication. And of course adding "Your Health Now" to a list of health magazines. Getting back to the article proper. no notability stated or implied. Also something odd turned up in Google: I was initially impressed by 141,000 Ghits, but only three pages of <b>22</b> distinct listings. It turns out there's a lot of press releases out about MerckSource, and that's basically it. Yeah, this is a new service, but that's also the point: WP is not a newspaper, nor a free webhost, nor is this the place to become well-known. At best, merge into a the general Merck article. Subject fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for lacking multiple non-trivial third-party articles (I don't count articles which merely link to MerckSource, as mostly noted above - the articles have to be about the subject). <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 17:51, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Possible Indirect Advert</b>
<p>My concern with this page is not that MerckSource should not be mentioned anywhere on Wikipedia, but that the way it is presented may lead to people thinking that MerckSource is an independent website and will give unbiased information, see quote from MerckSource page:</p>
<p><i>MerckSource is non-promotional and written and edited by third-party medical professionals. The site was launched in 2002 and has received several awards.</i></p>
<p>This is saying that MerckSource is excellent basically, and that it can be trusted.</p>
<p>The problem is that it is well known that big Pharma (Drug Companies such as Merck) use general or specific websites as well as patient groups to 'advertise products'. E.g. even on the MerckSource page it has a link to Merck's homepage. And the methods used are often quite subtle - e.g. there is nothing obviously wrong with the MerckSource website - it does not directly advertise Merck products but it does have links to Merck sites including Merck Product Info (even though there is a disclaimer). If I was to advise a patient who wanted to use such a website I would say okay but take care because you may find yourself getting linked to less neutral websites.</p>
<p>I suggest, that if there is nothing particulary special about MerckSource, that the majoirty of Drug Information websites supported by Pharma are listed on their own page of Wikipedia - and written in factual unbiased terms so that the user can choose which site to use if any.</p>
<p>Wikipedia does not want to become a tool of Pharma, but equally Pharma and its websites need to be fairly laided out in Wikipedia.</p>

Any magician that aims to deceive their audience will run out of audiences pretty quickly. And to top it all off the bottom of the article contains various links to commercial websites (2 for each effect). It's obsolete with <a href="../../../c/a/r/Card_manipulation.html" title="Card manipulation">card manipulation</a> which focusses on the art as a whole rather than how one particular person views it.

But here, I did a search for Cyrillic Zujanje - <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%D0%B7%D1%83%D1%98%D0%B0%D1%9A%D0%B5" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%D0%B7%D1%83%D1%98%D0%B0%D1%9A%D0%B5" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>. 221 hits, and all of them referring to people complaining to buzzing in their ears or asking for computer advice with buzzing in their computers. Serbian users generally use latin alphabet on internet, especially in forums and similar communities. Now, if this were an article on some obscure Serbian word, or something similar, the argument might would hold water. BUT, this <i>is</i> an internet website so Google and alexa are applicable in this case irrelevant of the language used. There are many much more notable and well known web forums in Serbia than Zujanje. Here are a few examples: EliteSecurity (very big computer oriented forum, deleted as uncontested prod, alexa rating 8292), Serbian Cafe (alexa rating 6348), Benchmark.co.yu (hardware site and forums, alexa rating 22329), Burek.co.yu (general community, alexa rating 16493). Also, look at <a href="http://www.top-sites-list.com/main.php?country=YU" class="external text" title="http://www.top-sites-list.com/main.php?country=YU" rel="nofollow">top sites per country, Serbia</a>. I'm not sure which is really biggest of these several forums (ok, benchmark is not for sure), but I'm sure Zujanje is not among the top 100, and it has no other claims to notability.Lets look at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. 1) Nope, Zujanje is subject of no independent sources (InfoStud and ETF are not independent). 2) Nope, no award whatsoever. 3) Nope, its distributed by InfoStud which is also not notable. Also, let me quote WP:WEB 'The article itself must provide proof that its subject meets one of these criteria via in-lined links or a "Reference" or "External link" section.'. This article doesn't have any assertion of notability, much less actual proofs. Also, you might want to read <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle G/On notability</a> for why is Notability important. So, if you want to <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">counter Systemic Bias</a> feel free to create articles on those websites I quoted and leave Zujanje for when its at least marginally notable.

<li><b>Reply</b> Atheist hindus is completely a misleading heading, Just emphasising atheists as infidels. We are talking about philosophies here, not personal views. You may say samkhya to be a non-hindu philosophy, but all scholars define it as a Hindu philosophy <i>(with no exception)</i>. And even if you read a three line text about Samkhya anywhere(reliable), you will come to a statement that Samkhya was a atheistic philosophy.<a href="../../../n/i/d/User%7ENidhishsinghal_5350.html" title="User:Nidhishsinghal">nids</a><a href="../../../n/i/d/User_talk%7ENidhishsinghal_a3a7.html" title="User talk:Nidhishsinghal">(♂)</a> 18:44, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for the above reply. So now, atleast i will not have to fight to define it as an hindu philosophy. You can check hinduism archives, there were a few users who contested this claim by saying that this is an extinct philosophy and does not have any contemporary followers.

<dd>Dear Sandstein, atheism in religion may be a contradiction in Abrahamic religions which are bound to what their books say. Hinduism is like science. Views are not put forth or discarded summarily. If science puts forth the idea of multi-verse or strings, it is considered without bias by other scientists. Scientists who cannot keep their biases separate from research are no scientists. The same thing happens in Hinduism. The guiding factor is the search for truth. If this search leads someone to discard the theory of a creator God, that is perfectly alright. Hinduism is more than just God. Family, society, and traditions also are important. There is nothing political about the search for truth. Yes, Samkhya, Vaisesika, and Purva Mimamsa are atheistic, there is nothing supernatural about them, this was the belief of those people, just as much valid as anybody else's. <a href="../../../a/u/p/User%7EAupmanyav_8378.html" title="User:Aupmanyav">Aupmanyav</a> 05:44, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Let me further elaborate why I think a Hindu atheist is possible. I believe a Hindu can be described as a member of a cultural group. Growing up in a Hindu family, I identify with many aspects of the culture and philosphy. I even participate in communal religious rituals such as <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durga_Puja_198d.html" title="Durga Puja">Durga Puja</a> which I identify with wholly on a cultural level. I do not believe in the deities themselves. Further, if Jews can claim a term "atheist Jew" on the grounds of lineage and culture, how is it that I cannot when I belong within the purvey of the caste system which is also hereditary and part of practical Hindu culture?--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntorjal_c04f.html" title="User:Antorjal">Antorjal</a> 04:10, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let me also add that in that sense, it is hard to be an "atheist" without the tag "Hindu atheist" if one is from a Hindu family and one resides in India. Such a person is constantly evaluated on the basis of their caste, their food habits, and their place in the social and cultural hierarchy, which for such a person is predominantly Hindu. Even by my not being a believer, had to perform certain rituals at my grandmother's cremation because it was expected of me at a cultural level. No one cared what I believed or if I believed in the deites themselves. I am not taking a POV on this, only a dispassionate view of a fact.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntorjal_c04f.html" title="User:Antorjal">Antorjal</a> 04:19, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"In some ways people had got used to the idea that India was spiritual and religion-oriented. That gave a leg up to the religious interpretation of India, despite the fact that Sanskrit had a larger atheistic literature than exists in any other classical language. Even within the Hindu tradition, there are many people who were atheist. Madhava Acharya, the remarkable 14th century philosopher, wrote this rather great book called Sarvadarshansamgraha, which discussed all the religious schools of thought within the Hindu structure. The first chapter is "Atheism" - a very strong presentation of the argument in favor of atheism and materialism."<a href="http://www.alumni.berkeley.edu/calmag/200607/sen.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alumni.berkeley.edu/calmag/200607/sen.asp" rel="nofollow">[58]</a></dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b> The article you quoted is of five pages. Have <i>you</i> gone through the entire thing? Where in the article does he say Atheism has been always a part of Hinduism? I once again went through it. He talks about "Indian culture" throughout. His observations may or may not be in line with the beliefs of present-day Hindus, that is a different issue. "<i>Sen believes Hindu nationalists (and American "clash of civilizations" theorists) distort India's history with their singular focus on the Hindu tradition, a theme he again takes up in Identity and Violence</i>" Therefore he is in favour of removing the "singular focus" on "Hindu tradition" and favours atheist/ other views too. But how is this a source for Atheism in Hinduism, as this needs to be in Atheism in India? <sup>Babub</sup>→<a href="../../../b/a/b/User_talk%7EBabub_afb5.html" title="User talk:Babub"><font color="DarkBlue">Talk</font></a> 15:13, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Hinduism is not simply a religion in the conventional sense of the word. There is scope for agnostism and athism while being a Hindu. In the <i>Wonder that was India</i>, Prof Basham details a Hindu sect that practiced athism. - <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenu62_2094.html" title="User:Venu62">Parthi</a> 04:06, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - There are two aspects of question. (1) Whether there was any atheism in Hinduism in history. This question may be debated. The Atheist Hindus will clearly find it in the Darshanas. The Theist Hindus will fail to see any evidence. But there is a second angle also. (2) Hinduism is not an Abrahamic religion which is limited by what is written in a book or has been declared as truth by a representative of God. It is an evolving religion. At one time we were worshipping local Bhairavas and Kshetrapalas, then we were worshipping Vishnu, Shiva, and Shakti, we were joined by people who were worshipping Indra, Varun, Surya, and Agni. Sri Adi Sankaracharya believed all-inclusive Brahman, Sri Madhvacharya informed us that God and jiva are essentially different, Sri Ramanujacharya said that in special conditions God and Jiva are same, Sri Nimbarkacharya said God and Jiva are separate as well as different. We revere all these Acharyas and also the writers of verses in the Vedas and the Darshanas. Hindu Atheists of today may or may not believe in the existence of a Brahman, may or may not believe in a God creator. The controversy is as old as the Nasadeeya Sukta. Please explain, how any one can fetter our Hinduism into believing this or that. That is our birth-right. We go by what Valmiki made Rama say in his Ramayana: 'Satyam eva eeshvaro loke, satyam padmaa samaashritaa; satyamoolaani sarvaani, satyaan naasti param padam.' (Truth alone is god in this world, all virtues are established in truth; all are rooted in truth, there is nothing higher than truth.) <a href="../../../a/u/p/User%7EAupmanyav_8378.html" title="User:Aupmanyav">Aupmanyav</a> 05:29, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dear friend Babub, I am not being emotional. I am explaining a basic principle of Hinduism so that it does not become an Abrahamic religion. Hinduism is a multicolored tapestry and at least, I am proud of it. It is the only religion (even Buddhism has its own prejudices) in the world which is that brave. Had it fettered my search for truth in anyway, I would perhaps not have been a hindu. It is possible that in the days to come there would be more people like me. Keep the article wherever you want, but asking for its deletion would not be fair to Hinduism.

<dd>Aup, I appreciate, as a Brahmana that you perform the duties required of you. I totally agree that our tradition empahsises solely on karmas, rather than "philosophy" as such. And this means that one can have any philosophy one wants but should do the karmas. This is basically the philosophy of the Gita. <sup>Babub</sup>→<a href="../../../b/a/b/User_talk%7EBabub_afb5.html" title="User talk:Babub"><font color="DarkBlue">Talk</font></a> 11:58, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, obviously. In reference to DaGizza's comment above, to say that none of the modern cultural side of Hinduism has any traces of atheism is incorrect if one chooses to define Hinduism as some people do, which is a belief in the accuracy of a way of thought or pattern of inquiry, rather than of a single set of beliefs and strictures. I quote the first line of WP's article on religion: <i>Religion is a system of social coherence based on a common group of beliefs or attitudes concerning an object, person, unseen being, or system of thought considered to be supernatural, sacred, divine or highest truth, and the moral codes, practices, values, institutions, and rituals associated with such belief or system of thought.</i> . It should be clear that Hinduism,including monotheistic, polytheistic, atheistic, and even "whatever, dude" agnosticism, can be defined, even today -perhaps especially today - as an (a) socially coherent (b) a common group of beliefs in a system of thought considered to be the highest truth and (c)morality and institutions associated with that system of thought. This is more than abstruse philosophy, it is a central question about self-identification. If I choose to say I am both an atheist and a Hindu, and also have historical precedents for my beliefs going back as far as anything in Hinduism, it ceases to be philosophy and becomes practice. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 06:16, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>DO NOT DELETE</b></s> Now, could you define notable for me? As far as i am concerned both these lawyers are extremely notable. Just being involved with Pan and/or HIH seems quite notable to me! I'm not sure if you are familiar with how the law and lawyers work, but whilst a case is being solved etc. the people aren't famous until the case is solved. In this case though they are already famous, so after the trial is adjourned you will already have an entry.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Peapea (<a href="../../../p/e/a/User_talk%7EPeapea_107b.html" title="User talk:Peapea">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Peapea_cdd0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Peapea">contribs</a>) .</small>

<p>Mayor of a town with &lt;7000 inhabitants. Not notable enough for separate article. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../d/j/b/User%7EDjbrianuk_0376.html" title="User:Djbrianuk">exolon</a> 19:27, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>VERY strong keep</b> it is a hugely important town, it is a regional upscale shopping and entertainment area surrounded by massive oakland and famous berkeley, it is home to dozens of global pharmaceutical companies and also pixar animation studios, its like saying santa monica's mayor is not imporant.

<li>Also this isn't a debate about whether the <i>town</i> is notable, it clearly is and it has it's own article which is fine.

<li><b>comment</b> emeryville is not a small down, its population is actually closer to 15,000 right now, its had a ginormous boom in development and high rises, its not rural its urban, its right in the middle of the urban core of the san francisco bay, surrounded by oakland. there are way less important people that have articles, this is legitimate and frankly i believe that she qualifies as notable un wp guidelines<a href="../../../q/r/c/User%7EQrc2006_905d.html" title="User:Qrc2006">Qrc2006</a> 23:37, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The fact that there may be less notable people with articles is never a legitimate argument. If you find any, please feel free to nominate them for AFD. A mayor that only gets about 500 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Ruth+Atkin%22+mayor" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Ruth+Atkin%22+mayor" rel="nofollow">ghits</a> doesn't strike me as notable. <a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDipics_9566.html" title="User:Dipics">Dipics</a> 23:51, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This person just does not pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. She is not a "Political figure holding international, national or statewide/provincewide office or members of a national, state or provincial legislature." Nor is she a "Major local political figure who receive (or received) significant press coverage" (she has received next to none). Ask yourself, if she was not the CURRENT mayor, would anyone have tried to list her? My bet, only if they were a friend or relative. I see no former mayors of this town listed on Wikipedia. Hence she easily fails the 100 year test also. <a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDipics_9566.html" title="User:Dipics">Dipics</a> 11:59, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I'm not sure why people refuse to acknowledge that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a guideline that represents a consensus. This person clearly does not meet the criteria. While there are indeed 500 ghits, it's only 148 unique hits, many of which are lists of mayors, lists of homosexual mayors or list of people involved in this or that project/charity/group neither of which constitute non-trivial independent media coverage. Ruth Atkin looks like a fine individual no doubt but the failure to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is pretty clear and there is nothing suggesting that the guideline should not be applied in this case. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 14:31, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

As <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> might attest, I am a strong proponent of inclusion in Wikipedia. Reading the discussion page on the article, it seems that Brunnock and Dannyfloyd had a perfectly civil exchange about providing substantiation. I think preserving regionalisms is an important mission and this could well fall within that concept. I am particulary sensitve to the idea that not all verification need come from Google. After all, 'Wikipedia is not Google' suggests that we be open to non-gogglable evidence. For those of you who did research in the B.G. (before google) age you know that this can take time. So I wonder what percipitated this action.</li>

<p>On the other hand, I think claims of malice deserve a strong response and should be accorded the benefit of the doubt. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> stated that the Nom 'makes a good argument for malice.' Am I missing something? I mean this quite sincerely. Is there a link with further evidence and a fuller claim? Please point it out to me. All I have seen is the the claim at the top of this page. It asserts malice and asserts sockpuppetry. I will gladly change my vote to Strong Speedy Delete if <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrunnock_1109.html" title="User:Brunnock">Sean Brunnock</a> can point to a more concrete reason why <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDannyfloyd_0f23.html" title="User:Dannyfloyd">User:Dannyfloyd</a> is out to smear him. Perhaps he has and I am just missing it.</p>
<p>On the final hand, I would change my vote to a Weak Keep on the basis of a good faith claim by someone that this has some basis in scottish fokelore, although I would prefer that the actual citation be provided.<a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 04:56, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Reply</b> to Jdclevenger's comment about Google. If "Brunnock" was really a notable mythological being from Scottish folklore, instead of something somebody just made up recently, it would certainly be found on Google. By comparison, I found each of the following terms from <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_folklore.html" title="Scottish folklore">Scottish folklore</a> easily on Google: Aos-sídhe, Sìdhichean, and <a href="../../../t/u/a/Tuatha_D%C3%A9_Danann_aecc.html" title="Tuatha Dé Danann">Tuatha Dé Danann</a>. But when I paired each of these terms with "Brunnock," I found no meaningful results (there was a total of one result, which used Brunnock as a county name). I think, in this case, that absence of evidence really is evidence of absence. And by the way, I also looked in Lexis, with no results. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 13:29, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b> to Sean Brunnock. My apologies. You did offer proof about the sockpupperty. While presumably this makes <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDannyfloyd_0f23.html" title="User:Dannyfloyd">User:Dannyfloyd</a>, a Wiki-badguy, it does not itself support your claim of malice (which as I mentioned before I am inclined to give you the benefit of the doubt). The heart of my comment on switching to a strong delete is motive. Do you have reason to believe that <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDannyfloyd_0f23.html" title="User:Dannyfloyd">User:Dannyfloyd</a> is doing this specifically against you? Perhaps I misconstrued the claim, "...smear my name." I took this to assert that the smear is against you personally. To fully support such a charge, I think information about possible motive would help. But perhaps what you meant was that the attack was litterally against your surname, but not directed against you yourself. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 17:08, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b> to <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a>. Thank you for the additional research. But I am prepared to believe that there remain pockets of information about the world that have not yet been googlized or indeed put on the net. The probability of this being the case for scottish fokelore is quite low of course, and presumably much lower than for regions such as, e.g. the Amazon, outer China, or central Africa although no doubt this is rapidally changing. Is this probability low enough to cast doubt on the article? Of course. But if there were not a charge of malice, my inclination would still be a week keep, at least for a "sufficent" period time to provide some kind of citation. My basic epistemolgoical constitution is such that I will always be highly skeptical of claims that absence of evidence is ever evidence of absence. Saddly, I will have to become less skeptical of such claims as the coverage of the net nears totality. It is an interesting side question about how one measures both the sum of verifiable human knowledge and the percentage of that on the net.<a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 17:08, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Way too much information to deal with. Once this forked article gets knifed, you could work on improving the real article, if you're of a mind to. However, if you look at the way Broodlinger immediately came in as an attack dog, it was <i>he</i> who violated the rules of conduct, not us... as do most of the hoax writers (many of whom appear to be sockpuppets of each other and/or singularly obsessed with that one article). <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 12:04, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I agree, hoax writers are not attractive&#160;:-). Ok, sorry, I didn't wish to hurt you. I just wish to say, that more accurate dealing with these hoax writers may be more effective than blind deletion. As for the article itself, I don't mind too much about the subject (I suppose it's more useful to spend time on more productive articles about moon landings), but maybe I will look at this article too. <a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrbug_126b.html" title="User:Drbug">D<b>r</b> B<b>u</b>g <i>(Vladimir V.

<dd>It was risky, but obviously it wasn't too risky. So what if the USSR spent only $6 billion on their moon program?

<dd>Nothing (except that with these 6 G$ Russians were close to make a moon landing, and therefore Russian space engineers don't doubt that 30 G$ were quite enough for NASA to make a successfull moon landing).

<li><b>Keep</b> I read Broodlinger`s explanation for this page in the discussion page under "Starting fresh". Makes sense. Wikipedia should have an article about what Moon Hoax Theory is, the different theories, period. For instance there were no crater under the lunar lander and no dust on the landing pads. We do not need a long (and unconvincing if I may say so) explanation on why there should be none in this article. Response to the hoax theory could be done in a separate article, for instance by changing the name of the original "Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations" to "Rebuttal of Moon Hoax Theory". Trying to get consensus on the original "Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations" is not working very well. I am not even trying after seeing how other believers in the hoax are treated. It is like trying to paint a picture, with some trolls laying it on the floor, jumping on it with dirty boots, and giving it back. No, think this page is a better try for Wikipedia.

<dd>The reply of Algr and Wahkeenah illustrate my point in an excellent way. Groundless and rude accusations of me beeing a sockpuppet. Far out reasoning (helicopter??). "There are no hoax theory". Hey Algr, the hoax theory says that pictures of astronauts allegedly on the moon was taken in a studio setting on earth. Anyone expect me to use my free time to achive consensus with rude people you can`t reason with? No, the hoax believers and the Apollo fans just don't get along to well. Apollo fans are in clear majority, and they are making the article of what the hoax theory is about. Their target is not to describe the hoax theory to readers, their target seems to be to discredit the hoax theory. And Wikipedia get an awful article on the subjeckt. No, hoax beliver are better suited to describe the hoax theory, Apollo fans are better suited at criticizing it. There could be a page for both, as described in my comments above.

<dd>Your <i>only</i> "contributions" to wikipedia in your 5 or 6 months have to do with this page, so it is reasonable to conclude that you're a sockpuppet. And it is the hoaxsters who are the rude ones, as they refuse to discuss anything. They constantly rail about the article being "biased", when their real agenda <i>is to present a biased page</i>, giving only their "side" of the story. Or <i>several</i> sides. "The" hoax theory is an incorrect characterization. First, because there are several, not just one; and second, because their only "theory" is their suspicions, because they have no actual evidence, just questions, which can easily be knocked down by explanations that are consistent with science and technology, and within the context of the historical record of Mercury-Gemini-Apollo. That by itself doesn't prove Apollo is true, but it introduces reasonable doubt into the hoaxsters' arguments. The article <i>does</i>, in fact, try to explain what the hoax "theories" are. It <i>does</i> present the claim of some (but not all) hoaxsters that the landing stuff was done in studios on earth <i>despite the lack of any evidence of that claim</i>. If anything, the article gives <i>too much</i> credence to the hoaxster side. The hoaxsters complain about the article, but every suggestion to "improve" it boils down to presenting a one-sided view. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 10:44, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The goal of an article about the hoax theory is to describe it, not judge it. The "Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations" article has lots of arguments against the hoax which may be "original research or unverified claims", something to avoid. If a telescope could show detaljed pictures of the alleged landing sites, that would be dependable and verifiable arguments for the article. But let us avoid "original research or unverified claims", with links to strange hoax-rebuttal internet sites. Axlalta 14:13, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We've tried multiple times to convert it into an article which describes the hoax theories in accordance with the NPOV policies (particularly without giving the hoaxers opinions undue weight and in a similar manner other pseudoscience articles). When we do so, the Apollo-deniers revert it back to the current mess. In any case, this isn't the place to discuss the problems with the "Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations" article, they have no bearing on a blatant PoV fork. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 14:25, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I see from your page that you're sensitive to this issue, understandably so. Several of these user ID's have written <i>only about this subject</i> despite being on here for months. Their phraseology, as well as their approach (making edits without discussion and then turning around and accusing us of same, and generally "stirring the pot" and name-calling, and then whining when the tables are turned) are similar. And their curious lack of righteous indignation when the sockpuppetry subject comes up does nothing to counter the suspicions.

<p>Allegedly an astronomy term, but one that doesn't seem to have a lot of traction. Gogle results showed nothing on the first two pages besides wiki mirrors and linkfarm/textscraping/keyword-spoofing spam sites.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Sometimes a standard Google search isn't the best bet, especially for academic and scientific topics. If you want to stick with Google, a Google Scholar and a Google Book search both reveal that this is indeed a term that is used in astronomy outside of Wikipedia. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=twotino&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en" class="external free" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=twotino&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=twotino&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en</a> and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=twotino&amp;as_brr=0" class="external free" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=twotino&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?q=twotino&amp;as_brr=0</a> are example queries. This term is obviously accepted, if not widely used. But it doesn't have to be widely used to deserve a spot in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Balsam_1bd3.html" title="User:Derek Balsam">Derek Balsam</a> 15:52, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Redirect to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trans-Neptunian_Object_6e23.html" title="Trans-Neptunian Object">Trans-Neptunian Object</a></b>. A search of professional astronomy abstracts on the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html" class="external text" title="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html" rel="nofollow">ADS Abstract Service</a> reveals that the term "twotino" is only used by an E. I. Chiang in three of his first-author paper. A check on the references given by <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Balsam_1bd3.html" title="User:Derek Balsam">Derek Balsam</a>'s searches also turns up nothing but papers by E. I. Chiang. Therefore, I conclude that the term <i>is not</i> in common use within the astronomical community at this time. Moreover, the entry does not add any new information on the topic that could not be covered in the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trans-Neptunian_Object_6e23.html" title="Trans-Neptunian Object">Trans-Neptunian Object</a> category. This should either be deleted or made a redirect. (<a href="../../../c/u/b/Cubewano.html" title="Cubewano">Cubewano</a> also looks suspicious; the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html" class="external text" title="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html" rel="nofollow">ADS Abstract Service</a> only turns up five abstracts, of which only one is from a refereed scientific journal.)

<dl>
<dd>Delete surely isn't the same thing as a redirect (which I don't argue with). If the right thing is a redirect, well, that's a <i>keep</i>, just with new content in the main article and in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trans-Neptunian_Object_6e23.html" title="Trans-Neptunian Object">Trans-Neptunian Object</a>. The term is noteworthy enough to keep in Wikipedia. E. I. Chang had a number of co-authors, too, who also use the term.<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Balsam_1bd3.html" title="User:Derek Balsam">Derek Balsam</a> 19:30, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Could you cite a few non-Chiang papers where the term is used? That would be helpful. George J. Bendo 19:53, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I simply meant that Chiang was not the sole author on those papers. His co-authors obviously agree with the content and wording of their own papers, therefore they also agree to the usage of that term. I agree with you that the term is not <i>widely</i> used, see my original comment above. But it is certainly used by other people than Chiang, for example see Maholtra (<a href="http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/faculty/malhotra_preprints/04-TPF_Darwin.pdf#search=%22twotino%20-%22in%20astronomy%2C%20a%20twotino%22%20-wikipedia%22" class="external free" title="http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/faculty/malhotra_preprints/04-TPF_Darwin.pdf#search=%22twotino%20-%22in%20astronomy%2C%20a%20twotino%22%20-wikipedia%22" rel="nofollow">http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/faculty/malhotra_preprints/04-TPF_Darwin.pdf#search=%22twotino%20-%22in%20astronomy%2C%20a%20twotino%22%20-wikipedia%22</a>) (that is a presentation, not a peer-reviewed paper). Just because it is not widely used does not mean it should be deleted from Wikipedia. The term is notable. There is, as far as I know, no requirement that terms in Wikipedia can't come from papers which are happen to have an author in common. Even non-peer reviewed usages can satisfy the notability requirement. If you think that the term should simply be a redirect, by all means, be bold. But in my opinion a delete would not be proper. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Balsam_1bd3.html" title="User:Derek Balsam">Derek Balsam</a> 20:57, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resonant_TNO_fa8e.html" title="Resonant TNO">resonant TNO</a>. (count as <b>Delete</b>). It appears that the term has not been adopted by other resonance theoreticians (e.g. Malhotra, Nesforny), nor by the most recent and most quoted classification papers (Elliot et al, 2006). We need an article for resonant TNO instead. <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurocommuter_c3bc.html" title="User:Eurocommuter">Eurocommuter</a> 08:49, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>And I should have added that E.I. Chiang co-authored the above mentioned DES survey (Elliot et al 2006). Resonant TNOs are on prominent place there, "Plutinos" are mentioned once, in double quotes! No twotinos. <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurocommuter_c3bc.html" title="User:Eurocommuter">Eurocommuter</a> 09:35, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Redirect</b> to trans-neptunian. There is not enough specific information regarding the characteristics or uniqueness of the twotinos. Whether or not it is a widely accepted term can be discussed within TNO. But since it is just a type of TNO that has a different orbit, a single paragraph in TNO should be enough to cover the existence of and describe what twotinos as well as plutinos. --<a href="../../../e/x/o/User%7EExodio_6f59.html" title="User:Exodio">Exodio</a> 20:13, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd><small>A remark on the good point by Exodio above. Is the orbital resonance the only characteristic? I understand the jury is still out on this. The objects in low- order resonances could have been captured by migrating Neptune (like Pluto-Malhotra). Alternatively, some resonances could prove to have distinctive origin/physical characteristics. Precisely a kind of subject for resonant TNO article.</small></dd>

<p><b>Reason</b>: As per the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Scouting_b499.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Scouting">Wikipedia:WikiProject Scouting</a> general policy of not having articles for organisations smaller than area/county level, I think that this article should be removed.
