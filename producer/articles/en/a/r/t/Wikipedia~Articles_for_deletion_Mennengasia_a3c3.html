<li><b>Comment</b> Apparently, the Farpoint Media podcast is such a world wide phenomenon that "Farpoint Media" gets only 48 unique Google hits, and its web site, farpointmedia.net, has an Alexa ranking of 4,772,307. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 14:59, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, isn't that some deep research you done. Farpoint Media isn't A podcast, but an affilation of podcasts. I'm curious to know what your settings were, my Google of the phrase Farpoint Media returns 630 hits. The more popular individual podcasts are Slice of SciFi, Dragon Page Cover to Cover, and Wingin' It, which all have higher rankings than the umbrella site. I found the show notes to the first reference and I'm adding the link to the main article. By the way, just becuase you haven't heard of it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What's the point of an encyclopedia if it only contains common knowledge? Ultimate ed 18:01, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Definitely this has a place in internet humour and culture, as an example of viral marketing. This is the same principle as the "Snakes On a Plane" internet phenomenom. The buzzwords became so well used, the movie's producers actually went back and filmed extra scenes that used the narration that originated in many podcasts, Michael and Evo's Wingin It being one.Vfrgurrl 012:51, 1 June 2006 (UTC)|'</li>

<dd>You misunderstand. We are a community of editors; that someone has recently arrived and is likely unfamiliar with how Wikipedia works is relevant. It doesn't mean we ignore what they have to say, but knowing that they may have a personal interest in the article helps us understand their point of view. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 01:06, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I apparently didn't save my comment last time, so I'll try it again - I find your comment confusing. Doesn't the fact that someone takes the time to contribute to an article indicate a personal interest (excluding simple vandals, perhaps)? Obviously, a person can't keep every article on their watchlist. While my list continues to grow, it is ultimately going to be limited to articles that I have an interest in and feel that I can make a contribution to. Jossi's notes about how many edits a poster as made come across as flippant efforts to dimiss the poster out of hand, which is the essential definition of Ad Homenim (which has a nice writetup here, btw.) Now, maybe that is not the intent, but that is how it comes across, particularly since jossi has not responded to the points that have been raised. Ultimate ed 03:44, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually, there are nearly forty hits in google for the term, and the hit to the show notes for episode 52 (the source of the word) ranks higher than the wikipedia entry. It's pretty dissapointing to see the herd mentality at work here dogpiling on this article. Does Joe Blow on the street know this word? Probably not. But, part of the power of podcasting is that you can connect with a worldwide audience of people with a common interest. Can I tell you how big the Farpoint audiences are? No, I'm just a subscriber so I do't have that info, but I can tell from fan comments on the blogs and forums that there is a significant listership that is aware of this. Is it enough to warrant inclusion here? I think it is. Ultimate ed 04:01, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> In fact I thought this symptom was totally fallacious until I observed a corresponding "Men in gay Asia" sympathetic response. After doing further research we were able to determine that indeed it was a cultural/linguistic failing. We then asked the original claimants here again to tell us what happened and they said, they indeed do listen to the Wingin It podcast with Michael and Evo and consequently caught "mennengasia" by mp3 file osmosis. In conclusion,in this web 2.0 world we live in we must learn to embrace the longtail, wikis and mennengasian epiphanies, lest life become unbearably dull and overly-serious. Bbluesman</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> While Wingin' It doesn't currently have a Podcast Alley listing (it was part of the Dragon Page Mondo Feed that has since been discontinued in favor of separate feeds) most of the other Farpoint shows that have been around for a bit are ranked in the top 1,000 on Podcast Alley out of over 20,000 podcasts in the directory. Even the defunct Mondo feed is still ranked 545 for last month. We can debate non-notable, but to call the podcast obscure is simply a display of ignorance. When it really comes down to it, <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcasting.html" title="Podcasting">Podcasting</a> in general is an obscure concept that a relatively small portion of the population is aware of, so awareness of any given podcast is going to be a subset of this. Should we nominate <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcasting.html" title="Podcasting">Podcasting</a> as an article for deletion for being obscure? Ultimate ed 21:42, 3 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is relevant how&#160;? <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcasting.html" title="Podcasting">Podcasting</a> is significant, this isn't (and neither is the podcast that spawned it, hosted as it is by a series of redlinks). If it helps, I see the deletion of irrelevant podcasts and websites as <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a>, and deleting them and their insignicant sub-fifteen minutes of fame "memes" as a Good Thing, my gesture towards <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">WP:CSB</a>.
