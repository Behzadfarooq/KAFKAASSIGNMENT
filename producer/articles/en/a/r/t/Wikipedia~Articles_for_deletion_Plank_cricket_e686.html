<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not something made up in school, this is something played in schools. It seems to me that a game of this nature is going to have a hard time asserting notability by the google criteria because the practitioners are &lt;gross assumption&gt; 10 year olds busy playing sport, not writing blogs &lt;/gross assumption&gt;. This article seems worthy of inclusion to me, and seems quite different from beach cricket and French cricket. Perhaps an all-round 'cricket variants' article would suffice, but I discern sufficient points of difference to suggest that the different articles should be retained. IMO, of course. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Colon</a><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_Esperanza_bb00.html" title="User:Col tom/Esperanza"><font color="green">el</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Tom</a> 13:36, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is a genuine article. Poor kids in cities don't have access to proper cricket, and this is the only way they learn - therefore the content of the article is important. Plank cricket is not written about on the internet because deprived 10-year-olds don't 'blog' about it, and probably don't even have the internet. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist - it matters hugely to a lot of people, and plays an important part in the development of cricketing skills. If the general feeling is that a separate article is too much, then it should be merged with <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_cricket.html" title="Street cricket">street cricket</a>, but certainly not deleted, as the information is 100% correct, and it is a well-written piece. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.135.11.121 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.135.11.121_3a92.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.135.11.121">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
