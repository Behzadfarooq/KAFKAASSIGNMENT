<li><b>Keep:</b> Clearly you never checked your sources becuase it primarily is not a webcomic. The webcomic for it was onyl created very recently, loong afer the fairly notable flash series. Okay, that's going a bit overboard, but if the Salad Fingers and David Firth articles stayed up I don't see why this one can't. I'll see if I can add some explanation of its notability in the article. --<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman">Wizardman</a> 18:50, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I certainly see your point. But in fact, Michael Swain (who goes by "The Swain" in his flash works, which is why you got so few hits) is quickly getting more popularity as time goes on (I would've been on the fence on this in May or June, definitely not now). I guess that was kind of a response to the below comment. Anyway, I'll change my reasoning to per Es, he said it better than I could. --<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman">Wizardman</a> 01:25, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but shorten - the article is too long, especially the plot summaries, and it is divided into too many categories. Blockhead itself is fairly notable - around a million views on <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> for all the episodes combined, has its own <a href="http://newgrounds.com/collection/blockhead.html" class="external text" title="http://newgrounds.com/collection/blockhead.html" rel="nofollow">collection</a> page and creator is the 12th-highest rated artist on Newgrounds (<a href="http://newgrounds.com/users_top_batting.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://newgrounds.com/users_top_batting.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). There is some name recognition, at least within the Newgrounds community, which numbers at over a million members. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 21:38, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> not anywhere near notable. the person above me is incorrect. First off, for all episodes of blockhead there is around half a million, and popularity for the series has been dimming as time goes on. the previous episode received half the views as the last one. clearly it is not going anywhere. Second thing - There are literally dozens of series that have collection pages that wikipedia would delete their articles in a hot second, this is definitely one of them. A collection page on newgrounds is no basis for legitimacy. And lastly, I could name more than half the people on the top 50 rated artists that do not have wikis, and many flash artists are not on that top 50 list that have wikis, like IllWillPress. This also rules out the top 50 rated artists being a deciding factor in the legitimacy of this wiki.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: Not counting the few Blockhead flashes by other artists, the Blockhead episodes have been viewed 1,224,098 times as of today. Presence on the Newgrounds top 50 is certainly not a guarantee of having a wikipedia article; however, 7 out of the top 15 (not including this article, which would make it 8/15) have one or more articles devoted to their work: <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Farr_471a.html" title="James Farr">1a</a> <a href="../../../x/o/m/Xombie.html" title="Xombie">1b</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/SamBakZa_9d60.html" title="SamBakZa">2a</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/There_she_is%21%21.html" title="There she is!!">2b</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Phillips_%28animator%29_3777.html" title="Adam Phillips (animator)">3a</a> <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brackenwood.html" title="Brackenwood">3b</a>, <a href="../../../o/l/a/Ola_Bergner_66d3.html" title="Ola Bergner">7</a>, <a href="../../../8/-/b/8-Bit_Theater_2a8a.html" title="8-Bit Theater">8</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stone_Trek_4499.html" title="Stone Trek">14</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Firth_155c.html" title="David Firth">15a</a> <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salad_Fingers_e87c.html" title="Salad Fingers">15b</a>. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 03:04, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Stone Trek and 8-bit Theater? I'm surprised those are still around. Regardless, an individual episode averages around 100,000 views (12 cartoons divided by your figure), and the previous episode has half of that average. Series such as Xombie, Brackenwood and animators like David Firth often receive millions of views per cartoon rather than all submissions as a whole. Regardless of the numbers, the all-around spread of Blockhead is lightyears behind a series like Salad Fingers and Brackenwood. You're not going to find people outside of Newgrounds that know about Blockhead, and Newgrounds is an extremely limited audience. Its notability beyond Newgrounds is minimal if not anything at all.
<dl>
<dd>The previous episode has fewer views because it's been out for far less time than the other episodes, which would be obvious to someone who isn't just tryign to bash the article. LegendaryFrog's also been on the way down, why not just delete his article since it fits your standards for deletion? Of course that would not happen, that's my point. I've never heard of Stone Trek ever actually, so notability based on hits is subjective. I don't mind the deletions, I just mind when the reasons for them are full of holes.--<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman">Wizardman</a> 03:36, 25 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's exactly why I said basing this on views per cartoon is regardless to the fact that no one has heard of Blockhead outside of Newgrounds, and a Newgrounds fanbase is not a valid reason to keep an article. All I'm hearing are numbers, and if we were to base a flash artist's validity by views per cartoon there'd be dozens of articles on wikipedia that are illegitimate, much like this one.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>: non-notable flash series; as has been said, a Newgrounds "cult following" is hardly prominent enough a reason for a keep, and outside of that fanbase I doubt anyone would care to read this.</li>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b>: There have been one too many jumpstart flash series just like this one that burn out and this one is beginning to show its lack of fuel. It wasn't notable enough to begin with.</li>
