If you are referring to the screenplay; it is well-documented on outside sources that a screenplay went to a leading film producer for consideration as a possible movie. If you're referring to unpublished or upcoming releases, they were referenced from the author's site and books, Stephen King's page has a lengthy list of unpublished work referenced from a book. And thank you for noting that I oppose the deletion.

<p><b>Comment</b>: I've twice changed my opinion as to whether there should be an article on Ms Tardif. Those who care to visit my talk page will see that I was initially in favour, but then changed my mind. The good work of a variety of people has led me to believe that an article on Ms Tardif is indeed warranted. That said, my vote to delete still stands as I find this particular article continues to include elements of self-promotion. For example, her 2004 nomination for the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta Arts Award sounds impressive, but a visit to the website tells us that "Any Albertan or Alberta-based organization may nominate a person for a Lieutenant Governor of Alberta Arts Award". <a href="http://www.albertaartsawards.shawbiz.ca/nomination.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.albertaartsawards.shawbiz.ca/nomination.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> I very much doubt an impartial observer would have thought such a nomination worthy of mention. Had she made the short-list, as had <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Cardinal_ac67.html" title="Douglas Cardinal">Douglas Cardinal</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Murrell_%28playwright%29_775a.html" title="John Murrell (playwright)">John Murrell</a>, among others, I would think differently. Furthermore, several claims made in the article, as it stands, are unverifiable. That Ms Tardif "graduated with Highest Honors" from a correspondence school is just one example. I must add that I assume good faith, and see these two examples as nothing more than typical problems associated with autobiographical entries as discussed in <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>. Again, I recognize that a great effort has been made to bring the article into line with Wikipedia policies, but I can't in good conscience say that it is there (yet). <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 17:32, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Any award or nomination for award is worthy of mentioning. That's why authors mention shortlisted titles and nominations. There are many that are open to nominations from their province. How do you think people GET nominated? Also, shortlisted and nominated is the basically the same thing in the writing field and holds the same status--every professional writer knows that. And in both cases, someone (other than the writer) has to believe that person is worthy of being nominated. I was nominated by a fan of my first novel. She emailed me AFTER she nominated me. This nomination is for excellence in the arts in my province and is highly respected; it is better than being shortlisted for almost any contest, which only judges 1 work. Victoriagirl, you cannot possibly expect every statement to be backed up by a citation. That is impossible, for any writer. And it would mean that a large % of the content here on Wikipedia is unverified. I DID graduate with Highest Honors. Call ICS. That is how it can be verified. They do not release that information in a book or on the internet. Victoriagirl's requests for changes have gone from warranted (which I've addressed) to picky and on to ridiculous. And initially VG was not in favor of my article because it was far different than it is now and she flagged it as advertising.(<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECherylktardif_fdb6.html" title="User:Cherylktardif">Cherylktardif</a> 23:55, 9 August 2006 (UTC))
<dl>
<dd>Risking further accusations that I am being picky or ridiculous, I offer following. A nomination is not the same as being short-listed, though the two terms are often used interchangeably (and I will admit my own guilt in this matter). To use one example, nominating a book for the Giller requires nothing more than submitting the book along with a cheque to the organization - a process covered in Stephen Henighan's <i>When Words Deny the World</i> (Erin, Ont.: Porcupine's Quill, 2002). Thus, it is the short-list that receives attention, not the rather long list of nominees. So, I must disagree that each and every award nomination is worthy of mention. In the specific case of the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta Arts Award, the bar is so low as to make the mere nomination not worthy of note. As I stated previously, a nomination may be placed by any Albertan or Alberta-based organization. <a href="http://www.albertaartsawards.shawbiz.ca/nomination.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.albertaartsawards.shawbiz.ca/nomination.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> The criteria the nominee must meet is also quite loose in that he or she must be “a Canadian citizen; a person whose achievement or contribution has benefited the arts in Alberta; A resident of Alberta or, if not now a resident, someone who has had a significant connection to the province over time; be willing to accept the award.” <a href="http://www.albertaartsawards.shawbiz.ca/criteria.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.albertaartsawards.shawbiz.ca/criteria.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> While I won’t speculate as to the number of nominees generated by such a process, I can’t help but note that the awards website doesn’t provide a list.</dd>
<dd>Concerning verifiability, while I don’t expect every statement to be backed up by a citation, I do believe that “Information on Wikipedia must be reliable and verifiable. Facts, viewpoints, theories, and arguments may only be included in articles if they have already been published by reliable and reputable sources. Articles should cite these sources whenever possible. Any unsourced material may be challenged and removed.” These are not my words – these are Wikipedia’s policies as laid out in <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a>. Assuming good will, I don’t doubt for a moment that Ms Tardif graduated with Highest Honors from the correspondence school. I was using this claim as typical of the problems associated with autobiographical entries. It is an assertion that simply cannot be verified.</dd>
<dd>One final point, it is stated above that I was initially not in favour of an entry dealing with Ms Tardif. Anyone who cares to investigate will see that this isn’t true. My first - and only - edit to the article was the placement of an advert tag; quite obviously I was asking tat the article be cleaned up, rather than deleted. A visitor to my talk page will see that in my first discussion on the issue I was in favour of a Wikipedia article on Ms Tardif. In fact, I am <i>still</i> in favour, but cannot vote for this particular article.<a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 04:16, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Delete: rather ho-hum - not quite encyclopaedia-worthy. Please note that claiming 'highest honors' (whatever they may be) from a correspondence school is only liable to render you subject to discreet sniggering from readers.</p>

<li><b>comment</b> Note that CKT seems to be making a serious effort in tidying up her bio. Sorry to learn about her brother, but that fact does not increase notability one jot (unless she was somehow involved- I jest). The existence of her books can be verified easily enough, and I'm on the cusp of reconsidering my vote based on the rewrites. However, those quotes from reviewers and the planned future events still bug me. They remind me of one-line quotes you see on back covers to entice would-be readers, so not entirely NPOV yet. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 08:38, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The quote from <i>The Edmonton Examiner</i> irritates in that it does nothing to inform the work - unlike, say, that from Robert Thacker in the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Munro_a00c.html" title="Alice Munro">Alice Munro</a> entry. What's more the sentence it is found in ("Whale Song is "A wise, enchanting story..." said The Edmonton Examiner, and it explores topics such as amnesia and suicide.") is badly coonstructed and confusing. Is it <i>The Edmonton Examiner</i> that says the novel explores topics such as amnesia and suicide, or is this a description provided by the entry writer? That said, I'm not so convinced that it goes against NPOV. I must disagree on the issue of future events. A visit to the Kunati website indicates that the book is indeed plannned for publication. Though this event is roughly half a year away, it is not that different than mentioning the forthcoming September publication of Alice Munro's new book.<a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 14:52, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As far as I can see, all Ms Tardif's books are self published. Also as far as I can see, <i>Kunati Book Publishers</i> have not published <b>any</b> books <a href="http://prfree.com/index.php?cur=index&amp;action=preview&amp;id=42434" class="external autonumber" title="http://prfree.com/index.php?cur=index&amp;action=preview&amp;id=42434" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> - they are a startup who <b>hope</b> to publish some next January. So until they publish her book this is crystal ball. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm ashamed to realize that Kunati have yet to publish their first book - I'd thought that their Spring catalogue dealt with last season. No wonder I'd never heard of them! Until they are on their feet and have proven themselves it would probably be best to delete references to the 2007 edition of <i>Whale Song</i>. At this point, they are untested and their reliability is unknown - stark contrast with Munro's publisher, which celebrates its centennary this year.<a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 18:00, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
