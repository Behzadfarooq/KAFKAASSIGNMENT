<p>Prod contested by original author with reason of 'Remove frivolous and unsupported PROD'. This is another totally unsourced article on a university society who's claim to notability is someone famous was once a member. Delete per the precedcents set before <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 10:03, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Although some past members of the society are clearly notable, they were not notable when they were members. Even had they been notability might have been contentious, but as it is there is no notability associated with the society. Delete, therefore.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 13:06, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> As suggested, the student society has no special claim to notability at this time... - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 17:10, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Each of your statements is wrong:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) Every sentence in the article has a reference. Thus, it is not "totally unsourced", but <b>totally sourced</b>.</dd>
<dd>2) You have cited no precedent. There are precedents to support <b>keeping</b> the article at in the form of <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Universities_Labour_Club_45da.html" title="Cambridge Universities Labour Club">Cambridge Universities Labour Club</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Student_Liberal_Democrats_20c5.html" title="Cambridge Student Liberal Democrats">Cambridge Student Liberal Democrats</a>. Note that these include university political societies.Hence, to claim that there is precedent is laughable.</dd>
<dd>3) Your cookie-cutter, cut+paste assertion that the claim to notability is the fame of its alumni is false. The 'Alumni' section comes at the end of the article. The actual claim to notability is mainfold:
<dl>
<dd>3a) The society is the oldest and largest (by current student members) student Conservative society in the country.</dd>
<dd>3b) The society is <i>not</i> a chapter of the Conservative Party, but an independent organisation unaffiliated to the party. The relevant chapter of the Conservative Party is the Holborn and St Pancras Conservative Future.</dd>
<dd>3c) The society is one of the largest student societies, of any sort, in London. Look at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_student_societies_50ec.html" title="Category:British student societies">Cat:British student societies</a> and tell me that there's any sort of policy or precedent.</dd>
<dd>3d) The society has a seat on the National Convention of the Conservative Party. It is, therefore, important by this <i>ex officio</i> status afforded to its President.</dd>
<dd>3e) The society has received a lot of attention in the blogosphere and the mainstream media. Most recently, <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Rifkind_8179.html" title="Hugo Rifkind">Hugo Rifkind</a> wrote a mini-article on the society in his column in the Times on 2nd March 2007.</dd>
<dd>3f) The society hosts innumerable Members of Parliament, Lords, and the Shadow Cabinet. In the last two weeks alone, the society has hosted <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Galbraith%2C_2nd_Baron_Strathclyde_b9ce.html" title="Thomas Galbraith, 2nd Baron Strathclyde">Lord Strathclyde</a> (27/2), <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Whittingdale_8267.html" title="John Whittingdale">John Whittingdale</a> (2/3), and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Ottaway_3d23.html" title="Richard Ottaway">Richard Ottaway</a> (6/3).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Given the above, I suggest that you, and the two people that have been misguided by your comment, reconsider your position. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_Signature_e263.html" title="User:Bastin8/Signature">Bastin</a> 18:27, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>per your (3c), refer <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> and yes, there are articles in that category that should be deleted as well. Please feel free to PROD them. Per (3e), if there is suitable external sourcing available then add it, instead of complaining about frivolous PRODs - this one was perfectly justified at this point. <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 00:13, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>[Apologies for not replying sooner] It's not a matter of citing articles that merely exist, but articles that have survived AfD.

Note that these include university political societies. I asked for the precedent that was claimed when it was listed. This has not been provided. The above ought to serve as precedent to the contrary, even ignoring the above facts that make the UCL Conservative Society one of the most notable student societies (of any sort) in the UK. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_Signature_e263.html" title="User:Bastin8/Signature">Bastin</a> 22:27, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Then the solution is to make that point on the talk page, use {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">Fact</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">Notability</a>}}, and to allow a short period in which the editors can then diversify the sources. The solution is NOT to inappropriately PROD the article, and immediately AfD it when that PROD is objected to. I have begun the process of introducing other sources, and intend to make at least half of the sources published by other individuals or organisations in the next couple of days. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_Signature_e263.html" title="User:Bastin8/Signature">Bastin</a> 21:42, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Orig., author is right. Major institution in contemporary and 20th c UK politics. The alumni make it N. Just undocumented, not undocumentable. Rather odd argument above: "though some past members of the society are clearly notable, they were not notable when they were members" This being a student society, that is by definition impossible--perhaps set as a deliberately absurd criterion. The reason schools, college, societies, are notable is because of their alumni--everything they might do in the organization would be irrelevant if there hadn't been alums whose real-life work made it worth thinking about in the first place--otherwise they would have been failures altogether.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> There are many articles on left wing political associations on wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> per above, NN, fails <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. Amidst the indignation, I'm waiting for some sourcing which indicates that this organization is notable <i>as a society,</i> not that a bunch of its alums have made good (something which could be said of a great many otherwise non-notable college societies). Great, so they get to send a delegate to Tory national conventions. No doubt the St-Brixley-In-The-Moor Conservative Party caucus does too, but we don't have articles on similar local Tory councils. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 20:34, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
