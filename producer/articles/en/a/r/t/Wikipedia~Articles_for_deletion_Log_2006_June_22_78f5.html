Way too many people look way too deeply into the "Nazo Issue", and it has been a source of frusteration for me that whenever the future of the TV series is brought up, somebody always has to mention this Nazo thing. That said, Nazo could possibly BE a different character - as he looks visibly different from <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Sonic_452d.html" title="Super Sonic">Super Sonic</a>, which was also seen in the same promo video that Nazo was.

<p><b>Delete</b> Putting it politely, the article is a mess. It just duplicates information in other articles over and over (usually in the main articles such as <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> and <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_News_5160.html" title="BBC News">BBC News</a>. The article has no structure, again and again returning to the premise that the BBC is biased against America, but at the same time it isnt.</p>
<p>I note it was previously nominated in December. A number of people at this point suggested it should be kept and cleaned up. However, this has not happened. IMHO the article should be deleted and anything of any worth (if there is anything) moved to <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_News_5160.html" title="BBC News">BBC News</a> (which is what the article is about).</p>
<p>I have reservations about any merger as: 1. The article doesnt really have any substantial debate it appears to use the likes of personal opinions, newspaper leaders, and blogs (often from those with a vested interest in casting BBC News in a bad light) to cobble together the criticism. For example is there any strong evidence that the BBC is anti-american? If the BBC's coverage of Katrina is evidence of anti-americanism some of the US networks are far more anti-american than the BBC. IMHO a blog is not a source worthy of an encyclopedia. On the other side (without looking) I'm sure there are plenty of the above which show the BBC in a good light.</p>
<p>2. Most of the stuff is covered elsewhere anyway.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, "Criticism of" articles are rarely a good idea. Write an NPOV article on the BBC. Don't split off criticism into another article. Having a section labelled "Criticism" within an article is bad enough (unless criticism is a big part of the subject)... but specific criticism articles are even worse.

The problem is that it is really multiple lists and I would argue that a list of legendary characters believed to be based on real people is very different than a list of literary alter egos. Maybe they shouldn't even be on the same page. But this list is potentially useful and more informative than a category would be. So I say "keep." <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 01:58, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - it's interesting enough, but I frankly can't see why anyone would want to look at it.

That may not be the fault of the article, but it still shows that it's not really, well, important. I wouldn't call it unencyclopedic, per nom, but it is sparse and needs some rewriting. <sup><a href="../../../r/i/a/User_talk%7ERiana_dzasta_b0bf.html" title="User talk:Riana dzasta">T</a></sup><a href="../../../r/i/a/User%7ERiana_dzasta_07ef.html" title="User:Riana dzasta">riana</a><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Riana_dzasta_06fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Riana dzasta">C</a></sub> 02:17, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b>: This article has the same kind of content and format of all other "Surf breaks by country", why only this one is being considered for deletion?

<li><b>Suggestion</b> I invite you to visit the section "Famous surf breaks" on the article <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surfing.html" title="Surfing">Surfing</a> and to add an AfD on each one of the articles listed there. Or more simply, perhaps we can classify the whole information about <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surfing.html" title="Surfing">Surfing</a> as unencyclopedic and delete this useless article too. And so on until there is nothing left. The other option is to try to improve the existing articles instead of deleting them (isn’t what wikipedia is about?)- <b><a href="../../../m/c/a/User%7EMcastilho_0df8.html" title="User:Mcastilho">Castilho</a></b> <small>, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hmmm, I didn't know that there were other similar articles. Some of them seem encyclopedic, like the Surf Breaks in the U.S. article (with information more than just a list), but many are in worse shape than this one. If this article can be expanded upon like the U.S. article (but with sources, which the U.S. one lacks), then it should be kept. Until then, though, it's probably better to merge into <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism_in_Israel_0438.html" title="Tourism in Israel">Tourism in Israel</a> until there's enough information to split off. — <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">ዮም</font></a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="green">(Yom)</font></a> | <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">contribs</font></a></small> • <small><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a></small> 18:40, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> per Riana, at least in the interim. Seems to be valuable, verifiable information that should be kept somewhere.

"naysayers are being more vocal because the people who understand it are too busy participating." so true. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE: people who are suggesting deletion also suggest deletion of OTHER YTMND.com wiki's. Just because it happened on the internet doesnt mean it isnt history, okay? And a reply to "Aren't most notable fads more than 24 hours old?"

There's no claim that any particular party, organization, or facton is particularly associated with this concept, or that any particular major thinker has used it.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think an article on <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutionary_socialism.html" title="Revolutionary socialism">Revolutionary socialism</a> is needed - though it's something of a cluster concept rather than the particular ideology which this article seems to think it is. "Revolutionary socialists" aren't necessarily Communists so a separate article would make sense, one that refers both to historical revolutionary socialism (out of which developed Marxism and Marxist-Leninism) and modern use of the phrase "revolutionary socialism" which is generally used to differentiate oneself from parliamentary socialists/social democrats, is a phrase also used by Trotskyists, Stalinists and other variety of Communists as well as those who reject Leninism or Marxism and isn't a set ideology. However, this article is called "Revolutionary Socialist Democracy" so I don't see the point of keeping and rewriting.Homey 13:30, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi, This is not an advertisement. Although I have studied myself at Vidyamandir Classes, I don't consider it to be a very great place. If you read the article carefully, you'll notice that I have kept a fairly factual tone, thrown in both the plus points and the criticisms (some of which were initiated by me), and maintained a reasonably objective point of view. My purpose in putting up this page is that people should be aware of the details about coaching institutes so that they can take a more informed decision. most students after Class Xth have only unreliable rumours on which to base their decision to join coaching institutes and I want to reduce this factor. If you think this contradicts the objective and neutral policies of Wikipedia, please let me know in what way. <a href="../../../v/i/p/User%7EVipul_fa3e.html" title="User:Vipul">Vipul</a> 02:31, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus</b> to delete the version on the 1921 series. Seems to be a consensus to delete the other version, so I will take the relatively unusual step of deleting just that from the history, as no content from it was used in the rewrite. <a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 02:02, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But, unless the closing admin is meticulous, we will not have the answer to the question for which this AfD was created, namely "Is the fantasy <i>Chronicles of America</i> by Stephen Ward a suitable subject for an article?". So, when S.W. McCann creates yet another article on this theme, someone will have to re-list it, and we will have to discuss the matter again. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Stephen_33a8.html" title="User:Mr Stephen">Mr Stephen</a> 13:53, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This appears to be well-written article about a professional wrestler, but the person is <b>definantly non-notable</b> per <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Wade+Mitchells%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Wade+Mitchells%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">google search</a> that pulls up 1 exact hit, and the hit it does recieve is the Wikipedia article. Wade Mitchells appears to be the author of the article because it is written in a POV only aquirred by an auto-biography. This person also created several other articles about the wrestling promotions he was wrestling for, but they too pull up no exact hits except thier Wikipedia articles and a self-made homepage for the promotion. <b>Delete</b>.</p>

This could be deleted under speedy since no claim to fame is made in the article. I actually intended to nominate this article myself. "Ben Burch" as an article has no verifiable secondary claims and, in-fact, none where "Ben Burch" is the subject likely exist. His website might be slightly notable, but not Ben.

<li><b>Speedy Merge</b> (or delete)The article on Mike Malloy might be expanded to include information about some of that program's regulars and guests.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. It is a funny case; I tend to believe that the BenBurch who nominated it really is the same person as the article subject. And I also think that it's been used for trite attacks on the person. However, I read Mr. Burch's writing activities as minimally meeting notability criteria, especially under the "author test". Obviously, per below comments, Mr. Burch's opinion has no special weight in regard to his own notability. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 07:18, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

My contributions to AVN are all editorial and advisory, and do not entail a byline, just a mention in the colophon.

<li>I don't understand your reference to "a pornography industry magazine". Do you mean that notability based on a publication would depend in part on whether Wikipedians approve of the publication? I assume that, with pornography as with many other subjects, some magazines are important and widely known, while others are obscure. Setting aside for a moment the specific question of Ben Burch's notability, are you arguing that public attention received because of <i>some</i> activities should be discounted because the activities are disliked by some people? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 15:41, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is, it seems to me, a very strange case. This article has been around for a while, and has been the subject of an extraordinary number of edits---mostly, by the looks of it, vandalism, and the reverting of same. Now, here we have the ostensible subject of the article, asking that the article be deleted because he does not feel that he is notable enough to deserve said article. How, one wonders, are we to even know that this <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> is, in fact, the real Ben Burch? Reading the article, which is rather short, the individual in question seems somewhat notable in the field of political blogging and talk radio. This is all very puzzling to me. Can the subject of an article ask that said article be deleted on the grounds that he or she does not feel he or she is notable enough? I feel that I cannot vote on this AfD until some facts are sorted out. ---<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 05:20, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>Hi, Charles! The article was created in the first instance as a vehicle for personal attack by the trolls who reside at Conservative Underground. These people are well know to vandalize liberal and progressive message boards, and they decided to expand. I listed the article for deletion because it became clear to me that they would never grow up and stop vandalizing it, and people here on Wiki have enough to do trying to get actual work done without having to revert this page endlessly. And I am no more notable than a lot of people who don't have Wikipedia articles. Lets save those for folks you can at least find a newspaper article about, OK? <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 05:27, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

Might I remind you of your comments yesterday on the DU Talk page regarding the External Links discussion: "My dear, I've had a lot of serious fun lately. This is quick becoming my new hobby and my model railroad and the live steam locomotive building up in my workshop are gathering dust. I have to monitor the computers here in the studio at all hours from 11 AM through midnight, and so this fills in the time when things are working properly quite nicely."

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Again with the innuendo, my little box of Nuts n' Honey. I challenge you to point to a single Wiki comment of mine that is out of line. If you are referring to my posts on CU, they are irrelevant to the discussion at hand, which is your notability. Adolf Hitler was a disgusting human being, but I would never argue that he was not notable. While I find you personally abhorrant, I am able to separate my personal feelings from my objectivity about your notability. This is something you should learn. I could refer to volumes of your posts on DU which are disgusting examples of hate speech, but they would be irrelevant to this discussion. While blog mentions are not considered here, if you were to count all the mentions of BenBurch, Fister, and Fat Che on CU, FR, and the Dummy Funnies, one could draw the conclusion that you were more notable than the President. You really aren't very good at this Ben.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Charles, of course, is correct. Absent <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">legal</a> concerns, the opinion of the subject of an article merits no more consideration than that of any other editor (in the case that the subject should be a Wikipedian), and the desire of a subject that an article apropos of him/her be deleted in no way militates for (or against, I suppose) deletion (toward which proposition see, e.g., <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Daniel_Brandt_%283rd_nomination%29_1c82.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Daniel Brandt (3rd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Daniel Brandt (3rd nomination)</a> and its sundry affirmances); neither does his/her opinion with respect to his/her notability carry any special weight (even where he/she adjudges himself to be non-notable, which determination would tend to be against one's interest, although surely not in situations such as these). Of course, I'm likely to support deletion, believing the subject to be non-notable, but his desire that the article be deleted will not affect my reasoning (and neither will the fact of the frequent vandalism of the article, even as I'm no fan of the CU). In any case, <a href="../../../s/p/e/WP%7ESPEEDY_9918.html" title="WP:SPEEDY">speedy deletion</a>, for which Ben advocates, is surely not an appropriate disposition here. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:47, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Keep</b> I searched (google finds no hits about the movies, but Yahoo does - one of those net quirks I guess) and found several interviews, although most are on fansites re-posted from elsewhere. I could only find one link to an original article: <a href="http://www.expressgaynews.com/print.cfm?content_id=2480" class="external free" title="http://www.expressgaynews.com/print.cfm?content_id=2480" rel="nofollow">http://www.expressgaynews.com/print.cfm?content_id=2480</a> This is from a gay lifestyle newspaper published in Florida. Jai Rodriguez also has an official website where the movie is mentioned. It has also been mentioned in other media articles, that seem to not be online. The production company making the movie also mention it on their website: <a href="http://www.larkinangels.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.larkinangels.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.larkinangels.com/</a></p>
<p>This is a major movie, has a script, has announced the casting of name stars, and has already begun pre-production. The lead role is played by a famous TV star and Broadway actor in his first real (non-cameo) movie role. Queer Eye is not as 'hot' as it was when it first started (i.e the cast are no longer on every magazine cover and talk show), but they were, and with the show ending it is reasonable to assume there will be a level of interest in what the cast do next. The movie has already garnered some media attention, mostly in the gay press, and sparked a great deal of interest among Queer Eye's huge fanbase, on fansites and forums. There are also discussions going about the movie in Broadway forums, especially among 'Rentheads' because Jai starred in the Broadway production of Rent for years.</p>
<p>There are many upcoming movies listed on Wiki with less information and less public&amp;media interest and I can think of no reason for it to be deleted. If deleted it would just be re-added in a few months when it's no longer an 'upcoming' movie anyway.</p>
<p>I should mention that I was in the middle of adding more info, including citing sources, when I was unable to edit the page for some reason. That is why the page is short on info and sources. 172.212.37.115 05:11, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Of course it must be kept. I've been reading loads about it on the QE blog. It's a big movie being made by a major studio with big-name actors.

<li><b>Keep</b> I run a Jai fansite and I've received over 200 emails about this movie. Even if it the current theatrical release date is changed or cancelled (and there is no reason to suspect it will be) the movie is notable enough because of its high profile cast and writer and the level of interest in it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.93.21.74.html" title="User:195.93.21.74">195.93.21.74</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/5/User_talk%7E195.93.21.74.html" title="User talk:195.93.21.74">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.93.21.74_56af.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.93.21.74">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I find nothing to indicate that the company making this film is notable either. A search for "Larkin Street Angels" on google gives nothing either, and the website consists of one page announcing this film, with the barest minimum of information. To the above (195) I have seen no information on the writer, and the "high profile cast" consists only of Jai Rodriguez, with no information on anyone else who might be in this film. If there's so much interest in this film there should be more information on it in the media. Once there is that interest in the media, and the film has been released and shown itself to be of interest, then write the article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a crystal ball. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 17:40, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This "comedy duo" are simply nonnotable. I placed a db-bio tag on the article, and the author replaced it with a hold-on tag, but the argument he made (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tom_Lennon_and_Martin_Blair" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tom_Lennon_and_Martin_Blair" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tom_Lennon_and_Martin_Blair</a>) on behalf of the article is not convincing. So, I am here, asking for your opinion(s) on the matter. Oh, and to make matters worse, this same author keeps inserting information about these two men into other articles only vaguely connected to these two gentlemen. This indicates to me that he is trying to manufacture the facade of notability---in his defense of the duo, on the article talk page, he refers to himself as a "fan and well-wisher". <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 05:08, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Well, uh, if it was an issue of the comic, do you think people would be so eager to call it a hoax? But to answer the question, no, nothing under this name (or approximating the storyline) has been published in the <i>Sin City</i> series. In fact, if you do a Google search for "Sin City" and "A Killer Reborn", you get exactly zero hits. Is it fanfic? I don't know. The article reads like a description of fanfic, but then again, it could also be a hoax. But, honestly, who cares? The bottom line is, we know it's not a part of the <i>Sin City</i> series and we can't even verify it exists. It's just something some guy on the internet made up. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:00, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I was only asking for verification -- being as I wasn't familiar enough with the comic to know, I found it entirely possible that the other people here might not be as well.

<p><b>Keep All</b> I would just like to add that most of the people in this grouping, with the exception of Jehu Eyre, Jr. and Anne Eyre Heller, already had longstanding articles about them before they had Infoboxes tagged on. The Infobox alone should not qualify them for deletion. Rather, the Infoboxes ought to be removed. I mean, for goodness' sakes, the <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehu_Eyre_5c1a.html" title="Jehu Eyre">Jehu Eyre</a> article is extremely well-sourced. There is no debate whatsoever in the historical community that he was a crucial figure in the Revolution. A quick look at the references shows this. I would urge the author of these articles to please enter this discussion.</p>
<p>I am not partial to any one editor, but am a former history teacher and would consider it a terrible shame if notable articles were to be deleted because someone felt the need to include the word "dynasty" where perhaps it wasn't viable (which point I confute anyway). Please read all of these articles IN THEIR ENTIRETY, as I have, before deciding on deletion.</p>
<p>I know that Jehu Eyre, at the very least, is quite notable, and would include the rest of his family as well, if simply for the fact that they carried on his money and his traditions.</p>
<p>Not only that, but each individual article ought to have its own deletion page. Leader of the Eyre/Heller Dynasty in the United States is on a quite different level than <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehu_Eyre_5c1a.html" title="Jehu Eyre">Jehu Eyre</a>. The latter is highly notable, while the former is somewhat questionable.</p>

<p>Okay, this:</p>
<p>Title: Business papers, 1795-1847 (bulk 1800-1805). Description: 720 items. Notes: Manuel Eyre, a Philadelphia merchant of Quaker ancestry, was born in 1777. His father, Manuel Eyre, Sr., [take note, as this man was the subject of one of my articles] (1736-1805) was a shipwright in Kensington and a colonel in the Contintental Army. He obtained his training in the counting house of Henry Pratt and Abraham Kintzing and in 1803 joined with Charles Massey, Jr., (b. 1778) to form the mercantile firm of Eyre &amp; Massey, a partnership that lasted until Eyre's death in 1845. The firm of Eyre &amp; Massey owned over 20 vessels, ranging in size from ships to sloops, and traded around the world, mounting voyages to Europe, the Caribbean, South America, China, India and the Pacific Islands. Manuel Eyre also served on the Philadelphia City Council and was a founding director of the Schuylkill Navigation Company (1816) and the Second Bank of the United States (1816). After 1820 he gradually retired from active trading and devoted much of his time to agriculture. He owned two farms outside the city and three in Delaware. He was the founder of Delaware City, Del., at the mouth of the Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal, buying the entire site in 1828, erecting public buildings and dividing it into lots.</p>

<p>This:</p>
<p>Mr. Rumsey says in page 2, "That in the month of September, 1781 he exhibited the model of a Boat to his Excellency General Washington at Bath in Berkeley County, calculated for stemming the current of rapid rivers only constructed on principles very different from (his) present one&#160;; satisfied of the experiment of her making way against a rapid stream by the force of the stream the General was pleased to give me a most ample certificate of her efficacy." Here it is to be observed, that no mention was made to General Washington of steam at the time of such exhibition&#160;; the principles on which the Boat was propelled, were entirely unconnected with, and distinct from steam; being simply a model propelled by water wheels, cranks, and setting poles&#160;; a mode which was many years ago tried on the river Schuylkill by a farmer near Reading, but without success. From an exhibition of this plan it was that Mr. Rumsey procured the certificate from General Washington, and on that certificate were Mr. Rumsey's laws founded. In his petitions to the several legislatures, he prayed for no exclusive right, for the use of Steam Boats; neither did be make mention of Steam, to their committees; or even suggest an idea of the kind; as proof of which, I offer the following petition to the Assembly of Pennsylvania the certificate from General Washington, accompanying it, and the certificate of Manuel Eyre, Esquire, who was one of the committee of Assembly, who reported in Mr. Rumsey's- favor.</p>

<p>The same day the Navy Board recommended to Council that as there were reasons to believe that some vessels of the English fleet would attempt to approach the city, a certain number of persons should be assigned to flood Hog Island, and that ninety or one hundred men should garrison the fort at Darby Creek. Council requested the Navy Board to see to the flooding of the Island, and ordered a company of artillery and a company of "Musqueters," under the command of Col. Jehu Eyre, to the works at Darby Creek.</p>

<p>Since its founding, the cemetery has had a self-perpetuating board of trustees to look over its affairs. The board has included such notables as the Emmanuel and Jehu Eyre, shipbuilders to the Continental Navy. The board of trustees has kept the cemetery independent over all these years and has also withstood an attempt by a local church to usurp it.</p>

<p>This: When the Revolution broke out in 1775, Hewson organized a company of volunteers from his own Kensington workmen and served as their Captain. He was joined in this patriotic response by the shipwright Jehu Eyre, who captained his own ship carpenters, workmen, and apprentices in the "Kensington Artillery." The Eyre shipyards at the foot of Columbia Avenue hastily constructed thirteen gondolas and galleys for use in the defense of the city.</p>

<p>This: Manuel Eyre built the first gun-boat for the Government. It was launched at Philadelphia, July 26, 1775, and was called the “Bull Dog.” He organized his workmen into a company of minute men and commanded them at Trenton and Princeton. When he was selected by the Council of Safety as a member of the Navy Board, his company was merged into that of his brother Jehu.</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> This is not a collective AfD for all articles about people referred to in the article nominated. Perhaps one or two of them might warrant an article, but the idea that there was something called the "Eyre/Heller Dynasty" fails any sort of sourcing or verification test.

<p><b>Comment</b> Okay, that is what I wanted to know. Because all of the other Eyre articles' deletion discussions link to this one, I assumed that a decision for deletion of this article would mean a deletion for all of the articles. The simple deletion of this section would be something that, while I would not like, I could certainly accept.</p>
<p>Before you come to that, though, I ask of you to please consider my sources. Just because a family was not proclaimed a "dynasty" in its time does not mean that it didn't display dynastic traits in practice. The loaning of significant sums to the federal government, the association with Washington and the family's deep involvement in the Revolution, and the family's continued wealth after the war (i.e., Manuel Eyre, Jr., Jehu Eyre, Jr., Anne Eyre Heller, etc) all the way down to the Crash of 1929 certainly qualify it as a very influential and important component of American history.</p>
<p>And I dispute that Anne Eyre was not important; in marrying Amos Heller, she united two of the richest clans in the nation. You see, I have yet to post my sources on the Hellers, who were a significant force by themselves. I'll ask you to give me some time. Thank you all for your consideration and I ask of you to please face this with an open mind.</p>
<p>At the very least, should any of the individual articles be removed (which I assure you that, as a history major, I will fight quite bitterly), I would ask that I be allowed to create a single article about the significance of the family as a whole. I repeat, though, that it should not come to that. I will be providing more sources soon.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> They bankrolled the Revolution (both Jehu and Manuel), provided a significant chunck of the Continental Navy, saw their properties devastated in the British invasion of Philadelphia (where, it should be mentioned, Eyre Street is named in their honor (and I will source that)), founded at least one city (through Manuel Eyre, Jr. (which is already in the sources)), maintained a global shipping company (through Jehu Eyre, Jr., Manuel Eyre, Jr., and their descendants), united two of the wealthiest groups in the United States (through the Anne Eyre-Amos Heller marriage), are directly tied to many historical monuments throughout the United States (Laurel Hill Cemetery, Grange Estate, the Eyre Mansion) and around the world (Eyrecourt Castle), are relations of the Wikipedia-recognized Vanderslice family of lawyers (through the Franklin Pierce Heller-Gertrude Vanderslice marriage), played a role in the U.S. Civil War (if less pronounced than their influence on the Revolution), were directly associated with George Washington, and remained in the upper strata of American society until the Stock Market Crash of 1929, the greatest economic disaster in American history, ended their nine-century ride (two centuries in the United States, seven in Great Britain and Ireland). You don't think these people are notable?</li>

<li>History21, Wikipedia is not a place to practice your own historical research and scholarship; it's an encyclopedia that relies on the concept of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, which we summarize and collect into what we hope are authoritative and comprehensive articles. This does <i>not</i> mean synthesizing your own academic theories about the importance of various individuals by putting together pieces of somewhat obscure historical primary sources. That's what Calton and others mean by <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. That type of material is best suited to journal articles, monographs, and books; if your theories become widely accepted among historians, then they will be welcome in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 05:47, 23 June</li>

<dd>Oh, my. I didn't realize we had been through all this before. Yikes. Apparently, this is somebody's cryptohistorical hobbyhorse. This is getting ridiculous. And History21, again, please read <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Wikipedia guidelines on reliable sources</a>. Amateur genealogy from unreviewed personal web pages like those cited above from Angelfire, Rootsweb, and Geocities are <i>not</i> reliable sources, and if you have to resort to them to "prove" the existence and notability of this "dynasty" of Eyres and Hellers and Vanderwhoositses, you have basically admitted lack of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiabity</a> for Wikipedia purposes. Again: Wikipedia is not a place to research and present your personal theories on American history by digging through obscure personal web sites. When you have convinced the community of mainstream historians of the existence of this "dynasty", and we can verify the identities and facts about the lives of its members from reliable sources, that is the point when it should be included in Wikpedia. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 05:40, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p><i><b>The following passage is from Talk:Macarra:</b></i></p>
<p>I am also from Spain and sufficiently cultured to know that "macarra" has nothing to do with what is described in the page. [ ¿how does one correct it? I'll find out because ] not only it is offensive to find a wrong image of our youth published across the planet but also because it is a definition absolutely localised to a _very few_ years and to only a part of two big cities. Evidently it has been written by someone with good intentions but who has not asked enough or simply very little.</p>
<p>"Macarra" does not appear in my hard copy of the D.R.A.E. It is a term originating in Argentina, as far as I know and it means originally "proxeneta" ... wrong, it has a French origin. I have lived in Madrid and various other cities in Spain since the day I was born. My parents, both teachers, explained this term to me when I asked as a child and most educated adults will understand that when someone is termed "macarra", we refer to the person as being: vulgar, with no taste or a bad one, ordinary, uncultured, ... I can't find the right English adjectives just now. In Spanish we define "macarra" as "vulgar, ordinario, chabacano, de mal gusto" not only in dressing but also in manners and speech. It refers more to that latter than to the former.</p>
<p>It has __no connotation whatsoever__ with the terms used in the article: punk, kind of music, political stands or beliefs, squatters, communities, social groups, alcohol nor any other type of drugs, "botellón", delinquency, hairdo or hairstyle, dressing or any other reference semi-implied in the article. In fact there are public figures who are quite wealthy and even well dressed who frequently appear in the media who we would term as "macarras". Though they always wear suit and tie and live in wealthy in mansions in so-called respectable neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Personally I consider the example of mentioning the characters depicted in Pedro A. films as very unfortunate since I view that author precisely as a "macarra". I would even go as far as saying the same of the present inhabitant of the white house ... Just to show that the concept described is absolutely wrong from a Spaniard's point of view.</p>

  2. col. desp. Chulo, [hombre] que vive de las prostitutas.

<p>So, the English adjectives I was not able to find before are: ordinary, cheap, flashy, tacky, pimp, lout, aggresive, brutal, cruel</p>
<p>And in Spanish: vulgar, ordinario, hortera, de mal gusto, chulo, proxeneta.</p>
<p><br />
The author/s might have wanted to refer only to a counter-sub-culture very localised and quite epochal (?) that uses the term just to provoke society, but have not read a single dictionary or asked anyone older than him/herself ...</p>
<p>FelipeTD 21:48, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I´m from Spain and I have never heard of the tem "macarra" being used to refer to a subculture based on punk and that listens to "new wave and reggae".</p>
<p><br />
---</p>
<p><br />
In fact "macarra" is the term for the man whose business is the woman trade ( proxeneta ).</p>
<p>Maybe the "macarra" subculture term wants to point "cheli" that is a modern urban spanish dialect centered in Madrid circa 1970-1980 in declive nowadays.</p>

<li><s><b>Comment</b>. It is more accurate to say that the article <i>reports</i> on a non-notable theory. The reporter <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_D._Croft_0acc.html" title="User:John D.

Personally I'd like to add my equally unfalsifiable theory that Wikipedia does not arise as the result of a combination of accidental edits, but that its emergence is hard-wired into the laws of biocosmics.

<li><b>Comment 2</b>. The article appears to give a rather wrong impression of the theory. Gardner has written a book on this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1930722222/002-0943784-2198426?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1930722222/002-0943784-2198426?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. Quoting from the editorial reviews:
<ul>
<li>Amazon.com: <i>Gardner is meticulous in outlining his ideas, explaining their falsifiability and scientific rigor, and offering deep chaos theory to support them. Did our universe create intelligent life in order to ensure its own reproduction? Gardner thinks so, though he knows his position will irk many cosmologists exhausted from battling pseudoscientists and creationists. His impressive list of scientific supporters includes Sir Martin Rees (Britain's Astronomer Royal), Michael Shermer (publisher of Skeptic magazine), and John Casti (Santa Fe Institute honcho).</i> Biocosm <i>synthesizes many disciplines and theories in its conclusions, offering much food for cosmological thought.</i></li>
<li>Publishers Weekly: <i>Science writer and amateur cosmologist Gardner proposes a startling theory: that a pre-existing superintelligent race that inhabited a "mother universe" created this one and tweaked the physical laws in its baby universe to ensure the continuity of intelligent life and of the cosmos itself; this universe</i>.

<dd>Don't be fooled by the man behind the curtain. Those references are amateurish as seen from the fact that they are basically uncited in the literature. There doesn't seem to be anyone in the field that actually uses the anthropic principle who refers to Gardner, so why do we in this fashion? --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 00:25, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If we have an article on this theory, it doesn't mean we <i>endorse</i> it. The theory is not today's standard cosmological model; neither is the anthropic principle, but that should not stop us from reporting on it. I'm not sure what you mean by someone "actually using" the anthropic principle, or why we should put any trust in such a person. It's an interesting and thought-provoking idea, and with 12,000 Google hits for "biocosm gardner", and the selection as best science book by several sources, it should be notable enough for inclusion. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 07:46, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's fine with me if you agree that such an article should still describe the idea (in a better way than the present article).

<li><b>Comment</b> I choose one paragraph at random and unfortunately it has a very serious error. The paragraph lists alleged criteria of John von Neumann for <i>evolution</i>, but in fact von Neumann was talking about self assembling/reproducing machines (in work which lead to the still rather inchoate theory of cellular automata).

<li><b>Comment</b>: it's awkward to admit, and I don't know enough to say "keep", but I have actually heard of this band. I think they are or were somewhat notable in Swedish nazi/white power music (or whatever the correct term is), and the band member with the nickname "Nitton" (Patrik "Nitton" Asplund) was one of the more notorious young neo-nazis in the 1990s and figured a lot in Swedish media when he publicly left the nazi circles a few years ago and published a <a href="http://websok.libris.kb.se/websearch/search?SEARCH_ONR=7777842" class="external text" title="http://websok.libris.kb.se/websearch/search?SEARCH_ONR=7777842" rel="nofollow">book</a> about it.

<li><b>Comment</b>, same as Uppland. I too have heard of this band, and as Uppland says, they are one of the more famous White Power bands in Sweden.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not entirely sure of what to think, according to the God in the Pits Website, there are some pretty notable reviews<a href="http://www.godinthepits.com/reviews.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.godinthepits.com/reviews.html" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>. But, naturally, there is no sourcing. The God in the Pits article is also a complete mess, and unless there is someone whom can supply some info, it probably should go down into the pits. I know Amazon doesn't really count, but it appears somewhat notable there. Personally, I believe this article should be extinguished if nothing else is brought up to prove notability. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> <sup><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox">(talk)</a></sup> 17:01, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am neutral as to whether it stays or goes, but I have replaced the tangential material about banned books that was at God in the Pits with an actual stub. (Thank you, Amazon, for providing pictures of the back covers!&#160;:-) ) The book did, apparently, get noticed by Forbes, Barrons and the Economist, if anyone wants to go grovelling through archives for the reviews. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> 20:29, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Looked on Forbes.com, Barrons.com, and Economist.com. Couldn't find anything in the first two. The Economist gives it a two-sentence mention in a longer article about books on Enron, calling it the "most curious" of the hundreds of books on the topic. At first glance I'm leaning toward deletion, but if the Forbes and Barrons references turn up and are, unlike The Economist, proper book reviews, I think it would squeak in. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 23:57, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

As for the copyvio that apparently keeps coming back, that is an issue but I don't think the way to resolve it is by deleting the article. Copyvio material needs to be removed. If it's not a good faith addition of info <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, then the posters need to be contacted and, if they persist, a block on them needs to be taken up.

After the Prophet passed away, he would take care to go to as many companions as possible especially those who knew the Prophet longer and learn from them what the Prophet had taught them. Whenever he heard that someone knew a hadith of the Prophet which he did not know he would go quickly to him and record it. He would subject whatever he heard to close scrutiny and check it against other reports. He would go to as many as thirty companions to verify a single matter." <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 02:06, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>: People who have been suggesting that this matter is copy vio rather than AfD are missing the reason I nominated it; I DID nominate for copy vio, whereupon the material was removed, and as soon as the admin checking copy vio said there wasn't a violation (because he didn't see what had been deleted), the copyright violation was immediately put back on, <i>and added to from the same source</i>, as it stands today. The article is unreferenced, it is biased, and it is a copyright violation. This surely breaks as many WP:Policies as is needed. I am tired of having to push this point, simply because I am outnumbered by the people who want the copy vio to remain on the article (though Mr. Striver is unaware of what constitutes copyright violation, he still has no right to continually replace what various admins agree IS). I want this article, like all articles, to be a GOOD article, and it seems to me that as it stands it is a disgrace to everyone. So, please, I beg you, either vote to delete, or take on this article's improvement instead of simply calling for someone else to do it. I have tried every avenue now and I don't have the will anymore for a protracted edit war.

<p>This is a wholly unencyclopedic game-guide article that...well, let me reprise my comments from <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_attacks_745b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Pokémon attacks">the last AFD</a> (nine months ago):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have an excellent place for descriptions of common or signature Pokémon attacks: in the articles for the individual Pokémon involved. The fact remains that there aren't many (none that I can think of) common Pokémon attacks that aren't plainly obvious, and the uncommon ones don't bear mentioning (for the same reason that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_characters_c18c.html" title="List of Pokémon characters">List of Pokémon characters</a> doesn't include every single Pokémon trainer in the games; there are hundreds and most are more-or-less interchangable). Anyone with a basic grasp of English or a dictionary understands that Flamethrower is going to be a blast of flame, Water Gun is going to be a jet of water, and that Thunderbolt is going to be a blast of electricity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As for attacks that aren't as obvious, in both the manga and the anime (where the effects of the attack are extremely fluid, depending on the needs of the plot) they are immediately explained, in all but the oldest games they're described in the game, and, most importantly, it's exceedingly unlikely anyone without access to those primary sources will ever have cause to look up further information on Wikipedia (unless that information was specific in a technical way, a la GameFAQs, which isn't Wikipedia's thing anyway).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article serves no encyclopedic purpose, and each major revision only adds more game-guide-style detail (such as specific accuracy/damage, specific chances of inflicting a status effect, etc.) - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 22:09, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> It is inappropriate to discuss attacks in Pokémon articles, as not every attack is a signature attack of some Pokémon, and some Pokémon have the same signature attacks. Many things which may be “plainly obvious” to you will not be to the average wiki reader( as is always mentioned in Pokémon FA noms. While minor trainers may be interchangeable, I challenge you to have your attacks randomly replaced with different ones in battle and say it makes no difference. I think there is a place in Wikipedia for nontechnical descriptions and lists of attacks. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidSmaht_d49d.html" title="User:WikidSmaht">WikidSmaht</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidSmaht_41da.html" title="User talk:WikidSmaht">talk</a>) 03:06, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>:Although this is not intended to be a strategy guide to the game, a cross-reference to any attacks/moves that are listed in other articles, eg. the signature moves, are probably best kept in a section for the moves. Do we really want (probably) different descriptions of a given move that is particular to certain Pokémon? For example, (and I paraphrase here): "Growlithe are difficult to catch ... because of their Roar ability"... ok, so what is Roar? And, with so many other Pokémon also having Roar, is a page on one specific Pokémon (in this case Growlithe) necessarily the appropriate place to discuss such an attack available to several different Pokémon? Of course, this is not the place for detailed stats such as accuracy, damage, etc., but a general description of each attack, written in a prosaic style to match the rest of Wikipedia, may be in order. <a href="../../../o/v/e/User%7EOverlordKain_bb11.html" title="User:OverlordKain">Kain</a> 00:26, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't understand what makes her different or special enough from any other faculty member. Generally most faculty members are running some kind of "Center" these days and the fact that one of her parents died of cancer, while tragic, doesn't make her so unique that she merits an entry into Wikipedia. Also, the fact that her youngest sibling was 5 years at one point isn't that special either. Has she been able to repeat her success with other animals? Or was Koko a one time wonder?

<li>This is one of those cases where people who lack understanding or awareness of an article's subject should not nominate them for deletion. Either that, of you have some kooky agenda. Looking at your contributions history, most of what you do around here is nominate things for deletion. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 23:22, 22 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If Danny hasn't read a newspaper in years, how does he know Dr. Patterson? Should we give more weight to his vote if he knows her personally and lacks objectivity? If you look at what I have done, you will see that most other people agree with me when I suggest something should be deleted. Therefore, it's not just me saying something should be deleted, but rather, the Wikipedia community as a whole agrees. I'm sorry but these ad hominem attacks will have no bearing on whether the article is kept or deleted. We99 23:26, 22 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know if you're too young, or what, but this is a well-known, notable person from a well-known, notable news story. I doubt Danny knows Dr. Patterson personally. So I question your motives. This is a bad faith nomination, period. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 23:31, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't know why you are trying to shut down discussion on whether this article should be deleted. If she is really distinguishable from many other professors -- let's keep the article. All I'm saying is that if we had to include every professor who ran a "Center" or published a book (semi-well known or not) of one-hit wonder professors, the quality of Wikipedia would go down. Why hasn't she been able to replicate her results? A good measure of someone's contribution is being able to replicate the results somewhere else. We99 23:38, 22 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe you should have used {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} instead?

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think yelling at me with "BAD FAITH" in <b>bold</b> makes your argument stronger. It just means you are resorting to ad hominem, which is a fallacy. If she is truly notable, the Wikipedia community will find her to be that way. Maybe we should focus the discussion on what makes her more worthy than a lot of other professors who have published but aren't in Wikipedia. Are we going to include every professor who publishes a semi-noteworthy book? We99 23:51, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> High numbers of Google hits isn't notability. Are all those 20,500 hits of Francine Patterson the same Francine Patterson that we are talking about on Wikipedia. If not, I submit that your argument has been made in bad faith, because it's misleading. You're trying to imply that she is more popular than she really is. In any event, Koko never used ASL signs. Non-signing people saw them where there were none. Ape sign language is a pipe dream. See Pinker, S. The Language Instinct. Also, as the article currently stands, it doesn't meet Wikipedia standards. notice that someone else nominated it for cleanup. So it's not just me who has problems with this. We99 23:59, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Cleanup is far different from deletion, and let's leave our debate at that. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 00:01, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think she is notable and I've made my arguments. Since this is not a vote we should discount the two speedy keeps and look at whether ape sign language is really a pipe dream. If you don't believe me, check out the book I cited. We99 00:23, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Obvious keep</b>. I've heard of her, and it has nothing to do with my newspaper reading habits, it has to do with her work being discussed in one of my university classes umpty-ump years and the long-time big freakin' controversy regarding the validity of her work. On the latter score, it looks like the nominator has decided the work is bogus and is trying to get the article deleted on that basis. Uh uh: the work is controversial but <b>very well known</b>, which is what counts more than one editor's opinion of what the truth is. It <i>does</i> look like a bad-faith nomination, given that most of the nominator's arguments is made up of vigorous handwaving. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:37, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> it seems the people who want to keep her can't support her science so they turn to the fact that they have heard of her as a reason for keeping the article. Seriously, look at the article. It's not notable that her mom died of cancer. Her proclaimed contribution is of questionable scientific value, and the article doesn't cut the standards of Wikipedia. I'm sorry, but 2 years have passed since its creation. If we can't clean it up to meet the standards, it's because the content of what we have to say about her is not worthy to be on Wikipedia. Also the fact that she has reviews on Amazon means nothing. Anyone can write a review on Amazon. Merely because people have "heard" of her is not a reason. A lot of people who have heard of freeones.com but that does not mean we need to have an entry for it in Wikipedia. We99 07:34, 23 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Only since none of the key policies other than <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> have been cited yet and I'm assuming that you're simply unaware of them rather than pushing a bad faith agenda: It is completely irrelevant what we think of her science. The key criteria for inclusion are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>. For an article to warrant inclusion the subject must have garnered enough scholarly or media attention that any editor can write a balanced article, based only on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, without any foreknowledge of the subject. Patterson has clearly received ample scholarly and media attention, and not all of it positive or flattering. If you're so adamant about this book you're touting, quote from it in the article and see if it stands the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> test. Whatever your scientific objections are to her research, an AfD is not the right outlet for it. And I'm writing this as someone who hasn't called your nomination in <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">bad faith</a> yet. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 08:05, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, AfD Is Not Cleanup (or Source Check). Solid or questionable observations aside, I heard of Koko and her landlord years ago. From television. From books. From everywhere. I was quite a fan of apes and monkeys at one point, see. =) And in Wikipedia, it doesn't matter if the <i>subject</i> is truthful or not, as long as <i>the article</i> is truthful and accurate. We have a <a href="../../../h/o/a/Category%7EHoaxes_f08a.html" title="Category:Hoaxes">category full of hoaxes</a>, for crying out loud. In conclusion, either we have here someone who taught sign language to a gorilla, or a scientific "scandal" that has stood at the verge of mere suspicion for a couple of decades.

<dd>Yes, good point - my apologies. I refer you to the article's talk page where the saga can be found. Basically, the subject was perpetrator of an adolescent (so-called greenlighting) hoax, and in the brief publicity flicker surrounding the event, his (self-authored,vanity) page became a touchstone for disagreement. One year later, however, this should be accepted as simply a flash in the pan; the notability of the subject is highly questionable. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 10:33, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Passed two VFDs already. Wikipedia should strive for inclusion, not exclusion, of content. Subject writes for numerous publications with huge circulations. Why should someone who wants to understand more about the name behind the byline not be able to get that information from Wikipedia? Just today Farivar's byline appears in the San Francisco Chronicle with no other biographical information. Why should people who write for large publications not be discussed in Wikipedia? The suggestion that Farivar's article should have existed only because of the Greenlighting story is bogus.
