Ariocarpus Fissuratus is a species of extremely slow growing cacti found in rare numbers in Mexico and the southern United States. Commonly called "living rocks," these cacti usually blend in well with the terrain around them. They are greyish-green in color, sometimes taking on a yellowish tint with age. These cacti consist of many small tubercules growing from a large tap root. They are usually solitary, rarely giving rise to side shoots from old areoles. These cacti are difficult to spot in their natural habitat. When they are found, it is usually due to their pinkish flowers.</p>

<p>In culivation, Ariocarpus Fissuratus is often grafted to a faster growing columnar cactus to speed growth, as they would generally take at least a decade to reach maturity on their own. They require very little water and fertilizer, a good amount of light, and a loose sandy soil with good drainage.</p>

<p>Ariocarpus Fissuratus is a unique species in that is has been used by Native American tribes as a mind altering substance. While it does not contain mescaline like many other North American cactus species (such as Lophophora Williamsii A.K.A. Peyote), it is purported to contain other mind altering substances, and is commonly referred to as the "False Peyote," "Peyote Cimmaron," or simply "Sunami."</p>

<p>Who is Katie Mitigo? Well, I don't know, so don't ask me! OK, I lied. She is a person, alive or dead it doesn't really matter; whichever one you want it to be. If she is dead, than stop reading this page, as it would be of no use to you! But if she is alive, well then. Katie happens to be a very good friend of mine; I met her once on a beach on the Western coast. She is very fun, though she asks a lot of questions and often comes up with random stories. A section is devoted to these random stories. Anyway, you may think that this is good and all, but what's the point? See, Katie is very different from the rest of us.</p>

<p>Katie has two parents, a mom and a dad, and all live in the city of Debrina, in the country of Iforget(never heard of it? It came from my imagination.) Her last name, Mitigo, is latin for "to soothe". Actually, her country, KURAMACARA which for right now is Iforget, is in a war with a neighboring country called SHANG YANG. The strange thing is, they are just fighting because of anger and greed. See, there was once a paradise, where everything was, of course, perfect. Then, some barbarians took over the utopia and turned it into a slave place. There eventually was a Resistance, which won, but the fear was still there. It goes like this: there was fear of being controlled, then fight for freedom, then fear of the civilians from all the fighting and war, and so it turned into a big mess; no one can trust another because of fear, and the war goes on. Its a complicated psychological process</p>

<p>Katie Mitigo has a destiny. Now wait, I'm not saying that <i>we</i> don't have destinies,but that that she is predestined to find and spread the truth of this war. No one on Earth is predestined like she, unless you are Calvinist. The thing is,everyone has forgotten why they were fighting for centuries, and just kept fighting their forever "enemies". In order to stop the counrty's paranoia, she must learn this past, and spread the word. Why? Because in a matter of months, a terrorist group is going to wipe out everyone on the planet, innocent and guilty.</p>

<p>One day, I walked to the grocery store and saw a banana! (Ok, just kidding. I made that up. Here is the real story) Last Saturday I woke up with my sister-that-doesn't-really-exist yelling into my ear, "Enna, wake up! There is a fish stuck in a cherry tree outside!" As soon as she said this, two things popped into my mind. First, that my name wasn't Enna, it was Katie. Enna was actually my sister-that-doesn't-really-exist's name. Second, that how can a fish be stuck in a cherry tree! Fish don't grow in cherry trees, cherries do! But then I thought, that can't be right either; that would mean that a pit is in a tree too, but it isn't, it is the pit of my stomach. And that would mean that I was a cherry on a tree. I look up to tell my homosexual-cousin-that-doesn't-really-exist this, but all I see is a bunch of leaves and branches, and a great big red herring sitting in front of me. --Eliza C. Hamilton</p>

<p>Andre Wadsworth(b. 1975) was born in Miami and played for the Florida St. Seminoles football team from 1994-1998. He gained acclaim as an interior force during his first three years at FSU, then exploded on the national scene after a move to defensive end produced dominant results leading to his selection by the Arizona Cardinals number 3 overall in the 1998 draft. That, unfortunately, was the high point of his NFL career as Wadsworth was plagued with injuries his entire time in the league. Wadsworth finally retired in 2002 and is now living in Chandler, AZ. He now splits his time between volunteering for his church and creating interactive fantasy programs for children called unicorncorp.</p>

<p>Red Alert is a semi-group ran by one Richizzard Fryer who knows almost every girl with lowered expectations on the Miami University web-page. It is a fan group who bribes you with points to go to sports events to garner prizes such as 1.00 off free admission to events. It is basically a waste of a student group.</p>

<p>Look at the discussion regarding the anon edits in {Illegal immigration in the United States}. Two admins are trying to force me to cease editing as an anon. They have done this by misusing the sockpuppet tag (Wiki policy specifically states these tags "should not be added in the case of accusations of sock puppetry which have not been proven, nor should they be added in the case of an legitimate alternate account, especial where the user may wish to maintain anonymity. Abuse of these tags will result in warning and potential blocking." I want to point out that these admins have provided no commentary with these tags providing specific verifiable evidence of abuse by myself in using these multiple IPs. The IPs disputed are 198.97.67.59, 198.97.67.56, 198.97.67.57, 198.97.67.58, and 71.74.209.82 The admins are Will Beback and Jossi.</p>

<p>Pla, Josep (Jose) I 1728-1762 Spain,? - Germany, Stuttgart brother of Joan and Manuel.</p>
<p>Album: Catalan Flute Music of the 18th Century.</p>
<p>Jos√© (=Giuseppe), Juan (=Giovanni Baptista), and Manuel. There are variant spellings of the family name: Blasa, Blas (Schubart‚Äôs spelling), Blass, Le Plats, Pla, Plaa, Plach, Plah, Plai, Plas, Plat, Plats, Plaz. Much confusion clouds the biographical information about these brothers. In many cases, references to these Spanish oboists (and composers) are by family name only. In 1752, two brothers (unspecified) from Madrid arrived in Paris and, according to Fetis in his Biographi universelle des musiciens et bibliographie g√©n√©rale de la musique, performed in the Concerts Spirituel. In the same year, Jos√© and Juan travelled to Stuttgart and were employed (ca. 1754) by the grand duke, Karl Alexander, of W√ºrttemberg. Two of the brothers may have been in London around 1760. In 1761, Juan died in Suttgart. Jos√© continued in the duke‚Äôs service until 1763, when he went to Amsterdam until 1776. (This, according to F√©tis; other sources state that his whereabouts were unknown or that he returned to Spain.) Some of his works were printed in Amsterdam in 1776. From 1782 to 1789, the elder and younger Pl√° were in Germany. Richard Sanchez cites Subira, who states that ‚ÄúIn 1783-84) Pla the elder and the younger were part of the chapel orchestra in Mannheim. Also that same ‚ÄòAlmanac of Music‚Äô in the volume for 1789 includes the name of Manuel Pl√° among the composers who live in German countries.‚Äù The Musikalischer Almanach f√ºr Deutschland auf das Jahr 1782 [hereafter MAfD] lists the oboists of the Mannheim court, but no mention is made of the Pl√° brothers. The 1782 and 1783 almanacs indicated that the Pl√° brothers were formerly at Ludwigsburg but no mention is made of their whereabouts at that time. The MAfD 1789, p. 86, lists ‚ÄúPlats‚Äù but no other information is supplied. See Richard Xavier Sanchez, ‚ÄúSpanish Chamber Music of the Eighteenth Century‚Äù (Ph.D. dissertation, Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, 1975), 46-52, 279-81. A recent article corrects Fetis. See Beryl Kenyon de Pascual, ‚ÄúJuan Baptisa Pla and Jos√© Pla: Two Neglected Oboe Virtuosi of the 18th Century,‚Äù Early Music 18 (February 1990): 109-10. 33Schubart must be referring to the inseparability of Castor and Pollux, who were brothers. In one version of the legend, Castor was killed and Pollux prayed that he too might die. Zeus took pity and allowed Pollux to be with Castor and that they would spend half their time beneath the earth and the other half in heaven.</p>

<p>A brushless generator consists of a part that spins called an armature, this is most often connected to your engines flywheel, and a part that doesn't spin, this is called the stator. When the engine starts to spin the armature, residual magnetism in the armature induces a small voltage in the output windings of the stator, most often over 10 volts, but not allot more.</p>
<p>This voltage is converted to a DC current by the voltage regulator, which is connected to a second set of windings in the stator, called the exciter windings. This DC current in the exciter windings forms an electro magnet, which induces an ac current in the matching exciter windings in the armature. The exciter windings in the armature are connected to units called rotating rectifiers which convert (rectify) the AC current into DC current.</p>
<p>The DC output of the rotating rectifiers is connected to the main windings in the armature. This current creates an electro magnet in the armature, which induces a larger voltage into the output windings of the stator. The voltage regulator uses this increased voltage to produce more DC current, and the cycle continues until the generator reaches full operating voltage.</p>
<p>When the generator output reaches full operating voltage, the generator voltage regulator reduces the amount of DC current that it produces, thus in effect lowering the output voltage of the generator. At the correct output voltage, with a non changing load on the generator, the voltage regulator comes into a state of equilibrium where it produces just enough current to keep the generator producing the correct output voltage.</p>
<p>If you add load to the generator, the first thing that happens is that the output voltage drops a little. The generator voltage regulator increases the amount of current it produces, raising the voltage back to it's proper level. If you reduce the load on the generator, just the opposite occurs. The output voltage goes up, and the voltage regulator reduces the amount of DC current that it produces, and the voltage drops.</p>

<p>Oscar Ghiglia was born in 1938 in Livorno, Italy, to a pianist mother and a painter father. While attending Rome's Santa Cecilia Convervatory, he participated in Segovia's summer master classes in Siena and Santiago de Compostela. His graduation from the Conservatory in 1962 was followed by several important awards: First Prize in the Orense Guitar Competition, First Prize in the Santiago de Compostela Guitar Competition and First Prize in the Radio France International Guitar Competition.</p>
<p>In 1964, Andr√©s Segovia invited Ghiglia to be his assistant in master classes in California. Since then, Oscar Ghiglia has given concerts and masterclasses throughout the world. In addition to appearing extensively in all parts of North and South America and Europe, he is a frequent performer in the Far East, Israel, Argentina, New Zealand and the South Pacific, and has recorded for Angel and Nonesuch Records.</p>
<p>While being active as a concert artist, Ghiglia has always favored teaching as a sister profession. Very few well-known guitarists today have not at one time or another been in his classes and profited from his lessons. Oscar Ghiglia is currently professor of guitar at the Basel Music-Akademie where he teaches post-graduate students and gives summer courses in Europe, America and the Middle East. He established the classical guitar summer program at Aspen, CO, and taught there for twenty years. He now regularly gives summer classes at the Festival d'Arc in southern France, at the Chigi Academy in Siena, Italy, and at the Festival Garnanno (Italy).</p>

<p>Michael Lorimer, a favorite prot√©g√© of Andr√©s Segovia, caught the eye of American audiences in the early 1970's through tours arranged by the great impresario Sol Hurok. Lorimer was the first American guitarist invited to perform in the USSR and toured there extensively in 1975 and 1977. He has appeared in Israel, Cuba, throughout Europe, on most North American recital series, with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and Orpheus, with Kronos, and with the orchestras of Atlanta, Baltimore, Indianapolis, Louisville, New Orleans and San Francisco.</p>
<p>While an enthusiastic exponent of new music and of traditional classics, Michael is also the first world-class guitarist to regularly feature the baroque guitar in recital. Twenty years ago, long before the present vogue in original instruments, Lorimer was a pioneer bringing attention to the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century predecessor to the modern instrument. By the mid-1970's one London critic said "If Lorimer is not the best baroque guitarist in the world at present, the competition has still to present itself." In 1987, Michael Lorimer brought to light a milestone of the guitar repertoire, the best surviving collection for any instrument of early eighteenth-century Spanish dance music, when he published a detailed study and facsimile of the Sald√≠var Codex N¬∫ 4, a large, hitherto anonymous manuscript from a private collection in Mexico, and identified it as the companion volume to the British Library manuscript Pasacalles y Obras (1732), a legacy of Santiago de Murcia.</p>
<p>In addition to concerts, Michael Lorimer gives master classes at North American universities and conservatories from coast to coast. He is an engaging spokesman in demand for experimental programs in arts presentation. During the academic years 1980-1982, he was Distinguished Professor of Music at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. His most recently released recording Remembranza (distributed by Windham Hill) is a tribute to Andr√©s Segovia.</p>

<p>Ray Musicbear, one of the "first" self-proclaimed "Bear" musicians, songwriters and performers to emerge on the GLBTI, i.e. (Gay, Lesbian, Bi-Sexual; Transgender &amp; Intersexed) music scene. Identified as a "founding father" of the Gay Male Bear Music Movement, started in the late 90's. Ray Musicbear set the "standard" for today's growing list of Gay males who call themselves, "Bear Artists."</p>
<p>Working with a group of local musicians Ray Musicbear made his debut with his first CD, "Musicbear: Music By A Bear For The Bear Community," on Ski Hill Records, a collection of self-penned folkie ballads.</p>
<p>He pursed a career as a "Bear" coffeehouse performer, openly professing his "Bearness &amp; Gayness" to a very warm &amp; brotherly audience of acoustic music fans.</p>
<p>Re-inventing himself, Ray Musicbear set out to widen his appeal, and hopefully his audience with some drastic musical changes.</p>
<p>Moving into the genre of electronic dance music, hoping to capture the ears of the larger and more "mainstream" (GLBTI) Community, Ray Musicbear recorded his second, self-produced CD, "Dance Musicbear," for Ski Hill Records. On this sophomore release, Ray Musicbear proved that he had the knack for electronic dance music production, and could boogie down with the masses.</p>
<p>Musicbear managed to capture the ears of the "Bear Community" with a dance version of what has become an anthem in the Bear Community, "Teddy Bear." The song remains a classic example of what "Bear Music" has become today.</p>
<p>Re-inventing himself a third time, Ray Musicbear moved on to show tunes, polished pop and "Out" Gay tunes. On his third release, "BUDDY," for Ski Hill Records, he combined his love of folk and electronic music into a mainstream pop package.</p>
<p>Coming full circle, Ray Musicbear has now returned to the Folk Music genre. Accompanying himself on the acoustic guitar, with vocals, Ray Musicbear has returned to the world of coffee houses and folk festivals, to re-joined the warm and wonderful world of acoustic folk music. Its good to be back home...</p>

<p><b>Fan boats</b> are flat-bottomed <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punt_%28boat%29.html" title="Punt (boat)">punts</a> powered by a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propeller.html" title="Propeller">propeller</a> attached to an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">automobile</a> or <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft.html" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a> <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engine.html" title="Engine">engine</a>. The propeller has the typical shape and size of an <a href="../../../f/i/x/Fixed-wing_aircraft.html" title="Fixed-wing aircraft">airplane</a> propeller and so requires a large metal cage to protect passengers and other users. The flat bottom allows air boats to navigate easily through shallow <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swamp.html" title="Swamp">swamps</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marsh.html" title="Marsh">marshes</a> as well as in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canal.html" title="Canal">canals</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/v/River.html" title="River">rivers</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake.html" title="Lake">lakes</a>. The driver sits high on a platform to improve visibility and to permit spotting floating obstacles and animals in the path of the boat. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steering.html" title="Steering">Steering</a> is accomplished by swivelling vertical <a href="../../../f/i/n/Fin.html" title="Fin">fins</a> positioned in the propeller wash, so control is a function of current, wind, water depth and propeller <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrust.html" title="Thrust">thrust</a>. <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crab_landing.html" title="Crab landing">Crabbing</a> into the wind or current is required. The <a href="../../../n/o/i/Noise_%28environmental%29.html" title="Noise (environmental)">noise</a> from the propeller and engine is quite loud. Air boats vary in size from 18 person tour boats to trail boats carried on a road trailer and suitable for two or three passengers.</p>
<p>Fan boats are a very popular means of transportation in the <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everglades.html" title="Everglades">Everglades</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>, where they are used for <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunting.html" title="Hunting">hunting</a>, and <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourist.html" title="Tourist">tourist</a> rides.</p>
<p>Safety knowledge is an important aspect of airboating. The normal airboat throws off 150 miles an hour winds behind it, and if a tree branch gets into a propeller the spray of material could be very dangerous. Airboat hulls can be aluminum or fiberglass, and selection can depend on the type of terrain chosen. There are no major airboat manufactures in the United States. This is still a mom and pop industry of "assemblers" who normally build to order. Typically a truck or airplane engine is position on the bank of the boat with a 2 or 3 blade propeller.</p>

<p>The Chadonius incident is the worst instance of OffTopic anger and banning in the history of the message board, and one of the most notable on the Internet. It began when a poster name Chadonius called himself an internet revolutionary and flooded the board with his messages calling for a calmer OffTopic atmosphere. He was permabanned, and alternately three "Chadonius Revolutionaries" tried to enter the boards and were banned.</p>
<p>For months, calm remained until the night of August 5, 2006, in which MrJenkins declared himself to be the prophet whom Chadonius had said would declare the second coming of Chadonius. MrJenkins said that two prophets would follow him, and that Chadonius would then return. MrJenkins was also met with heavy criticism and banning.</p>
<p>Despite constant bans, the Chadonius movement has been hard to restrain. One estimate on the boards said that there were around 50 revolutionaries, while another claimed the number was closer to 300. In response to the growing "revolution", OffTopic entrance has become more difficult, and has led to speculation whether the boards will have to close down. Other message boards have also taken measures to prevent widespread problems like the ones facing the OffTopic message boards. One estimate claimed that within five years, 40 other major boards would become infested with the movement as well.</p>

<p><i><b>Desilets v. Clearview Regional Board of Education</b></i>, <a href="../../../c/a/s/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">647 A.2d. 150</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>) was a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_Supreme_Court_831a.html" title="New Jersey Supreme Court">New Jersey Supreme Court</a> decision that held that public school curricular student newspapers that have not been established as forums for student expression are subject to a lower level of First Amendment protection than independent student expression or newspapers established (by policy or practice) as forums for student expression. It was decided on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_13.html" title="January 13">January 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> in favor of <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazelwood_School_District_c95c.html" title="Hazelwood School District">Hazelwood School District</a>, overruling a Court of Appeals reversal of a District Court ruling.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Decision:</b> For Hazelwood School District.</p>
<p><b>Basis:</b> The First Amendment Freedom of Speech clause was not violated by the school district because the First Amendment protection for student expression described in <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tinker_v._Des_Moines_3e5b.html" title="Tinker v. Des Moines">Tinker v. Des Moines</a> Community Independent School District, <a href="../../../c/a/s/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">393 U.S. 503</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>) does not compel a public school to affirmatively sponsor speech that conflicts with its educational goals. The school-funded newspaper at issue was also not considered to be a public forum under the totality of circumstances present in the case, and therefore, its editors were entitled to a lower level of First Amendment protection than is applicable to independent student newspapers or those newspapers that have, by policy or practice, opened their pages to student opinion.</p>
<p><b>Precedent:</b> Under the First Amendment, school officials can censor curricular, non-forum student newspapers when they can justify their decision with a legitimate pedagogical (i.e., educational) justification. Subsequent decisions, such as the decision in <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_v._Utica_Community_Schools_3edf.html" title="Dean v. Utica Community Schools">Dean v. Utica Community Schools</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/s/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">345 F.Supp.2d 799</a> (E.D. Mich. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>), have made clear that this is not carte blanche for school officials to censor articles wantonly or based on personal opinion.</p>
<p>Note also that some states have passed laws guaranteeing that curricular, non-forum newspapers (those at issue in Hazelwood) have greater rights than the First Amendment requires.</p>

<p>Australian singer/actor. Appeared in the Australian production of Disney's The Lion King in Sydney, Melbourne and Shanghai China.</p>
<p>Her website has this to say "Aussie-born bombshell Amy Edwards is well on her way to making her mark on the Australian music scene. The stunning 19-year-old of Maltese and Australian heritage, possesses a powerful singing voice that conjures up feelings and experiences way beyond her years.</p>
<p>Amy began performing at the age of seven, as most young girls do, taking dance classes in ballet, tap and jazz. It began as just fun a hobby I used to do with my friends but over time it grew into something I waited all week for,</p>
<p>Two years later, at the age of nine she added modern and contemporary dance, singing and drama to her studies. From there she was offered a scholarship to the prestigious Sydney-based McDonald College of Performing Arts, where she studied a mixture of classical ballet and jazz dancing. After two years at the college, it was discovered that Amy had more than just one talent excelling not only in dance but also in music. With an eagerness to learn about her new talent, she changed into a music major and found that her true passion was singing. It was definitely a turning point, I realised I could sing and I couldnt wait to try-out my newfound medium.</p>
<p>Over the next two years she worked on her talent through song writing and recording, vocal, dance and drama lessons and various performances venues of which include Sydneys Opera House and Angel Place.</p>
<p>In 2002, at the age of 15 Amy was chosen to work on an all-girl group for Sony Records however unfortunately the group spilt before a contract could be signed. It was disheartening, but in the end it showed me that I did have something that was appealing as an artist there is always a silver lining.</p>
<p>Amy then moved on to do a one-year full-time performing arts course at Brent Street studios, which led her to be signed by Detour Management. Amy list among her highlights performing solo at the Star City showroom in Sydney and being apart of the group that won the Australian jazz dance championships.</p>
<p>Soon after completing the course she successfully audition for Disneys The Lion King being cast as a singer/dancer swing which meant she had to cover up to 12 different parts in the show. The Lion King was an eye-opening experience, it gave me a taste of the real world performing for over 2000 people each night.</p>
<p>After being with the show for 15 months 12 of which were spent in Melbourne, three spent in Shanghai Amy chose not to continue on with the show and moved to Sydney.</p>
<p>She is currently developing her sound, recording and song writing whilst modelling and acting part time. Describing her sound as edgy, soulful and sexy she says about her music that if I cant move to it, I know its just not happening.</p>
<p>Amy has proven herself a force to be reckoned with and will stop at nothing to achieve her dreams. The message is clear Amy is the next big thing; the only question is who will be lucky enough to sign this shooting star."1</p>

<p>Troponin C is a calcium-binding protein with similar homology to calmodulin. It forms part of the troponin complex. The binding of calcium produces a conformational change which modulates the activity of other proteins. This is vital to the functioning of skeletal and cardiac muscle where formation of the complex triggers activation of contractile proteins</p>

<p>Milo Wolff is an American physicist who is credited with discovering a theory that elegantly explains how matter is created out of waves in the fabric of Space.</p>
<p>Briefly, Milo mathematically proves that matter consists of standing spherical waves made from a spherical scalar (not vector) incoming wave, and a spherical scalar outgoing wave where the central point of these waves is the subatomic particle, eg. an electron.</p>
<p>He mathematically proves that this model has the potential to answer possibly all the outstanding questions of Quantum mechanics, including As examples, the 2-slit experiment, and EPR experiment, and a quantum eraser.</p>

Dani√´l Lohues is best spoken of as a singer/songwriter from 'Erica', a place in the Netherlands. He is in a band called 'Skik' who make a sort of a pop/rock music. Alongside that he's also been active as a solo-musician. In 2006 he gathered a bunch of songs from a theatherprogramme that he played. He didn't want for the songs to 'dissapear' so to speak, and therefore he had them compiled at a CD called 'allenig' which means something like 'lonely'. The songs vary from very happy and funny to ballads with a more sad character. Some of the songs could even be called 'dylanesque'.</p>
<p>Lohues is cousin to Harry Muskee, a famous dutch blues-singer known from the band 'Cuby and the Blizzards'.</p>

<p>Knightsbridge is a board game by <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Hartnell_53fe.html" title="Tim Hartnell">Tim Hartnell</a>.</p>
<p>It is played on a 7x7 board by two players (white and black). Every player has seven pieces, numbered 1-7. You also need a cards with numbers 1-7.</p>
<p>Board setup: put the white pieces on the first line (bottom row), put the black pieces on the seventh line (top row).</p>
<p>White starts by drawing a random card (1-7) and moving the white piece with the corresponding number. If the number is out of the game, take another card. Players alternate turns. Every pawn moves like the chess knight. Capture is done by landing on the square of an enemy piece. The player who captures 5 enemy pieces, wins.</p>

<p>Coming out of Rome, Italy, 60 Were Enough is a contemporary jazz trio consisting of Jacopo Ruggeri on guitars, Luciano Poli on electric and acoustic basses, and Paolo Cavalieri on drums. Their sound is influenced by the newer generation of improvisational, instrumental music, typified by Medeski, Martin and Wood, as well as slightly older sonic explorers like David Torn and Steve Coleman. To label this music as "Acid Jazz" would not quite do it justice. 60 Were Enough remains true to the old school philosophy of fusion from the 1970's and their recordings center around the live performance aspect of the trio, with a minimum of added textures from sequencers, synthesizers and the like, that are pandemic in the majority of today's jazz/electronica crossovers. Like their ancestors in fusion, 60 Were Enough's music is based around complex rhythmic structures: odd time signatures, syncopated bass lines, etc., but this never devolves into a self-absorbed, esoteric and ultimately dry technical exercise. This music is groove based, and it remains something you can feel as well as think about.</p>

<p>The Drive at Five is the segment on the station that plays songs for people on their way home from work. One aspect that is special is that they often have "Lead-Foot Alerts" for people that enjoy speeding, to give them a warning of areas that are heavily patrolled that day.

There is also a clip played ~15 minutes into the The Drive at Five from that morning's BOB &amp; TOM Show.</p>

David charles Strohm Jr. was born June 1st 1979 to Rose and John Strohm (famous guitarist <b>Blake Babies</b>,lawyer in his own right)A monicker placed upon him by school yard chums since childhood, he has taken this ego and expanded upon it each year. 1997 saw one David Charles Strohm Jr. graduate high school and move on to the dulldroms of factory life in his hometown of beautiful Paris Ontario also known as the prettiest town in Canada. in 1998 Strohmer started becoming interested in upcoming rogers cable star Tom Green. He started a home website www3.sympatico.ca/dstrohm/index.htm which tracked Green at all times. Leagues of fansite wannabe's called into radio stations such as 102.1 the edge in Toronto to tell Tom of his lookalike fan who is tracking him down. The hosts suggested Tom cash checks in Dave's name and start habitating the Paris area. The first meeting between the two took place after the Mike Bullard show, in which Tom tried relentlessly to ditch Dave who used a similar brand of comedy to entertain only himself. Dave was able to track Mr. Green and his buddy and Tom Green show producer Derek Harvie where he dawned a disguise and sat down at their table. Tom mortified ran off yet again. a few weeks later during a show filming for the Dini Petty show, Strohmer dawned the disguise of Bill Gates and infiltrated the show. After doing some standup comedy for the audience ahead of the show, He convinced Dini to somehow get him onto the show and foil Tom's plans to harass the audience. Sure enough, Dini threw him an apple and all 3 had an apple eating contest, with Strohmer eating his way to victory. Tom had an appauling on air rant about Dave being a loser like "Bill Gates" and stomped off the air. Dave continued to tail him to other canadian shows such as CBC televisions Jonovision where he sprayed Tom with milk before the audience members could be sprayed by Tom.</p>
<p>Dave has since performed the same stunts against other such superstars as Canadian Hawksley Workman, Sarah Slean, John Southworth, and Joe Thornton</p>
<p>A big fan of The Smiths, he engaged Raul X in usenet performance art inside of the smiths newsgroup. now both who are considered founders of the confusing yet social schizophrentic art. It is still unknown who Paul is, and if Raul is indeed Paul or if this is all just a figment of the internet's imagination</p>
<p>Dave currently performs standup comedy downtown London Ontario in Yuk Yuks as well as the local circuit in Toronto, and is currently working on putting together an 8 man stage play featuring the beginning of the earth to present set to open sometime in the spring of 2007 in Toronto Ontario Canada.</p>

<p>A series of movies independently produced by the future generation of this country. The main focus of A. U R B A N PRODUCTIONS is about creating films from every Tom, Dick, and Harry to the amusing RICH BASTARD(S) of corporate America. Yeah, let me wink and pocket 15 million. Take the cotton balls out of your ears and stop looking in the mirror. Go read a book or write a screenplay. Be the town bicycle? Dig your own grave. Spit in your enemy‚Äôs face. We are too cynical to speak. One would label A. U R B A N PRODUCTIONS as a consort of catholic school girls trying to make it honest. But hey, we're not breaking any rules...</p>
<p>Put that in your pipe and smoke it Steven Spielberg.</p>
<p>Created by filmmaker Abby Urban in 2005. A. U R B A N PRODUCTIONS has produced 7 films in their series. Urban herself has created 14. She says, "I only think those 7 are worth showing people." I met Abby at the New York Film Academy in the summer of 2006. I was very impressed with her final project. The editing was superb and the content was clear. While teaching her in class, she was very attentive and involved.</p>
<p>Look for Miss Urban in the future because she is one of the young faces in amateur filmmaking today. I am certain she will be mentioned in the future.</p>
<p>Feature films include: Rich Bastard(s) Friend is a Four Letter Word Noel Urbain Redemption</p>

There after, he went on to build Zips, Tapes, Polyesters, Spinners and his master peice the Cement Unit. The unit was delyed due to number of enviroment problems created to delay the project. All the cases were fought tooth and nail all the way from High courts Of Gujarat to the India's Supreeme court. Finally the Cement unit started production in March of 2001. It is this grit that he is known for - establishing grass-root industrial projects and implementing them in record time and costs.

<p>Diclonius („Éá„Ç£„ÇØ„É≠„Éã„Ç¶„Çπ, Dikuroniusu?), a mutant strain of humans who have two horns on their heads and possess telekinetic powers through their "Vectors". Vectors (depicted as invisible "arms") can reach out in a limited range and easily slice through bodies, grab objects and propel them with superhuman strength at targets outside their reach, and even go through bodies without doing damage. Most Diclonius can only manifest two pairs of vectors, however, there are exceptional cases in which very few among these mutant individuals are able to summon multiple pairs of "invisible arms". Also the maximum range and distance at which vectors extend varies among Diclonius. Finally, the vectors are controlled by the pineal gland of the Diclonius which is the size of an egg,[3] in contrast to that of humans which is the size of a pea, and mostly occupies the frontal lobe[4] of their brains. The Diclonius have great contempt and homicidal tendencies toward humans, often viewing them as "inferior", and do not hesitate to kill them. They won't even show mercy at killing other fellow members of their same kin, if they engage in fight against them or see that the latter are associated or attached to humans.</p>

The Settlement of Neuendorf was founded by settlers from Danzig, Germany now [Danzig, Poland] around 1790. These settlers were Mennonites that were invited to help cultivate the agricultural activities of Russia by Catherine the Great, and the Czar's administrator Georg von Trappe. They were promised many privileges and rights that were unique such as maintaining their culture and religious practices, along with their German citizenship.</p>
<p>After scouts were sent out from the Mennonite community in Danzig, settlers started to arrive in Russia in 1789. The region that Neuendorf was located in at the time was refered to as the Chortitza Region, along the Black see of present day Ukraine. Neuendorf was founded one year after the settlers arrived in 1790.</p>

Most of the text is covered in greater detail in the <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chortitza.html" title="Chortitza">Chortitza</a> article and may be the same Neuendorf mentioned there. The link to the source is not helpful but apparently refers the book <i>Neuendorf in Bild und Wort: Chortitzaer-Besirk, Ukraine, 1789-1943</i> by Franz Thiessen or an English translation by Alma M.
