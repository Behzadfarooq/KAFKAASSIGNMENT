<li>You mean "beware of bad-faith votes by new users", not "beware of sockpuppets". They're not sockpuppets if they're different people. I agree that this article should be deleted, and I am certain that the admin will look at the justified votes and see a clear consensus to delete. So there's no reason to go around calling the new users "sockpuppets" without giving evidence.

<dd>Vandals? Fascinating. What did they vandalize? Is being on the losing side of a VfD now considered vandalism?</dd>
<dd>It's not that I'm defending this article existing, but people in this vote are far too keen on attacking new users who don't know the inclusion standards of Wikipedia, and calling them everything from sockpuppets to vandals.

<li><b>Keep</b> I too frequent the forum and before that I used to visit the website that birthed it, <a href="http://dbzuncensored.dbzoa.net/" class="external text" title="http://dbzuncensored.dbzoa.net/" rel="nofollow">DBZ Uncensored</a>. You have to realize that you guys that are voting against it live in a vacuum. The fact is, DBZU has had an enormous impact on the anime community. If it weren't for that site, we wouldn't have edit lists. We wouldn't have uncensored DVD's. That site got the ball rolling. Companies began to realize anime wasn't just for children. It was no longer possible to keep anime fans ignorant. And many others copied his example. Even animenewsnetwork. Psaros has since retired from his website but the web forum still thrives. So of COURSE that's why it was mentioned before the actual website. We probably should have created an entry for the website first. Of course, anime haters would be trolling that entry just as you're all trolling this one. I only visit GameFaqs for the combo guides but I still found the wikipedia entry for their messageboard interesting. I guess the fact that none of you knew George Washington personally makes his life boring and unimportant. Same mentality here. Utils 18:30, Mar 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Oh, interestingly enough, I happened to run across the defintion of sockpuppet voting, and it's used quite out of context here. Thanks guys.</p>
<p>KEEP-Yes this is a user vote. Since you are looking for arguments allow me to present one.</p>
<p>Aside from the obvious argument that Wikipedia has far more obscure entries, and may be in fact what Wikipedia is all about, there is also the fact that this is (or was) in fact the message board of a popular website (DBZ Uncensored). While it was not as popular as Planet Namek(which, as well as its messageboard has its ownt entry), any regular visitor to Planet Namek in it's heyday has heard of this site, and was in fact how I came across this messageboard. Secondly, while you may argue the obscurity of this board, the board is a fact of life. It has been in existance in some form or another for 5 years and will continue to exist for sometime. So it's not like this is really an advertisement or anything. And never, ever during this period has it been "dead".</p>
<p>Not only that, but I feel this entry will more interesting to the reader because pretty much anyone can be welcomed, and is allowed to post anything they want. It should be emphasized that most messageboards can not honestly claim this, as the vast majority of messageboards are far more strongly moderated, although few will admit it to being so(much as Wikipedia claims any article can be posted, but the existance of this page shows that in practice it doesn't). -Piccolo48</p>
<p><br />
In short, I feel this is a solid article.</p>

</ul>
<p>--response: The reason this wasnt done in the first place is because we felt the messageboard had it's own culture, even if it was part of a Dragon Ball Website at one point. Frankly, I do NOT think "obscurity" is a reason to disclude something from here, paricularly when the site this originated from was not "obscure", and is about a culture that \ has and will exist on the internet for a long time. The board WILL eventually get its own domain name, and unless you can name some SOLID AND FAIR GROUND RULES on why this article should NOT be included(ground rules which you feel apply to all Wikipedia articles, which i trust only a webmaster on this sight to make)</p>
<p>To say this article should be voted off because some random people feel it should is, at best, an ad-populum argument that shouldnt apply to an encyclopedia of all places. Place some ground rules, and then explain from there. Piccolo48Piccolo48</p>
