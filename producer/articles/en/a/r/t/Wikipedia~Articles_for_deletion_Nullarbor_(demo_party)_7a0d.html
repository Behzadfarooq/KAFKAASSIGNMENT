<p>Article does not assert notability; looks to be a convention that's been around just under a year. I initially speedied it under CSD A7, but am wondering whether that really applies. Also, someone really needs to brush up on his Latin. -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope"><b><font color="#3D59AB">Merope</font></b></a> 15:18, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>A few reasons nullarbor is noteworthy/important: 1. It is the only demoparty in Australia 2. It has the biggest demo scene presence in Australia. 3. It is a major part of GO3 - a very large event, including companys such as Epic, lucas arts, nVidia, midway. 4. It supports Perth's IGDA and Siggraph. 5. It is now running for its 2nd year, not 1.</p>
<p>Also, how is nullarbor any less/more notable than: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7DX_(demo_party)" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7DX_(demo_party)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7DX_(demo_party)</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_demo_party" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_demo_party" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_demo_party</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundown_(party)" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundown_(party)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundown_(party)</a> etc...</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the delete nominators need to check all that is linked with <b><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_demoparties.html" title="List of demoparties">List of demoparties</a></b> before they get too carried away. I dont support the article - because it is obvious that the red link user who is creating the article is either organiser or the actual promoter of the event! The user has not even had any editors courtesy of putting a welcome and warning about either 'advertisement' or 'original research' - the notability issue looks like a furphy - its the self penned article that someone needs to explain to a new user for a start! <a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatuSuro_2646.html" title="User talk:SatuSuro">SatuSuro</a> 15:45, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well I've now learned an Australian slang word - furphy. I don't have that many problems with the article itself, it looks like the editor made the wise decision to make it similar to the existing demoparties articles. Admittedly it could use some cleanup, but that wasn't part of my reasoning. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 16:19, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yes, user who created article is a co-organizer of the event. Yes, I am a new user, and I would be happy to put some kind of disclaimer about it or whatever. As such, I don't know how to argue whats notable and whats not, I'm not sure how to argue the 'reliablility', the event was co-organized by the australian Department of Industry and Resources, which seems to be what is required in terms of notablility? (government org), and was also organized with Edith Cowan University (academic org). Plus plenty of other organizations (ACM SIGGRAPH, IGDA, etc.) Because of the name, its difficult to assert its 'notability' independantly, (since you cant just google for nullarbor) , but google "nullarbor game" returns 43k results and "nullarbor plain" returns 133k results, making this event about 1/3rd as notable as the nullarbor plain, which I'd say is pretty notable..&#160;? In my opinion nullarbor is more notable than many of the other demopartys or game development competitions already listed in wikipedia.</p>
<p>I should stress nullarbor is a free, non-profit, volanteer run event. -- 16:10, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>'<b>Comment</b> I know of at least two thousand stubs that dont meet the level of sources that this article has to accompany it. What does concern me is that the editor (who wasnt welcomed or explained policy to) is the promoter - I am not sure the correct policy or procedure relative to work through this - however I would caution at this stage any continued delete on sight promoters- at this stage - about dont bite the newcomers and - good faith - as I believe the editor has shown however strange the subject and the article appeared at first - that the subject somehow exists in this wonderful and strange world we live in. <a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatuSuro_2646.html" title="User talk:SatuSuro">SatuSuro</a> 23:30, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>'<i>Response</i> I also do not understand how it fails WP:NOT. An explanation on the magazines and the "association" with the event:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>1. Xpress mag was not paid to publish an article or advertisment for the event, they did it from they're own free will. They independently decided the event was newsworthy for their audience.</li>
<li>2. Propel Arts magazine is produced by Propel Arts, and independent group, funded by ArtsWA. Some funding from nullarbor came from the Department of Industry and Resources. These are seperate funding bodies, so there is no conflict or association with the event here, other than both organizations belong to the WA government.</li>
<li>3. reAKT!magazine is compeltely independent afaik. It is not funded by the government, it has no association with nullarbor. (I do not know much about this magazine, I might be wrong)</li>
<li>4. HUGI Magazine is published online from Vienna, Austria. It is completely independent from the event. The magazine publishes newsworthy events in the demoscene area.</li>
<li>5. ECU Magazine is published by the same body which funded the event. This is a non-independent source. However, the magazine is academic in nature, and so I thought it was worth mentioning.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this clears up the 'independance' of the references of the publications. -- <a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAboeing_b157.html" title="User:Aboeing">Aboeing</a> 10:07, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. It's a well written article, and I wish more demoparty articles had non-scene references. The fact it was started just last year works against it, but we could always decide again in a year or so whether it's notable enough to keep or not. It would help if there were more articles linking to it other than the List of demoparties. --<a href="../../../v/o/s/User%7EVossanova_19f2.html" title="User:Vossanova">Vossanova</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/o/s/User_talk%7EVossanova_e002.html" title="User talk:Vossanova">o&lt;</a></sup> 14:23, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hmm, maybe there should be a rule about nominating an article for deletion within 2 minutes of the article's creation? I'm sorry, most articles need a chance. Post a message on the talk page, saying "hey, is this notable"? Give them a chance to say "oh, yeah, I hadn't yet posted the bajillion news items about it yet, I'll have that done in the next 30 minutes" or even a couple days. This falls under <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. Then, if they haven't said anything in a couple days. Let it slide. I'm not a fan of deletionists. Yes, I understand where you were coming from, and (aside from probably not assuming good faith) there was nothing technically wrong with this AFD, but was it really necessary? Very little content is not a reason to delete an article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> those are the criteria.

<dd>To be fair, Merope did see a very early version of the article, and made a justifiable choice in deleting. The only thing I can say is that I'm a novice wikipedia user, so I was planning on incrementally adding content, I did not realise that you needed to add a complete article on creation. I think it would have been better to have a comment and then deleting it if the article is not improved later, however I can understand not everyone might have the time to go through this procedure. I have asked some other people unrelated to nullarbor (other than they were there) to add content. Hopefully that will happen soon. I would like to know what Merop's objections still are to the article so it can be addressed. (Also, "The author has then modified the comment" is not true, another editor made those changes, as you can see from the history I have not touched this article since I was informed of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAP" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#SOAP</a> "self promotion") -- <a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAboeing_b157.html" title="User:Aboeing">Aboeing</a></dd>

<li>Indeed, <a href="../../../a/c/m/ACM_SIGGRAPH_735f.html" title="ACM SIGGRAPH">ACM SIGGRAPH</a>'s reputable is unimpeachable, and the reference does indeed support the relevant claim. But it is still a pretty pathetic reference.&#160;:-( You were always going to be skating on thin ice if these four references are all that has ever been written about the event. Next year, at least fire off a press release to ECU's student newspaper letting them know how it went.
