<li><b>Strong Delete</b> as per nom. Fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Very minor Nazi/SA member and WWII German military police officer who just happens to have a famous son. In addition, article smacks of anti-Arnie scandal-mongering. Aside of one passing mention of one newspaper headline, linked sources do not indicate that Gustav Schwarzenegger was a "high-ranking" Nazi or WWII German soldier - they indicate instead that he was a "low ranking" Nazi party member who attained the rank of "Master Sergeant" in the military police. Also, article insinuates sinister crimes by Gustav only to finally state that there is no proof of any direct connection to any crimes and that he was cleared of any suspicions. That's just not cricket. Merge a <u>brief</u> mention to the main Arnie article if there's nothing already there, but no justification for own article <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:45, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've edited the lead to say "high-ranking enlisted soldier" instead of "high-ranking soldier". Master Sergeant is a significant enlisted rank with command responsibility.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> on the basis of being a person "achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events" and "primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works", as per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. GS's military record and NS/SA credentials (and issues surrounding AS's stated ignorance thereof) received considerable attention during the 2003 recall campaign and were legitimate discussion points at the time, not "scandal-mongering", against the background of AS's apparent espousal of naive attitudes about Nazism and his country's past generally (at least earlier in his career). It's also signficant as an example of the Austrian public's being comparativelyless informed about their fellow citizens's (or many of their own family members) active participation in NS politics and war crimes (compared to the record of self-examination in Germany proper, for example.) The article seemed to be factual, balanced, and propertly sourced before I made a few contributions to it myself, which I did because I had heard rumors that GS was a "high-ranking Nazi" and a "war criminal" and that AS paid the Simon Wiesenthal Center to "cover this up", none of which appear to be strictly accurate. So far from scandal-mongering, my hope is that this article will set the record straight. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiskey_Pete_b5ca.html" title="User:Whiskey Pete">User:Whiskey Pete</a> 17:01, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>He is notable for being the possible tie between Arnold, a candidate for an American electorial office, and the Nazis. Having any ties to Nazis, for an elected official, or a serious electoral candidate, is extremely rare and notable. Possible ties, especially ones that can be taken seriously to be newsworthy, while not nearly as notable, is notable enough for WP. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 01:14, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I would also point out that there is no way that Google News Archive provides comprehensive historical coverage (e.g. of wartime Austrian newspapers) and drawing inferences from that assumption is erroneous.
