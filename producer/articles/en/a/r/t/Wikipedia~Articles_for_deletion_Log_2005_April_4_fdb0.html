<p>While "xxx passwords" passes the Google test admirably, I don't believe that this is a generic term for this kind of site, as the article claims. It originally seems to have been contributed simply as advertising (link now removed), and without even that, there's little left of the article anyway. username: <b>Delete</b> password: <b>rightnow</b> --<a href="../../../r/l/a/User%7ERlandmann_a23c.html" title="User:Rlandmann">Rlandmann</a> 23:25, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if the title is correct, I think we could face a few legal issues. If we ban users for posting their passwords, like Fatheron, I am sure we can <b>delete</b> this too. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> 00:47, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> if there is a bigger consensus to move the information to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_pornography.html" title="Internet pornography">Internet pornography</a>, I will change my vote. However, I still do not think we should post links to sites that give out free passwords. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> 02:16, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't disagree--Wikipedia is not a link farm. The version I saw had no such links, but a statement that some emails/websites give passwords for free access to porn sites, which is true, and mention of a court case, which, if a solid reference is cited, seems like it could be worth noting on the broader article. The main reason I didn't leave my vote as simply 'delete' is because I suspect if it's deleted, it will be recreated at some point, and will have to repeat this discussion. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 16:37, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can definitely understand your point of view. However, when dealing with something in pop culture, isn't information like the indisputable presence of a rumour (unconfirmed by definition) for a 3rd movie information that those who would look up such an article be interested in?

<li>Okay, well let's ask another question then. Since when did movies become encyclopaedic anyway? I can't remember any other encyclopaedia that I've looked at listing them. Then there is this idea that <i>anything</i> remotely rumour- like in nature can't exist here. By your standards I would think that an article on the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graviton.html" title="Graviton">graviton</a> is unacceptable. I mean the article itself states "Detecting a graviton, if it exists, would prove rather problematic." Not much chance of any proof in the near future but I doubt (or at least I severely hope) that no one would consider deleting that article. Anyway, my point is that some unproven info has a place here. --<a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzzball%21_0d08.html" title="User:Fuzzball!">Fuzzball!</a> <a href="../../../f/u/z/User_talk%7EFuzzball%21_4d48.html" title="User talk:Fuzzball!">(talk)</a> 02:10, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As I said, <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Lady_1ce9.html" title="First Lady">First Lady</a> doesn't use this term at all. What you are asking us to comment upon does not in fact exist. <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Gentleman_86f9.html" title="First Gentleman">First Gentleman</a> is a redirect to <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Lady_1ce9.html" title="First Lady">First Lady</a> and has been since its own deletion discussion (see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_First_Gentleman_8702.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/First Gentleman">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/First Gentleman</a>). Since (according to Google) there's no occurrence of the term "second gentleman" in Wikipedia <i>at all</i>, the argument that it should be explained because it is used has a fundamental flaw.

<p>I am nominating this as a test case. I would ordinarily call this an article that should be deleted outright. This ship plays a minor role in a single Star Wars story and is never heard from again. This is fancruft of the tiniest signifigance. However, I am not voting delete because of a new project, the <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Star Wars wiki</a> that has been recently created.

<li>You seem to have failed to grasp my point entirely. This page most certainly should be deleted, and I would vote for that over a keep or merge.

<li>This is a semi-policy as opoosed to an official policy, and the major thrust is on dealing with characters, though other fictional concepts are also covered. While this approach works for most fiction, the Star Wars universe is so large that creating lists on every minor point would not be feasible: they would simply grow to large and be split back into individual articles. That is the very reason that a Star Wars wiki was created and the very reason why minutae like the Eclipse II belongs there. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 15:29, Apr 4, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I never said it was policy, I'm simply using it as reasoning for my vote. Anyway, I think transwikiing to the Star Wars wiki would be appropriate, but since it doesn't list a legal disclaimer anywhere I could find, I'm not sure that that's legally allowed. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 17:34, Apr 4, 2005 (UTC)

<p>Appears to be a prank entry, the only references I can find for silent velcro are that it appeared as a joke in the movie "Garden State".

<li>It is not hoax. It is fiction, i.e., it is a <i>real</i> thing in a <i>real</i> work of fiction, namely, the movie. Also, there is something <a href="../../../i/n/h/Inherently_funny_word.html" title="Inherently funny word">inherently funny in the term</a>, so that it was picked up as a joke. (Or was it vice versa? the creators of the film picked a known joke to add some fun?) Anyway, the term is searchable, it is not a neologism, i.e., lives sufficently long. So the best idea IMO is my proposal above, rather than deleting. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 17:04, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>for what reason is GUWPCT non notable? It is a part of whirlpool, its in the FAQ, there used to be a website dedicated to it. I feel it is a part of (ever so small) of Whirlpool, given there are users on the site with the Conspircay theory tags, it continues to support theory every so often.

<li>Fyi Kappa, the definition I was using for cruft in "gamescruft" was derived from definitions such as <i>n. Excess; superfluous junk; used esp. of redundant or superseded code.</i> <s>and <i>n. An unpleasant substance. The dust that gathers under your bed is cruft; the TMRC Dictionary correctly noted that attacking it with a broom only produces more.</i></s> from the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/C/cruft.html" class="external text" title="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/C/cruft.html" rel="nofollow">Jargon File</a>.

<li>I would like to apologize for those words, in retrospect my statements above look quite inflammatory. I didn't mean to say the article was poorly written or unpleasant, merely that this is excess, non-notable material. I guess the word gamecruft, invented as far as i can tell soley for wikipedia, does not fall under either of those definitions above, truthfully and is better defined as "excess or non-notable information pertaining to gaming."

<li><b>Delete</b> unless good source citations are given to counter the impression that this is a personal essay and "original research." Currently, no source citations are given that would indicate general use of this phrase to refer to a well-defined suite of misconceptions. The article says some ideas are held in low regard by "most practicing members of the field," but no such members are named. It says they are "often" described as superstitions but gives no specific examples of such usage. It says they are "fallacies" and "errors," but cites no authority identifying them as such. If this is paraphrased textbook exposition, then it should be sourced ("Economic textbooks enumerate a number of beliefs as 'economic superstitions.'

<li>Despite <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStirling_Newberry_897e.html" title="User:Stirling Newberry">Stirling Newberry</a>'s efforts, this is still not an encyclopedic article. Most of these "economic superstitions" are not superstitions or even fallacies. They are approximations which are useful in some contexts and badly incorrect in others - the economic equivalent of assuming that the world is flat (which is, for example, one of the first simplifying assumptions in most Physics 101 classes). The choice to highlight these particular misconceptions is problematic. Many people mis-understand many things about economics. The various <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics.html" title="Economics">economics</a> articles explain those topics much better. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 05:16, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Since the article names their periodical, confirming the existence of the <i>Vereinigung Revolutionärer Arbeiter Österreichs (Marxisten-Leninisten)</i> is no more difficult than visiting the website of the <a href="../../../%C3%B6/s/t/%C3%96sterreichische_Nationalbibliothek_34d9.html" title="Österreichische Nationalbibliothek">Österreichische Nationalbibliothek</a> (<a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a> <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Library_fcde.html" title="National Library">National Library</a>) and searching their <a href="http://www.onb.ac.at/kataloge/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.onb.ac.at/kataloge/index.htm" rel="nofollow">online catalogue</a>. Perhaps we should have a policy not to translate the names of political parties in article titles, especially when there is no official translation - the result is sometimes outright silly and often misleading and confusing, particularly with all these small fringe parties with very similar names (cf. <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_of_Brian_e306.html" title="Life of Brian">Life of Brian</a>). / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 04:58, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The source claiming the existance of a group using this name comes from <i>International Maoism in the Developed World</i> by Robert J. Alexander. If anybody can contradict his claim of the existance of such a group, I would be interested to know. Note that Alexander only mentions the English version of the group's name in his book. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 18:14, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> The question is not so much whether this group exists or ever existed, but whether it is noteable. I don't think the mere fact that it published a journal establishes that. There are lots of groups publishing all sorts of pamphlets. How is/was that group noteable? Did the group ever have any candidates for office? It does not seem so. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartg76_fbde.html" title="User:Martg76">Martg76</a> 15:26, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> I don't see the point in that argument. Why have an encyclopedia limited to the things all people already know about? Nowhere in the article text is there any reference to the eventual size of the group. That is not to say that it is unimportant. We should see that importance is valued differntly to different people. A political group might have only 2-3 members, but publish theoretical material that influences other groups. A group in one country might be very small, but connected to an international community of political parties and organizations, which in its totality will have some significance. You obviously value the importance, or 'notability', of a political faction in terms of its electoral performance. That shows ignorance to the political history of the radical left, were many groups consiously decided not to participate in any electoral process. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 18:35, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>"Importance" or "notability" is a criterion for whether something or someone should be included in Wikipedia. You are of course right that influence by means of publications can constitute sufficient importance. However, notability should normally be explained in the article (if it is not obvious). In this case, we can only presume notability, which I think is not Wikipedia policy. BTW, I came accross this article in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Category%7EPolitical_parties_in_Austria_9f45.html" title="Category:Political parties in Austria">Category:Political parties in Austria</a>, a subcategory of Category:Austrian politics. (Other than that, this page is an orphan). Assuming that this group had influence outside Austria, should it really be listed there, given that its influence on Austrian politics is non-existent? Is/was it a an actual political party rather than just a group of people with political goals? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartg76_fbde.html" title="User:Martg76">Martg76</a> 20:31, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>The orphanage-problem of the article ought to be solved once an article for <a href="../../../m/l/p/MLP%C3%96_d116.html" title="MLPÖ">MLPÖ</a> is started. The impact of this group ought to be seen in regards to its relations to other forces in the Austrian left, not Austrian society as a whole. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 08:39, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Isn't "alleged" the proper terminology for a title, especially when there is no consensus for such a thing? Or are you saying there are POV problems with the content inside the alleged version? If <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation_of_Islam_and_anti-Semitism_42cc.html" title="Nation of Islam and anti-Semitism">Nation of Islam and anti-Semitism</a>'s content is good it should be renamed to Nation of Islam and alleged anti-Semitism - <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 19:42, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As has been pointed out in a number of places, including the wikien-l list, the name doesn't follow Wikipedia naming conventions. We don't have articles about "Alleged <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a>" or "Alleged <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a>" etc. Instead, the article title is declarative, and the article itself discusses the pros and cons of the concept. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:28, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is an illogical argument, all the examples you cite are generic articles about just the controversial subject specifically, the title to the other article in question is *specifically* stating that the nation of islam is totally anti-Semitic, very different than a generic article on a controversial subject like "homophobia". If someone created an article say George W. Bush and homophobia how long would that title last? How about U.S. Government and Islamophobia? Stating, or even implying in a title, that some organization or somebody is definitely a controversial thing is a very dangerous policy for an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 21:03, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>The title makes no claim that NOI is anti-Semitic, it merely presents the discussion. The article itself is where the pros and cons are listed.

<li>The article is woefully insufficient to claim an overwhelming majority of evidence proves what you are saying it does, if there isn't 100% consensus for something then declaring in a title that someone or some organization is anti-Semitic is very dangerous. Certainly the point that criticisms of the government of Israel are often construed as anti-Semitism is a good one (because then at least *some* of the "rhetoric" is not actually anti-Semitic which is an additional point against your "overwhelming mainstream view" belief). <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 01:43, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As in the prior votes, I again argue that the content of this article presents more evidence about the beliefs and statements of <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Farrakhan_10e0.html" title="Louis Farrakhan">Louis Farrakhan</a> than about the attitudes of the organization, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation_of_Islam_86de.html" title="Nation of Islam">Nation of Islam</a>. An individual can be anti-semitic. I have trouble with the concept that any large organization can be so easily characterized. The contents of this article (both titles) should be distributed to the articles about the leaders making these statements. The left-over section (that a few other organizations have tarred the NOI with this accusation) should be merged back into the main NOI article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 05:45, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sorry Smithfarm, I had to edit your reply with the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags, because the way you originally wrote, this VfD nomination actually ended up in the category "Pseudoscience". Anyway, I think the title is POV too. I'm an atheist myself, and I feel "godless" is a derogatory term towards atheists.

<p>I propose that we delete or redirect this article. This article was a personal essay by the now-banned <i>Entmoots of Trolls</i>, and it never developed into an actual article. He made this as a parallel to our real article on <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">Ethics</a> because he didn't like the contents of <i>Ethics</i>. However, Wikipedia policy says that we should not have parallel articles on the same subject. Thus, this page also falls into the category of <a href="../../../d/u/p/Wikipedia%7EDuplicate_articles_da79.html" title="Wikipedia:Duplicate articles">Wikipedia:Duplicate articles</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> If the author is a banned user, then we should not even need to debate it. AFAIK wikipedia policy is to <i>automatically</i> delete anything written by a banned user <i>on sight</i>. Are we sure that the author is that pain-in-the-ass Entmoot of Trolls? If it is, then this should be binned immediately and all his edits, no matter where on no matter what, should be reverted/deleted instantly. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="green"><b>Fear</b><font color="orange"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a> 22:17, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> POV fork, original research. Pace <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">User:Jtdirl</a>, I don't think that articles contributed by banned users should be deleted without consideration: there may be useful content hidden in them (here, I'm a little sympathetic to the right-vs-right way of looking at ethical problems). --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 09:07, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete, personal essay. Note that the banned-user issue doesn't trigger automatic deletion in this case, because it was written before he was banned. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 00:52, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
