<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution_3353.html" title="Edit section: Proposal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Proposal</span></h2>
<p>Whenever they "deem it necessary," two-thirds of both houses of Congress may propose an amendment. This means two-thirds of those members present—assuming that a <a href="../../../q/u/o/Quorum.html" title="Quorum">quorum</a> exists at the time that the vote is cast—and not necessarily a two-thirds vote of the entire membership elected and serving in the two houses of Congress. It was suggested that the two houses first adopt a resolution indicating that they deem an amendment necessary, but this procedure has never been used—the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">U.S. Senate</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_of_Representatives_fcb5.html" title="United States House of Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> instead directly proceed to the adoption of a joint resolution, thereby proposing the amendment with the implication that both bodies "deem" the amendment to be "necessary." Up to this time, all amendments have been proposed and implemented <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codicil.html" title="Codicil">codicil</a> to the main body of the Constitution.</p>
<p>If at least two-thirds of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_legislature.html" title="State legislature">legislatures of the states</a> so request, Congress is required to call a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convention_to_propose_amendment_to_U.S._Constitution_a4c6.html" title="Convention to propose amendment to U.S. Constitution">convention</a> for the purpose of proposing an amendment. On the questionable assumption that only state requests addressing the same possible amendment are to be counted by Congress, which is not stated in Article V, the requisite number of states never made such a request although two proposals have come just two states shy of the required number. However, over 500 state requests for an Article V convention have been made and some believe that Congress should have already called a convention. There is much controversy as to how such a convention would operate, how its delegates would be chosen, the necessary vote required to propose a particular amendment, and many other lingering questions. The state legislatures have, in times past, taken advantage of the fear of the unknown by using their power to apply for a national convention in order to frighten Congress into proposing the desired amendment. For example, the movement to amend the Constitution to provide for the direct election of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senators_c59a.html" title="United States Senators">U.S. Senators</a> began to see such proposals regularly pass the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_of_Representatives_fcb5.html" title="United States House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a> only to die in the Senate from the early 1890s onward. As time went by, more and more state legislatures adopted resolutions demanding that a convention be called, thus pressuring the Senate to finally relent and approve what later became the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventeenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_64b7.html" title="Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Seventeenth Amendment</a> for fear that such a convention—if permitted to assemble—might stray to include issues above and beyond just the direct election of U.S. Senators.</p>
<p>Since Article Five does not make clear how the amendment-proposing convention is to be composed and operated, Congress—presumably through enactment of a Federal statute—could determine how the delegates are chosen and to provide for other procedural details.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President</a> has no formal role in the constitutional amendment process. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution_de54.html" title="Article One of the United States Constitution">Article One</a> provides, "every order, resolution, or vote, to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives." As previously stated, the Constitution requires the concurrence of at least two-thirds of the members present of both the House of Representatives and the Senate to a joint resolution which proposes a constitutional amendment. In <i><a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollingsworth_v._Virginia_808f.html" title="Hollingsworth v. Virginia">Hollingsworth v. Virginia</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/7/9/1798.html" title="1798">1798</a>), the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Supreme_Court_76bb.html" title="US Supreme Court">Supreme Court</a> held that it is not necessary to place constitutional amendments before the President for signature and, by the same logic, the President is powerless to <a href="../../../v/e/t/Veto.html" title="Veto">veto</a> a proposed constitutional amendment.</p>
<p><a name="Ratification" id="Ratification"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution_3353.html" title="Edit section: Ratification">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ratification</span></h2>
<p>After being officially proposed, a constitutional amendment must then be ratified by the legislatures of, or by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conventions_within_the_states_to_ratify_an_amendment_to_U.S._Constitution_7b6d.html" title="Conventions within the states to ratify an amendment to U.S. Constitution">conventions</a> in, at least three-fourths of the states. It is not mandatory that amendments proposed by Congress be ratified by legislatures nor is it mandatory that amendments proposed by a national convention be ratified by state conventions; either mode of proposal may be used with either mode of ratification. Of the twenty-seven amendments to the Constitution that have been ratified, Congress has specified the state conventions ratification method for only one: the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_696a.html" title="Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twenty-first Amendment</a>, which became part of the Constitution in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>. Most states hold elections specifically for the purpose of choosing delegates, but even that is not a requirement. For example, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Mexico_2a18.html" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a> provides, by state law, that the members of its legislature be the delegates at such a state ratification convention, thereby skirting the occasional sentiment that persons other than state lawmakers should consider the ratification of a particular proposed Federal constitutional amendment.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution_3353.html" title="Edit section: Rescinding a ratification">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rescinding a ratification</span></h2>
<p>The validity of a ratification that a state first grants and then later purports to rescind, and of the subsequent ratification of an amendment which that state previously rejected and then later assented to, was addressed by Congress in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a> when <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_088f.html#United_States" title="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_H._Seward_3993.html" title="William H. Seward">William H. Seward</a> issued a proclamation that what we know today as the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_74cf.html" title="Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a> was properly ratified and a part of the Constitution. Seward's proclamation noted that <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> lawmakers had reversed themselves and purported to rescind. Further, Seward's proclamation questioned the validity of those reversals. Shortly thereafter, both houses of Congress adopted a concurrent resolution likewise declaring the Fourteenth Amendment as having been duly ratified and listing Ohio and New Jersey among the states approving it. While Ohio and New Jersey purported to withdraw their earlier ratifications, three other states that had previously rejected the amendment then reversed themselves and proceeded to ratify it. In <i><a href="../../../c/o/l/Coleman_v._Miller_9eea.html" title="Coleman v. Miller">Coleman v. Miller</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>), the Supreme Court declared the question to be non-justiciable, leaving the issue to Congress and accepting the precedent set by Congress' actions some 71 years earlier with respect to the Fourteenth Amendment. It would therefore appear that states may not undo prior ratifications of amendments, although they may ratify an amendment which they had previously rejected. However, Congress is not subject to the doctrine of <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Stare_decisis.html" title="Stare decisis">stare decisis</a></i>, so a future Congress could simply ignore this precedent. The issue of recision became important again during the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> when the legislatures of four states adopted resolutions purporting to repeal their previous ratifications of the <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equal_Rights_Amendment_5e53.html" title="Equal Rights Amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution_3353.html" title="Edit section: Deadline imposed on ratification process">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Deadline imposed on ratification process</span></h2>
<p>The Constitution does not expressly provide for a deadline on the state legislatures' or state ratifying conventions' consideration of proposed amendments. In <i><a href="../../../d/i/l/Dillon_v._Gloss_9b05.html" title="Dillon v. Gloss">Dillon v. Gloss</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>), the Supreme Court affirmed that Congress—if it so desires—could provide a deadline for ratification, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not find anything in the article which suggests that an amendment once proposed is to be open to ratification for all time, or that ratification in some of the states may be separated from that in others by many years and yet be effective. We do find that which strongly suggests the contrary. First, proposal and ratification are not treated as unrelated acts but as succeeding steps in a single endeavor, the natural inference being that they are not to be widely separated in time. Secondly, it is only when there is deemed to be a necessity therefor that amendments are to be proposed, the reasonable implication being that when proposed they are to be considered and disposed of presently. Thirdly, as ratification is but the expression of the approbation of the people and is to be effective when had in three-fourths of the States, there is a fair implication that it must be sufficiently contemporaneous in that number of States to reflect the will of the people in all sections at relatively the same period, which of course ratification scattered through a long series of years would not do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the aforementioned <i>Coleman v. Miller</i> decision, the Supreme Court modified <i>Dillon</i> considerably, holding that the question of timeliness of ratification is a political and non-justiciable one, leaving the issue to Congress' discretion. It would appear that the length of time elapsing between proposal and ratification is irrelevant to the validity of the amendment. For example, the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty-seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_68b7.html" title="Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twenty-seventh Amendment</a> was proposed in <a href="../../../1/7/8/1789.html" title="1789">1789</a> and ratified more than 200 years later in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_20.html" title="May 20">May 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, both houses of Congress adopted concurrent resolutions accepting the 27th Amendment's unorthodox ratification process as having been successful and valid.</p>
<p>Beginning in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>, Congress has usually—but not always—imposed deadlines on proposed amendments. The limitation originally took the form of a clause in the text of the constitutional amendment itself, such as "This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress." Such a clause may be found in the <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eighteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_135b.html" title="Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Eighteenth</a>, <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twentieth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_2267.html" title="Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twentieth</a>, <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_696a.html" title="Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twenty-first</a> and <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_fa39.html" title="Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twenty-second</a> Amendments. However, with the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty-third_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_315b.html" title="Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twenty-third</a>, <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty-fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_d1a4.html" title="Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twenty-fourth</a>, <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_3f18.html" title="Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twenty-fifth</a> and <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty-sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_b6a4.html" title="Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twenty-sixth</a> amendments, Congress instead placed the ratification deadline in the preamble of the joint resolution proposing the amendment rather than in the amendment's actual text. And in the cases of the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_3c94.html" title="Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Nineteenth Amendment</a> (proposed in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>) and the still-pending <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_Labor_Amendment_da6a.html" title="Child Labor Amendment">Child Labor Amendment</a> (proposed in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>), Congress chose specifically <i>not</i> to establish any deadline at all.</p>
<p>As noted in <i>Dillon</i>, the Supreme Court has upheld the power of Congress to set such deadlines on ratification. The power of Congress to <i>extend</i> an already-agreed-upon deadline, however, has not been settled. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, Congress extended the previously-agreed-upon, seven-year limit on the ratification of the <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equal_Rights_Amendment_5e53.html" title="Equal Rights Amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</a> by more than three years from a <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">March 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, original deadline to a <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_30.html" title="June 30">June 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, revised deadline. It was accepted that if the deadline had been contained within the actual text of the amendment itself, Congress could not have extended it, as doing so would involve changing the text of an amendment already ratified by some of the states. In the case of the Equal Rights Amendment, however, it was argued that since the original <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">March 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, deadline was contained in only the preamble of the joint resolution proposing the amendment—rather than in the actual text of the amendment itself—that the deadline could be altered. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, a Federal District Court in <a href="../../../i/d/a/Idaho.html" title="Idaho">Idaho</a>, however, found that Congress did not have the authority to extend the deadline, even when only contained within the proposing joint resolution's preamble. Before the matter could be appealed to higher Federal courts, the three-year extension had itself expired, and the issue therefore became moot. To avoid this controversy with the 1978 constitutional amendment proposed to grant congressional representation to the residents of <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, Congress returned to the habit of placing the deadline within the actual text of the amendment itself. The <a href="../../../d/i/s/District_of_Columbia_Voting_Rights_Amendment_f040.html" title="District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment">District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment</a> expired unratified in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven amendments have been ratified and made part of the Constitution. However, four proposed amendments submitted to the states by Congress remain pending for ratification: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congressional_Apportionment_Amendment_cc9f.html" title="Congressional Apportionment Amendment">Article One of the original Bill of Rights</a> (proposed in 1789), the <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titles_of_Nobility_Amendment_06e0.html" title="Titles of Nobility Amendment">Titles of Nobility Amendment</a> (proposed in <a href="../../../1/8/1/1810.html" title="1810">1810</a>), the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corwin_Amendment_63b6.html" title="Corwin Amendment">Corwin Amendment</a> (proposed in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a>) and the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_Labor_Amendment_da6a.html" title="Child Labor Amendment">Child Labor Amendment</a> (proposed in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>). Two other proposed amendments are no longer pending before the state legislatures—the <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equal_Rights_Amendment_5e53.html" title="Equal Rights Amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</a> (proposed in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> and expired, depending upon your point of view, in either 1979 or in 1982) and the just-mentioned <a href="../../../d/i/s/District_of_Columbia_Voting_Rights_Amendment_f040.html" title="District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment">District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment</a> (proposed in 1978 and expired in 1985).</p>
