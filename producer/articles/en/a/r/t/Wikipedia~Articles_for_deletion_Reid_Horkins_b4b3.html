<dd>I was the one responsible for deleting the notice becuase it said "delete this if you are intending to edit the article" which i have done since then. While I do understand that my use of the phrase "internet phenomenon" was an overstatement, he is still widely known and regarded within the toronto private school community and I have known other wikipedia artciles which target a similarly small audiance. I did not author the article origionaly but I have done alot of work to clean it up from the origional post. I think considering how new this article is it should at least be given time to be refined. several people have expressed thier interest to me about seeing this article kept alive and made more legitimate and I have told them to voice thier opinions here on wikipedia. hopefully they will take my advice. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Faltru (<a href="../../../f/a/l/User_talk%7EFaltru_879f.html" title="User talk:Faltru">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Faltru_25ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/Faltru">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Reid Horkins may be non-notable to you because you do not live in Toronto. He is a well known individual within the independant music scene in southern Ontario. A person does not need to be well known by millions of people to be worthy of a wikipedia page, im sure many of the now high traffic pages began with a small amount of public knowledge concerning the person/incident etc. I see no valid reason for this page to be up for deletion despite the fact that he is not widely recognized outside of Toronto, Canada. 65.95.227.28 00:57, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DON'T DELETE</b>. I am in the same boat as Mr. Marx, Reid Horkins seems to have struck upon a bountiful and Lucrative market, his novelty is greatly respected and appreciated by youth in their late teens. He has a political message and is a refreshing new prespective on the Toronto Rap scene. From reading previous (now deleted) posts and from word of mouth, I have learned that even young adults who are not inspired by mainstream Rap are captivated by this young phenom. Mr. Horkins is the hairbringer of the new wave of Rap and Hip Hop in youth, and I would be devastated if he were to be eliminated from this superior website. A Rapper and overall character of his calibre is not something WIKIPEDIA should shy away from. Granted that he is greatly different from other Rap artists, what would the mainstream media think of a website that turned away the next Eminem. I eagerly await the next hot single or music video that Rappin Reid releases, and please Wikipedia, and commited readers, do not delete or vouch for the deletion of this rising star.

<li><b>Strong Comment</b>: Before any more of you meatpuppets post "Don't Delete" warnings, use your computer skills to visit <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. There you will see the guidelines to assessing a musician's notability. Mr. Horkins does not have a charted hit. He has not gone on a national tour. He does not have multiple hardcopy publication credits, nor has put out albums to the general public, nor has won a major national musical award, nor has written several works in widespread national or international use, nor receives regular national radio airplay.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> per all above. Looking at the video I doubt most of the claims in the article, it's just completely banal. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 19:54, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Don't delete.</b> To the strong delete above. I first question your knowledge of Toronto and the music community in Toronto. While you can doubt the claims in the article, you have nothing to support the doubts. Do you know Reid Horkins personally? I doubt. Your doubts are empty and most certainly inane. Get yourself another few years of schooling. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.31.247.232 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.31.247.232_04e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.31.247.232">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd><b>Don't Delete but also a potential solution</b> How about the people who wish the article to be deleted summarize what they expect to see in a creditable article. I will go through the article put some serious time into it and then refresh it. Obviously we are debating whethor or not he is notable for Wikipedia but how about we look past and turn our backs to that and make an article which not only contains in many eyes a notable being but also contains alot of creditable volume. ~~Strachan Jarvis

<li><b>Dont Delete</b> Isn't Wikipedia all about inclusiveness? You sound like George Bush, trying to put a man down for being different. If Wikipedia's policy is that he has to have a charted hit, doesn't that exclude all those indy artists who may be just as talented as charted ones, but play to small crowds and intimate audiences? The fact that McNugget hasn't sold out yet, in my opinion, makes him more noteworthy. Let's take the ideals of free expression that Reid so proudly supports and let the world recognize a burgeoning superstar in the indy rap world. (Julius Marx) (69.159.80.21)</li>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> I have seen Reid Horkins rap at the Marquis Theatre on Coxwell in Toronto. I am not part of the private school scene. This shows how fast Reid is growing, it would be pointless to delete his article and then have to redo it a couple months in the future. PLEASE WIKIPEDIA, I donated to your fundraiser campaign.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Reid Horkins is circulating the private school sector of the GTA at a phenomenal rate. To delete him now would be a mistake, I gaurantee with the momentum McNugget has picked up, he will soon be well known. With more time and editing, this article can be made to better reflect wikipedia standards. -James Wolfe</li>
<li><b>Dont Delete</b> I am a record producer and Alumn of Crescent School and I was looking at the Crescent School wik and I came across Reid Horkins under Notable Alumni. I noticed that he had a link and we all know that Wikipedia's best asset is not the articles its' links. I clicked on his name and found out that he is a rapper who is taking over the private school sector of Toronto. The private school sector is one of the largest producers of Hip Hop music in all of Canada so I followed the links to his web page and bought his CD 'Stickin to the Man'. I loved it and have been in touch with Mr. Horkins on a possible deal. Thanks Wikipedia for your help in finding the next Canadian Star.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, there's the solution. If you're a record producer, sign him to a deal, and release a CD on a recognized label. As soon as that happens, and it shows reasonable sales volume, he would qualify to be added back into Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 00:13, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. I am a student at Jarvis Collegiate a high school that is very different both socio-economically and geogrpahically from Crescent School, and I have heard of and enjoy Reid Horkin's music. He is popular among my peers, and we all feel that this page shouldn't be deleted, and it's deletion would be an insult to Reid and his fan base. I am tired of people voting against this who don't live anywhere near Toronto, and who have zero knowledge of the Toronto Hip-Hop scene.</li>
<li>"Don't Delete" I also witnessed Reid's performance at the Marquee theatre, and I feel he has potential as not only a rapper, but an entertainer. Wikipdeia has a lot more to lose then gain by deleting Reid from its database. If people are digging his beats and rhymes, why shouldn't they be able to learn about this budding rapper off of Wikipedia. Personally, whenever I want to learn more about anything in particular, this site is the first one I go too, and I know that applies to many people. Why should all these people be shut out from learning about a possible new up-and-comer, just because a select few feel different?</li>
<li><b>In response to all the people saying hes not a muscisian</b> Although we belive he is and should be listed as such several people have told us he doesn't belong in that catagory, so if there is a more legitimate catagory for him please tell us and we can change it.</li>
<li><b>In response to all the people saying non-notable</b> There are many other articles which speak to a small audiance, one much smaller than this I might add. If need be i'll pull some up.</li>
