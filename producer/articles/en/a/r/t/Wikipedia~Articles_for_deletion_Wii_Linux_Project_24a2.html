<li><b>Comment</b> - I disagree. It seems like a group of people feel the need to put Linux on every platform they possibly can, and there's plenty trying to get it on the Wii — <a href="http://www.wiili.org/index.php/Links" class="external text" title="http://www.wiili.org/index.php/Links" rel="nofollow">here</a>'s a list of nine different sites up for Linux hacks especially (ten, if you include the site linked to). It's in development still, but it almost certainly <i>will</i> be done, and there's Wikipedia articles on software/hardware in development. Be more specific about what it fails in WP:SOFTWARE. Whether there should be a separate page on every variation of Linux, according to system... now, that's a different question. 66.69.90.253 22:42, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Y'know, you could find 1,000 sites on a given topic, but it doesn't mean it belongs on WP. 9 or 10 is pretty pathetic, what should we write an article about milk and cookies and the scientific interactions they create? <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7EScepia_1657.html" title="User:Scepia">Scepia</a> 00:10, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think this is a notable article, I agree that it needs some work and cleaning up, but it's a constantly growing and promising project that may even get some recognition from Nintendo (even if it's not quite positive, but there's a petition for them.). I say <b>Keep</b>. On the other hand, @Scepia, you are just in bad need of reading <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick" rel="nofollow">this</a>, I know it's not a rule, but it may help us get your point. <a href="http://www.wiili.org/index.php/User:Luis_villase" class="external text" title="http://www.wiili.org/index.php/User:Luis_villase" rel="nofollow">Luis villase</a>

<li><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../x/b/o/Xbox_Linux_030b.html" title="Xbox Linux">Xbox Linux</a> is a working, complete project. Wiili barely qualifies above vapourware. IMO the project has lost it's original goals, currently they are just a not very organized repository of random Wii information.

<li>Then argue it. Just because <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> doesn't apply to every little thing doesn't mean we should ignore IAR.

<li><b>I suggest we stop this AfD immediately and request help from an admin</b>. This article is in need of some serious cleanup, as it is completely mixing up two projects, the <a href="http://www.wii-linux.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.wii-linux.com/" rel="nofollow">Wii Linux Project</a>, and <a href="http://www.wiili.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wiili.org" rel="nofollow">WiiLi</a>. Most of what's in this article is actually about the latter (except for the arstechnica/slashdot quotes, which are about the former), but for some reason at some point both were considered the same project and <a href="../../../w/i/i/WiiLi_b23f.html" title="WiiLi">WiiLi</a>/<a href="../../../w/i/i/Wiili.html" title="Wiili">Wiili</a> now redirect to this article's page. The former project has absolutely nothing and is not notable at all IMO (they haven't even had an update since the wii came out, and their wiki is basically empty), while the latter is a well-known (if controversial and of debatable merit) project. Personally though, I'd just say <b>Delete</b> the whole thing and create a single article (say, <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii_homebrew.html" title="Wii homebrew">Wii homebrew</a>) to encompass all of these sites and also including non-linux-specific homebrew (<a href="http://www.wiibrew.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wiibrew.org" rel="nofollow">wiibrew</a>, <a href="http://www.wiire.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wiire.org" rel="nofollow">wiire</a>, etc). Currently anyway, there is no Linux on Wii development, since it is impossible to run homebrew code, so the efforts to run homebrew in the first place are far more important (and more general). Stuff like the Wiimote reverse engineering is also not specific to Linux. Once someone comes up with some linux that actually runs on the wii, it might deserve its own page. Marcan 06:11, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b> per Marcan above. It would be better to vote after the article is cleaned up <a href="../../../g/i/s/User%7EGisele_Hsieh_103a.html" title="User:Gisele Hsieh">Gisele Hsieh</a> 20:27, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - One or two paragraphs about non-existant projects does not count as "encyclopedia" news. This seems to read more as an advertisement to gain interest in the projects rather then information on the projects themselves. I personally agree with Marcan that we should have have a more broad article focusing on the entire homebrew scene, rather than a single project. <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii_homebrew.html" title="Wii homebrew">Wii homebrew</a> would do nicely. -- <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkain_1ac3.html" title="User:Darkain">Darkain Dragoon</a> 21:54, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The project is young (as is the wii), but it has a lot of traction, and they make fast progresses. I say keep, and if it turns out to slow down or be a dud in 3 months, let's talk again about a VFD. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> 23:56, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Seems to more a battleground for a bunch of immmature web sites more intent on trying to draw attention to their Wii homebrew web site than actually doing anything. When there are notable results there can be a notable article about Wii homebrew, not about a web site. 59.167.63.205 01:20, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I would like to point out that both the Xbox Linux project and the Gamecube linux project have articles, why should the Wii Linux project be any different?59.167.63.205 01:20, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
