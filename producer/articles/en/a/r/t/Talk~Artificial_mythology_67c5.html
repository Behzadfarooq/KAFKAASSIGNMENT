<p>The page <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_mythology.html" title="Artificial mythology">artificial mythology</a> is problematic. The article has useful information about the concept, useful information that belongs in an encyclopedia. On the other hand, I don't think "artificial mythology" is a standard term. A search on Google turns up few hits that are not derived from Wikipedia and its mirrors. So, would any mythology experts care to weigh in? Is there a better term we can use instead, a different title we can use for the article? And if I'm wrong and the term "artificial mythology" is standard, can someone provide a citation to prove it? --<a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowellian_970e.html" title="User:Lowellian">Lowellian</a> 22:39, Apr 11, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are at least 25 non-Wiki originated websites referring to "artificial mythology" in Yahoo Search.<br /></dd>

<p>Craig J. Saper has written a book, <i>Artificial Mythologies: A Guide to Cultural Invention</i>, 1997, Minneapolis: Univ. of Minnesota Press.<br />
A. Wicher quotes <i>The artificial mythology of Tolkien's "The Silmarillion".</i></p>
<p>And H.P. Lovecraft's <i>Necromicon</i> is described in <i>Straightdope</i> as an artificial mythology.</p>
<p>There is a magazine called <i>Zothique</i> which is quoted as "a journal of dark fantasy...and artificial mythology".</p>

<p>I share your discomfort with the term -- after all, isn't all mythology "artificial?" -- but it seems that it's already being used in this sense, and it is handy and relatively easy to understand. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_Applegate_b4a6.html" title="User:Ben Applegate">Ben Applegate</a> 11:52, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, mythology is not artificial. That's like saying all religion is artificial. Most myths come about naturally via a variety of factors, socially and through the evolution of the stories, the ones discussed here are completely made up, which is done through an entirely different process... and artificial one. 172.162.116.112 05:56, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What defines the division between "artificial mythology" and "fantasy world"? I understand instinctively that this term applies to <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Earth_f1cb.html" title="Middle Earth">Middle Earth</a> and the <a href="../../../c/t/h/Cthulhu_Mythos_bb25.html" title="Cthulhu Mythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a>, because those are both presented by their authors as alternate mythologies or the real world, and since so much is written about the expanded <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> universe and since it took place "a long long time ago" I could see that fitting in too, but what about "future mythologies" like Dune, or the expanded fantasy world of something like <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wheel_of_Time_a73a.html" title="The Wheel of Time">Wheel of Time</a>, or any of the literally thousands of fantasy worlds that various authors have created? <a href="../../../l/u/v/User%7ELuvcraft_7624.html" title="User:Luvcraft">Luvcraft</a> 18:42, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>First off I would like to say that this is my first post into the Wikipedia system. I have a particular interest and I believe some expertise, in subjects related to myth, metaphor and individual and collective systems. The idea of Myth and Mythology lies beneath major streams of psychological and anthropological thought. The term "artificial mythology" is in my experience, probably unique to Wikipedia. I have no problem with it, however, it encompasses a narrow world view. Work in psychology by authors as C.G.Jung, James Hillman and Wolfgang Giegerich to name a few have incorporated conceptions of myth as an operating part of the individual's unconscious that is active in the establishment of his/her external reality. Yes, it does also border on conceptions or reality that others might argue is religious but it is not dependent upon this view. This broader perspective is also supported, in my opinion, by conceptions of myth and metaphor in cognitive psychology with the view of the individual's cognitive process involved in establishing an external reality (Berger and Luckman), or of folks like Joseph Campbell or Levi-Strauss that take a more anthropological approach to the subject. In light of these perspectives to consider mythology artificial may be premature.</p>
<p>Note I suggested a minor change in the description of the piece on Tolkien. He didn't "coin" the term mythopoeic but he did use it. thomas m. Obrien 5 September 2006</p>

<p>Makes sense to me. There's nothing in <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythopoeic_literature.html" title="Mythopoeic literature">Mythopoeic literature</a> or <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legendarium.html" title="Legendarium">Legendarium</a> to set them apart from artificial mythology -- they're just different, more esoteric terms for the same thing -- and both invented (or at least popularized) by the same man. Merging them into this article would enrich it with info that people are not likely to find where it's filed now. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_Applegate_b4a6.html" title="User:Ben Applegate">Ben Applegate</a> 11:50, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>From the definition provided for "legendarium," it seems like it could be just as accurately applied to a real mythology (clearly defined on the <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">mythology</a> page) as a fictional one. As such, it would be very inappropriate to merge it with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_mythology.html" title="Artificial mythology">artificial mythology</a>. <a href="../../../m/u/t/User%7EMutant_Despot_b430.html" title="User:Mutant Despot">Mutant Despot</a> 03:44, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regardless, I don't see a need for an encyclopedia article on "Legendarium." If "legendarium" simply = a mythology that's written down, why not just call it "written mythology?" And if there are examples of "legendariums" that are not artificial, then we should just merge it with <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">mythology</a>. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_Applegate_b4a6.html" title="User:Ben Applegate">Ben Applegate</a> 13:17, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the article on legendarium would probably be sufficient as a Wiktionary entry, since eveything relevant in the way of content is dealt with at <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythopoeic_literature.html" title="Mythopoeic literature">Mythopoeic literature</a> or at <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">mythology</a>. But as long as the division of information was clear, I do not think that it would be helpful to merge <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythopoeic_literature.html" title="Mythopoeic literature">Mythopoeic literature</a> (which is really a subgenre of modern Fantasy literature) with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_mythology.html" title="Artificial mythology">Artificial mythology</a>, which covers a much broader spectrum from Blake to Ossian, and less directly literary figures such as Wagner. I think "Invented mythology" would be a better name for that article, though. <a href="../../../m/y/o/User%7EMyopic_Bookworm_35a2.html" title="User:Myopic Bookworm">Myopic Bookworm</a> 12:58, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Legendarium absolutely should not be merged. Whether it stays as a stub, redirects to <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legend.html" title="Legend">Legend</a> or gets Wiktionaried can be decided later, but the overall meaning of the word has no reason to be merged here, as it would be inaccurate. 172.162.116.112 05:56, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree. Just by wording <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythopoeic_literature.html" title="Mythopoeic literature">Mythopoeic literature</a> strikes me as a section of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_mythology.html" title="Artificial mythology">artificial mythology</a>, since literature is written and the written word is not the only way to convey mythology. Other media include music, pictures, movies, and even interactive forms such as video games and more I've either forgotten or don't know about because they haven't been created yet&#160;;) Just my two cents. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamann_5884.html" title="User:Camann">Camann</a> 02:35, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
