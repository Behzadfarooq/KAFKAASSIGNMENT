<p>Kirby Wright is best known for his coming of age island novel PUNAHOU BLUES. The setting for the book is his high school alma mater Punahou School.</p>
<p>EARLY YEARS</p>
<p>Wright was born at Queen's Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii. His father Harold Wright was a t r ial attorney for the firm Smith, Wilde, BeBe, and Cades. His mother, the former June McCormack of Boston, was a former secretary at MIT. Starting at the age of 4, Wright spent summers with his part-Hawaiian grandmother Julia Gilman on her ranch on the east end of Molokai. It was here Wright met Sophie Cooke, a cattle rancher who wrote the memoire SINCERELY, SOPHIE about her life and times in the islands. This meeting proved influential to the young Wright because Cooke wrote about his grandmother.</p>
<p>HIGHER EDUCATION</p>
<p>After graduation from Punahou School, Wright studied writing under the tutelage of Maxine Hong Kingston at the Univesity of Hawaii, Manoa. He transferred to the University of California San Diego, where he met Kurt Vonnegut, Allen Gin sb e rg, Jerome Rothenberg, and Bobbie Louise Hawkins. After graduation, he became the PR Director for the Carlsbad Inn in Carlsbad, California. Unhappy in sales, Wright pursued an MFA in creative writing at San Francisco State University and became the first student in the history of the school to sweep the poetry awards.</p>

The Bowman and the Spearman are two American Indian statues, standing as gatekeepers at the entrance of Congress Parkway in Chicago's Grant Park. In 1928 they were sculpted in Zagreb by Croatian sculptor Ivan Mestrovic.</p>
<p>Rarely do the visitors notice that something is missing from these powerful figures--their weapons. There are rumors that the weapons were removed at the request of Native Americans but the rumors may be false. The weapons are intentionally missing from the sculptures to leave something to imagination according to one source.</p>

<li><b>Declined</b>. This seems like it could be a notable subject, but the second paragraph just has too many "weasel words" in it. Wikipedia article's shouldn't just say "There are rumors that..." or "according to one source"; they should specifically list sources to back up these facts (newspaper articles mentioning the rumors, etc.). If this information can be found at the choosechicago.com site, please say so; I tried to verify this on my own but the interactive map crashed on my machine. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 20:45, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>In 1999, Treaty #3 set out on a course to form their own police force. It took four years and the dream is just beginning.</p>
<p>"The eagle has landed" Formally incorporated on April 1st 2003, Treaty Three Police assmed all policing duties from the OPP administerd First nations Program to become the latest stand alone police force. Currently serving officers were signed on and the intial group of 12 newly hired recruits attended the Ontario Police College were sent to Aylmer Ontario in spring 2003</p>
<p>Treaty Three Police services 18 550 First Nations residents in 28 First Nation Territories in the Kenora and Rainy River districts. Due to the vast patrol area, (55,000 square miles) T3PS was divied into two major "subdivisions" with smaller satellite detachments left over from the OPP administered program. The Kenora subdivision was headquarted in Dalles First Nation. Territories in the Rainy River district operated out of the Couchiching Sub Divsion, located on Couchiching First Nations. The City of Kenora hosts the Treaty Three Headquarters, where Chief of Police Brian Rupert oversees daily operations. Until his recent retirement , Deputy Chief Wally McLeod surpervised the Kenora SubDivision from both here and the Kenora OPP detachment. Deputy Chief Ernest Jones was his counterpart in Couchiching until his retirement in the summer of 2006. Staff Sgt Larry Indian has since taken over. Deputy Chief Louie Napish currently serves as second in commnad of T3PS. Assisting them are several Staff Sergeants, some of whom are retired or seconds OPP officers. Treaty Three has its own Crime Unit also based in Kenora led by Detective Sergeant Rob Bears, assisted by several Detective constables. Like other police services, the Detective branch runs parallel to the front line officers.</p>
<p>Each Sub Division (sometimes referred to as "detachment", a holdover term from the OPP program) employs a number of Sergeants who answer to the sub-division commander in the day to day operations. Front line policing is performed by Constables. After graduating Ontairo polcie college, each recruit is grante the rank of Fifth Class constable (roughly equivalent to the OPP recruit constable), promoted based on experience, reaching the rank of First Class constable within three years.</p>
<p>Currently T3PS uses the Chevy Impala and Chevy Tahoe after the OPP Ford Victoria, Expedition and Excursions were phased out. Also in service are boats, fourwheelers and snow machines, allowing for a variety of deployment methods.</p>
<p>T3PS also uses the same personal equipment, radio and computer systems and training system (such as the annual "block training" ) as the OPP, since the majority of the equipment and operations used by the First nations program is still used by the currrent service, allowing ease of use, and greater cooperation between neighbouring forces until T3PS can provide its own in service training united new police facilities.</p>
<p>T3PS's motto is "policing for the people by the people"</p>

<p><b>Tamahome</b> (鬼宿) is a character is the anime and manga series Fushigi Yūgi.</p>
<p>Tamahome is a loser who tries to risk his life for Miaka but always ends up hurting her. He is, sadly, the main character of Fushigi Yuugi. He is totally useless throughout most of the series. All he does is try to "love" Miaka, yet he ends up hurting her in a lot of ways. Nuriko should have been the one for Miaka, but sadly, Tamahome is. He has no skill at all, and could be defeated easily. Though his gift is Martial Arts, he does not know how to even fight well with it, as well as going to far, far enough to turn into a demon, as you can see in Fushigi Yuugi Episode 27. Tamahome is also careless, and rushes into battle without even thinking. He isn't mature either. He's just stupid and should die and burn in hell. 24.193.27.151 03:39, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The fourth in a series of live action movies from Troma productions. Toxie, a man who has been mutated into a radioactive hero of colossal strength by nuclear waste, finds himself in an alternate universe following a massive explosion. Here he must face evil versions of himself and his superhero friends as he tries to find his way back home. In typical Troma style there is plenty of nudity, gory violence, and scenes of generally poor taste. A must have for Troma fans.</p>

<p>Des Blood 2 is a second game in the Illusion Soft's Des Blood series. The gameplay is shooter with interactive hentai scenes.</p>
<p>Plot. The game starts with the awaikening of the main heroine from the cryo-chamber. She does not remember anything about who she is and where she from. Only things that she fount around is set of clothes, a handgun and a medallion with the date AD2156 and name "Lily" engraved on it. When she steps out from he cryo-coffin, she meets different people and gradually learn that her name is Lily Sandrea, the time is AD2158, and she is on the wanted list of the Space Army. She recieves help from the some people she meets - clone hunter Kikuno and another girl named Kito. The Space Army is controlled by the sapient super-computer Isys that dwell on the space station, and Isys wants the next-generation chip Isys2 that is implanted in the Lily's head. But that whouldn't be so easy to obtain, and in the end Lily manages to destroy orbital station and escape without beeng consumed by the mad AI.</p>
<p>Characters.</p>
<p>Lily Sandrea. Main heroine of the game. Brown-haired slim girl who does not remember who she is at the beginning. She bears a Isys2 super-computer chip implanted in her head which is causing her lot of troubles.</p>
<p>Kikuno. A clone-hunter, she meets Lily and helps her a lot. Silver-headed, she has two spare bodies - one for her hard and dangerous work and another - for phisical pleasures. She is older of the three sisters survived Rostready Incident.</p>
<p>Wolfgan. A clone-hunter and somewhat of the Kikuno's battle buddy, he too helps Lily and saves her before his death. He is former lover of the Hotaru Sara and was at the very beginning of the Rostready Incident that caused Isys to existance.</p>
<p>Kito. A girl who saves Lily from her first conflict with the Space Army. Redhead, boyish and impatient.</p>
<p>Satou Tatsuya. Free chaser who hunts down criminals for reward. It happened that he killed Kikuno's younger sister when they where little kids. His wife Emily is older sister of Kito.</p>
<p>Graphics To put it simply - it's awful. All levels is just square boxes, frightening characters models and even more frightening hentai scenes. Well, its old.</p>
<p>Sound/Music Music has nothing to remember about, except the full title song. Sound standart - all main dialogues in the game fully dubbed with voices, and so all the hentai scenes.</p>
<p>Gameplay Gameplay consists mainly of the two parts - running/shooting and interactive sex scenes.</p>
<p>Running/shooting is quite simple - you run through level boxes with periodically popped battle events when the schene stops, enemies appears and you shoot them with the mouse cursor just like in some lightgun-shooting videogame. There is different weapons to select with different killing power - guns, shotgun, machine-gun, grenade launcher, every one of them has it's own limited ammunition. During your journey you will stamble on the different items on the levels - weapons, ammo, health packs, card keys and different items to use later in the sex scenes.</p>
<p>Sex scenes The sex scenes consist of three main parts - static image, realtime 3D-scenes and prerendered video. On the static images you select action (look, touch, tongue, finger, dildo, real thing) and the place on the girl where to apply selected action. It will follows with voiced conversation of with the 3D-scene. 3D-schenes is the most awful part of it. Well, as soon as you make through it, you will be rewarded with the video. It is still quite primitive but far better than ugly realtime 3D.</p>

<li><b>Declined</b>. Two problems here: First, the article should say at least a little more about the author, and ideally say something about the books as well. Second, the odd cutoff in the opening paragraph -- that he's written these books since his entry into a particular religion -- suggests that there might be point-of-view issues here (in other words, that the article might be choosing to emphasize only the religious aspects of the author's life while disregarding other aspects that might be equally notable). <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 00:43, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>PbC is a nationally driven health care programme in England, which aims to deliver better care, better patient experience and better value. It represents a jump in the ethos of the NHS (National Health Service), which will allow for a greater diversity of providers with more freedom to innovate and improve services. National tariffs will be used to cost procedures and commissioning will provide a much stronger voice for patients along with greater choice of service. Health Care Intelligence will support the identification of demands and gaps where areas are in need of further development. Commissioning will harness diverse information sources such as those from Public Health (e.g. demographics, mortality), Local Authorities (e.g. social exclusion), patient satisfaction (e.g. surveys) so that health care provision is responsive and effective.</p>
<p>A step towards PbC according to Department of Health (DH) guidance requires the PCT to derive an indicative PbC budget and to monitor and report on performance. Unfortunately the National Programme for Information Technology has been delayed and supporting tools such as the Secondary Users Service (SUS) are not available to assist with this. The onus has since fall on the PCT to develop its own in-house mechanisms utilising local data to derive an indicative budget.</p>
<p>Although PbC is one element of a comprehensive health reform program it does represent a fundamental change in the ethos of the NHS and so has to be suitably incorporated into organisational development. The challenges for PbC include:</p>
<p>1. considerably more information to analyse than during the introduction of GP Fund-Holding in 1992.</p>
<p>2. establishing the roles and interaction of the PCT and practices.</p>
<p>3. monitoring and identifying information anomalies so that action can be taken to improve information.</p>
<p>4. identifying areas suitable for service redesign.</p>

<p>Pat Keogh is a professional footballer from the west from Scotland. He is 6 foot 2 inches and weighs 13 stone. His solid build has allowed him to create a reputation as a bustling striker, although he can play in midfield or defence also. He has played for clubs such as Maryhill FC, Clyde FC and, most recently, Hamilton Academicals FC. However, this season he is playing at Partick Thistle of the west end of Glasgow. During his time at Clyde, he became known as the thorn in Thistle's side due to his good scoring record against them. Most notably, his early header in a 3-1 victory at Broadwood Stadium in season 2001/2002, when Thistle were overwhelming favourites. So far, this season he has played in Thistle's only pre season game to far at Lancaster City. He scored a looping header in the Jags 2-1 victory. He is expected to be a key player in the Jags season due to his scoring ability, as well as his versatility.</p>

<p>A DVDRip (not a dictionary word) is usually a movie compressed to Xvid format, and does not play on regular DVD-players. (It is often confused with DVDR, which is a direct copy of a DVD, where the movie is compressed to fit on a standard DVD disc.)</p>

<p>Plastic Venus were the musical expression of a large section of angry and defiant Israeli youths in the early 90's. Combining <a href="../../../n/o/i/Noise_rock.html" title="Noise rock">noise rock</a> guitars, relentless drumming and the inimitable performance style of singer Ronit Bergman (often leading to gigs meeting an early ending), the band appeared in numerous small venues in Tel Aviv to an increasing following.</p>
<p>The first Plastic Venus album (originally released in 1993 through 3rd Ear and later remastered and reissued by Fact records) is a testament to that period and a glaring example of a true noise-rock classic.</p>
<p>The original line-up of the band included, besides Bergman, Guitarist Yoram Gur, Bassist Hagar Magen and drummer Ilan "Diamond" Leibowitz. After the completion of the recordings for their debut album, the band (sans Diamond, who sadly passed away in 2005) moved to London and went on touring Europe and eventually recording Helven Park (for producer <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Newman_a7e9.html" title="Colin Newman">Colin Newman</a>'s Swim records) in 1995.</p>

<p>Richard (Rick) Diefenderfer is the author the book titled, "Creating Christian Communities - A Simple Cell Church System", <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-59196-171-8</a>; pastor a Celebrated Community Church and founder of "The School of Cell-Based Church Planting".</p>
<p><b>About the Book</b> -- This book was written as a “road map” for those with the God-given vision to create a working cell-based church. The writer has made every attempt to maintain a simple readability in both format and language. He provides clear definitions throughout in order to maintain his meaning for the reader. The use of an interview transcript format, dot points and lists, anecdotes and orderly explanations appropriate for each teaching point, are all broken down into 27 chapters.</p>
<p>Commencing with an explanation of the vision God gave this church planter for this church system many years before, the author relates how the development of the structure formed and goes into detail as to how the vision of the church and the day-to-day actions of its members conform and support this structure. He lists and explains the benefits of cell-based church over the Program Based Design, and spends some time on the leadership map and on how important this is to maintaining correct teaching. The division between ministries within the church and programs, and their differences and similarities, is thoroughly covered.</p>
<p>This author seems deeply concerned that people rediscover relational living. To this church planter/pastor, cell groups within a simple cell-based church system answer this need in a way that conforms to a biblical definition of the church; body of Christ.</p>
<p>The author believes that balance between worship, instruction, fellowship and expressions of our faith in Jesus Christ through friendship evangelism with skeptics and edification of the Saints is the fourfold purpose of the church. This book presents and promotes the cell-based system as a viable and simple alternative to traditional church structure, and does so in a non-threatening and easily understandable fashion.</p>
<p>This book does many a favor by taking the concepts others have written about the cell-based church and using a language and writing style the 'common man' is really able to grasp and understand</p>

<li><b>Declined</b>. This reads like a review of the book, not an encyclopedia article about the book. An example: "This book does many a favor by taking the concepts others have written about the cell-based church and using a language and writing style the 'common man' is really able to grasp and understand". Who says that "many" are looking for more information about the cell-based church? Who says that the book is written in a style that the 'common man' can grasp and understand? A book review can make claims like this, because the reader can judge the claims based on the credibility of the author. A Wikipedia article can't work that way, because it has no one author whose credibility the reader can judge. That's why claims like this in Wikipedia articles must be cited to and backed by verifiable sources. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 03:52, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Andrè Isak Wøien is a Norwegian Citizen, he`s born in Tønsberg, Norway 20th of november 1969. Moved to Sweden in 1994 where he worked as a graphic designer and designed the logo for Linkøping Hockeyclub. His design was awarded as Sweden`s coolest hockeylogo in three years a row, `94, `95 and finally 1996 when the awards was ended. He also worked as a webdesigner to launch one of the worlds earliest icehockey sites in 1994. In later days he`s been seen in some articles of a Norwegian men`s magazine, named Vi Menn, where he talks about his decline into heroine abuse, and working as a beggar on the streets of Oslo to avoid criminal acts as a way to keep clear of hurting innocent third parties of his abuse. He also showed up in a documentary about a room for heroine abusers to take their shots, in Oslo. This programme was viewed at TV2`s; "Dokument2", in april, 2005. The programme has a clear social agenda, and he expressed a clear opinion to a need for a "needle room", in downtown Oslo. The city has been bothered by an unnaturally heavy abuse of heroine, to a city of it`s size.</p>

Pinecrest Pinecrest is a subdivision built in 1960 of brick ranch and split level homes along three streets. The homes were built by Vari Bros. in the sturdiest of fashions, it is doubtful much profit was made from the construction of these homes. Located at the rear of the development is Pinecrest Park, a county park with the added bonus of a creek (Muddy Run)along with a full size basketball court. It is located on Kirkwood Hwy. (Rt.2) and Milltown Rds.</p>

<li><b>Declined</b>. Wikipedia simply isn't the place to "start now". This is an encyclopedia. Encyclopedias don't publish original research on a subject; they collect and summarize information that has already been published in other sources. If there's no published information on your hometown, then it's simply not appropriate for an encyclopedia article. That's not a knock against Pinecrest; many of us would love to live in a place that's so quiet that little is published about it. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 03:56, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>--156.34.212.18 17:03, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>Danse Villageoise is a piece originally written for violin and piano in 1929 by Montreal composer, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Champagne_9dfa.html" title="Claude Champagne">Claude Champagne</a>. He later arranged the work for <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_quartet.html" title="String quartet">string quartet</a> in 1936, then for <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_orchestra.html" title="String orchestra">string orchestra</a> somewhat later, and finally, sometime after 1954, for full <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orchestra.html" title="Orchestra">orchestra</a>.</p>
<p>In complete contrast to the extended phrases of his romantic compositions, Champagne has based almost the entire composition on a single clear eight-bar melody in A major.</p>
<p>The second melody is a variation of the first, in the key of E (dominant). All of the other sections are closely related to the original theme with one exception.</p>
<p><b>Character</b></p>
<p>Champagne recalls a rustic scene in <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Quebec_7127.html" title="Old Quebec">Old Quebec</a> with the diffler playing as the villagers dance a lively and ageless <a href="../../../r/o/u/Round_dance.html" title="Round dance">round dance</a>.</p>
<p>Tempo is indicated <a href="../../../v/i/f/Vif.html" title="Vif">vif</a>. This is French for lively. Duple meter (2/4) moves the piece along quickly.</p>
<p>Attractive, folklike theme is reflected in the accompaniment after each statement by the violin. The piece also features an off-beat rhythm throughout.</p>

<p>The Tree Council, the organisation that was founded to follow up the success of Plant A Tree in ’73 (National Tree Planting Year) is the umbrella body for over 150 organisations working together for trees – planting, caring for and enjoying them – and a forum for tackling issues relating to trees and woods. It promotes the improvement of the environment by the planting and conservation of trees and woods in town and country throughout the UK. Members range from professional, non-governmental, specialist and trade organisations, including other conservation charities, to government departments and local authorities.</p>
<p>It works towards</p>
<pre>
Making trees matter to everyone
More trees, of the right kind, in the right places
Better care for all trees, of all ages
Inspiring effective action for trees
</pre>
<p><br />
It is responsible for an annual programme that includes Seed Gathering Season, National Tree Week, and Walk in the Woods month, supporting the groups organising local events. To find out more about what is happening near you, click on the events link on the website for details of events or call the Tree Council info line on 020 7940 8180 (office hours). It also co-ordinates the national volunteer Tree Warden Scheme and operates a fund giving tree-planting grants to schools and communities, as well as working with partners on an agenda for change that includes its Tree Care Campaign, Green Monuments Campaign and Hedge Tree Campaign.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Seed Gathering Season: Seed Gathering Season starts on 23 September (the autumn equinox, considered to be the first day of autumn) and continues until 23 October, giving everyone plenty of days on which they could hold events. These could be anything from guided walks enjoying the beauty of autumn colours to workshops and other activities to gather seeds, nuts and fruits to grow a whole range of trees.</p>
<p><br />
National Tree Week: This is the Tree Council’s festival to mark the start of the tree planting season, and a nationwide celebration of trees and woods. It begun in 1975, is launched on the Wednesday before the last weekend in November and runs through until (and including) the first weekend in December. Across the country there will be lots of opportunities to plant trees, or to take part in events, walks, talks, songs, story-telling and tree dressing. How to get involved: Plant a tree in your garden, school grounds or neighbourhood. (Tree Planting Tips are available free from the Tree Council, with an S.A.E.) Enjoy one of the National Tree Week events organised by The Tree Council's members, its Tree Wardens and other supporters. Organise your own event. Get ideas from the list above, or do anything interesting to raise awareness of the value of trees!</p>
<p><br />
Walk in the Woods Month: Walk in the Woods, throughout May, is the time to encourage everyone to enjoy trees and woods in spring. It’s a time to go out for a quiet walk among trees with family and friends or take part in local Walk in the Woods events. It’s a great month to go down to the woods or enjoy the trees in a local park. Spring flowers, birdsong and fresh green leaves make them particularly inviting. Walks, talks and other events take place in town and countryside; events are organised by Tree Council members, its Tree Wardens and other supporters and include bluebell walks,teddy bears’ picnics, dawn choruses, woodland open days, tree trails around towns, treasure hunts, bat and badger watches, games and story telling.</p>
<p><br />
The Tree Council's Tree Warden Scheme: The Tree Warden Scheme is a national initiative to enable people to play an active role in conserving and enhancing their local trees and woods. The scheme was founded and is co-ordinated by The Tree Council. It is currently funded as part of the Government’s Cleaner, Safer, Greener initiative and in partnership with National Grid, which has a well-established policy of community involvement and environmental care. Tree Wardens are volunteers, appointed by parish councils or other community organisations, who gather information about their local trees, get involved in local tree matters and encourage local practical projects to do with trees and woods. Since the Scheme's launch in September 1990, The Tree Council has been working closely with Local Authority and voluntary sector partners to set up Tree Warden Networks throughout the UK. By the end of 2000, there were over 7,000 Tree Wardens.</p>
<p><br />
Tree Care Campaign: Just a handful of simple tasks — that’s all it takes to give a recently planted tree a better start in life. The Tree Council campaigns to remind everyone who has planted trees in the last five years to revisit them in early spring and give them some aftercare. The ideal time for this vital aftercare is March or April, although there are tasks that can be undertaken right through until September. Gardeners, volunteer Tree Wardens, tree professionals and anyone else who has planted trees during this winter’s planting season or in recent years are urged to make time to go back and check on their young trees.</p>
<p><br />
Green Monuments Campaign: The value of trees of historical, cultural or ecological importance is already formally recognised in many countries. This is not the case in the UK. In contrast to historic buildings, there are no legal safeguards specific to ancient trees or others of heritage significance. Many of them could be felled tomorrow without penalty. Such protection that does exist for historic trees is coincidental and not by design. Often, heritage trees survive today largely thanks to the individuals, past and present, who have cared for them. However, it takes only one person in the life of a tree to neglect, mutilate or destroy it. The Tree Council’s Green Monuments Campaign is a concerted effort by the UK’s lead tree campaigning partnership to gain special protected status for trees of great historical, cultural or ecological significance — heritage trees. The Tree Council has brought together its member organisations to campaign for safeguards for green monuments; encouragement for custodians to look after them; support and advice on their care.</p>
<p><br />
Hedge Tree Campaign: Hedge trees are a traditional part of the UK landscape and havens for wildlife. Yet, of an estimated 1.8 million hedge trees, nearly a third are over a century old and may disappear from the landscape at any time over the next 25 years. Without an immediate effort to establish new hedge trees, there will be profound changes to the UK landscape and its biodiversity. This campaign will increase awareness of why hedge trees matter, halt their decline and help the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) meet an important National Biodiversity Action Plan target - to ensure there is no net loss of hedgerow trees in the UK.</p>
<p><br />
More information on all of these and other activities can be obtained on The Tree Council website.</p>

<p>On the 26th of the 5th of the year 2006, the Tree Haters or WATT (War Against the Tree's) was created. The Tree Haters hate tree's, as you may have guessed. They hate trees because the two leaders were at an educational facility, and they were walking along a path, and they made the claim that one of the trees "looked at them funny", since then, they have been fighting to get rid of the trees and everything that supports them. They have formed a website, and have also recruited members.</p>
<p>They are currently recruiting (as they always are, and always will be) as they wish for more members. The Tree Haters have ranks and points. The way it works is the leaders (Known as Pringle Gods) give you tasks to do, and once you have done one, you are awarded a point. When you accumulate enough points, you will advance in a rank. Eventually you will get to a certain rank, where you cannot use points to get advance to the next rank, and you may only advance, when the leaders think you should. The rank Pringle God may not be obtained by anyone except for the founders of the Tree Haters. Eventually when you get to the last rank available (Pringle Leader) you will be able to assign lower ranks tasks, but you must have permission from the Pringle Gods first.</p>
<p>Thier slogan is: Changing the worlds view of tree's, one person at a time. They would love you to join, and it is free, you just have to hate tree's.

<p>Vavavava: Vavavava is a secret language created by two anonymous individuals. This language consists of describing things rather than naming them as you speak. An example would be (mom, can I use the portable telecommunication device?), rather than;(mom, can I use your cell phone?) Often when writing in this language, you spell things how they are (fone=phone, or xtreme=extreme. Anyone can use this language among his or her friends. This language is growing every day, as new terms are created.</p>

Research indicates that metastereotypes may have important consequences for thoughts and behaviour in intergroup settings. Although the existence of socially shared metastereotypes have been demonstrated, it is not yet clear when metastereotypes are activated and when not. Joris Lammers studies whether a relationship between people of groups with unequal power may lead to metastereotyping, and investigates what variables are vital mediators and moderators.</p>

<p>Over the years, a number of comic-book publishers have created comics taking advantage of the large stable of characters, detailed fictional universe, and rich back-story contained in the Oz books and related writings of L. Frank Baum and his successors. Some are non-revisionist, almost reverent extension of the existing Oz mythos, like the semi-canonical graphic novels of <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Shanower_e535.html" title="Eric Shanower">Eric Shanower</a>. Others mix characters from multiple milieux, like DC Comics 3-issue <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Carrot_554c.html" title="Captain Carrot">Captain Carrot</a> miniseries, <i>The Oz-Wonderland War</i>. Many revise or update the characters and events of the Oz books to create "darker" stories that go in more adult directions, like the multiple different <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliber_Comics_aede.html" title="Caliber Comics">Caliber Comics</a> Oz miniseries, or the <a href="../../../o/z/_/Oz_Squad_13bb.html" title="Oz Squad">Oz Squad</a> series.</p>

<p>The Bwa Kell is a goblin gang from Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident. They try to take over Haven City using softnose lasers and AA batteries. They almost succeed because all the LEP guns were disabled by Opal Koboi,but because of Holly Short and Artemis Fowl,their plans were foiled. Some facts about goblins: They're very stupid They shed their skin They can make fireballs They don't have eyelids so they have to lick their eyeballs</p>

<p>Mervall and Descant Brill (aka Merv and Scant) are twin brothers and pixies (which is pretty rare so they got into Canto-a fairy magazine) who aid Opal Koboi in her plans of world domination by becoming janitors at Dr. Argon's clinic (where Opal resided after she went into her self-induced coma). They successfully help her escape but are later killed by Opal in the end of The Opal Deception.</p>

<p>Gameplay in Trickster is mostly point-and-click based, very much like Ragnarok Online. There are, however, some unique elements. First, there is the Drill System, which allows a player to drill in certain types of terrain for items and EXP. Second, there is the Card Battling System, which sets two characters against each other in a game of cards, played with card items found in various places in normal gameplay.=</p>

<p>Tabitha Yim, of Korean American descent,(known as Tabby by friends and fans) is a former United States Women's Artistic Gymnastics elite. Touted as a junior international elite to watch for her expressive dance and strong balance beam perforamnces, Tabitha quickly progressed as one of the major gymnasts in the 2001-2004 gymnastics quad. In her first major senior competition (where she was coached by Beth and Steve Rybacki of Gliders), 2001 U.S. Nationals, she placed second to 2000 Olympic Team squad member, Tasha Schwikert. Her runner-up placement secured her a spot on the World Team, occurring in Ghent, Belgium, where she placed 7th in the AA competition, and 6th in the FX finals. A fall on the balance beam in preliminary team competition cost her a position in the balance beam final, where she was a legitimate contender for a medal. The United States gymnastics team won a surprising bronze. Many had disregarded the team's chances even though every single member of the 2001 WAG World Team (comprised of Katie Heenan, Tasha Schikert, Tabitha Yim, Rachel Tidd, Ashley Rae Miles, and Mohini Bhwardwaj) made an event final (Katie Heenan went on to win bronze on the uneven bars). Tabitha's team bronze at World's 2001 would be the last major international medal she would receive as injuries would hamper and cut short her elite career.</p>
<p>Out for most of 2002 with a series of lower body injuries, Tabitha returned to 2002 Nationals with just two weeks of full training. Considered to be a legitimate contender for a world team position, Tabitha did not disappoint, turning in a wonderful performance that garnered her a surprise consecutive runner-up All-Around placement, second once again to Tasha Schikert. However, an injury post-nationals sidelined her from the 2002 World Event Finals team, where she could have contended on balance beam and floor exercise for medals.</p>
<p>Out for most of 2003 with a series of injuries again, Tabitha did not compete at 2003 Nationals and missed out on qualifying for the 2003 World team which went on to win the team gold. Tabitha did return in time for compete in the Olympic Year. At nationals, she placed a resurgent 7th in the AA, which would place her within striking distance of the Olympic Team. At the Olympic Trials, Tabitha continued in her bid to become an Olympic Team member with an electrifying 4th place AA performance, a performance many have argued would have placed her on the team. However, with a lengthy selection process, her selection will always be in doubt. Just pior to the closed door Olympic Selection Training Camp, Tabitha sustained a serious Achilles tendon injury that ended her Olympic aspirations and effectively terminated her elite career.</p>
<p>Tabitha is currently an NCAA gymnast, competing for Stanford, where she continues to impress.</p>

<p>The Discord of a Forgotten Sketch</p>
<p>Montreal 's angular “défonce” warriors the Discord of a Forgotten Sketch, are tearing genres apart one by one. Combining styles with precision and chaos, just plain madness, slit your veins noise-jazzy-hardcore with a that of grind. They are innovative, with awaken new ideas and a live act that is sure to rank them among fan favourites in years to come.</p>
<p>They have shared the stage with acts such as Hot Cross, Cobra Noir, Electric Frankenstein, The Sainte-Catherines, the Expectorated Sequence, In Dying Days, Figure four, Maximum R N R, A Perfect Murder, North of America, Between the Buried and Me, From Autumn to Ashes, Daughters… they played the Pop Montreal festival twice, and appeared on the Pop Mtl's 2004 compilation. They have played many shows in Canada , and have crossed the borders to the USA twice. With a live performance that is sure to blow you down, and pull your eyes off. New Romance for Kids holds the first EP, 5 tracks of well structured chaos, clocking to 20 min. of intense jazzy drumming, strumming technical six strings, noisy bass and screamy vocals, a must for every fan of heavy music.</p>
<p>With extensive touring, you are sure to catch the band somewhere around your area in the year to come. The road ahead looks promising, noisy and damaged.</p>
