<li><b>Rebuttal</b>: Everything above was posted to skew the voting and make people turn against me and bias their viewpoint of the nomination and the entry. It's a pretty sick tactic. It shows they care little about the actual strength of the entry; which should be the only thing considered. Since the "warnings" have been posted, some people have even said that they've voted <i>only</i> because of the alleged misconduct. Consequently, they and the people who are engaging in this witchhunt should be ashamed of themselves. They've done irreparable damage to their integrity and to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 01:01, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Very untrue. The comments posted above were to question the strength of your argument, as per <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> it is prohibited to use a sockpuppet to create a illusion of a broader support for your side of the argument. Your "campaigning" comes from you and your sockpuppet, and you even admitted that you use sockpuppetry to aid yourself in AfD. <a href="../../../s/y/c/User%7ESycthos_ff74.html" title="User:Sycthos">Sycthos</a><a href="../../../s/y/c/User_talk%7ESycthos_0fbd.html" title="User talk:Sycthos"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 05:46, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is a complete lie. I never admitted using sockpuppets to "aid myself in AfD"; nor have I <b>ever</b> done this, even when I <i>did</i> use sockpuppets in my first days in Wikipedia!</li>
<li>If you look at the history, an admin checked IPs and confirmed that I never did this to sway a vote and I still never have done this.</li>
<li>You need to get your facts straight and show that you care for the folks at Wikipedia. This atrocious lie/accusation at the top of many pages is inexcusable and I'd like an apology; and I think the good people that you may have influenced with this lie should receive an apology as well. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 04:41, 24 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I acknowledge your attempts to evangelize Wikipedia, but your argument will not stand without a statement disputing against it. First of all, if your statements remain true, then why is <a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiggins2_f047.html" title="User:Wiggins2">Wiggins2</a> blocked 24 hours for "external campaigning group spamming talk pages to pack Wikipedia debates"? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Daddy_576d.html" title="User:Big Daddy">User:Big Daddy</a> is another one of your main sockpuppets. If you look at its <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Big_Daddy_045d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Big Daddy">contribution history</a>, there is no doubt that you have violated <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> for using sockpuppets to create an "illusion for a broader support" for your position.</li>
<li>I do not appreciate your constant and veiled use of <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphemism.html" title="Euphemism">euphemisms</a> and words/phrases with a slightly more negative connotation when used against others. <i>This is a complete lie</i> is not correct, as you have, in fact, used sockpuppetry for AfDs. Also, I, in fact, do care for the folks on Wikipedia. If I didn't care, I would not even mind editing any mistakes I catch in articles, reverting and simple vandalism I see, or voicing my opinion in Wikipedia debates. I openly apologize to you if I have offended you, but I would also request you to conform to Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy.

<dd>Not quite. The correct search term is <b>"thomas ice" christian</b> which yields 21,700 hits. As anyone can prove, <b>at least</b> 25,000 of the 37,400 "Thomas Ice" hits are about this author. Probably many more, around 30,000. Even so, this does not mean "notable" to me... Actually, anyone with some knowledge of Christendom and eyes in his head (or fingers on his hand) can see that Thomas Ice is notable, both positively and negatively, to millions of people. OK, where notability is disputed, references can clinch it, but really, in this case it's like trying to prove apples taste good (218 Google hits).<a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">&#160;AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 16:51, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With all due respect, two things. First, since the alleged vote stacking, there haven't been any votes to keep; just to delete. My alleged vote stacking simply asked four or five people to vote (not one way or the other). So, you being strongly influenced by that doesn't make any sense. Furthermore, voting one way out of spite isn't in Wikipedia's best interests, so I'm sure that'll be noted by many as well. Honorable Wikipedians will examine the entry and decide one way or the other. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 18:46, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Mr. Gastrich</b>, allow me to say for myself, I am an Afd regular and I often vote to delete, not because I am a deletionist but because those doing the nominating usually have good reason. That said, I also do due diligence. I am very proud of having "saved" several articles, including a Russian folk song <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Vo_sadu_li,_v_ogorode" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Vo_sadu_li,_v_ogorode" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and a truly tacky but notable drinking game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Beer_Mile" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Beer_Mile" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. I also chastise those whom I suspect of bad-faith nominations. I do not consider these bad-faith noms. It appears to me that you, as you cannot rewrite the article for LBU since it is protected, have decided to take another tack and make a list of people who went to LBU and write articles about them. While it is understandable that you would want to try to gain for your alma mater as much credibility as can be gleaned, filling the pages of WP with articles about people whose main claim to fame is that they got their diploma from the same place as you is vanity. You have compounded vanity with attempts at vote-stacking, and now with personal attacks<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FThomas_Ice&amp;diff=35645089&amp;oldid=35644864" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FThomas_Ice&amp;diff=35645089&amp;oldid=35644864" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Guettarda&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35775394" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Guettarda&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35775394" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and accusations of "spite voting" which is nonsense in my case, and I believe in the case of every editor voting here.

<p>"...Several weeks ago, JCSM (Jesus Christ Saves Ministries) noticed this trend and created a new ministry called Wiki4Christ. It's an organization that exists to make sure Christians have a united and represented voice on Wikipedia.

<p>Yesterday, the entries below were nominated for deletion. This means there will be a vote on whether or not to keep them. Please come and let your voice be heard! This endeavor will only take 10-15 minutes and it will be something you can do with your online time that will further the kingdom of God. Wouldn't you like to vote to keep Christian entries on Wikipedia?..."</p>

<dd>I think your analysis may be in error. Thomas Ice is essentially a nobody in the real world. He has a small cult following, and produced books of little or no value to anyone but those who share his rather unorthodox views. (This may seem harsh, but reality sometimes bites). In a way, what would really be best would be an article on "Inerrantist Writers" (or something like that) that mentioned Ice, but wasting kilobytes on this guy alone is a tad ridiculous. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 11:06, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
