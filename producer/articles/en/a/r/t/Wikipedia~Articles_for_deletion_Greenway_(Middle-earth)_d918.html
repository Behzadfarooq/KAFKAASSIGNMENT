<li><b>Keep</b>. Abusing the annoying term "cruft" is inherently POV, and if you're going to delete articles about fiction there are far worse examples to start. Nothing in the Wikipedia policy can be abused to delete this article. This is not just any road in Middle-earth, but arguably the most important one. <span class="internal" title="View my user page" style="white-space: nowrap;">-- <a href="../../../a/n/%C3%A1/User%7EAn%C3%A1rion_c250.html" title="User:Anárion">Jordi</a>·<a href="../../../a/n/%C3%A1/User_talk%7EAn%C3%A1rion_e6d6.html" title="User talk:Anárion"><span title="Leave me a message">✆</span></a></span> 06:50, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Eh, why the fuck can't I make up my mind? I'm neutral again. Maybe after I sleep I'll be strong keep. Fuck the man with the deletionist plan. I'll abstain, now and in the future, due to not being able to make up my mind. By the way, the 'cruft' labels were sarcastic, lashing out at those who label articles like <a href="../../../y/o/r/York_Road_7201.html" title="York Road">York Road</a> 'roadcruft'.

<li><b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../m/i/d/Category%7EMiddle-earth_places_8776.html" title="Category:Middle-earth places">Category:Middle-earth_places</a> is chockfull of valleys, rivers, peaks, and several roads.

<li>Keep. Important element in one of the key <a href="../../../f/i/c/Ficton.html" title="Ficton">fictons</a> of modern literature. The mind boggles.

<li><b>Comment</b>. SPUI raises a reasonable question, and doesn't do so offensively. The only time he's rude is about/to himself and about the general business of commenting on Wikiworthiness. (Out of laziness, I'll assume he's male.) There are now 80 "Middle earth places", 22 "Middle-earth hobbits", etc. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Middle-earth_articles_6a7b.html" title="List of Middle-earth articles">List of Middle-earth articles</a> is what makes <i>my</i> mind boggle. I don't rush to say that there's anything wrong with this -- they're much-loved books and all that. (I enjoyed them myself when I was about 14.) But I too wonder whether something is askew when fictional roads are OK but admittedly less-than-famous roads in the real world are not. Is this where SPUI should have raised the question? Perhaps not, but I see no reason why anyone should "chastise" him. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 11:15, 2005 Jan 13 (UTC)</li>
<li>While I do believe that all these breakout Middle-Earth articles are getting out of hand, this isn't the place to address it. I think a lot of merging could be done, particularly for the minor articles (of which there are plenty). Of course, any proposal to do this will be fought tooth and nail by the Tolkien fans. A modest proposal I made for combining the all the Kings of Numenor into a single article (with the 3 or 4 important ones still keeping articles of their own) was dismissed as crazy and threatened with immediate reversion if it were even attempted. And yet with many other important works of fiction people have no problem with characters redirecting back to the original book. At some point Wikipedia as a whole has to get some sort of sense of proportion, and some consistency. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:07, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's a road. In a book of fiction. Not majorly central to the plot (in the way that, say the Mines of Moria were), and with no break out effect whatsoever on the world. And people think that someone should be chastised for daring to question why this is would be in an encyclopedia? IT'S FICTION, PEOPLE! Put it this way - would anyone voting 'keep' for this consider voting 'delete' if I wrote an article about the recent Chelsea vs Manchester United football match? Be honest, plenty of you would thing that was unnecessary sporting trivia. Well, some people think the same about what you may appear to find tremendously interesting. If you want to know about this road, read the book. It doesn't exist separately. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 21:48, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Disingenous nomination. If <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> is "neutral" about the article then he should not have nominated the article, it's as simple as that. <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_8268.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point</a> VfD is for executing established policy, not a forums for creating new policy. The article itself is a borderline <b>keep.</b> It is a <i>reasonably</i> good article about a <i>reasonably</i> important part of an <i>extremely</i> notable fantasy world. Given this, the level of detail is not grossly excessive, i.e. these five paragraphs belong in some Wikipedia article. Personally I would prefer to see them within a larger, well-organized article, with or without a redirect. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:30, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd><b>cruft</b> /kruhft/ [very common; back-formation from crufty] 1. n. An unpleasant substance. The dust that gathers under your bed is cruft; the TMRC Dictionary correctly noted that attacking it with a broom only produces more. 2. n. The results of shoddy construction. 3. vt. [from `hand cruft', pun on `hand craft'] To write assembler code for something normally (and better) done by a compiler (see hand-hacking). 4. n. Excess; superfluous junk; used esp. of redundant or superseded code. 5. [University of Wisconsin] n. Cruft is to hackers as gaggle is to geese; that is, at UW one properly says "a cruft of hackers".</dd>
