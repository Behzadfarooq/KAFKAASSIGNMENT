<li>I'm inclined to agree. Reversals make this a forest fire. Convention is that when something on DRV appears on AfD, the AfD is the one that survives. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:40, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>WTF? So you stop the forest fire by reverting me, back to your version? How is that helpful? ATM we have this debate (which incidently I don't care about too much) happening over two fora. We could quite possibly get two differing results and thus a real forest fire. Opening this during a DRV is NOT AT ALL helpful. You should either have waited for ther DRV to finish - or closed it and see if anyone objected. There is now a high probability that someone will question the legitimacy of this AfD (as I do) and it itself will be sent to DrV. I'm no stickler for process - but let's keep discussions in one place. I'll not feed this fire by reverting you (as you did me), but I invite someone (else) to close one of these discussions immediately.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 21:42, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
