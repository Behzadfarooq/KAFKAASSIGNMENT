<p>99.94 is not itself notable; in a cricketing context, any content worthy of inclusion must actually be about incidents and achievements in <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Bradman_c1d9.html" title="Donald Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>'s test career, not about the number.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The 99.94 article emerged from a conversation at the cricket Wikiproject. 99.94 is a number of huge significance to millions of cricket lovers the world over. It is probably the most famous statistic in the sport and the articles should <b>not</b> be merged. Rather, the 99.94 article needs some further expansion. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 17:25, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You mean <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Cricket_9cf1.html#Iconic_scores" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Cricket">here</a>? I don't read that discussion as a consensus to create an article. I do not disagree that the number is of interest, and a matter for wonder: I am merely trying to find out whether it is verifiably notable. I'm willing to be convinced, but what can possibly go in the article that should not be in the Donald Bradman article? Similarly, it's <i>Bradman</i> that's notable, not the number that happens to be his average. Can you think of a cricketing event that would have turned out differently as a result of Bradman averaging more (or less)? Can I take a musical analogy? Consider: should <b>9</b> be documented as the number of symphonies <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beethoven.html" title="Beethoven">Beethoven</a> wrote? The symphonies are documented at Beethoven, and the influence of the number is documented at <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse_of_the_ninth.html" title="Curse of the ninth">curse of the ninth</a>. My point is that it's not <i>9</i> that's notable in that context, it just happens to be the number of symphonies he wrote: it's the <i>influence</i> the number had on other composers. --RobertG ♬ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertG_9f35.html" title="User talk:RobertG">talk</a> 17:49, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The figure is notable, like a Beethoven symphony, or an album by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Verve_e47e.html" title="The Verve">The Verve</a>. It was the product of an extraordinarily superhuman career and a touchingly human incident at the end of that career.

<li><b>Delete, don't merge.</b> This information is aptly covered in <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Bradman_c1d9.html" title="Donald Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>'s article, and the coverage there could be expanded. However, this article is not about 99.94 the number or (obviously) 99.94 the year, and the idea of an article under the topic being about this seems ludicrous. Unless 99.94 is some kind of notable <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a>, or a nickname for Donald Bradman, we shouldn't have a redirect from 99.94 to <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Bradman_c1d9.html" title="Donald Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>, so we should delete. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 17:30, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm perplexed. I thought that the criterion was <i>notability</i>. It doesn't need to be a neologism (&gt;50 years since he retired, unlikely to be new) or was someone's nickname. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 17:47, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Here, the issue is naming. Does this info belong in an encyclopedia? Sure, I think it does. Should it be in an article about "99.94"? I really don't think so. It should <i>absolutely</i> be in an article about Bradman (it is), and other articles about Cricket more generally, or even an article on outstanding records in sports generally. Or, put it from another perspective: this may be the most important thing to say about the number 99.94, but in the scheme of numbers, 99.94 is quite unimportant, and right now all we have there is an article about 99.94 that includes one piece of trivia. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 22:19, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> - merge any info not already there into D.Bradman. 99.94 not a notable number outside of cricket so does not justify own article. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethaniol_f0fa.html" title="User:Lethaniol">Lethaniol</a> 17:50, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I wasn't aware that notability criteria meant that subjects had to be notable outside of their own area. You might as well argue for deleting <a href="../../../a/s/d/Asda.html" title="Asda">Asda</a> for not being notable outside of shops/shopping. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 18:26, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> with Donald Bradman. That would be like creating the article 1.12 just for Bob Gibson's 1968 ERA, or .406 for Ted Williams' 1941 season. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 18:24, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know much about baseball, but if those figures were astonishingly, staggeringly better (by c.65%) than anything anyone else has achieved over a career and they're figures known to millions all over the world, I'd say they may be notable too. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 18:41, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would say those statistics are in a rather different category, because they're statistics for one season, not a whole career. <a href="../../../c/a/l/Cal_Ripken_2bb5.html" title="Cal Ripken">2632</a> might be a better example, and that is in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_%28number%29.html" title="2000 (number)">2000 (number)</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Turner_b872.html" title="User:Stephen Turner">Stephen Turner</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephen_Turner_5111.html" title="User talk:Stephen Turner">Talk</a>) 21:46, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Information is already located in two other places. I'm really big on pointing out the precedent not deleting certain articles would set. If we keep this then every number that has statistical significance in sports must be kept (the number of most homeruns in baseball, for example) which is clearly ridiculous and unencyclopedic. Statistical information like this is important in the context of the articles on the sport, the person achieving the record and the article on records in that sport. It, however, does not need its own article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 19:22, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Yes, fantastic achievement, but the proper place for the information is in the Bradman article. No need at all for a separate article here. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 20:19, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Please see talk page for a proposed rename of the article</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> 99.94 is absolutely unique and of special significance to millions of cricket fans all over the world. Though it may not seem important to those who live in non-cricketing countries, I assure you it is very significant to cricket fans. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayanta_Sen_1e6a.html" title="User:Jayanta Sen">Jayanta Sen</a> 21:40, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I'm a bit torn on this one, but I think it's worth keeping. I'm almost persuaded by Wildthing's argument that we are opening the floodgates to lots of other numbers that happen to be sports statistics. But in the end, I can't think of anything quite as iconic as Bradman's average, that isn't an integer (integers already have good homes). <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Turner_b872.html" title="User:Stephen Turner">Stephen Turner</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephen_Turner_5111.html" title="User talk:Stephen Turner">Talk</a>) 21:55, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The number isn't significant or notable, Bradman is. Nobody is ever going to search for 99.94 and go "ooh, look Don Bradman averaged 99.94" <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiteUnusual_1e3d.html" title="User:QuiteUnusual">QuiteUnusual</a> 21:57, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. There's no point discussing this number outside the context of Don Bradman, and any information that would go on this page is better placed on Bradman's page. -<a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmaus_1358.html" title="User:Dmmaus">dmmaus</a> 22:48, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Since its in the Bradman article, why does it need to be here? I agree that this will lead to other 'statistic' articles. 755 (868 in Japan), 4,256, 2,131.

<li>According to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Numbers_793f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Numbers">Wikipedia:WikiProject Numbers</a>, <i>A record is worth mentioning if it is from a Major League player, or if it appears in the Guinness Book of World Records. Be sure to indicate the year the record was set in order to facilitate removal when a new record is set.</i> Now the Guinness site is not forthcoming with any information, although a Google search did give me a tantalising result to guinnessworldrecords.co.uk/au, which turned out not to work. It is a notable statistic, and there are many Australians who would be able to answer you "What's the significance of 99.94?" even if they don't know much about cricket. Still, the number is only really notable in relation to Bradman, so I would suggest either have the article <b>redirect</b> to his article, or else have it redirect to <a href="../../../9/9/_/99.html" title="99">99</a> (or possibly <a href="../../../9/0/0/9000_%28number%29.html" title="9000 (number)">9000 (number)</a>, where 9994 would go), and include a mention of it there, in parallel to way integers are listed on collective pages. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 14:54, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reluctant delete</b> and take into into Bradman article. It is indeed an iconic number, but I simply don't see anybody searching for it as a number without reference to Bradman, and to give it its own article is non encyclopedic.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlp_0f7e.html" title="User:Johnlp">Johnlp</a> 22:59, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Do you think someone will search for "0.999..."? --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 07:38, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment to Dweller</b> I was waiting for someone to bring that up (.999 was a featured article a few days ago). That's a mathematical article, which is a bit different. I'd say, at least personally, peculiar numbers like that which have a unique significance in mathematics and are more likely to be searched for by people looking for articles in that subject. And besides, .999 has nothing better to link to or be merged into, it's not associated with anything but itself and the abstract mathematical concepts underlying it. 99.94, on the other hand, IS associated with something that it relies upon. People are far more likely to search for the man associated with 99.94 than vice versa, the same is not the case for .999 and other mathematical numbers of significance. And notice that 3.14 redirects to Pi and not vice versa.. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:51, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> As the originator (almost the only defender!) and only contributor to this article, I see no reason to fight what seems like overwhelming consensus. Some of the arguments presented here and on the talk page are very persuasive and I'd like to graciously concede. Will an admin please close this Afd. I'd argue for leaving a redirect to Bradman's article. I have pasted a copy of the 99.94 article into my sandbox and plan to gently insert appropriately into Bradman's main article, trying not to step on any toes along the way. No doubt there are a number of watchers of that article who'll keep me in line if I exceed the mark. Thank you everyone who participated in this Afd. I hope that my defence of the article has remained "vigorous" rather than "heated". --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 08:37, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I immediately knew what the article was about on seeing the title. It is an australian/cricket special number, and the article goes a little way to reflecting that.
