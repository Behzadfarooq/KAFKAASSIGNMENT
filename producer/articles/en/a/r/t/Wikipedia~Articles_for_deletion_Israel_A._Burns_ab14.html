<li><b>Comment:</b> According to Wiki's own standards Mr. Burns's notability is almost complete. This figure is noted among A-list communities and Political spectrums in Brooklyn, NY as well as NCAA record books across the US.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The reason I am adding this page is to jump infront of media bad mouthing&gt; There are at least a couple thousand people who have expressed intrest in this African American figure.</p>
<p>I was inclined to create this page by two very prominent photographers and Event planners as he will be heavily involved in very large congregational campaigns.</p>
<p>-This is not a vanity page- I am a web creator&gt; Please reconsider- public demand will persist&gt;</p>
<p><br />
An article is "important" enough to be included in Wikipedia if any one of the following is true:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is evidence that a reasonable number of people are, were or might be concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community).</li>
<li>It is an expansion (longer than a stub) upon an established subject.</li>
<li>Discussion on the article's talk page establishes its importance.</li>
</ol>
<p>If an article is "important" according to the above then there's no reason to delete it on the basis of it being:</p>
<ol>
<li>of insufficient importance, fame or relevance, or</li>
<li>currently small or a stub, or</li>
<li>obscure. (Detailed obscure topics hurt no-one because it's hard to find them by accident, and Wikipedia isn't paper.)</li>

<dd>Quote of WP:VANITY by Akadam: <i>Does lack of fame make a vanity article? An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia (although consensus exists regarding particular kinds of article, for instance see <a href="../../../i/n/c/Template%7EIncGuide_0522.html" title="Template:IncGuide">Template:IncGuide</a>). Borderline cases are frequently nominated for deletion and discussed on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. Lack of fame is not the same as vanity.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Furthermore, an article is not "vanity" simply because it was written by its subject; indeed, it can also be vanity if written by a fan, or close relationship. Articles about existing books, movies, games, and businesses can be "vanity" depending on the amount of recognition - e.g. a homemade movie or game, a self-published book, or a fanfic story is not generally considered encyclopedic. In general, the content is kept to salient material and not overtly promotional.'</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The key rule is to not write about yourself, nor about the things you've done or created. If they are encyclopedic, somebody else will notice them and write an article about them.</i></dd>

<li>This is my second post on this page. N Siegel posted on my Talk pages asking me to reconsider my opinion. I've <i>twice</i> re-read the article this morning and my opinion is unchanged. I cannot see why anyone outside of this person's university would have an iota of interest in him. I have a number of questions and comments that I believe are pertinent to the notability question:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li><i>why</i> was he invited to speak at a "Humanitarian of the Year" event. Is he, in fact, a humanitarian? If so, spell it out... prove his notability!</li>
<li>what is so "uncanny" about his sporting achievements? If we listed everyone who broke a couple of school and college sports records, Wikipedia would overwhelmed.</li>
<li>what is so notable about getting involved with local politics? Or even national politics? Do you want an article for every intern, every fundraiser, every camp-follower?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, this chap shows signs of developing into a noteworthy human being, if his ego is allowed to remain human-sized. He may even end up <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_polymaths.html" title="List of polymaths">here</a> one day.</p>
<p>But currently, I'm amazed that so many people can read the Wikipedia criteria and still argue to "keep"! He's not notable. Yet.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Well I want you all to know my friends and I have spoken with Israel and he actually begged them to remove the article. That being said I nominate its deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before I let this issue go let me address those concerns, (I assure you this is in no way a ploy for sympathy, the sheer fact that I have had this much difficulty confirming this young mans reputation is beyond me. He disserves better then this.)</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Israel is a prolific writer and his written many speeches for some esteemed clinics. He was invited to the event as a speaker because he comes from a broken home, and has a reputation a progressive young black. He’s 20 right now.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2. According to the record he is one of the one of most progressive throwers in his schools years… I don’t know…. Whatever, somebody told me to add it because the kid does this and he does a lot of other activates. Israel is a pretty good guy and I think it deserves mention… whatever..</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3Israel is not involved in politics he is a very powerful behinds the scene man in Brooklyn… I’ve asked him the specifics and he said he couldn’t tell me, but he’s everywhere and if you ask everyone knows him. They compare him to a young Karl Rove… I have a picture of him with Cindy Sheehan in Texas…if you’d like it let me know…</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I suppose your all right the kid is a young progress black and he will pop up in the future, the purpose was to get this out before his next campaign so maybe he might get some of the reputation he disserves… but you guys run Wikipedia and I’m just a web-designer… I guess we’ll just wait tell he’s not young anymore…. Since that’s what defines importance.--Adam15obong 02:03, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - age isn't the defining factor. As has been said umpteen times already, it's <i>notability</i> that is the key. There are plenty of kids <b>much</b> young than Mr Burns with (deserved) Wikipedia articles. One example is <a href="../../../i/l/o/Ilona_Mitrecey_9d2c.html" title="Ilona Mitrecey">this</a> 13 year old. And if Wikipedia had existed in the 1930s, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shirley_Temple_f4b9.html" title="Shirley Temple">this</a> kid would have got in at 5. And in 1978, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louise_Brown_142c.html" title="Louise Brown">this</a> girl would have got in at <b>1 day old</b>.<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 10:03, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
