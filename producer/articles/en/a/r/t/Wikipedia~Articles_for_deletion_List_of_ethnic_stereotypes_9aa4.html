<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a natural extension of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html" title="List of ethnic slurs">List of ethnic slurs</a>. It should certainly be cleaned up; we can differentiate between various ethnic subdivisions, have greater detail, and talk about some of the history and such. We can also make it less US-centric by saying exactly who tends to believe what sterotype (Or who is stereotypically assumed to have a certain sterotype). Remember, we're not saying any of this excrement is remotely true, we're just acknowledging the harsh reality of sterotypes. -<a href="../../../l/t/n/User%7ELtNOWIS_fcfd.html" title="User:LtNOWIS">LtNOWIS</a> 01:52, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I noticed you made an edit to this page in which you modified several of the stereotypes. I'm not interested in debating any of these changes, but what if I did want to dispute them? How can a user show that stereotype A should be included but stereotype B should not? That's the main problem with lists of unverifiable information. This page will quickly devolve (if it already hasn't) into insults being hurled at every ethnic group.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I have added another example of ethnic stereotypes which, while it a valid addition, does I think demostrate why this page should be deleted.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is most assuredly unencyclopedic as it does not even qualify as an article. The point of lists, it seems to me, is either to organize groups of articles or provide a number of short entires on subjects of a common theme that do not deserve their own articles. This list fails to do either and provides no context for its entires. Furthermore, it is hard, though not impossible, to keep this NPOV when it is just a list with no context for any of its assertions. Some of these stereotypes deserve mention somewhere in wikipedia, maybe even their own articles, but this does not seem to be the place for it. The people that claim certain users are trying to hide from unpleasant information need to learn the difference between a content arguement and a structural arguement. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 20:14, Jan 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Several of these are not sterotypes, but rather racial slurs and unexplained associations. Such as, 'Rag head(s)' under Arabs/Middle Eastern. 'Rag head(s)' isn't a sterotype, it's a racial slur. 'Wearing of turbans' is a sterotype. '"They hate us" assertions.' This is meaningless without some explanation, who hates who? Look at the Italian section. The <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guido.html" title="Guido">Guido</a> link is irrelevant in context. Should be geographically qualified. Even if these issues are cleaned up, difficult to remain NPOV at best. This will ultimately become a list of things not interesting or encyclopedic enough to warrant their own articles, and thus confusing and useless. Consider your reaction to the proposition of adding a <b>Racial Sterotypes</b> section to each ethnic or national wikipedia entry. --<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParaphelion_56c8.html" title="User:Paraphelion">Paraphelion</a> 01:55, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
