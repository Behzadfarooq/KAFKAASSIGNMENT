<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. Just counting votes, consensus is iffy here. The <b>deletes</b> put up a more cogent argument: this fails WP:WEB. Why is that important?

With no reliable sources, this article, if it is to be neutral, is at best an unexpandable stub.

<li><b>Comment as Nominator</b>: The reason that I nominated this, as well as the above reasons, was that I believe that this article is unfixable. Because of GraalOnline's staunch opposition (harrsasing phone calls to Wikimedia Corp, which Brad Patrick described to me as: <i><b>"That's how [this issue] was brought to my attention, that and the harassing phone calls from the crazy Frenchman."</b></i>) to anything added which doesn't have a positive connotation and serve as an advertisment, there will never be a NPOV on this page, unless GraalOnline corporation members are prevented from removing material. I would accept this resolution (GO staff being banned from removing material) as an alternate to deleting it, but if that isn't possible, delete it will be. <b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant"><font face="tahoma" color="#086F9A">Killfest2</font></a>—<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_Esperanza_c5f3.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant/Esperanza"><font face="tahoma" color="green">Daniel.Bryant</font></a></b> 07:12, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> We now see where all this is coming from "a crazy Frenchman" (strange from an Australian and some American guys), that's the real problem not the article.

Who are you to judge me and my corporation? Are you above of all wikipedia rules to be able to decide what article should be deleted or not and who should be able to edit the article or not? We have given URL of articles speaking about graalonline and lot of people think that the article should not be deleted pointing to wikipedia rules. Graal unixmad 17:25, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was referred to <b><a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">this page</a></b> by Danny as a likely reason for this page being deleted:</dd>
<dd><i>"If the rules are unhelpful, ignore them and do your best to improve or maintain Wikipedia's quality."</i>
<dl>
<dd>So if i understand, if the wikipedia rules don't allow you to delete an article about a game you have never played, then just break wikipedia written rules and destroy it for improving Wikipedia's quality. This remind me something... Perhaps a country declaring war to another for improving the world even if it's against all rules made by ONU. Graal unixmad 17:34, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm going to ignore that last statement as nothing more than a distracting red herring. While I do believe there are enough reviews of graal floating around on the web to base an article off of, your edits are obviously acting in bad faith. You claim that negative comments are deleted by your corporation because of being unreferenced (which is correct in general, although bad form in a long standing dispute without discussion) - HOWEVER, take this statement currently on the page. "Perhaps Graal's greatest strength is its customizability. An intuitive editor allows even the most technically-inept players to build levels of their own, complete with custom graphics and interactive NPCs. The latter are developed using a simple - yet surprisingly powerful - language named GScript, the syntax of which was loosely inspired by Java and which lately has adapted some semantics of the scripting language of the Torque Game Engine. The target audience of the game has not yet used these features to their fullest extent. [citation needed]". That entire paragraph, consisting of weasel words such as "greatest strength", "intuitive editor", and "simple-yet surprisingly powerful", was made without a single reference, independent or otherwise, to back it up. You're acting like an interest group lobbying for your article, obeying the rules only when it suits your position. That is blatantly abusing Wikipedia policy. JoshWook 18:29, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The GraalOnline team have not written the wikipedia Graalonline article (and the part you are talking about), the article has been written by someone called Loriel, this graalonline player is the creator of '<a href="http://wiki.graal.us/'" class="external free" title="http://wiki.graal.us/'" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.graal.us/'</a> that has no relationship with us. You should compare '<a href="http://wiki.graal.us/Graal'" class="external free" title="http://wiki.graal.us/Graal'" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.graal.us/Graal'</a> and you will see the actual article has not been written by GraalOnline Staff. Also have a look at other game article like <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> and tell me if you don't see weasel words, the article is full of make "RuneScape one of the top online games", "Unlike many similar game", "RuneScape places a lot of emphasis on ... allowing players ", ... Graal unixmad 18:43, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The Runescape page is heavily referenced, notice the footnote after "Runescape is one of the top online games." Also, I did not accuse GraalOnline of writing the paragraph in question - I only question why you are so intent on removing unreferenced negative information while ignoring the same standards on unreferenced positive information. JoshWook 18:53, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Did you watch what we have deleted? It's nothing about removing negative information about the game but defamatory and false content against Me, the GraalOnline Staff and the Game. Perhaps you have not followed the story but the section has been written a few weeks ago by 2 players because they have been banned from GraalOnline for not respecting rules ( <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarcaptain_c047.html" title="User:Warcaptain">User:Warcaptain</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/4/User%7EDi4gram_0c4f.html" title="User:Di4gram">User:Di4gram</a>. Have a look who have modified the article and made this war... Graal unixmad 19:06, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You're ignoring the crux of my argument - if the reason for deleting what you refer to as "defamatory and false content" was that it fell under <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, then why have you allowed the other unreferenced information to stand? User:JoshWook 19:23, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We were not the creator of this article (article created long time ago) so we prefered to discuss on the talk page (What have done Stefan Knorr and Me). We have deleted the defamatory and false content because it was new content and it was also not discussed with anyone before being added. Also we are not experienced Wikipedia User and we have learned the hard way. Graal unixmad 19:31, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To throw in my other 2 cents: Almost whenever I heard of Graal, I also heard about Unixmad's and the forum administration's unfairness towards the players. So if you like it or not, this issue also concerns users of your game. But then, as your actions were only announced in your private forum that is not immune to later modificiation or private conversations that are not at all quotable, there is probably no way to state this in a "verificable" way. Forum posts of banned persons were altered, and players critising the action of Graal's administration were silenced by threatening them with bans. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilipp_Kern_0be1.html" title="User:Philipp Kern">Philipp Kern</a> 20:43, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am the User:Loriel who unixmad attributed the aforequoted weasel-words to. However, they originated in <a href="http://wiki.graal.us/index.php?title=Graal&amp;diff=18&amp;oldid=17" class="external text" title="http://wiki.graal.us/index.php?title=Graal&amp;diff=18&amp;oldid=17" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> of the Graal article on our <a href="http://wiki.graal.us" class="external text" title="http://wiki.graal.us" rel="nofollow">Graal wiki</a>. While I hosted the wiki at that time, it was not entirely written by me and this edit was not my doing. Also, while I am not currently associated with Graal and was not when that edit was made, I used to be a game master/administrator and involved in or managing some of Graal's projects. While I suppose that the wording used was not entirely NPOV considering my past enjoyment of the customisability of Graal, it still does not appear particularly glamourising or advertising to me. Having a "greatest strength" does not imply any notable strongness compared to other things, and "surprisingly powerful" only served to relativate "simple" which I believe is entirely justified considering most of the game's content, outside of the actual engine, is written in this language.</dd>
<dd>However I would like to point out that I also made plenty of "negative" comments regarding Graal, the volunteer administration and so on, which were partially lost by vandalism (that went unnoticed by me until the recent edit-war when I did not dare to interfere anymore) and by the administrative intervention after the mediation. While pf course it was entirely unsourced (apart from a link to our wiki) as I was blissfully oblivious of Wikipedia policies at the time, but hey, nobody complained, and it appeared way more balanced and less "dramatic" than the current version.</dd>

<dd>"Anti-GraalOnline" is a very funny phrase to use, whether or not it preceeds the word "management". You seem to be dangerously close to following that game's management in that you are defining critics as "anti". I'll still let good faith guide me away from saying that you are speaking under their direction, but please don't suggest otherwise by using rather black-and-white terminology.
<dl>
<dd>Huh? I certainly wouldn't classify too many in there as pro-GraalOnline, would you? You prefer another phrase, throw it out there. Pro-GraalOnline-criticism seems a little unwieldy to me but that's fine too. As for www.suiffix.com, I can't even figure out how to use the site so how reliable can it be? —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 17:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I entirely agree with di4gram in the "anti-Graal" thing. If you are so eager to condemn contributors as anti-GraalOnline, I just have to consider you biased or heavily influenced by the GraalOnline management. Loriel 17:58, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, just trying to keep count of people who wanted the criticism section vs. those that didn't. It felt like the ratio was weighed heavily in favor of the former and, if you consider that two of the users in the latter group were blocked indefinitely, the ratio approaches infinity I think. Maybe I'm wrong and it was just the same pro-criticism-section (is that better?) users posting over and over but it seemed like it was becoming quite a hive mentality. Whichever, take a look at how many of my 12,000+ edits here have been related to online gaming at all and reconsider how affiliated I am with the GraalOnline management. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 18:17, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><strike><b>Keep</b> Considering Phil's comment above, I see that the article indeed describes a game and not the company behind the game, except where necessary to explain criticism, so the policy cited in the nomination is not applicable at all. Also, it seems pretty questionable to me to consider an online game/community "web content" as per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<li><strike>Changing my vote to <b>Delete</b> - the discussion has transcended the reasons given in the nomination that I originally considered and it seems only a clearly biased subset of possible sources (amateur game review sites) would be admitted as sources. I would prefer no article at all over a rather useless advertisement. I find the guidelines that are cited to support this wholly inadequate for an article of such limited scope, so I doubt that anything good is going to come of this. Sorry, guys.

<li><b>Keep</b> What do corporate notability guidelines have to do with this? This article is about a game, not a company. Same for web guidelines. Besides, my understanding is that it's not notability that's the problem here. We list many lesser-known video games. The problem is the inability of the editors to properly NPoV the article. As there's nothing about the topic that suggests it's inherrently PoV, this doesn't seem like a reason to delete, more a reason to refer to the neutrality project. We don't scrap things because we have difficulty writing good articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I've gone through and read a lot of the information on wikipedia about this particular dispute, and while I'm sympathetic to the "I give up" position, I think we all need to step back and breathe for a second. I've never played Graal before but I've heard about it before this mess - surely it's been notable enough to get a mention independently <i>somewhere</i> before. As far as the criticism, "positive", and "negative" information is concerned, I could care less as long as there are reliable sources listed. If not, tag and eventually delete, as per the mediation dispute. The corporate website is fine for information on game mechanics, publication date and history (as long as the information cited avoids advertisement and blatant self-praise), etc. - that stuff is NPOV and their website is nothing more than a convenient source. If it is later vandalized, temp. protect the page. Don't let wikipedia be bullied by a couple of minor online communities. In short, I'm sure this can all be worked out before the publication deadline. 129.61.46.16 16:20, 31 July 2006 (UTC)Josh</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't known if this is common on wikipedia that someone introducing a request for deletion try to influence the vote saying that everyone agree to delete the article. But the team managing the game and the creators of the game (Me and Stefan Knorr) are completly against having the article deleted. Could be also interesting to ask the &gt; 300000 players that have downloaded the game and open an account if the game is <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or not.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The preceeding comment by unixmad was originally placed in the header of the AFD with the nomination. I'm going to assume good faith in that they meant to add it to the bottom of the page as a new comment and were not trying to interfere with the nomination itself, so I moved it down appropriately as a new comment. I think they're right about the reviews though - they do at least attest to the notability of the game. Would it be possible to use those as a basis for a rewrite? 129.61.46.16 19:54, 31 July 2006 (UTC)Josh
<ul>
<li>Those reviews appear pretty onesided, so you might as well replace the article with an advertisement copy&amp;pasted from the game's website. Though I am laughing pretty hard at "modified version of C, know as Graal Script.". Loriel 21:40, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I did not mean to suggest that the reviews are balanced in coverage, only that they qualify as sources independent of graal online and therefore testify to the notability of the game. I guess the main issue I have with this AFD is that it was nominated for deletion because it was not notable enough, when the real problem is the content dispute. Unfortunately, content disputes generally do not fall under any deletion guideline that I'm aware of. Of course, they also usually don't result in Wikimedia's lawyers stepping in...so this may be a highly unusual case all around. 68.106.198.28 00:40, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Josh

<li><b>Comment</b> While I hate to pass the buck here, you have to understand that even if the entirety of the internet and print world has been purged of negative information on a subject, it is simply not Wikipedia's job to publish that negative information first. That's original research, and goes against one of wikipedia's foundation policies. You may have the right to get the word out about Graal, but basically, you don't have the right to do it here until it's done in a reliable, peer-reviewed source elsewhere. 68.106.198.28 11:43, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Josh

<li><b>Comment</b> No, Wikipedia does not condone advertisements - many articles about non-notable games or websites, usually written by the owners of the product, are deleted on a regular basis. The websites listed above, however, confirm in my mind that Graal is not something invented last week. It has a fairly long history for an online game, and is notable enough for an article. Most of those reviews do not appear to be affiliated with the site, and even if they don't mention the personality conflicts that seem to be the issue here, their impressions of the game aren't overwhelmingly positive either. I guess the thing is, that while a game or website may be notable enough for a wikipedia article, not all of its components (in this case, its forums and spin-off forums, I guess) are necessarily worthy of the same treatment.

<li><b>Comment</b> Honestly this is getting old. This wikipedia war is not going to end. I can see perfectly why it's nominated for deletion as it is one-sided and more advertisement friendly. Everything put in it is simply on Graal Online's side and as much as I love the game, this wiki is not part of Graal Online and is control by the community. I don't see why both sides can't come to a conclusion and by allowing the article to go back up just means the war will start again. Deletion seems to be the easiest method, this whole situation has gotten so complicated and has become such a big issue that it disserves itself to be on the wiki as it's an issue. It just seems like a bunch of accounts are being made to say "Keep" now as if it truly matters... just let it go and forget it for a while and if it is deleted just wait a while to make a new one. Even when you make a new one, people are going to alter it because that's how wiki works. Once someone alters it then more arguments will happen on Graal Onlines side. It's more likely in the future that there will be citable information for critism for the game... even those reviews of the game are not very good but in no way reveal any critizism. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandon_Mitchell_4970.html" title="User:Brandon Mitchell">Brandon Mitchell</a> 5:23, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are right, which is why I did not attempt to directly post it on the article, but rather put it in for consideration here. The standards for verified information in relation to the nature of this article makes the whole situation difficult to be fair either way. All of the information is going to come from some person or another from the internet, you are not going to get verified pictures of over 300,000 people, or even 30 people to stand and pose in a picture with todays newspaper and a sign saying "I PLAYED GRAALONLINE, or that GRAAL IS COMPATIBLE WITH EVERYTHING AND IN C++" and even if they did exist I do not think they would organize in such a fashion, make the cardboard signs and do such a thing. This whole situation is not an easy one, no matter who you are, if you are to make the GraalOnline wikipedia article more relevant, factual, and verified, it is simply not the nature of non-mainstream lesser popular online games. <a href="../../../v/i/p/User%7EVipercat_c28e.html" title="User:Vipercat">Vipercat</a> 13:27, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Unix, for a second I was sort of miffed, because I thought someone high up in wikimedia had contacted you and decided to over-rule the discussion taking place here. The fact is that a number of people who frankly find your behavior deplorable in these debates have voted "keep", including myself. The most likely result right now, especially since you posted a number of reviews, is a "no consensus" result, which will result in the article staying. The nomination to delete was not brought up by wikimedia, so stop with these conspiracy theories. There's no reason to cry foul - it's childish and distracts from the points of the debate itself. On another note, I do not believe wikipedia should cover your dispute with your members until a reliable source can be found to document it - but on a personal level, I very much hope that a well known gaming website does a story on how you treat your customers.

<li>Hold up - you're missing the point. From everything I've read, I'm fully on your side on a personal level...however, I honestly don't think Wikipedia is the right media to vent your complaints. Wikipedia is, above all, an encyclopedia. I would not expect the Encyclopedia Brittanica to cover a non-notable dispute, using only forums and personal emails as evidence - Wikipedia is not constrained by the limits of paper, but it still strives for the same quality standards. An encyclopedia is, in general, a compendium of the research of others - and by research, I mean of the intensive, peer-reviewed kind. That happens in a newspaper and even more in sources like scientific journals, and there are simply no controls or authority behind an individual, or even a group of individuals, posting semi-anonomyously to an online forum. It amounts to original research, and is not appropriate subject matter for an encyclopedia.

<li>This is where the problem lies. Nobody has written a documentary or scholarly artice, or published book in print that has been extensively peer reviewed on this matter. You are also correct this is an encyclopedia, but if it is not a relevant subject such as Elephants then how can it fit into an encyclopedia in the first place? How can any game? <a href="../../../v/i/p/User%7EVipercat_c28e.html" title="User:Vipercat">Vipercat</a> 13:12, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Easy - there are lots of print magazines dedicated to games, and even more online. The business as a whole is undeniably massive, on the same order of magnitude as film, and receives a good deal of media coverage. It doesn't have to necessarily be scholarly, it only has to meet wikipedia's internal standards for verifiability and reliability. And verifiable is not the same as truth - just because something is true doesn't mean it warrants coverage on wikipedia. Actually, see the big discussion I had up above in this AFD that now looks like I had it with myself under 129.61.46.16 and 68.106.198.28 because the other guy deleted his comments when he changed his opinion&#160;;) JoshWook 13:45, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well...don't take this the wrong way, but that's just how Wikipedia works. Wikipedia is not a forum - it's an encyclopedia. Go to your local decent-sized library and check out the reference section. Ignore the Brittanica and find a more obscure, specialized encyclopedia, such as an encyclopedia on Occult phenomena (yes, they do exist). And then look at how the articles are written and, more importantly, the references. You'll find that the encyclopedia, no matter how obscure, has not gone out and conducted its own study and interviewed people about their experiences with alien abductions - it relies on the published "research" of others. There might be other wikis out there with different standards, but as an encyclopedia, wikipedia is not the place to *conduct* research, it's a place to *report* on it.

<li><b>Comment</b> How come when others make remarks such as what you just made, Daniel.Bryant, they are told to not post things like that here? (Nice threat, btw =/ ) --<a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoon_Goddess_aa74.html" title="User:Moon Goddess">Moon Goddess</a> 17:39, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The only one that tells them not to post criticisms thus far has been Unixmad. And defacing and deleting articles and criticisms, especially in the talk page is considered defacement, defacement is not allowed, it is not a threat, just a simple fact of life, one which some people can't seem to deal with... <a href="../../../v/i/p/User%7EVipercat_c28e.html" title="User:Vipercat">Vipercat</a> 18:14, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For the record, neither I nor anyone else ever threatened to remove anything - I simply asked if he would move this particular branch of the discussion off of the AFD for the article, since whether he was banned from Graal or not has nothing to do with whether or not Wikipedia should include an article of GraalOnline. I still hold to that position, and ask that Daniel and others please continue this discussion elsewhere. JoshWook 18:44, 4 August 2006 (UTC)
