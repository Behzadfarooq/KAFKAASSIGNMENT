Beside that it's just a stub without any useful information and what I dislike most is that the original author himself added the stub template to the article.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Weak argument given for deletion. Yeah, I suck at creating articles. I acknowledge this. Calling the article unreferenced isn't true, because, if one were to look one would see 2 references to it. Alleged "notability" has never been an official criteria for inclusion or deletion.

<dd>COMMENT: Thanks ScottW! However, much of what I wrote has now been deleted. Even so, I feel the article needs to stay. Inclusion in the OED is significant but this is not the time or place to go into why that is. I merely suggest you google the term to see how common it is. You will find it is regularly used in feminist and/or lesbian literature. When I was a Linguistics Grad student in the early 1980s, I witnessed much of the debate over such terms. <i>Herstory</i> was well-accepted in Academia even then because of it's narrow application. It wasn't a word that was being promoted to displace <i>history</i> but rather one to be used alongside it when appropriate or in place of it when referring specifically to women's history from a female perspective. I believe it has more credability than <i>Wymyn</i>, <i>Wimmin</i> or <i>Wombyn</i> - 3 words often used in place of <i>woman</i>. Thank you SO much for your time in rereading the article. I believe the word has found its niche in terms of usage but I agree with others who state that it will never be a widely known term outside it's current usage applications.<a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7ELisapollison_fe0d.html" title="User:Lisapollison">Lisapollison</a> 18:48, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(I have zero interest in the field where it is used, but I've known this term for longer than some of our admins have been alive.)

<p><b>Delete</b>-This article seems rather ridiculous. South America is neither a unified country nor culture, and neither would be expect the same of the immigrant communities in them. South America is a huge landmass, and the history of Chinese immigrants differs drastically among different countries such as Brazil and Peru, and some have no more than an insignificant immigrant population. I wouldn't object to articles on Chinese cuisine in the various individual countries (if they exist), but unless someone does some informed article expansion, it's doomed to always be a one-sentence original research stub. --<a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">Yuje</a> 01:35, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - seems to be sort of a random subject. And I've been to South America... Chinese food in Peru is different then in Chile (for example). "South America" is an imaginary social construct. However... the subject of "Latin-Chinese cuisine" might be viable.... But then again, Peru likes there food with heavier spices then people of Chile. The food ends up drasticly different. So how can you lump them together?

<p>This entry is not nonsense at all. Were it nonsense, the neologism 'Wiki' would not exist, and Wikipedia would never have come to light. Wikipedians itself as a word is a neologism. Why should Wikipedia not support kindred useful neologisms?</p>
<p>To merge Gotchi with Hackergotchi would be akin to merging Wikipedia with Wiki. And Wikipedia then would lose its right of autonomy. Hackergotchis are one category of 'Gotchi.' The entry 'Gotchi' makes the case that this unique and entertaining icon style is spreading to the net, hacker and wider art and culture community. The Wikipedia entry 'Hackergotchi,' is mentioned in the entry for 'Gotchi,' as it should be. A link from Hackergotchi to Gotchi if possible would be useful.</p>
<p>The date of entry of the neologism Hackergotchi is irrelevant. Both Gotchi and Hackergotchi stem from Tamagotchi. Tamagotchi itself stems from the Japanese word for 'egg' but it is the first two syllables - and not the 'gotchi' - in Tamagotchi that refers to the Japanese word for 'egg.' As such, Gotchi is extracted from the link which Hackergotchi has initiated with Tamagotchi and it does so in a clever way. It becomes a root for both neologisms Hackegotchi and Tamagotchi, which both grace wiki nodes in Wikipedia. Why not Gotchi?</p>
<p>As the entry Gotchi clearly attributes, the term also stems from the most valuable source on the Internet, the Open Source community of Linux hackers, thinkers and developers. Some are attributed, i.e. Planet Gnome. Others may be freely added in Wikipedia style.</p>

<p>Dear Golbez - This is a page for discussion not flaming. As author of the Gotchi page, my interest is in communication, perhaps our last diplomat on planet Earth. Wiki itself was innovated to aid such platforms of communication that are based on respect and consensus. I respect any respectful criticism of my entry Gotchi. Through criticism, consensus is built and knowledge deepened. Please, Golbez, keep your power urges to yourself. If Wikipedia wizards condone such abuses of its members' hierarchy, allow individuals such as Golbez to abuse his powers, it will only lead to diminishing the Wikipedia community's initial intention, and perhaps doom Wikipedia to become a disrespectful and therefore disrespected, source of knowledge. I suggest that Golbez give a good reason now why his bad language, his flaming utterance above, should lead to anything other than his speedy retreat from any decision-making Wikipedia wizard role. What does Golbez mean by attitude anyway? His bad language is a blemish on the reputation of Wikipedia and for this Internet pioneer indicates Golbez ought to explain reasonably why his breech of online etiquette toward an equal, is not an abuse or power that could scorn the Wikipedia community. Abuse of power has no place in Wikipediadom! Why shoud Golbez be acceptedd for his off-the-cuff slanderous remarks while I waste time reasoning? If this outburts does not lead to his resigning his role from his own initiative, I will be disappointed that he does not see that he has done all here a disservice, including language itself. Respect is earned not through bullying bad language. It is a sign of a desire to wield power which is in fact a priveledge based on one's acumen, study and knowledge.</p>
<p>Ace of Sevens - You will find gotchis at Flickr - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=Gotchi" class="external free" title="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=Gotchi" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=Gotchi</a> - for instance - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jp-o/26973829/" class="external free" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jp-o/26973829/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/jp-o/26973829/</a> specifically (a good example too.) Or check this major lycos site using and visualizing the English word 'Gotchi' - <a href="http://www.lycos.de/startseite/news/bundestagswahl/wahlogotchi/ergebnis.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lycos.de/startseite/news/bundestagswahl/wahlogotchi/ergebnis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lycos.de/startseite/news/bundestagswahl/wahlogotchi/ergebnis.html</a> . There are oodles of Gotchi entries for the patient searcher. And there are many misunderstandings of the term to be found. Most think that the root of Tamagotchi has issued the wor Gotchi, when in fact, Tama stems from Tama (related to the Japanese word for 'egg.')</p>
<p>SpacePlace is one major cultural instance where the term Gotchi is used. It is a site made by Internet pioneers, who have been involved with Net culture since the early 1990s. The term has been published in information concerning the SpacePlace project by the world-reknowned museum ZKM Center for Art and Media Technology. Gotchis adorn currently a link banner on its homepage - www.zkm.de - and the SpacePlace Press Release. Google has I believe already indexed these pages. The term Gotchi does not occur as a title word, but in the body of various texts. the word 'gotchi' also occurs since April 2005 on the entry for Hackergotchi - "The "-gotchi" part seems to be a reference to the term Tamagotchi." where it is misleading as Tamagotchi I mentioned above stems from Tama (related to the word 'egg' in Japanese, and not 'gotchi.) Therefore the term 'gotchi' has been around in Wikipedia space for some time, and has not, until now, been defined as a term. This is done now by the entry 'Gotchi'.</p>

<p>A few short sentences of speculation about a TV Movie of the Week that may air in October, crystal-ballism. Erik the Rude 01:52, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Seems basically verifiable, found some news about it via Google News. Official page, IMDB page... no reason to doubt the article. "Crystal ball" just refers to reporting rumors and outright conjecture as fact, or having an article with nothing but speculation. This movie seems to be have announced and is in production and will air in 10/06... no reason to delete the article. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 01:57, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- it's a remake of the 1978 TV movie, as mentioned on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795403/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795403/" rel="nofollow">IMDB</a> and not in this stub of an article. Seems pretty non-notable. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckRose_0826.html" title="User:BuckRose">BuckRose</a> 02:06, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It needs to be expanded, but there is no reason to delete it. Just because it's a TV movie doesn't mean it should be deleted. There are plenty of articles about TV movies, just look at all the articles at List of Television Movies. Yes it needs to be expanded, but it should be kept. MasterGreenLantern 02:25, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, looks entirely legit, and has a decently notable cast, too. Crystal ballism is for unverifiable stuff, not this. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 11:21, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Even if the 2006 movie by this name ends up not being released (unlikely, as I'm sure it's fairly far along production-wise) there's a late 70s film by the same name which could go under this title. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 13:52, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>. This article is very well written, and in my opinion, is a good contribution to Wikipedia. This page should be merged with cropier. I don't see a difference between the two pages except the poker specification. I think in the cropier page there should be sections that describe the role and responsibilities of dealers in different casino games. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/c/User%7ECocopuffberman_ef2d.html" title="User:Cocopuffberman">Cocopuffberman</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/c/User_talk%7ECocopuffberman_1831.html" title="User talk:Cocopuffberman">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cocopuffberman_6598.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cocopuffberman">contribs</a>) May 23, 2006.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't object to croupier being expanded, but the word croupier is never used for poker dealers, and little of the information in this article is extensible to other dealing positions in a casino.

<li><b>Keep</b> The comment above is insubtantial, unless there is some proof to be offered. In the end, what does it matter how users get here. The fact is, they are here. Buck Star has become somewhat of a facet of the LCS phenomenon and has transcended the role of a typical contestant. This is evinced by the amount of air time he has received as compared to other contestants (even those who made the cut) on the first episodes (both seasons 2 and 4). This is noteworthy in itself. Beyond this, there is a story to tell, and America (or at least those Americans willing to post on the nbc forums) is eager to hear the final punch-line. The main issue, in my mind, is that the content of the entry is sparse and needs to be updated and completed. This can be remedied. unklcid 22:38, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I must concur that the very fact that many users have an opinion on this at all is substantial support of Buck Star's relevance. Also, to those who say that Buck Star being an aspiring comedian who will probably keep performing and auditioning is Crystal Ballism, on the same token saying that he is only a fifteen-minute of fame flash-in-the-pan obscure reference is also crystal-ballism. We can't say that he will ever experience fame and success in a major way, but we also cannot say that his fifteen minutes are up and that he will never succeed beyond this point. The fact that he keeps returning to the show Last Comic Standing, and the fact that they continue to give him a surprising amount of airtime, I think is evidence to support that he will stay consistent in his efforts, and that he is reaching an audience. In fact, this very debate to keep or delete the page is evidence that Buck Star has reached an audience. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Doppleganger09 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Doppleganger09_3037.html" title="Special:Contributions/Doppleganger09">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't quite know how to use everything just yet but I am figuring it. Maury Nunes is my Uncle, he did not create this page himself. I didn't know what the original deletion tag was and deleted it, sorry. The picture I forgot to mark that I used it from his website, but can't figure out how to mark it as so. He has some notable clients, such as Bob Ross the painter, now Bob Ross' company, but I know he has other notable clients but I wanted to wait to list any before I made sure of it. It would be really helpful if anyone could let me know what else I should include or anything I should take out. <a href="../../../j/p/r/User%7EJpr20_e0c1.html" title="User:Jpr20">jpr20</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Highway planning and construction in Canada tends to provoke a lot of debate, particularly when it involves a lot of damage to nature or demolishing homes. Occupation of the affected land by protestors is also commonplace. And there is also likely to be debate over whether the highway should be publicly owned.

<li><s>I am not sure what you mean by this. Law of return does not differentiate citizens of Israel based on race. It does differentiate people who are <i>not</i> citizens of Israel, but most of the Western countries do that - a Russian who can show German ancestry, is allowed to "return" to Germany at a stroke of a pen. In Norway, I know of at least one Russian family who were allowed to "return" to Norway because they had a Norwegian grand mother.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Instead of an apartheid dab it may be more worthwhile to create an Apartheid (metaphor) page that talks about how the term is used as a metaphor -- that the SA system was iconic and thus the term entered into the lexicon on its own, which seems to be the case. This Apartheid (metaphor) article can, besides noting its use as a metaphor, point to a few of the areas in which it is widely used and thus link to those articles if they exist. The main <a href="../../../a/p/a/Aparthied.html" title="Aparthied">Aparthied</a> article should still link directly to the SA Apartheid article but at the top should be a <b>see</b> macro to the Aparthied metaphor page.

I like MCB's suggestion that perhaps a general article on apartheid would be appropriate. Anyone can create that article next week if they want; I don't think we have to do it for them. The articles that this page currently points to probably should not be on Wikipedia. Only one country in history has ever considered it inoffensive to be labelled as apartheid. Any article whose title is "____ apartheid" is pretty much by definition a POV page that should be merged with a broader article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Apartheid was a specific system in place during a specific time period (1948-1990). Any other uses of the word, such as Gender Apartheid or Economic Apartheid are perjorative metaphors and are thus not equal to the word's primary meaning.

<li>Which is an excellent reason why the disambig article is necessary 1) to allow references to "modern" uses of the term apartheid to go somewhere other than the main apartheid article 2) thus allowing the article to actually be called <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> rather than the cumbersome <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era_ac13.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">History of South Africa in the apartheid era</a>Homey 21:32, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>That doesn't make any sense. Your reason number 2 cannot be justified based on what Zaian says, because he is asking, nay <i>pleading</i>, for the exact opposite. (For other people not following all this, Zaian says that whatever else happens, <i>please</i> don't rename the current History fo South Africa in the apartheid era to Apartheid; Homey says that if we have this disambiguation page, we can rename History etc. etc. to just Apartheid. So those are two opposite ideas.) On your reason number 1, these "other apartheid" articles were all created by you (except for apartheid wall, I believe), so claiming that the disambiguation page you created is necessary so there can be a distinction drawn among the other articles you created is a little like the teenager who murders his parents and asks the judge for mercy because he is an orphan.

This probably says more about the speaker than anything, but Wikipedia policies do not judge the validity of opinions. If there is a significant number of people who use "apartheid" to mean something beyond the historical South African apartheid, then that needs to be reflected on the wiki even if you think they are being tendentious. The current situation in which <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> redirects to the South Africa page on the original term, which links to the dab, seems moderately intuitive and I don't find the argument of the nominator convincing. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">BT</a> 04:08, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

The word is innately referential to South African apartheid, and is not in itself a generic term for apartheid-like occurrences, save when it is used metaphorically. This is not about judging opinions (<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">BanyanTree</a>), but about keeping opinionation out of the disambiguation pages, as well as remembering that they are there for the reader, not for the editor. People should see an article on South African apartheid when they enter apartheid into the search field. DABs can and should be objective and useful, and there is nothing immediately useful (and debatably something POV) about listing every segregatory social system that happens to have been classified as apartheid by its original author. There are systems that have not been classified as such (such as that upon which apartheid was supposedly based in part, the American system or systems), and this makes the article ineffectual at disambiguation, even if disambiguation were necessary in the first place. If someone wants to research "apartheid" in Israel, they can do a <i>search</i> for apartheid on wiki, and perhaps a section of <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> can note that the term is sometimes used to describe social systems outside of the South African issue.

<li><b>Comment</b> "Holocaust" does not in itself refer to the death of Jews in WWII, but "great destruction resulting in the extensive loss of life, especially by fire" (first definition listed from most sources). That it has become almost synonymous in recent times with that event has nothing to do with the word itself, which predates the twentieth century. This is a major distinction. "Holocaust" has ancient Greek etymology, while "apartheid" is from Dutch, indicating its specific South African origins. Note that the first definition of "apartheid" listed uniformly refers to the South African event. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 04:56, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The meaning of words changes, I don't see how you can say that somehow Greek words <i>can</i> have general use, but Afrikaans words <i>can't</i>. A better comparison than <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">holocaust</a> would be <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghetto.html" title="Ghetto">ghetto</a> (no I'm not picking another Jewish comparison on purpose), where a specific reference has become general. Just as the OED states in the definition of apartheid "Name given in South Africa to the segregation of the inhabitants of European descent from the non-European...applied also to any similar movement elsewhere; also, to other forms of racial separation (social, educational, etc.). Also fig. and attrib" so at least <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid_%28phrase%29.html" title="Israeli apartheid (phrase)">Israeli apartheid (phrase)</a> would be a valid literal use of the word while the others (except maybe global apartheid) would be figurative. --Coroebus 08:38, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Coroebus, though words <i>can</i> change meaning, the word "Apartheid" as yet did not. You have to read a little between the lines - what OED states is "applied also to any similar [ie, to the original Apartheid] movement elsewhere". This merely states that the word has been used metaphorically.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am intensely uncomfortable about reading between the lines to establish that something is metaphorical. At what point are we just engaging in our own speculation? Re: ghetto I don't understand what you're saying (the definition is "1. The quarter in a city, chiefly in Italy, to which the Jews were restricted" - the first ghetto was in Venice (hence the OED: "[Of uncertain etym., perh. f. It. getto foundry, as the first ghetto founded in Venice in 1516 was on the site of a foundry.]") but the word came to be generalised to any Jewish enclave, and then to a densely populated slum area (this latter use is designated figurative). So by your reasoning the <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghetto.html" title="Ghetto">ghetto</a> article must be stripped of any reference to non-Jewish ghettos as these are simply metaphorical uses? --Coroebus 13:51, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Note also that Merriam-Webster has <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/apartheid" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/apartheid" rel="nofollow">apartheid</a> as "2&#160;: SEPARATION, SEGREGATION <i>&lt;sexual apartheid&gt;" so I think the shift in meaning really has already taken place, despite your protestations to the contrary. --Coroebus 13:59, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</i></li>

I think you are trying to have your cake and eat it here. You reject the use of apartheid for anything other than the SA Apartheid, because anything else is metaphorical in your eyes, and thus invalid, even when there is pretty good evidence that the word has come to mean something like 'separation' or 'discrimination' (interestingly the OED details it as going back as far as 1955). But for another word, ghetto, you reject the literal meaning and insist that the figurative (that means the same thing as metaphorical by the way) usage is the correct and 'most used' one. What I have tried to show, and I think you have rather nicely demonstrated, is that some objections to the use of 'apartheid' here are not driven by linguistic concerns, but rather something else, perhaps political --Coroebus 14:53, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Perhaps I should be more clear. I reject that the word Apartheid is used for anything else then SA regime, other then for political purposes (very much like for example fascism). "Ghetto" is generally used about racially segregated neighbourhoods. A ghetto is easier to define (bunch of "ethnical" people living together -&gt; ghetto), and its use is not limited to those with some particular political agenda. -- <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHeptor_46d0.html" title="User:Heptor"><font color="#000040"><b>H</b></font><font color="#400000">eptor</font></a> <a href="../../../h/e/p/User_talk%7EHeptor_c1c0.html" title="User talk:Heptor"><sub><small><font color="#400000">talk</font></small></sub></a> 15:15, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think I may have been misleading when I brought etymology into the discussion, though the fact that "holocaust" was simply an already common word used <i>to describe</i> "the Holocaust" that happened to "stick" in popular language is not entirely negligible. What's really important is that every single one of these articles can be distinguished from existing, generally better and more NPOV articles only by the presence of the word "apartheid", which in itself indicates flagrant POV. I don't agree or disagree with this POV, <i>but it is pov</i>. If I made an article called "Iraqi holocaust", I would be framing all information on that page in the POV of something that is not historically established as holocaust, and I would damn well hope someone would delete it. Sexual apartheid is <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_discrimination.html" title="Sex discrimination">sex discrimination</a>, save that the name of the article itself throws NPOV to the wind by using a metaphorical reference to a historically-recognized despicable act to color the inferrences that will be drawn from the article. It's the Wiki equivalent of flashing pictures of Stalin in a smear ad. This has nothing to do with feelings about apartheid, sexual discrimination, the Israel/Palestine conflict or what kind of cheese the moon is made of. It's about impartiality, which these articles go out of their way to dismiss. I really can't believe this has sparked so much debate, as these things seem very plain to me. Coroebus, I am additionally saddened that you continue to frame opposition to this article as politically motivated when there have been many clear cases for its removal on an NPOV basis alone, whether or not you agree with the argument. I take this moment to assure you that this is not an pro-Semitic conspiracy, a misogynist conspiracy, or an (insert favorite conspiracy) conspiracy.

Denying a biased (or superfluous <i>and</i> biased article, in this case) title (e.g. Gender Holocaust to describe a mass-murder of women, a despicable event but not "gender holocaust") is not acceptable. Believing we should be rid of such articles has nothing to do with POV and everything to do with the integrity of WP. If someone provides ample proof that all of these terms <i>have been used in prominent, peer-reviewed discussion</i>, then I say a redirect is warranted. Only if someone can provide proof that all these terms have been used <i>and</i> are distinct from their counterparts (e.g. "sexual apartheid" v. "sexual discrimination"), then they deserve their own articles. Only then. Removing POV is not "POV in itself" unless you propose it because the ideas in the POV offend you, which we have established we are not (or I hope this has been established, anyway).

<dd>I'll probably betray my background in objecting to political science being referred to as a science, I don't think subjects like politics should rely on academic discourse to the same extent as (proper) scientific articles - in particular the academic and practical worlds of politics overlap and inter-relate, I think it would be very unwise to declare all non-academic political discourse out of bounds as a source, and also politics (as with other semi-sciences and humanities) as an academic discipline does not rely on the academic paper to the same extent as science - certainly almost the entirety of our political output on wikipedia would go up in flames.

<dl>
<dd>Political science is intangible, in that it's not about making polymers and identifying starlings by their coloration or somesuch, but whatever your own definition of science there are guidelines on WP about what is and is not acceptable. These titles are analysis, that is, "original research" by the WP definition. Even pop poli-sci publications are peer reviewed, so this is not as major a limitation as you make it out to be. In fact, it's a very reasonable one. If google scholar brings these terms up in real journals, let's pop the results in as sources (after a glance to make sure it's relevant) and give these redirects, as I said. If there is some distinction in their use, let the author cite them. If proper citations were used, this entire debate would be null. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 16:25, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

But by your insistence on academic study of a concept, movement or whatever, Wikipedia would very rapidly have to stop, lacking many contributors with access to academic journals, and limited entirely to that which political scientists have deigned to write about, things like the Lib Dem <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Orange_Book_-_Reclaiming_Liberalism_faad.html" title="The Orange Book - Reclaiming Liberalism">orange book</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Labour_d0a0.html" title="New Labour">New_Labour</a> or the <a href="../../../e/u/s/Euston_manifesto.html" title="Euston manifesto">Euston_manifesto</a> covered many years after the event, and limited to a handful of sources if any.

<dd>If one has access to neither academic or semi-academic (being that most such citable debate is carried on by those who are professionals in the matter) resources or even <i>texts</i>, I do not understand it to be wise to make substantive edits on any potentially POV subject. I and many others have made the mistake of doing so in one way or another without providing citations, and the material has been (rightly) reverted, when the article gets the attention of experienced editors. I think this is no exception. If the concept of Israeli apartheid "exists" (by WP standards), it will have been discussed professionally. This is my interpretation, and I think it is a common one. Sourcing potentially POV statements is not a hindrance to good editing--it is part of the definition of good editing. <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_anti-semitism.html" title="Arab anti-semitism">Arab anti-semitism</a> are concepts that have been noted by major sources (probably a million times over, by now), and as such they definitely "exist" by encyclopedic standards. It is more important that WP have these standards than that every indefinite, casual or novel concept is legitimized by its place here.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The word "apartheid" is often used in a metaphorical sense to denote any kind of segregation or separation (normally in a negative sense). In the same way words like terror, fascism, tyranny, nazism, and so on (including derivatives) are often used metaphorically. An encyclopaedia doesn't have separate articles for all different kinds of separation. Particular forms of separation should be discussed in the articles that deal with the corresponding subject (where that particular form of separation occurs). This ought to be obvious.--<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenis_Diderot_ecdb.html" title="User:Denis Diderot">Denis Diderot</a> 12:26, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I was thinking I'd lean toward keeping this one based on the USO tour, but after a little searching, I'm not sure about that now. Take a look at <a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:epzOahLZkvYJ:www.detnews.com/2004/metro/0405/20/d08e-158345.htm+%22angela+lanza%22+uso&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=8" class="external text" title="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:epzOahLZkvYJ:www.detnews.com/2004/metro/0405/20/d08e-158345.htm+%22angela+lanza%22+uso&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=8" rel="nofollow">this article (Google cached) about her participation</a> in the USO tour. After reading the circumstances of the tour, do you feel that she's notable enough? And further, can there be a good article here? I know that participating in the USO is technically touring internationally, but is this really the same as being individually booked (and in most cases, paid) to play in another country? I'd be interested in hearing the reasoning one way or the other. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 00:49, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It'd work for me. Moreso, in fact, that it's the USO and not some random club tour. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 01:15, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, the USO part is why I was originally inclined to say keep. That's certainly a notable enough organization. The way she was sent though was almost club-like though. And I guess what troubles me the most about this one is that there's little coverage of her beyond 'local girl makes good' type articles. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 01:25, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But, also consider, that in this case we have more verification that she was actually independently selected for the tour, than in other cases. Sometimes, we have articles on singers/bands that "tour" nationally, but the "tour" is really them renting various small venues at their own expense, and getting write-ups in music sites, that basically cover every gig around. In this case she was selected by an organization independent of herself. While she just got her expenses covered, those expenses are probably more than what many performers get paid for smaller venues. Often, booking a singer/band as the non-headline member of a tour is no big deal, because if it doesn't work out, you cant punt them pretty easy. Going to Iraq, probably takes more thought and committment, though. But, I'm going to make the obvious concession, that I'm not seeing this becoming Featured Article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 01:39, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>From the articles on her tour, it seems as if she was chosen for the tour based upon a minor beauty pagent. I agree, though, that this isn't some group who paid their way to Canda one weekend to perform at an open-mic night. She definitely participated in a substantial tour, but is it a tour she took because she was in demand, or one she took because she won it from being a runner up in a Hooters contest? If it's the former (or even if it's just somehow shown not to be the latter), then I'd feel much better keeping this one. For tonight, I think I'll refrain from commiting one way or the other. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 02:16, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. All news articles appear to be about the same event (and so count as one). I don't agree with her passing <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Does being part of a large tour qualify as going on one? Does every <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riverdance.html" title="Riverdance">Riverdance</a> dancer qualify under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>? <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 02:12, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> refers to a "<i>single day's news event only</i>", and this is much more than one days event. Also, Riverdance involves a large number of people on a stage at once, doing similiar things. Hence, they warrant an article, but only a combined article for the whole production. Lanza was a solo act. The only other musical act mentioned (or in the photos) is UC3. So, for a made-up analogy, if a solo act toured with Riverdance to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Qatar and Iraq; then they would likely warrant an article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 05:35, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm referring to the news stories which all seem centred around May 19-20, 2004, about the USO tour. The rest seem to be either about trivial events or from local media.

<li><b>Comment</b> Oh and, by the way, the drugs scandal case was a very very important case in nz. it capitivated the media in nz for about a week, and the primary focus was on the information leak on the internet THROUGH GPFORUMS which identified the celebrities involved. And it is in the process of being written, you may or may not notice, but it is nigh on 24 hours old, and hasnt been completed yet. --<a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubwaynz_26cd.html" title="User:Subwaynz">Subwaynz</a> 11:27, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> To those who disagree with this nomination, I apologise if you feel my deletion proposal was hasty and that this subject is notable. I'm not very knowledgable about online gaming communities nor am I from New Zealand, but I assumed that if this article was about a notable subject it would have been in just a little better shape than it was. Here is the diff just before I nominated it for deletion: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gameplanet&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=56083828" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gameplanet&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=56083828" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. Take a look at it and hopefully you'll understand my motivation for deleting it. Oh and by the way, I was contemplating nominating it for a speedy deletion but thought that it might have some redeeming value so instead nominated it for a standard deletion so that attention might be brought to its problems and those who opposed deletion could voice their opinions.--<font color="green"><b>Conrad Devonshire</b></font> <sup><b><font color="purple">Talk</font></b></sup> 16:58, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Knowing nothing of the Something Awful entries, I took a look to see how they compare with regards to the "personalites" sections. Personally I see the Something Awful entry itself as more of an entry about a type of publication (as it appears to have articles rather than freeform chat which would be the Something Awful Forum). If you take Something Awful itself and compare it to, say, The Times or Washington Post (taking two other publications at random), you'll note that the two paper entries have a notable contributors section. The Something Awful Forum entry doesn't. (I'm from NZ btw) <a href="../../../r/2/b/User%7ER2b2_b388.html" title="User:R2b2">r2b2</a> 06:46, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> My god this is frustrating, everyone seems to think just because they dont know of something that they feel it is not relevant, while this is a broad comment, it is what the users of wikipedia feel. the whole idea of an encyclopadia is to provide a medium to collate information from the world around us. why do i go to wikipedia? to learn about something i have no idea about/havent heard of. If i was a prospective forum member and i wanted to learn about gpforums, and i went to wikipedia, i then learnt all about gpforums, and i saw the notable members aspect, and when i DID join gpforums i would know why people post replies of why they hate wushu, or brock. It is not about why a United States wikipedia user doesnt know about someone or a topic (from nz). I just think that people should stick their noses where its actually wanted. The notable members part complied with wiki policies, sgt molloy was featured in the mainstream media. So, however much you think your the expert on everything world wide, your not. The notable members are an integral part of gpforums and is what makes gpforums what it is today. If you dont like it, or havent heard of it, but it complies with wiki policies, then dont be a knob and delete it, wikipedia is diverse, so is the world. Thats what an encyclopedia is designed to do.--<a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubwaynz_26cd.html" title="User:Subwaynz">Subwaynz</a> 06:00, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This doesn't really exist, it's just lots of hype. There's no specific 'Finnish innovation system', this article just seems to be about some sort of 'innovation system' that's used in Finland and is exactly the same as in any other country.

It's also had a cleanup tag since July.</p>
<p>I don't think there's anything worth merging anywhere in the article. It's pretty much advertising that doesn't really say anything. ulayiti <font color="#226B22"><small>(talk)</small></font> 07:35, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>&#160;: I fail to see the notability of this individual. His only claim to fame is perhaps that he was "mentor to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevie_Ray_Vaughan_c7aa.html" title="Stevie Ray Vaughan">Stevie Ray Vaughan</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmie_Vaughan_9262.html" title="Jimmie Vaughan">Jimmie Vaughan</a> and numerous other musicians."

<li>I have changed my vote to a Weak Delete, as the LA Times does not run an obituary about just anybody. We'll have to wait to see how the article develops. --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 15:41, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Disclosure -- I am the first author of the article. The Wiki article on biograpnic notability gives different standards for living and (long) deceased persons. As Clifford Antone has only been deceased one week, the living standard should apply. He clearly meets several tests for notability: the Google Test yields more than 250,000 references, the Verifiability test is passed because his obituaries can be easily found in the NY Times, Washington Post, and LA Times. Antone was largely responsible for Austin's international fame as a music venue. He started a record label, and a blues club that was a featured nearly every major blues performer. Through his mentoring of musicians, his legacy will be felt nationally for many years. Antone's effect on Austin is very similar to that of <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Graham_%28promoter%29_4953.html" title="Bill Graham (promoter)">Bill Graham</a> to San Francisco. If the article does not yet fully express this signicance, a great deal more information is becoming available as many major newspapers are publishing his obituary. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveHopson_68d6.html" title="User:SteveHopson">SteveHopson</a> 15:10, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep&#160;: This is a keep article for me as Antone's has always been 'light on the hill' for blues players. Here in Australia we in the Blues Society talk about the roots of blues that came from Austin and Cliffords zeal. regards Terry carlan</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I first heard of Antone's death in an Australian online music magazine Undercover News. Since then, he has had obituaries in a number of significant newspapers indicating widespread acceptance of his notability. He was a significant player in blues and in the Austin music scene which is one of the most significant in the US if not the world. For mine, he is both notable and verifiable. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 19:27, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Antone was a big part of the development of modern blues through his work in the industry. Definitely notable. Sorry to hear about his passing, too. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> 17:11, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>By looking down the obituary list on this site, one gathers this is not a who's who list. As a whole, Wikipedia contains hundreds, if not thousands, of articles of little or no concern. Clifford Antone was a cog in what put Austin's music scene on the radar. He's not <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Arden_6d51.html" title="Don Arden">Don Arden</a> or <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Geffen_57d9.html" title="David Geffen">David Geffen</a>, but a bit more relevant to Americana than <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_Fat_Dutchmen_7d3d.html" title="Six Fat Dutchmen">Six Fat Dutchmen</a> or <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slingshot_%28band%29.html" title="Slingshot (band)">Slingshot (band)</a> or countless others that are about as relevant.</li>

<li><b>Soft Keep</b>: Though only because I'm opposed to the wanton killing off of articles for "obscure" webcomics in general. This one is niche but seems to be updating on a reliable schedule, which is (IMHO) an indication of a positive future for a webcomic. On the other hand it seems to be attracting vandals, presumably these londes.com people that Jansky thinks are so against him. Vanity confirmed, author cops to it on his blog. Is that hugely important when there are other editors?--<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaighle_c70b.html" title="User:Khaighle">Khaighle</a> 03:26, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: I'm voting keep for several reasons. Yes, the author of the wiki is the guy who originally created the comic, and yes, that's a potential issue. However, the comic is notable enough, relevant to Magic- Wizards of the Coast has several people say they read his comic, including Aaron Forsythe, who linked to Manascrewed in an <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/af70" class="external text" title="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/af70" rel="nofollow">article on the official site</a>. I think this is reason enough to keep despite the fact that it's a niche comic and that the author created the wiki. The vandalism alone shows that it is notable enough to be targeted.

<li>Or you could cross-check with IP addresses and see that I've probably made a dozen edits, I just never bothered to log in to make most of my edits. Plus, my account's been around longer than this AFD has been up, which is what Wikipedia policy states is important. If you're going to accuse me of being a sock puppet, you really should do a bit of checking. ChocoCid 20:32, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I never accused you of being a sockpuppet, I simply pointed out a fact. I apologise if I have offended you. I'm not aware of any policy that says what is important. According to the deletion policy it's down to the closing admin to decide where community consensus lies. --<a href="../../../j/i/f/User%7EJiFish_180b.html" title="User:JiFish">JiFish</a>(<sup><a href="../../../j/i/f/User_talk%7EJiFish_ceec.html" title="User talk:JiFish">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JiFish_b9a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JiFish">Contrib</a></sub>) 20:45, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Actually one of my favorite online comics. However, it isn't notable enough to merit inclusion per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Being linked to by Wizards of the Coast may make it notable within the world of magic players or the magic internet community but not in general. The fact the the author created the article also counts in favour of deletion. --<a href="../../../j/i/f/User%7EJiFish_180b.html" title="User:JiFish">JiFish</a>(<sup><a href="../../../j/i/f/User_talk%7EJiFish_ceec.html" title="User talk:JiFish">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JiFish_b9a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JiFish">Contrib</a></sub>) 20:51, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I agree with ChocoCid. The entry was indeed created by the author of the webcomic, but the webcomic is also relevant in the Magic: The Gathering community. 1,000 readers a day seems like it seems pretty "notable" to me. Plenty of other articles on wikipedia are only relevant to a niche, and they are permitted to exist.--<a href="../../../t/a/h/User%7ETahngarth_22a8.html" title="User:Tahngarth">Tahngarth</a></li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> The link from Wizards caught my attention. Perhaps more ideal than keeping it now may be to give it a <b>delete without prejudice</b>. The Magic audience is sizable, so it's a pretty big niche. It's likely that the comic will grow in significance, but it seems a little early at this point. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 12:47, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Last year, a user went around and split up the team pages for every MLB team, creating multiple subpages. These are decidedly not the same as the categories, as the categories are much, much larger than the notable players lists.

<li>With some basic standards (All-Stars and other players of 10 or more years, for instance), these could be useful. The categories include everone with at least one appearance, which isn't particularly helpful. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfitToys_23f7.html" title="User:MisfitToys">MisfitToys</a> 23:00, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think there are already All-Star-related categories. And I'd support categories like "St. Louis Cardinals with ten years experience" - or something to that effect. Just to say "Players of note" is too general. I'm sure someone could think of something more definitive. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 00:16, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think there are already too many categories like that; most of the All-Star categories could be replaced by articles on the individual games. Some of the bio articles are going to end up with 50 to 60 categories, which IMO is overdoing it. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfitToys_23f7.html" title="User:MisfitToys">MisfitToys</a> 21:17, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I won't comment on category count. I've never seen consensus on how many are too many. If, instead of categories, you want lists of people with 5+ years experience on a team, I'm happy with that too. Just not something as generic as "Players of note". It seems like some people run into Joe Shmoe at the grocery store and get an autograph - and that means they qualify as a player of note. That I don't like. Just my opinion... —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 21:47, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't see why this author should be treated any different from any other published author. His book was published, has sold many copies, and is sold over various vendors including Amazon.

<li><b>Comment</b> Media notability only associated with his positions as National Union of Students Black Students Officer and as President of the Cambridge University Student Union. He has left both these positions. I did a <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> newspaper and magazine database search on him and it came up with around 15 original stories referencing him (mostly just brief quotes) in those positions on student issues plus about 5 stories on him taking up the Cambridge position. About 20-30% of these stories appeared in regional, not national press. There were also about 30 mostly minor stories written by the subject when he was an entry-level journalist for the Daily Telegraph. Could not find any stories relating to his current role as local government councillor. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> (just). His name probably should be mentioned in various places, but he isn't quite noticeable enough for an article of his own. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainj_9196.html" title="User:Captainj">Captainj</a> 22:35, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> A notable individual with a high hit rate on google. Wiki has full section on all NUS presidents, given he was very nearly an NUS president and then became a councillor, is very relevant to Wiki and of interest. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexmanchester_67ba.html" title="User:Alexmanchester">alexmanchester</a>

<li><b>Rebuttal</b> Actually a poor hit rate on google - only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Pav+Akhtar%22++-site%3Awikipedia.org+&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Pav+Akhtar%22++-site%3Awikipedia.org+&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">746 google hits</a>. The previous figure of 9000+ cited by Jusjig was incorrect. Also, are you suggesting that we have articles on everyone who "nearly" becomes student union president.

<li><b>Response</b> Apologies I relied upon the earlier poster. Still a strong keep though. This individual is notable because of the amount of national publications who have asked his opinions on issues, and the fact that he is a gay muslim candidate for (not a student union but) National Union of Students president. Given the amount of controversy surrounding his election, this is still a strong keep - and a very well known person both in the student movement but also in the UK on issues of race relations.--86.132.192.82 17:19, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Admittedly there is an element of self promotion here but I hope you will all agree that we are trying to further the interests of our selected charities - any forum is a good one where that is concerned, particularly as Wikipedia is often highly listed in Google (although below our own site). We are also of course, interested in creating awareness about our expedition and for a global rally that we are in the process of trying to establish.</p>
<p>I am a little confused as to what 'Non-notable' means. Does it mean that the expedition is not yet famous enough? Or does it mean that it is pointless? These might both well be the case but one could argue in that sense, that any expedition is "Non-notable". Who chooses what is 'Notable'?</p>
<p>The comment about us being self-mentioning on free sites is only true in as much as our website is hosted on a free provider. If you look at the 'newspaper' tab on our site you will see there has been, and continues to be, considerable interest in our expedition.</p>
<p>I am sure the page will be removed as it looks like the general consensus is for deletion and for the most part I take no issue with the points made above. Vizjiz, however, your comments are a little strange. I am assuming you are some kind of moderator for the site and as such it would seem inappropriate of you to attempt to insult contributors. I can't work out why you have said we have 'delusions of grandeur'. Perhaps driving around the world in rusty old tractor seems 'Grand' to you but I can assure it is not. As for 'delusional', I can only imagine that you either, don't know what it means, or simply like the expression. In any case you are not being particularly constructive. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Copropraxia (<a href="../../../c/o/p/User_talk%7ECopropraxia_3798.html" title="User talk:Copropraxia">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Copropraxia_aa7e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Copropraxia">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> -- I'll address a couple of salient points here.
<ul>
<li>"Notability" is a general guideline that determines what topics are "encyclopedic" enough to be included in Wikipedia. A good place to start reading about notability is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">here</a>. Lack of notability is one of the primary criteria for articles being listed for deletion (and thus ending up here).</li>
<li>Closely tied to notability is the issue of "self-promotion." A guideline about self-promoting articles (aka "vanity articles") can be found <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">here</a>, which should explain why they're not suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Actually, there aren't any "moderators" per se on this page. Anyone can suggest that an article should be deleted, and list it for deletion. Similarly, anyone can take a look at an article that's been listed for deletion and add their opinion to the discussion. Vizjim is a simple contributor to this site just like the rest of us, and his / her comments have no "cloud of authority."</li>
<li>You may want to check out <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a> for some insight into why people are concerned about this article's inclusion in Wikipedia. You can always rewrite this article to provide <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> evidence of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7Enotability_75cc.html" title="WP:notability">notability</a>, and to satisfy other objections.</li>

<li>Like Docether said. Having this deleted definitely would not say your expedition is pointless. It sounds like a very good cause and is probably even quite fun - but those aren't the criteria for what is included in Wikipedia. Wikipedia is designed to report on things that other people have reported on. Your best bet for saving this would be to elaborate on where your expedition has been written about. The <a href="http://www.lrm.co.uk/" class="external free" title="http://www.lrm.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lrm.co.uk/</a> link is for a magazine - it doesn't say where your expedition is mentioned. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 14:42, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Apologies</b> for my previous comment, which broke the <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> guidelines. In compensation, I have <b>done a major re-write of the article</b>, removing the POV, advertising and first-person content, and adding in the newspaper coverage this trek has received. I think this still breaks the notability guidelines, but it's more of a balanced case than it was before. And, by the way, I have no more authority than you do. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 15:08, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Thanks Vizjim. In any case it is probably true to say that it is still perhaps too personal for Wikipedia for the moment. When we eventually get on with something more concrete we can come back on and add it. Until then delete away. Cheers.</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Too bad about Vizjim's cleanup work, but still non-notable. (Unless they get themselves kidnapped or otherwise wind up in dire circumstances on CNN, sadly.

<li><b>Delete</b> but don't get discouraged. I think it would be easy to establish notability in the future.

<p>Of the people who want this deleted there has been 2 reasons. Yes; Brutonstock currently has no context, because a link was made to it in the List of music festivals which was deleted without consultation. Brutonstock only gets one hit on Google because the information about it has been mainly spread by word of mouth, as a festival it is only just growing in popularity and a page on wikipedia would help establish fact from fiction, the organisers have plans to establish a website in the near feature for this music festival, I am in favoured of this article remaining at the current time. I purpose that this article to not be deleted and for the writers given a chance to improve upon it (giving more detail) until its website is opened and it gets more talking about, then it may be reconsidered.

<li>No - it's not to do with fictionality. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_legendary_kings_of_Britain_efbf.html" title="List of legendary kings of Britain">list of legendary kings of Britain</a> is a finite category - there are only a certain number of them, and it makes sense to collect the information together in one easily used list. The List of fictional rulers, by contrast, could include any king, queen, sultan, emperor, dictator, chieftain, sheik, khan, etc, to have appeared in any work of fiction, in any language, ever. This makes it an infinite list, in other words an <i>indiscriminate</i> collection of information (since the job is simply too big to be completed or worked on in any kind of systematic way). Better by far to create a category to cover this, which all of these entries could be included within. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 14:36, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, we already have categories for "Fictional monarchs", "Fictional kings", Fictional queens", etc. Far better to expand and standardise these than to try to mainatin an unmaintainable list. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 14:39, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can only conclude you start to invent indiscriminate rules supporting your AfD nomination. Quite disgusting. Where is that so-called rule that finiteness vs. infiniteness has anything to do with whether a list can be made in wikipedia? You just invented it on the spot. Wikipedia deals with a lot of "infinite" lists (if we take infinite according to your definition); But the list at hand isn't even infinite (you just constructed an akward definition of "infinite" in order to make this list seem "infinite". Disgusting).</li>
<li>Also, if there's a good running set of categories, there's no argument that for that reason a list on the same topic should be excluded. Where did you get that? Obviously not in wikipedia's current policies and guidelines, see for instance <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes_edc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes">Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes</a>: "Increasingly, multiple entries to fields of knowledge are provided [...]" (which is followed by an example of a set of articles that are connected as well by <i>lists</i> as by <i>categories</i> as by <i>series boxes</i>).</li>
<li>Note that, for instance, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Ubu_910e.html" title="King Ubu">King Ubu</a> isn't listed in any of the "fictional rulers" categories (nor should he necessarily be, the article is on the <i>play</i> with the same name, not the fictional ruler): much better to keep this fictional monarch in the list of fictional rulers.</li>
<li>Note also that <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a> *discourages* to make separate articles on secondary fictional characters. In many fictional universes, for instance, the <i>emperors</i> are the secondary characters (e.g. in <a href="../../../f/u/t/Futurama.html" title="Futurama">Futurama</a>). So, if one wanted to have these in <i>categories</i>, articles would need to be created (or at least categorised <i>redirects</i>). Well, no, the list, where the rulers are listed <b>grouped by the work they come from</b> has a separate function of it's own... would need an "infinite" number of subcategories to do the same grouping by categories.</li>
<li>Please don't make up your own rules. Please have a look at the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">existing ones</a> instead. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 15:13, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Not an arbitrary collection (being a "ruler" is a key attribute of a fictional character; contrast: "list of fictional characters with blue eyes"). It's better as a list than a category since not all these characters deserve articles, but conversely the fact that not all the entries have their own articles is not a clear reason to delete the list. It may need subdivision, probably not by fictional universe (this would produce too many small lists, and wouldn't serve the more useful connecting purpose): perhaps separate lists for the more common titles would be in order? Maybe it would be better to split by genre (List of fictional rulers in science fiction etc). Is it useless? No: if you want to consider the characteristics of rulers in fiction, this would be a good place to start looking. Moreover <b>"It has little content beyond links to other articles, and would therefore better serve as a category" doesn't comply with <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a></b>. There's no reason it shouldn't, if worked upon, include more information than mere links (it appears to me that well over 50% of entries actually do already!). Further, there's no reason to limit the list to only rulers with their own articles. And just because it is likely to be permanently incomplete doesn't make it invalid. <i>Please refer to <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a> before nominating lists for deletion</i> - this seems to fit the criteria there almost perfectly!

<p>Accidentally I stumbled into some asteroid-related wikipedia pages today:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are currently over 1000 "list of asteroids" pages, each listing 100 asteroids (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_asteroids_8bf3.html" title="Category:Lists of asteroids">Category:Lists of asteroids</a>);</li>
<li>there are currently over 100 "Meanings of asteroid names" pages, each listing some 1000 asteroids (example: <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meanings_of_asteroid_names_%28100001-101000%29.html" title="Meanings of asteroid names (100001-101000)">Meanings of asteroid names (100001-101000)</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, this puts this vote (regarding a single list) a bit in perspective... especially the outrageous claim by the initiator of this vote that "any attempt to produce something approaching a comprehensive list would involve terabytes of information":</p>
<ol>
<li>I think there are less "fictional rulers" than there are registered asteroids;</li>
<li>For the *notable* fictional rulers (anyway, per <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_notability_criteria_535d.html" title="Category:Wikipedia notability criteria">wikipedia notability criteria</a> only the notable ones would be included in the fictional rulers list, and the notability criterion has apparently a slightly higher threshold for fiction than for asteroids if "visibility in the media" would be used for comparison) the meaningfullness for people's lives is often higher than that of most of the over 100000 rocks of a few cubic kilometers floating around the sun.</li>
<li>Most importantly: list "size" is a lame argument from whatever side it is approached.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note also that I must formally reject the argument that the list of fictional rulers would be difficult to maintain. I have it on my watchlist for some time now, and I suppose there are some others. I've seen no particular vandalism to the list. There were some odd reverts (just a couple as far as I can remember), but maintenance-effort-wise not comparable to anything happening on the "high profile" lists contained in wikipedia that are on my watchlist. In fact this vote cost me up to present dozens of times the amount of energy than the maintenance on that list has cost me over the last year.</p>
<p>So, obviously, those that argued "[...] <b>unmaintanable</b> list" above, weren't involved in its maintenance. "Votecruft"? Is that a word? If not, I invent it here formally: <b>votecruft</b>. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 13:34, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article has been deleted twice in its current form as a speedy, and never saw AFD. It does, however, appear to assert notability; compare with <a href="../../../s/k/_/SK_Gaming_8f02.html" title="SK Gaming">SK Gaming</a> or <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_3D_82e5.html" title="Team 3D">Team 3D</a>. Someone poked me last night, having found a cached version of the article, and I undeleted it provisionally. Since I'm not entirely sold on whether or not such groups should have articles, however, it seemed best to bring it to AFD.

<li>I think if <i>any</i> clans are going to be considered notable by WP standards, then this one probably at least has a fairer claim than many. It's certainly not as cut-and-dried as your usual bunch of 15-year-old amateurs thinking they're incredibly important.

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> for now. The introduction doesn't reference "Some Asian Americans point to the racial stereotyping of Asian women as a driving force behind sex crimes targeting them." I can't say whether this is a prevalent theory or a collection of newstories that struck some Wikipedia editors as being similar. Also if kept that title should be changed to say "Asian American."

<li><b>Delete</b>, the article that says Asian women are disproportionally targeted does not provide a single supporting reference for that assertion and the authors have no apparent expertise in the area of sex crimes or statistics.

<li>Even if any users have any expertise on the subject matter, they'd have to rely on sources like the Asian American woman's organisation that was linked.

<li>But you need unbiased professional sources. An Asian women's organization says sexual assault is a special problem for Asian women? Not surprising.

<li>There's really no such thing as an unbiased source of information, especially when you're talking about something that is controversial. What makes an article conform to NPOV is the presentation of opposing points of view. Hence, the stub I added in request of expansion of the article. The lack of an opposing view does not entail deletion of an article, it entails the inclusion of said opposing view into the article. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 06:00, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b>Wikipedia is a <i>tertiary</i> source.

<p>Although this article was prodded, and the prod was not removed until after 5 days had elapsed (see timestamp), I am sending this article to AfD because it violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. The article clearly states that it was sourced from "a lot of pondering and discussion, with a full list of all Suzuki models built" (see the very bottom), which makes it original research and speculation by the author, not reporting of a third-party source - Suzuki has never published a document listing its naming conventions, if they even exist. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 15:10, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> While the notablility of Muds and the activities and characters who use them is limited, there are many other articles on Wikipedia that are as notable, if not less so. The World of Warcraft articles alone set a bar that would allow the Muds articles to stay. Muds are a foundation for the internet gaming of today, their history is in a way the history of internet gaming. It is informational and educational to see the in-game history of these Muds, as it shows where large games (such as World of Warcraft and Everquest, both of which have large articles, and articles about in-gmae areas and historys) came from and possibly what where they are going. Gaming on the internet is only going to grow over the next several decades, and articles on Muds offer a vantage point into the beginnings of it all.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Warcraft has 5 million players. The typical MUD is lucky to have 100. The history of mudding in general is not sufficient, in my mind, to justify allowing articles like this. If it could be merged into the main article for DSL, that's one thing, but if we start allowing articles like this - summaries of the goings-on of characters in a MUD - how do we justify NOT allowing similar articles for the goings-on of characters in other MUDs? Or worse, in Warcraft? Imagine 5 million subscribers all wanting an encyclopic entry for their guild. It's a path down which I think we ought not tread. <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 14:27, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am a newbie, but the guidelines on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a> say web content is notable if it meets <i>any one</i> of the criteria, and point 3 reads, 'The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster' of which I have provided an example. If a site meets the criteria, the guidelines suggest it should be included. If this site fails to meet the criteria, then could someone explain why, is it because we are still only a small community? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveb74_0110.html" title="User:Daveb74">Daveb74</a> 20:12, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Still hasn't met notability requirements.

<li>Both sites seem to lack independent and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.

<p>I hope this article has come on alot since I started it. I have been reading through the guidelines and I probably should have read them before starting the article. Dramapod has been mentioned in local press but not national press yet. As the community continues to develop every week I hope it features in the national press in the near future. I was hoping that being featured by the online broadcaster <a href="http://www.bxradio.net/coolcast/podcasters/dpd/" class="external text" title="http://www.bxradio.net/coolcast/podcasters/dpd/" rel="nofollow">BX Radio</a> counted as an established alternative, combined with the distinction of being the first and currently only podacst directory for audio theatre. If that doesn't count and the article is deleted then perhaps I can add a revised version in the future after Dramapod has featured in the mainstream. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveb74_0110.html" title="User:Daveb74">Daveb74</a> 10:20, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - judging from the touring schedule listed on the group's site, they appear to be touring nationally and regularly. Although their albums are self-released, their music seems to have proper distribution (available from Amazon, cdbaby and the inevitable iTunes) and sales of over 20,000 are reported in a reputable source (The Boston Globe).

<li><b>Comment</b>. Fair points. Clearly they are regionally popular, though i have no idea whether they qualify as "the most prominent representative" of the local scene. Boston is a big place. Moreover, their 'national tour' hasn't made the West coast, so its more of a large regional tour. Nevertheless, i'm less convinced now, so will change my comment to neutral. However, I also just noticed that a fair amount of the article is a direct lift from their website, making it a copyvio. I'm not sure whether it is appropriate to blank the page during an AfD. If it stays it needs a NPOV rewrite anyway. Any ideas? <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="blue">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 19:51, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment - your US geography is clearly superior to mine, so I'll take the point on that one. I think <i>changes</i> to an article are appropriate during a AfD as they are frequently made to try and satisfy the concerns raised during the discussion but if it's a copyvio and no-one comes forward to rewrite then it'll have to go, I believe.<a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 19:57, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The sooner, the better. It might be best to do it in stages, so show the other editors that there is a bona fide attempt to rectify the problems. That's how I managed to salvage a couple of music-related articles from AfD (such as <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Ward_8bd4.html" title="Robin Ward">Robin Ward</a>). <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 06:46, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Theoretically, as a copyvio the page should be blanked immediately and started from scratch. However, i very much doubt the band would worry too much that their copyright is being violated in this manner. You should have a week or so until this AfD is resolved, i would recommend you replace the copied text by then. You could also read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for advice on how to write a verifiable article in neutral tone.

<li>Comment - I know these guys personally and professionally and based on the wording of this article I would say either a band member or a member of the bands staff wrote this. Notice the complete lack of mention of former lead singer/guitar player/front man Chad Perrone who wrote almost ALL of the songs from thier first 2 albums. It has only been 2 months since Chad's departure. (what happened to cause his departure is unclear as both the band and Chad refuse to get into a he said/they said type thing.) As for thier importance in the Boston music scene, these guys are the real deal. They may not have had a "real" national tour, but what they have done to the local pop/rock scene is no less then what Dropkick Murphys have done for the irish-punk scene.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Comment - I also know them on the same level. Perrone's departure actually happened last December, almost six months ago. A member of the band or staff probably did write the former history section but didn't mention him most likely because the band has moved on and would like people who read about them to see them as the band they are in the here and now.</li>

<li>New Article(mostly) - I've made some changes that should take this article out of the deletion pool. I added a history section and took most of what was already there and moved it into the "press - growth" section. I have included mention of the previous lead singer and given what I believe to be an unbiased view of his leaving the band by providing quotations of both sides of the story.</li>
<li>I am a member of the band's staff and while I understand that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, it is also a place where unnecessary finger pointing can begin, maybe not with the musicians themselves but with supporters who unfortunately chose to take sides after the split. As long as the article stays up, it poses as a risk to start trouble, and I am sure that neither Averi nor Chad wants anything more negative to happen. Both sides have moved on. I will be putting in a request to delete this article as soon as possible. Thank you for understanding.</li>

<p><b>KEEP</b> Listen i dont understand what your problem is, is Wikipedia some kind of mafia? EasyPizza is a company registered in the Uk which has 3 branches, an address, a phone, a website, customers, workers, pays tax, vat and has every right to be listed in Wikipedia. If you delete easypizza i will ask for all the other similar pizza companies Wiki pages to also be deleted and possibly other restaurants and if Wikipedia is fair they either delete all company pages or they leave them all in. What you say about SEO is again unfair. Your page <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easygroup.html" title="Easygroup">easygroup</a> has nothing but SEO links and company propaganda as simply one example, i will demand that if our company page is deleted on the basis of only backlinks just to our homepage then all your pages that have dozens of back links must also be removed.

<li>There is continued discussion about Halls of Residence. A compromise that has been reached in some other places is for a single article that gives information about all Halls in a particular university. This is usefull when the main university article is getting large. The suggestion here is a merge to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monash_University%2C_Clayton_campus_b858.html" title="Monash University, Clayton campus">Monash University, Clayton campus</a>. This article for the main campus is very recent and will get much larger.

Articles for some of the other smaller campuses at Monash are larger than the one for the main campus. My proposal is to <b>keep</b> <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monash_Residential_Services_bef8.html" title="Monash Residential Services">Monash Residential Services</a> but <b>delete</b> the articles for the individual Halls at Monash but adding <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_East_Flats_cbc3.html" title="South East Flats">South East Flats</a> to the five listed above. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 23:06, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is a correct assertion, and it's what makes Wikipedia, a secondary source, possible—copyright doesn't protect facts, or the effort of researching them. It only protects creative expression. There's accordingly no obligation to keep a record of who contributed what facts as long as you're not using their copyrighted expression. See <a href="../../../f/e/i/Feist_v._Rural_4040.html" title="Feist v. Rural">Feist v. Rural</a>, rejecting that copyright protects the "sweat of the brow."

<li>Apparently you dont see the distinction between copyright and GFDL, GFDL actually cares about contributions and as such you should find a better case law precedent for your argument.

<ul>
<li>I was just trying to keep a tangent from swamping this AFD. Anyway, I'm really not clear on what your rationale is. You seem to be suggesting that the license itself creates rights in the grantor, which is not how it works. The GFDL is a license for the use of copyrighted material. A license is a grant of permission extended by someone who has the rights to control the subject matter of the license. If something is not copyrightable, licenses are irrelevant, because your permission is not needed for someone to make use of something you do not have the right to control. You can't give more than what you have. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 16:31, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps they could be merged into a new article, Notable Residential Halls in Monash University or something. I'm not too fussed about the fate of those particular articles. However, if there <i>is</i> a merge, the articles almost <i>must</i> be kept. Here are the reasons we always merge and redirect instead of merging and deleting:
<ul>
<li>As Peter pointed out above, <i>the bloody GFDL</i>. We can't deliberately take someone's work and then delete any records tying them to their contribution; it's not only a copyright violation, it's immoral, too. And something like "rewording the facts to get around copyright" fixes one problem, but not the other.</li>
<li>People will expect to be able to find the articles at their current locations; if we move the information to another article, it's Common Sense to provide a redirect so everyone knows where it's gone.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, searching. If I've just stumbled across Wikipedia and I want to find out about Howitt Hall, a redirect is very useful for that purpose (since our search engine sucks).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>There is no good reason for deleting the redirect. Some people on AfD (usually newbies, which is why it's disappointing to see people like Postdlf arguing otherwise) tend to want redirects deleted after merging so they can have the satisfaction of deleting <i>something</i>, and that's just <i>sad</i>. Why delete when you don't have to?</li>
<li>Surprisingly enough, it's actually more work for the closing admin to merge and delete. And as a closing admin, I put enough work into these damn things already without all y'all inventing more out of sheer devilment.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>And here's why we might want to delete the redirect instead:
<ul>
<li>It has an offensive name.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dd>Categories do not make lists obsolete -- lists can give more information than categories, and can allow you to see places where articles are still needed.

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm still wondering how a list of porn stars, whether Japanese or not, is encyclopedic, especially when most of that list comprise of empty articles. The Wikipedia community can be pretty pathetic sometimes. Where are the requests to prove that those names are actual people? Where are the requests to source the article? Did anybody even check the articles linked to see if they pass <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28erotic_actors%29_17a3.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (erotic actors)">Wikipedia:Notability (erotic actors)</a>? Because many of them do not. Did anybody check to see if those articles actually link to real people? For example - AOI (AOI), Shion, Shizuka, Sonobe, Subaru, Yuka - those on the list don't even link to articles on any porn stars. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 05:44, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Let me see if I get this straight... The list is unnecessary because we have categories of articles... and the majority of these names have no article, therefore they won't be in the category... but they're not worth listing until they have their own article, at which time they will be put in a category, not a list...

<li>I didn't blank the article. All I've essentially done was deleted information that was not verified. Those names could all be completely made up for all we know. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 05:44, 9 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Among the "unverifiable" names you blanked (twice so far) were <a href="../../../m/i/k/Miki_Sawaguchi_c4ea.html" title="Miki Sawaguchi">Miki Sawaguchi</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Ohura_3400.html" title="Anna Ohura">Anna Ohura</a>, who not only are well-known, they already have articles. The majority of the others can be verified simply by clicking on the 日本語 link. You obviously made no effort to verify anything, and you requested verification from no one at the article.</li>
<li>This argument that a list is the same as a category is as dishonest as the claim that the majority of these names are "unverifiable." I'd be willing to bet the vast majority are verifiable with a simple search. I'd do that myself, and re-sort the list into family name order, if not for the obvious dishonesty behind the request for verification. You simply intend to delete the list.</li>
<li>I have posted a restored, revised article, with red-links taken out and put it in a better format. I'd do more, but I get the feeling any further work on this list will be a wasted effort. -- <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 07:09, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>deletion was already suggested in June 2005, cleanup tag since June 2005, still an extremely short and unwikified text, not linked by any normal Wikipedia article; <i>keep and improve</i> votes obviously don't make any sense unless you are improving the article yourself Deleteme42 21:31, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep and improve</b> votes (like this one) make plenty of sense. I know that this is Wikipedia where everybody is equal, but you could fit everything I know about epidemiology into my navel and still have room for a lot of lint. I wouldn't know how to even start improving this article, but sooner or later someone who <i>does</i> know what they're doing will find it. Until then, I'll pass the buck. Trying to delete stubs on notable subjects displays a fundamental lack of faith in the process here. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 16:08, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>If an article is neither linked by other Wikipedia articles nor would be of any help for someone creating a proper article there's no value in keeping the article no matter how notable the subject of the article is. Otherwise, I could easily find an area where hundreds of notable people without Wikipedia articles exist and create articles consisting of no more than five words for each of them (<i>Mister Foo was a bar.</i>) - would you vote for keeping such articles? And it seems in this case the AfD made much sense - after nearly a full year with the cleanup tag the article still was bullshit, but only 15 minutes after my AfD someone improved the article to a reasonable stub proving the value of this AfD (and making it obsolete).

<li>If they were genuinely notable people, then yes, I would want to keep them. There's nothing wrong with stubs, and if a page in an under-covered area doesn't have any inbound links, chances are that the page will acquire some once people start more pages in that area.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Someone seems to have a grudge against Family Guy&#160;;-) Seriously, they are episode pages like those of any other series. There is no original research in them. As for "cite", the episode which is summerised is a valid source. The person who made these accusations should back them up, as they seem pretty random and unfounded to me. And while he's at it, he should justify why he's going after Family Guy episodes only. Is it more researched or sourced to describe an episode of another series? Or is he planning to mass-delete all episode pages of all series? Until we get some kind of explaination on why these episodes in particular should be deleted, I'm strongly for keeping them. -- <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 21:52, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The "debate" was when the page was porrly written, not when it was uncited. It is original research; the authors are getting their info from their knowledge of the episode. If they got the info from a summary then wheres the citation?

<dd>So by your judgement, any movie/book/tv show page that has a summary of the work is "uncited original research"? That's nonesense. It is cited, and the source is the movie/book/tv show being summarised. And if that's "original research", then every page where something's expressed in the writer's words instead of being copy-pasted from a book or encyclopedia - which is to say, every single page in wikipedia - is guilty of original research. And since we cannot copy-paste articles from encyclopedias (you know, with those pesky copyright laws and all), then we might as well shut down wikipedia right now and save you the trouble of listing every last page. -- <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 22:02, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is not an <i>interpretation</i>, it is a <i>summary</i>. It is a factual description of what happens in the episode. "Peter gets trapped on a desert island. He comes back after several months, and finds Brian has married Lois. He wins Lois over again." There is no original research in there. If the text were to read, say, "In a very unoriginal plot twist, Peter gets trapped on a desert island. But the Robinson story was better. Lois married Brian -- ewww gross, bestiality is wrong! But Peter wins Lois over again, yay Peter! He's so great, I love him so much!" then that would be a fan interpretation of the show, and you'd have a case. But there is nothing in wikipedia policy against putting factual information in - in fact, that's what wikipedia in for.</dd>
<dd>And another thing, did you actually read the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original Research</a> page? I'd like you to find me a part of it that can says, or even that can be loosely interpreted as saying, that a factual NPOV movie/book/tv show summary constitutes original research.

<li>I'm all for compromise, but I'm not sure I follow your logic here in asserting that the articles are uncited. It seems to me that if an article is about a TV show, the <i>show</i> is the citation... the citation is implied and should be obvious. Same goes if I am writing an article for a film; the plot summary, cast, etc are technically "uncited" in that I have not made a citation, but the <i>film</i> is the citation. Now if I write something about the critical reception, that requires a citation. So, what exactly are you suggesting? Are you saying that one can't write an article about a television show unless a secondary source has summarized its plot, therefore providing one with a citation? <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 23:03, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes it does, but the problem with it is that <i>Family Guy</i> is so symbiotically connected into American pop culture that Wikipedia is better able to put it all into context. In this way it is very different from another TV show that has its own Wiki, <i>Star Trek</i>. In some ways, the <i>Star Trek</i> universe is highly self-contained, it could exist in the absence of 20th Century American pop culture. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromulent_Kwyjibo_1af7.html" title="User:Cromulent Kwyjibo">Cromulent Kwyjibo</a> 20:44, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> As with all other Family Guy episode summaries. Family Guy is closely linked to American popular culture, and the summaries at the Wikipedia offer and excellent reference for viewers who aren't too familliar with the said pop culture. Giving people more insight in different cultures is certainly something we want to achieve with the Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../g/s/c/User%7EGSchjetne_4132.html" title="User:GSchjetne">GSchjetne</a> 20:35, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I have found these guides to be incredibly useful, especially when attempting to decipher the many vague (I was born in '90) cultural references made on Family Guy. The guides are really just factually summaries; the WP policy isn't holy writ, and I believe that quite reasonably, we can bend the rules a bit. And yes, if you did delete this extensive amount of work, you would have to do so for just about every uncited TV show entry out there and minor article stub. If you must, put that uncited banner above the article. Don't destroy this much work. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAristotle1990_4bfe.html" title="User:Aristotle1990">Aristotle1990</a> 01:52, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I certainly wish we could bend the rules here (seriously), but with editors treating even short essays as concrete, unbreakable rules (notability), I don't expect to see rule-bending here. It's either accept the rules or, when a deletionist is losing a battle, <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">flat-out ignore</a> them. At this point, <b>I am not trying to delete all this work.</b> I realize that they are great articles as far as quality of writing is. I just wish that the rules would stop being bent for TV shows and someone could introduce citations. If an article is uncited, it's original research, which is no-exceptions banned on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../c/c/o/User%7ECcool2ax_5c31.html" title="User:Ccool2ax"><font color="blue">Chris</font></a> <a href="../../../c/c/o/User_talk%7ECcool2ax_7ce5.html" title="User talk:Ccool2ax"><font color="green" size="1">Ccool2ax</font></a> <font color="gray" size="1"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ccool2ax_93c0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ccool2ax">contrib.</a></font> 03:56, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It would be absurd to delete virtually every TV show and movie page on Wikipedia, but almost all were written by a viewer based on what they saw rather than by citing a third party summary. At worst, use the Primarysources tag. IMHO, that's overkill for a popular culture item. As someone noted above, critical reaction or other news connected to the episode should be cited.

<ul>
<li>This is getting nonsensical in my opinion. Research on any topic is at some point original. Can a shared experience i.e watching a tv programme be considered research? Research suggests pursuing something to an end no-one has reached before. There is nothing on any of the Family Guy pages that anyone couldn't find out through seeing the relevent shows. It's a matter of knowledge rather than research. As a British person watching Family Guy I don't get all of the cultural references. It's nice to see them here laid out so I can understand them. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox">Mallanox</a> 21:27, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Haha, well I would have to agree to a certain extent. I do not really know why socialites deserve mention in an encyclopedia. But I was looking up someone else, and came across whole categories of socialites (by nationality, etc) whose authors would probably be sad if they were deleted.

<dd>Let's not play games like this. You would not have even thought about looking up random socialites and deleting them if you hadn't seen it on my contibutions list, so it is clear that you did it because you are mad at me or something for reporting some (admittedly negative) information about some schools in BC. We are fixing that, and I will try to be unbiased about universities in the future. So about this, you would have to agree to saying that all or the majority of the articles on socialites should be deleted for the same reasons, which I don't think you are prepared to do because you really don't care about the socialite thing but about the universities.

<p>Ok, I made the new category for Canadians because there wasn't one before. I realize it looks a bit silly with only one, but I guess I was sort of hoping others would add more. There are categories for Americans, Australians, French, British, etc. I thought Canada should have a category too. Is that ok?</p>
<p>And about non-notable-ness, most socialites probably *are* non-notable compared to celebrities or less-famous authors or certain types of cheese or a bunch of other wacky stuff that is on wikipedia because some people think it is interesting. There are enough people interesting in recording the goings-on of socialites, so that is why there are articles about them, Hosty included.

<li><b>Delete</b> as 100% NN vanity, what more do you need? I'd also question the sheer factual nature of the article - I'm wondering when, for example, she would have fit in "studying at Oxford" during this "youth" of hers, since she only finished high school in 2003 and has been at college in British Columbia since (and while we're at it, how can one start college in 2003 and now be in their fourth year?). Anyway, the article asserts no notability whatsoever. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 09:09, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fact: Canadian universities end in April and thus students graduating from high school in 2003 are entering their fourth year, and when you are in the summer between years you wouldn't say you are in the year you just completed. Also, many bright students ie those that would be accepted for a study abroad program at Oxford will have taken AP classes and would be well into the fourth year credit wise. So Seb Patrick's question of the article's "sheer factual natural" is illogical in those areas. In terms of notability there are other articles on Wikipedia regarding socialites are equally not "notable". The main definition for socialites being that they are not primarily something else ie actress, model. For if they were they would be called by that instead. This article sounds like most of the rest of them so I'd say <b>keep</b> because I don't see a problem about this one. Roses85 00:00, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Rose85 also totally ignores the fact that, even if socialites were notable, we're totally unable to verify that she is one, or exists at all.

<li><b>Comment</b> - the only worry I have is that putting it into the main Ennis article would make that article a little long and list-orientated. On Ennis' own page, I think the comics bibliography should be selected and concise, rather than comprehensive. On the other hand, there's a lot of good information in this entry, and it can't be argued that it isn't encyclopaedic - and it would therefore be a shame to lose it. I wouldn't strongly oppose the merge, but I think if some actual writing was done to bulk out the entry, describing Ennis' <i>2000AD</i> work and its significance and context (he is, after all, one of the most important writers ever to have worked on the comic, although it then beggars the question if similar articles should be created for Wagner, Grant <i>et al</i>), then the article can stand on its own. Either way, I've no firm vote - just that comment. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 09:16, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is a good point.

My problem with this is that it seems pretty arbitary and if you had a selected bibliography some of his 2000AD material would have to be in it. If there is an agreed upon format for a concise/complete bibliography we can sort that out when/if the merge is made (I'll start a section on it on the Talk page so we can decide what would go in to a concise list).

<dd>Is an exhaustive list of every 5 page story that Ennis wrote for the weekly 2000AD during his stint on dread really that necessary? Followed by an exhaustive list of reprints?

<dd>As one of the people adding those details to those bios I'd say yes. The information is available elsewhere but it is the bringing together of various strands of data in one place that allows us to get a grasp of their overall body of work. Otherwise you'd have to list their major work (which is subjective) and tag on "and some other stuff" leaving people to wander off to try find out what that is. Equally this also relies on the other places staying up as long Wikipedia or you'd end up scrambling to dig out the extra information (<a href="../../../d/e/z/Dez_Skinn_92ce.html" title="Dez Skinn">Dez Skinn</a> is always predicting 2000 AD's demise - one day he may even be proven right). As I've said I'd be interested in having a "concise bibliography" within someone's entry and separate "comprehensive bibliography" for the details. All their publications are clearly notable and so trying to reach a consensus on what would or wouldn't be included would be a nightmare and almost impossible to police. Alan Moore in particular has a lot of abortive runs of comics and single issues here and there which are notable and worthy of inclusion but possibly not within a more concise bibliography.

<li>Although I personally haven't been adding them, I don't understand why they could be a problem with comprehensive bibliographies. All Wikipedia creator biographies - literary or otherwise - follow the same pattern, with biographical details at the top, career details second, other issues third, and finally a list of achievements, accomplishments, and/or published works. <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="m:Wiki_is_not_paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>, and these pages so far are not breaking even the recommended page sizes.

<li>I am not quite sure that I agree with the above sentiments. I do think that the copy can be reworked a little bit, specifically some of the comments about fees, but I don't think that this is a "blatant" advertisement that warrants a deletion. The entry doesn't have any external links. Furthermore, I don't think that it should matter who wrote the entry. It is an attempt to add valid copy to Wikipedia and improve the site. This entry should not merged into the <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overstock.com.html" title="Overstock.com">Overstock.com</a> entry because Overstock.com Auctions is one of the few online auctions sites that receives any traction (according to Hitwise and ComScore Data) besides eBay. I have been following the company for a long time, specifically its colorful CEO <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Byrne_81fd.html" title="Patrick Byrne">Patrick Byrne</a> and his jihad against [[naked short selling]. I have watched it build out its web property over the past few years. Overstock.com now has a Travel Business, Bulk Supplies Business, and now, an Auctions Business. In a way, it is a smaller version of InterActive Corp, who owns many well known properties such as Ask.com, Match.com, etc. Lastly, if you look and Ebay's page, it seems to promote the site a little bit by advertising the famous items that have sold. I haven't seen any complaints there. Bottom line is that there is some work to be done here, but a deletion would be harsh. --Tallac20 - May 31, 2006</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It is true that songs have had a rotation in major Norwegian radiostations - NRK P1(national), NRK Trøndelag(regional) and Radioadressa(regional) plus on local radiostations. However, claims cannot be backed up yet - as neither NRK nor TONO keeps records of songs played on the internet, and I understand why it should be deleted after being made aware of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Another tidbit I could not find sources for is the participation of Tor Espen Aspaas on the album - a former "Spellemannspris"-winner (The Norwegian equivalent of the Grammy's). That might warrant a mention, although his page should have been made first, I'm sure. --Roamer82 15:27, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> for many reasons. First, this is the first major action of a new union, SEIU, thus noteworthy. Second, original reason suggested has nothing to do (as far as I can tell) with wikipedia's deletion policy. I strongly feel that the suggestion to delete is an NPOV tactic. Third, this particular strike has gotten *national* attention (just read the article) and has become a testing ground for labor issues in the American south. I think there is no reason to discuss this further: the article needs to stay. 129.171.49.201 16:15, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for reasons listed above. This is not about my neighbor's dog, and wikipedia is not made of paper. Also, there is likely to be another editing flurry around 1 August 06 when the ballot counting starts. This issue is not yet history. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversitytruth_ac59.html" title="User:Universitytruth">Universitytruth</a> 16:30, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Mistaken and misleading reason for deletion. John Edwards, among others, was involved in this, and may still be in the coming months. Nice try, DSJ2. 129.171.49.206 16:41, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The criterion of noteworthiness is not what happens in NYC. The move to delete is frivolous. 129.171.226.193 17:53, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As a complete stranger to this debate, and as somebody who hates 'reality TV' and personally considers it intrinsically unencyclopedic, the chronology of something ongoing like this is nonetheless highly significant to many people which makes it notable. Once the series is over it can be condensed. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a paper encyclopedia and can afford the tiny bit of space this article uses on the servers. Having said all that, the article as it stands is pretty poor and could do with some major work which I am personally not offering to do! Still, as I understand it, that is grounds for adding a tag or two, not for deletion. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 15:01, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
