<p><s>Not 100% sure about this one. The article appears to be about an Indian political party, not a person.

<dd>I never said anyone was advised how to vote, but rather that they were advised that the AfD existed. In fact, I was clear to use the word "recommend" and not "vote". Regardless, is there any information about this organization not dated December 2004 or not from PTI? <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedtopic_fe40.html" title="User:Medtopic">Medtopic</a> 18:05, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b> - Please note that there is NO doubt as to whether this entity exits <a href="http://www.indiatraveltimes.com/news/news2004/dec04/dec0504_news2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.indiatraveltimes.com/news/news2004/dec04/dec0504_news2.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Hence the Verifiability is not at all a question. PTI in India is like Reuters. Hence it is an authenticated source. The only question over here is Notability and if a breakaway fraction of a political party is notable, then this Jagran is notable. Also we have to keep in mind that Local Newspapers (in Bengali / Hindi etc) are not searchable in Google. Another problem is the minor spelling variation (Jagran / Jagaran) that may limit the utility of Google as far as these reports are concerned<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">Doctor Bruno</a> 03:25, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Verifiable in its existance and verifiably important are two different things. Do you have anything else not dated December 2004, or not from PTI, that would suggest the organization is verifiably important? <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedtopic_fe40.html" title="User:Medtopic">Medtopic</a> 03:55, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Most of the press coverage is by the Local Media in Languages like Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam and Bengali</li>
<li>Such media reports do not have an online edition</li>
<li>If if there is an online edition, most of the reports are not in Unicode, but use their own fonts and not searchable</li>
<li>Even many of the English papers are behind a subscription and hence not retrievable</li>

<dd>Any how both PTI as well as Outlook are very reputed sources and the fact that the organisation has been reported in these means that there should be no doubt regarding Verifiability, which I suppose is an objective phenomenon. (If it is verifiable by me, it should be verifiable by you.)</dd>
<dd>The notability, however is a subjective phenomenon and hence is for the Community to decide by Consensus<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">Doctor Bruno</a> 04:18, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28organizations%29_0596.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (organizations)">Wikipedia:Notability (organizations)</a> attempts to address the aspect of subjectivity by setting certain guidelines for what constitutes "notable". Among these: "Notability can be asserted for organizatons through... [a] significant amount of media coverage that is not trivial in nature and that deals specifically with the organization as the primary subject." Thus far we have two links (<a href="http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/dec052004/i12.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/dec052004/i12.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://www.indiatraveltimes.com/news/news2004/dec04/dec0504_news2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.indiatraveltimes.com/news/news2004/dec04/dec0504_news2.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>) that are both dated December 5, 2004 and are apparently from the same press release, and a third (<a href="http://outlookindia.com/pti_news.asp?id=368966" class="external autonumber" title="http://outlookindia.com/pti_news.asp?id=368966" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>) dated March 8th. Certainly our standards differ on whether or not <i>this</i> is a "significant amount of media coverage". The assertion that information exists but we don't have access to it is problematic when building Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> doesn't grant special exemptions to articles that may have a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">systemic bias</a>, nor does it prevent you from citing publications that are written in other languages. <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedtopic_fe40.html" title="User:Medtopic">Medtopic</a> 05:06, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is no uniform system of translitteration of Indian language names into English, and therefor one has to be a bit flexible when seaching. Googling "Tapan Sikdar" + Manch OR Mancha gave some new links, which some have be included in the article. Other mentions in media are <a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/2004/12/11/stories/2004121106821100.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hinduonnet.com/2004/12/11/stories/2004121106821100.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1041206/asp/bengal/story_4091959.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1041206/asp/bengal/story_4091959.asp" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and <a href="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1041218/asp/bengal/story_4144686.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1041218/asp/bengal/story_4144686.asp" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Does anyone actually question whether this organization exists? Secondly as per notability, this is a political organization led by a former union minister.
