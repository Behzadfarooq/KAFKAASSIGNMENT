<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Carlson_788a.html" title="Edit section: Before and after the format change">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Before and after the format change</span></h2>
<p>Mr. Carlson is a well-meaning, bumbling, childlike man who is completely out of touch with the changes that have occurred in the radio and music business. He keeps his job as general manager of WKRP only because his mother, Lillian Carlson, better known as "Mama Carlson," owns the station. Unbeknownst to him, his mother has set up WKRP as a tax write-off that is intended to lose money, and she keeps him at the station not because she wants him to succeed but because she expects him to fail.</p>
<p>Flashbacks in the episode "Bah, Humbug" reveal that Mr. Carlson joined WKRP as sales manager in the early '50s. When his mother fired the previous station manager for being too generous to the employees, Arthur got his job. With the rise of <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_n%27_roll.html" title="Rock n' roll">rock n' roll</a> music, WKRP's "beautiful music" format became outdated and a sure money-loser, appealing only to senior citizens.</p>
<p>In the pilot of <i>WKRP</i>, the new program director, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Travis_2af9.html" title="Andy Travis">Andy Travis</a>, convinces Mr. Carlson that switching the format to rock n' roll might make the station successful and profitable; Mr. Carlson, who wants desperately to prove to his mother that he can be a success, goes along with the change and even gets the nerve to defend Andy's changes to his mother. Only when Arthur shows that much backbone does his mother relent and keep to the format change.</p>
<p><a name=".22Management.22_style"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Carlson_788a.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Management&quot; style">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Management" style</span></h2>
<p>Though he accepts the format change, Mr. Carlson is not a fan of rock n' roll music, and frequently doesn't even listen to his own station because he doesn't enjoy the songs or the modern, with-it styles of the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disc_jockeys.html" title="Disc jockeys">disc jockeys</a>. As the series goes on, however, Mr. Carlson becomes more accepting of the format and the changing cultural trends. In the episode "In Concert," after eleven kids are trampled to death at a concert by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Who_01bd.html" title="The Who">The Who</a> (something that really happened in Cincinnati), the staff fears that Mr. Carlson, who feels guilty about having helped to promote the concert, will change their format back to "elevator music." But Mr. Carlson, who was at the concert and actually found himself enjoying the music (before he learned what happened), understands that the stadium's first-come, first-served seating was to blame for the tragedy, and not the band or the music. "We're a rock n' roll station," he declares, "and we're going to stay a rock n' roll station."</p>
<p>Because Mr. Carlson doesn't know much about the music or about business, he spends most of his time sleeping or playing with various toys he keeps in his office: model trains, a miniature basketball and hoop, or toy soldiers. He defends this practice by saying "I'm not a child -- I'm a hobbyist." He is also an avid <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fisherman.html" title="Fisherman">fisherman</a>, keeping several rods and reels in his office at all times and speaking eloquently of the joys of hooking a fish and then throwing it back.</p>
<p>Mr. Carlson has trouble dealing with people, especially with saying "no"; he will buy anything from a salesman (WKRP sales manager <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herb_Tarlek_03bc.html" title="Herb Tarlek">Herb Tarlek</a> once sold him an insurance policy) and tends to whimper when someone yells at him. To protect him from the outside world, he depends on his receptionist, <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Marlowe_47eb.html" title="Jennifer Marlowe">Jennifer Marlowe</a>, whose main job is keeping people away from her boss by any means necessary, including telling them that he's dead.</p>
<p>Some episodes, particularly in the first season, show Mr. Carlson feeling left out at the station and wanting to prove that he, too, can come up with good ideas to make WKRP more successful. The most famous such attempt is chronicled in "Turkeys Away," where Mr. Carlson tries to become actively involved in every aspect of running the station, driving the employees crazy with incessant suggestions. He then comes up with what he describes as a brilliant idea for a <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving.html" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> promotion, but, distrustful of Andy and the other "casually dressed" employees, he won't tell anyone what the promotion is, except the obsequious Herb. On the day of the promotion, with news director <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Nessman_6662.html" title="Les Nessman">Les Nessman</a> covering it live, the WKRP staff discovers that Mr. Carlson and Herb are throwing live turkeys out of a helicopter, which promptly plummet to their deaths. When Mr. Carlson returns, covered with feathers, he admits: "As God is my witness, I thought turkeys could fly." Despite the fiasco, the employees realize that they need to make Mr. Carlson feel more respected and wanted at the station.</p>
<p>Being generally a straightforward, uncomplicated kind of person, Mr. Carlson sometimes acts as a father figure to members of his staff. By using a low-key, friendly approach, he helps Herb face up to his <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholism</a> problems, and in the episode "Who is Gordon Sims", he assists Venus in coming to terms with his past as an Army <a href="../../../d/e/s/Deserter.html" title="Deserter">deserter</a> (albeit with mixed feelings, as Mr. Carlson himself had served in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_Corps_50a5.html" title="Marine Corps">Marine Corps</a> and is initially very taken aback at hearing of Venus' desertion).</p>

<p>Arthur Carlson comes from a successful family of Cincinnati business people. Arthur's grandfather, who is seen in one episode in a dream (also played by Gordon Jump), was a miserly businessman who built up Carlson Industries. He left it to Arthur's father, Hank, a sweet-natured man who was more interested in having a good time than running the business. Hank married Lillian, a former actress in Broadway musicals, who soon proved to have a talent for business and took the family business more seriously than Hank did. Eventually Lillian took over the corporation entirely, and Hank died soon after. Because his father died when he was very young, Arthur Carlson was raised mostly by his mother and by her sarcastic butler, Hirsch (Ian Wolfe).</p>
<p>Mama Carlson has never shown Arthur any open signs of affection, and constantly puts him down: when he tries to hug her, she pushes him aside and says "keep away from me!" She tells <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Travis_2af9.html" title="Andy Travis">Andy Travis</a> that she raised her son this way because she was trying to make him tough and self-sufficient, like her; instead, by her own admission, the tactic backfired, making him even more weak-willed than his father.</p>
<p>He is married to Carmen (<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allyn_Ann_McLerie_278d.html" title="Allyn Ann McLerie">Allyn Ann McLerie</a>), a sweet-natured woman who is almost as shy as he is: though they are happily married, their main problem is that they are so anxious to avoid hurting each other's feelings that they rarely tell each other what they really think. They have a son, Arthur Jr., whom they sent off to <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_school.html" title="Military school">military school</a> on Mama Carlson's advice; this proved to be a mistake when it turns "Little Arthur" into a nasty, racist, borderline fascist. In the first season, Mr. Carlson takes his son out of military school, to live with his parents and go to public school, but later references suggest that Little Arthur gets worse, not better; in one episode, it is revealed that Little Arthur wants to join the American branch of the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Party_3bfc.html" title="Nazi Party">Nazi Party</a>. During the course of the series, Carmen has a surprise pregnancy and, after she and Arthur decide they want the baby, she gives birth to a daughter, whom she and Arthur hope they can raise their own way, without the mistakes they made with their son.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Carlson pays the sexy Jennifer the highest salary of any employee at the station, there is never anything improper about their relationship. He relies on Jennifer to give him the kind of support he never got from his own mother. He also knows that Jennifer, despite her apparent self-reliance, really cares about him and, in her own way, depends on him too: "You need me to need you," he tells Jennifer in one episode. Carmen is friendly with Jennifer and shows no jealousy or suspicions of her. Mr. Carlson is tempted once in the course of the series, by his first receptionist, Joyce Armor (Rosemary Forsyth). Though Joyce turns out not to have designs on Arthur, they agree that if he weren't married, something might have happened between them.</p>
<p>Mr. Carlson is a <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a>; he belongs to the local <a href="../../../k/i/w/Kiwanis_Club_c329.html" title="Kiwanis Club">Kiwanis Club</a> as well as the <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotary_Club_af49.html" title="Rotary Club">Rotary Club</a>, attends church every Sunday, and teaches <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_School_35de.html" title="Sunday School">Sunday School</a>. In the episode "Clean Up Radio Everywhere," his socially conservative leanings cause him to befriend the Reverend Dr. Bob Halyers, the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Falwell_c0ca.html" title="Jerry Falwell">Jerry Falwell</a>-esque leader of an organization dedicated to purging "obscene" songs from the airwaves. Shocked at reading some of the sexually suggestive lyrics that are being played on his station, Mr. Carlson orders his employees to follow Halyers' suggestions and not play those songs. But when Halyers delivers another list of songs to ban (including songs WKRP hasn't played yet), Mr. Carlson defies Halyers and refuses to co-operate with him anymore, leading to a boycott of WKRP's sponsors. In the closing scene of the episode, Mr. Carlson reaffirms that he likes Halyers personally, but that he won't submit to censorship, and he warns Halyers that anyone who would be cowardly enough to co-operate with him is bound to change his tune when the political winds shift.</p>
