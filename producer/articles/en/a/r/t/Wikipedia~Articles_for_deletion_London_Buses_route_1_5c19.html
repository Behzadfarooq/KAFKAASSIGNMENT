<dd><b>Comment</b> I found <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Buses_route_474_4218.html" title="London Buses route 474">London Buses route 474</a> just by chance, noticed it had a category of bus routes and didnt look any further. I've noticed a few in the list had been nominated before recently. Had I known about the history of some of the bus routes, then I would have thought twice about it. But still, some articles are riddled with POV, OR or look a bit like buscruft, and would definitely need a cleanup. Therefore, I am going to be <b>withdrawing the nomination for all articles</b>, however, anyone may re-nominate some or part of the route articles that doesn't comply with WP:NOT. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnzy_60da.html" title="User:Arnzy">Arnzy</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/r/n/User_talk%7EArnzy_d126.html" title="User talk:Arnzy"><b><font color="green">(whats up?)</font></b></a></sup> 22:34, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Well, this looks a lot like buscruft. Yup, it does. On the other hand, buried among the pictures of buses is some actual information of genuine merit - the histories of some of the bus routes dating back a fair time, when the routes have been extended and so on. And of course some original research and some gross POV (disabled passengers are quite glad that routes have "succombed" [sic] to low-entry buses). I will need to read each one in detail, it's probably a delete but for once this cruft has saving graces. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 14:30, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Riddled with POV and OR, as JzGuy points out, and just the teensiest bit crufty. However, in among the commentary are hard data that might actually be of use and cannot be easily incorporated in any other article. Some of these routes have been used for 50 or 60 years and must have carried tens of millions of passengers; others (such as the #15) have historical significance because of their use of <a href="../../../r/o/u/Routemaster.html" title="Routemaster">Routemaster</a> buses. I am reassured to see that some of the older articles have strong edit histories, which infers that they will continue to be edited and maintained by a number of different editors. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumansdorpie_a9a9.html" title="User:Humansdorpie">Humansdorpie</a> 15:31, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b> as per Web kai2000. The nomination says "Wikipedia doesnt need a article on every non-notable bus route in London" … but these routes <i>are</i> notable (although some do not assert notability clearly enough in the opening para). Most of them are older than some tube lines, and they are as well known to generations of Londoners as the tube. I am also very unhappy about the repeated re-nomination for deletion of these articles, which does not seem to me to be an appropriate use of the AfD process, since the nominator does not explain what has changed since previous discussions were concluded. I cannot see technical grounds for a "speedy keep", otherwise I would say "speedy". --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>) 16:21, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just out of interest, why transwiki? These pages aren't timetables. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVashti_aa77.html" title="User:Vashti">Vashti</a> 21:51, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> on the whole the articles seem to be pretty well written, with historical info and encyclopedic content. They're not "bus timetables". Yes, some of them could do with NPOV, but that's a case for cleanup, not deletion. The articles do us no harm. <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></b></sup>/<sub><i><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">talk</a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup> 11:19, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
