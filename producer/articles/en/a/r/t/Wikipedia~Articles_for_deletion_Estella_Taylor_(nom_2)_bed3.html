<p>The result was: in this AfD there is a larger majority for deletion than in other AfDs for sub-stub biographies just above this entry on the line of royal succession, but I believe this is more due to the randomness of participation rather than because we're getting close to some magical limit on the line of succession where you're no longer automatically notable. We may need a consensus on what point of the line of succession is automatically notable, but it hasn't been found here. <b>No consensus</b>, defaulting to keep. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:13, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> It's unclear where we draw the line in relation to descendants of royalty. This person is not royal, she does not have the title "Her Royal Highness", or any other title, not even "Lady" or "The Honourable". My own view is that I would be prepared to treat all children and grandchildren of monarchs as inherently notable, which is a fairly low threshhold of notability, but this person is only a great-great-great-grandchild. Wikipedia is not paper, but there are limits. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 17:28, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> - it appears there was a previous decision to merge so it wouldn't have hurt to have done that, but even merging to 25th in line to the throne is pushing it.

Saying <i>Well, she's less notable that Winston Churchill, or Jesus, so let's delete her</i> is plain foolish. With certain positions or titles, you're encyclopaedic even if you accomplish nothing.

<dd>29th in line to the Canadian Throne, for instance (she does have an impressive collection of positions).

<dd>No, it isn't. Notability of a position isn't dependant upon <i>everyone</i> believing the position notable. Since you've ignored most of my argument, it may be hard to grasp.

<dd>This isnt about what the experts in the field of n-th in the line care for, its about whats notable for wikipedia. and im begining to serious believe that you must be one of these "royal expert trackers" as you seem to believe she is notable. <font face="Tahoma" size="1"><small><b><font color="#000000">Matthew Fenton</font></b> (Talk | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">Contribs</a>)</small></font> 16:57, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Right, but in the case where we're establishing notability, your opinion of who's notable just doesn't measure up to the expert in the field. For what it's worth, I would guess there's only a single person who tracks the line of ascention, and you could probly verify I'm not that guy (for example, my IP comes from Canada, but I'd guess the guy who tracks this is English). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 17:00, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have no idea how many he tracks - the reference I found had 39, so I'll accept (at the moment) the notability of the top 39.

<dd>Well, I cut an extreme line at <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> - which is pretty reasonable - and even said that I might support the five millionth in line notable if it were verifiable. But in all cases of progression, some chop is applied. 2nd tallest guy is likely to have an article, and so on. I'm not sure where one <i>ought</i> to draw the line, but the Queen's website choose 39th, so as far as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> goes, that's as far as I can extend it. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:42, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> as I have said previously, there has to be some sort of cut off point beyond which distant relatives of royalty are not inherently notable. Wikipedia is not paper, but there are limits. I previously suggested a cut off point of regarding the grandchildren of monarchs as inherently notable, but not beyond that. Some people are arguing for inclusion on the grounds that this person is in the line of succession to the British throne. This suggests an alternative cut off point. Fair enough, but I would point out that the <i>verifiable</i> line of succession to the British throne, on the British monarchy website, stops at 39 people, most of the wikipedia article on this subject is original research. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 10:43, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
