<p>As a side-comment, I want to ask the PWs: If you guys win this (which looks rather likely, with 28 to keep and about 13 or so to delete), will you concede that Wikipedia is not a part of the "Liberal media conspiracy"?</p>
<p>No one is alleging any conspiratorial, nefarious cabals. The fact is that Wikipedia is liberal, insofar as the people administering it on a daily basis are almost uniformly on the left, and there are very few, if any, conservatives or center-right Wikipedians, or even centrists. All you need do is look at any entry on the Arab-Israeli conflict, American politics, Islam, etc., etc., ad nauseam.</p>
<p>I would use the laudatory Indymedia entry as a reference point.</p>
<p>Jim Whales is perfectly entitled to be a liberal. In fact, every one who moderators Wikipedia is so entitled. This is a free country. I simply think that we should be honest about things.</p>

<p>I did my best to faithfully copy comments to this talk page and to sort delete and keep votes into respective categories, and to be as neutral as possible in doing so. I would appreciate it if someone would check my work (correcting any mistakes is a plus) and put a note here if you checked the page. My count for before and after is 33/14, <i>including</i> votes that were crossed out. I'd also welcome any comments from experienced editors about the wisdom of my actions. I was doing my best to make the AfD readable for others, though I don't know if everyone will see it that way. Thank you.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase02</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 08:02, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I have already un-sorted the votes since <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#Discussion" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion#Discussion</a> specifically says:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Please do not refactor the discussion into lists or tables of recommendations, however much you may think that this helps the process. Both the context and the order of the comments are essential to understanding the intents of contributors, both at the discussion closure and during the discussion. Refactoring actually makes the job of making the decision at the closure of discussion much harder, not easier.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Moving the comments to the talk page is not considered desirable either, but I haven't attempted to fix that yet. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 17:09, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK. I'll have to admit I forgot about the recommendation not to refactor votes into lists, etc., although modifying the disastrous mess of comments seemed like a good idea. Perhaps wikifying them would have made more sense. In any event, I think I could move them back, but I've done enough at this point.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase02</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 17:22, 17 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure what you mean by "wikifying them" in this context. When I think of wikifying, I think of turning a sentence like "Following family tradition, he attended prep school in New England, at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts" to "Following family tradition, he attended prep school in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_30a7.html" title="New England">New England</a>, at <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phillips_Academy_feb0.html" title="Phillips Academy">Phillips Academy</a> in <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andover%2C_Massachusetts_afb9.html" title="Andover, Massachusetts">Andover, Massachusetts</a>." That is, adding Wikilinks to the text, which isn't really needed with regard to most AfD comments/"votes". --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:44, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I meant adding bullets and colons to make clear where responses are, bolding votes, etc. Formatting the way an AfD normally is, but not changing the content or its location. Perhaps wikifying was the wrong word for that.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase02</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 05:06, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you just added bullets and colons to fix the ordering of the comments, or removed line breaks so as to prevent a single comment from spreading over multiple paragraphs, that would most likely have been fine. I've done similar things myself in other AfDs. I don't recommend bolding the votes, though, since the commenters should decide when to do that themselves. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 08:04, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Feel free to start an AfD on both of those entries, then. That is how this process works. I think PW is yesterday's news, and is about as encyclopedic as, say, C.U.B.S. This was Citizens United for Baseball in the Sunshine, and was the group that wanted to keep the lights out of Wrigley Field, and I was a member of it. An encyclopedia entry on C.U.B.S.? Not a chance. The group is dead not even worthy of a mention in the article on Wrigley or the Chicago Cubs. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 03:41, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I didn't create either the Ben Burch page or the White Rose page. The former was created by a CUer. I don't know who created the the latter. I don't find myself to be especially encyclopedic, but three votes, and one on White Rose say otherwise. There is a current AfD on White Rose, and you should feel free to express your opinion there. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 04:10, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is obvious that this is simply a political attempt to delete. Protest Warriors entry is also being vandalized with links to sites that exist as a response to Protest Warrior. I think those forced links are proof enough that Protest Warrior is still valid. Notice that all the left wing articles lack links to opposing opinions yet Protest Warrior is flooded with them. 24.22.103.188 05:44, 15 June 2006</p>

<li>There are PW chapters on at least five separate continents, and numerous countries throughout the globe. Some of them are very active, e.g. those in the U.S. and Australia, some of them are moderately active, such as the chapters in Canada, and some of them are probably defunct. That doesn't mean that Protest Warrior is not a "global organization." There are numerous Protest Warriors in the Armed Forces-deployed overseas-and even one serving in Iraq who engaged in his own PW activism while overseas: <a href="http://www.protestwarrior.com/newsletters/12_25_05.php" class="external free" title="http://www.protestwarrior.com/newsletters/12_25_05.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.protestwarrior.com/newsletters/12_25_05.php</a> 06:49, 15 June 2006 72.68.177.238</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Academic citations? You've got to be kidding me!? Well, when you can post some research papers that relied upon the notable intellectual contributions of Kos Kiddies, DUmmies and participants in rabidly socialist, doctrinaire leftist websites and weblogs then perhaps I'll take that criticism more seriously. How do you measure the historical relevance of an organization that has only been in existence for three years? The SDS hasn't exerted an impact on American politics for at least three decades, and yet I don't see any of you punctilious moonbats and leftbot sticklers arguing for the deletion of that Wikipedia entry.

<li>My concern is not for you, it is for Wikipedia process, which has currently been tampered with by another community's action. Prior to your registering, your contributions, however great they may have been, were not credited to you, and as such, that kind of a claim bears little weight as far as a claim against sockpuppetry goes. I do not necessarily thing that you yourself are a sockpuppet, but it concerns me that there is a thread in the PW forums encouraging members to come here and rig the vote.

<li>Well, I am not from PW, I am a member of Conservative Underground, which was a previous victim to the nominator's politically motivated nominations, and about which he bragged on several liberal sites about how he got our entry deleted.

<p>I think this discussion has come to a reasonable conclusion of keeping the article. Negligble number of "delete" suggestions do not have any evidence as to why the article should be deleted, and most has been refuted by myself or others. <b>Would the admins or mods please remove the Protest Warrior article from the Articles for deletion.</b> <a href="../../../j/d/h/User%7EJdh_24_ff1e.html" title="User:Jdh 24">Jdh 24</a> 21:02, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

This begs the question, why does a lunatic like Burch have administrative privileges?</p>
<p>He's already deleted an entry for Conservative Underground-whose Web traffic dwarfs his insignificant file-sharing site for unpopular liberal talk show hosts-and is now attempting to broaden the scope of his pernicious regime of Marxist censorship.</p>
<p>The fact that his actions are not under stricter scrutiny-and that he has not yet been ordered to desist in his malicious actions-only leads me to question the credibility of the Wiki administration.</p>
<p>Over thirty "keeps" and less than half a dozen "deletes."</p>
<p>Can we consider this issued closed for now?</p>
<p>At least, until Burch Boy goes on his next Stalinist censorship wilding?</p>
<p>In other words, when is the tag coming off?</p>

<p>Point well-taken.</p>
<p>I just think that it's a bit absurd that this has been nominated twice-out of purely malign political motivations-and that both nominations resulted in the same lopsided votes, and yet nothing is being done to punish the offender, i.e. Burch.</p>
<p>72.68.190.24 22:17, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If Burch isn't motivated by his own political views and thinks that websites have no place for their own articles, then perhaps he'd like to be the one to nominate the article for Democratic Underground for deletion. It would be ridiculous to delete either one, but if one is to be deleted, how about a little consistency here? BennyJoe81 22:24, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, I'd like to know how you can justify deletion of this entry-on the grounds that Protest Warrior allegedly does not exert a large enough impact on the broader body politic-and yet at the same time assert that a far-left, little-read, sectarian Marxist journal like In These Times deserves a lengthy entry.</p>

Oh, and such unprofessionalism from a fake "Senior Wiki Master", whatever that is. <a href="../../../j/d/h/User%7EJdh_24_ff1e.html" title="User:Jdh 24">Jdh 24</a> 03:32, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, you're not the only one. NBGPWS has been vandalizing the PW entry and his only activity has been involving the PW entry and discussion pages.

<p>Word of advice, Neo,</p>
<p>A. Learn how to spell. You'll still be a complete ignoramus, but at least you'll be able to pass yourself off as someone who isn't functionally illiterate.</p>
<p>B. You seem to take an obsessive interest in something that is purportedly "dead."</p>
<p>C. Kfir is not a "creationist." Another day, another lie.</p>

<p>The assertion that other conservative groups or individuals are distancing themselves from PW is rubbish.</p>
<p>Protest Warrior has collaborated with numerous patriotic and limited government/right-leaning groups, as illustrated by Operation Liberty Rising, which had participants from a wide array of organizations, e.g. Right March, Bureau Crash, Free Republic, the New York Young Republicans, Log Cabin Republicans, among many, many others.</p>
<p>In New York City we work with Liberal Hawks and the United America Committee constantly, and in other parts of the country PWers join with YAF, Move America Forward, among a host of other patriotic, conservative organizations.</p>
<p>72.82.111.224 03:47, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Argumentative, non-responsive and utterly puerile.</p>
<p>Will another Wiki admin-preferably one who isn't in the 9th grade-please rein in this person, if-and I certainly hope this isn't the case-he actually is a Wiki editor?</p>
<p>72.82.111.224 03:49, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Protest Warrior exists simply as a way for people to garner attention and self-importance by doing nothing more than making people angry. One member explained that joining Protest Warrior "changed his life" and said, "I hate how liberals roll their eyes at us ... like we are children whenever they see our signs."</p>
<p>Something that both mainstream conservative and liberals on campus and nationwide learned long ago is that if you want your ideas to be accepted by adults, you must first act like one. Judging from Protest Warrior's rhetoric and behavior, it is clear that acting like adults is something the group would rather not do."</p>

Not that PW is primarily a Web-based organization-it isn't-but:</p>
<p>Criteria for web content</p>
<p>Web specific-content[3] is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</p>
<p>The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.</p>
<p>This criterion excludes:</p>
<p>Media re-prints of press releases and advertising for the content or site.[4] Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, the times at which such content is updated or made available, a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or content descriptions in internet directories or online stores.</p>
<p>This criterion includes reliable published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations.[5]</p>
<p>The website or content has won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation.[6] The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.[7]</p>
<p>The article itself must provide proof that its subject meets one of these criteria via inlined links or a "Reference" or "External link" section. Even if an entire website meets the notability criteria, its components (forums, articles, sections) are not necessarily notable and deserving of their own separate article.</p>
<p>Could the people advocating deletion please delineate-and provide supporting evidence/documentation-how Protest Warrior fails to meet the aforementioned guidelines?</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I just received an e-mail from a friend of mine.</p>
<p>For the record, this is a conservative member of The People's Cube.</p>
<p><i>KEEP - Such charmingly Stalinist reasoning from those advocating purging PW from a public record: "It is yesterday's news"; "PW consists of very few people whatsoever... only one or two people per counterprotest"; "appears to be a group that has come and gone and nothing it did is worthy of more than a footnote in an encyclopedia"; et omnia generis alia...</i></p>
<p>"Yesterday's news"? Were that the criterion by which entries in *reputable* public records were judged, the Encyclopedia Brittanica would be a single slender volume. The purpose of any encyclopedia is to RECORD FACTS. Failing that, an encyclopedia would have no reason to exist at all. One might as well advocating purging ALL of Wiki. "Yesterday's news"... What a transparently idiotic brain-addled notion to put forth as "reason" in this debate.</p>
<p>Now, the following may be phrased in a tongue-in-cheek manner, but I am deadly serious. Purging the politically inconvenient and annoying from the public record is a tried-and-true method of socialist propaganda. The motto of those who seek to act in this manner is "he who controls the record of the past controls the future" - think about it, and consider the drive to delete PW from WIKI in that light. An election cycle is just warming up, and it seems likely that it shall become quite heated. Prior elections have demonstrated that Protest Warrior is an effective poke in the eye to the mass of folks parroting the usual global socialist talking points. Seldom have "so few people whatsoever" so effectively rained on the kollectiv parades of so many Useful Idiots. That they have ever been relevant earns them a permanent place in the record. That they are likely to be so again merely reinforces their worth, and sheds cold light on the motives of some who would purge them from history.</p>

<p>I haven't accused him of anything of which he is not guilty.</p>
<p>Are you denying that this-as well as the CU afd nomination-were motivated by base political animosities-and had no basis in fact?</p>
<p>He lied about a CU user creating his vanity White Rose advert.</p>
