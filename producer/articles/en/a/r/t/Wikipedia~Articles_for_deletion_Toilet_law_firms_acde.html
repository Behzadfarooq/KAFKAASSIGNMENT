<li><b>Keep</b> This is absurd. Wikipedia's coverage of law is lacking. Why is big law defined yet small law is not defined at all. XOXO, vault, and jdjive which most members of the legal community read is totally ignored on wikipedia. I added Martindale Hubbel peer review which was also lacking. Most members of the legal community are familiar with toilet law--especially in New York and New Jersey where so many are prevalent. It's hard to believe that Wikipedia supports the dearth of information provided for the legal community and practice areas. Also the article about PIP was rediculous and so obviously wrong. Any toilet lawyer could tell you that. But I see noone even trying to edit this. Are any of the people who proposed deleting this even lawyers? I saw one law student and can only say that law students know absolutely nothing about the law.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Njlawyer06 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Njlawyer06_3d97.html" title="Special:Contributions/Njlawyer06">contribs</a>) 02:10, 11 September 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s><small>One "vote" per person, please.</small> The way that your site screens terms is rediculous. First, laywers use Lexis and westaw and this isnt going to show up on google or whatever flavor of the week search engine tool you web geeks decide to use. This is reflected by the quality and amount of legal terminology used on this site, which is sparse at best. Second, the popularity of a term on the internet does not always correspond to its popularity in real life. Most lawyers regularly use the term toilet law. It is prevalently used on legal discussion boards and is as much a part of the legal community as the term Big Law. Third, I also see plenty of slang on wikipedia. Just the other day I was reading about a "nanny state." They even have such absurd categories as 9-11 conspiracies. Yet with all the absurd subjects that do not get deleted because some rube has a web page, basic legal terms and categories are totally ignored. Fourth, why would I update your legal listings if I am going to have a bevy of myopic web geeks censoring my posts. It is especially disheartneing to know that these "editors" have limited and sometimes no legal knowledge. I find it highly ironic that some of your legal terms have glaring errors and omissions. Why is it that the greatest interest on this term is not in verifying that terms are correctly defined; rather the singular focus seems to limit the breadth of terms defined on wikipedia. This sort of snobbery leads to an abridged exchange of ideas and circumvents any exercise int he free exchange of ideas.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Njlawyer06 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Njlawyer06_3d97.html" title="Special:Contributions/Njlawyer06">contribs</a>) 06:09, 11 September 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Keeep</b>This article is certainly not ad hominem. I imagine that whoever wrote that is from a TTT or what we in the legal proferssion call a third teir toilet. Perhaps this Cooley law student should learn is that ad hominem menas against the person. You are using it as a noun when it is an adverb to describe an argument that is made against a person rather than the subject matter itself. What a moronic thing to say and way to butcher the term in this way. The article poses no argument. It merely defines a term that is widely used to describe the type of jobs available to recent law graduates.

<li><b>Keep</b>* It is a term widely used in well-traveled internet forums in the legal community. It is also a term widely used among young attorneys in communications <b>not</b> on the internet. The New York Times and other mainstream media publications routinely publish skewed articles like <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D1FF8355A0C728CDDA00894DE404482" class="external free" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D1FF8355A0C728CDDA00894DE404482" rel="nofollow">http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D1FF8355A0C728CDDA00894DE404482</a> that portray attorney salaries as astronomical, when in fact less than 10% of young attorneys even see six figures. Most young attorneys start in the $40k and $50k range, but no one knows the truth. Wikipedia should keep the free exchange of ideas open, so the truth can be heard. As to the pronouncement that "toilet law" is "juvenile," allow me to point to other terms on Wikipedia like "DVDA," which is a slang term for "double vaginal, double anal," a sex position that has never been used. And as to slang terms not known to the general public, what about "hyphy," which is a term to describe an underground hip hop dance form originating from San Francisco? If "big law" is an entry, so should "toilet law," as "toilet firms" outnumbed BigLaw firms 50 to 1, yet the public readily associates attorneys with names like Skadden, Cravath and Wachtell, when sadly, that association is not based in reality.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 160.79.85.226 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_160.79.85.226_0466.html" title="Special:Contributions/160.79.85.226">contribs</a>) 15:31, 11 September 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, although usage of the term "toilet" to refer to a sub-par firm or institution didn't originate with JdJive. It originated much earlier, years ago in fact, on the Princeton Review boards. There is common usage of this term among the ranking-obsessed overachiever crowd, who are all trying to "gun" for the top schools, top firms, and top credentials (see xoxohth.com - which arose from the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_Review_c6c9.html" title="Princeton Review">Princeton Review</a> boards), although it might seem juvenile to outsiders. If we have commonly used terms on Wikipedia used by other subcultures, such as underground hip-hop and techies (as mentioned earlier), I don't see why we can't keep an open mind about this term. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotoriousbhc_2455.html" title="User:Notoriousbhc">Notoriousbhc</a> 13:08, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
