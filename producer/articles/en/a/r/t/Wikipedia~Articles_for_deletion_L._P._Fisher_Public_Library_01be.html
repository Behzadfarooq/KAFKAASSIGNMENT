<li><b>Merge</b> some of the information. It's more valuable in context - people reading about the town can learn that the library is a historic and well-known landmark. (At least they could if someone edits the material to establish either of those points).

<li>Remember that in New Brunswick, everything is much smaller and more isolated than in the urbanized areas of the United States and even Canada. Therefore, a small town is much more important there than in other parts of Canada.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: That's an argument to keep? Just to be clear, you are saying that instututions that would be non-notable elsewhere are notable if they are in small towns in isolated areas?

<ul>
<li>No one is arguing that articles about notable structures belong in any encyclopedia; the subject under debate is whether or not this is a notable library.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 22:47, 10 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I consider the structure itself, built as a free-library at the bequest of the first mayor of Woodstock, handsomely designed by an architect of regional note (G L Fairweather) and in continuous use since 1912 to be a structure of sufficient significance to merit an article in an encyclopedia alongside such institutions as "<a href="../../../e/v/e/Every_time_you_masturbate%E2%80%A6_God_kills_a_kitten_3af5.html" title="Every time you masturbate… God kills a kitten">Every time you masturbate… God kills a kitten</a>". <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 23:12, 10 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It was built by an architect who doesn't have an article, and normally painters and authors (and by extension architects) don't have articles for each and every creation, especially not for a creator of "regional note". 1912 is positively new by some standards; I understand in Hamburg the new town hall dates from the 13th century. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 00:12, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're absolutely right. And Amsterdam's Niewe Kerk is very very old. However the context for this structure is Woodstock, not Hamburg and the context for this article is Wikipedia, not Encarta. We've got an episode-by-episode guide to "<a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_and_the_City_edf3.html" title="Sex and the City">Sex and the City</a>", detailed descriptions of minor characters from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>, and we can afford articles about significant structures in medium-sized towns. Hey and listen, if you want to merge and redirect, that's fine. But AfD isn't the place to do that. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 13:25, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When I said "normally painters and authors (and by extension architects) don't have articles for each and every creation", I was speaking in the context of Wikipedia. Even great authors don't typically have all their books wikified.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 17:38, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's also true (unless the author happens to set their novels in the Star Wars universe, of course). This building is more than an example of an architect's capability, however. It is also a local institution and landmark, an example of an important style of architecture, a keeper of locally significant archival collections, and, above all, verifiable and NPOV. Notability is a disputed criterion for deletion. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 19:50, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fish and chips shop outside my house is a "local institution and landmark", the building is ex-government built housing, so it was designed by a famous and well paid architect, a provider of nutrition, a place for the community to meet and exchange information on local events, verifiable (features in the University Student Magazine, which has an online edition), and is totally unsuitable for Wikipedia. Given that the criteria you mention above can qualify an otherwise unsuitable fish and chips shop for inclusion, perhaps they are flawed?--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 22:55, 13 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It sounds like the housing estate itself is probably worthy of an article, with perhaps some mention of the policy regarding the mix of retail and housing that was current at the time and a link to the famous and well-paid architect's biographical article. Wouldn't it be nice if we could all keep busy with constructive additions to the encyclopedia rather than going around deleting everything that isn't of any importance to you. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 23:11, 13 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It'd be nice we all kept busy with constructive additions that filled spots in the encyclopedia that were of comparable notability to articles in the encyclopedia, thus creating an encyclopedia that is comprehensive in what it handles, instead of creating articles about things that are just like thousands of others that aren't getting articles.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 23:28, 13 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I assure you, the housing estate is not at all article worthy either&#160;:) And I'm sure we can agree that removing material from Wikipedia that shouldn't be there is just as constructive as putting stuff in that should be there.--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 01:50, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps I can agree with that statement, but I feel that my threshold for inclusion supports an optimistic view of Wikipedia's potential for growth while some of these votes betray an attitude that seems contrary to an "encyclopedia that anyone can edit." It presumes that we should try to "manage" contributions so that the most notable topics are fully covered before we stray into more trivial matters. Of course we can agree that many more notable libraries have yet to be written about, but we do not agree that we should therefore delete what HAS been written about this one. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 03:00, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
