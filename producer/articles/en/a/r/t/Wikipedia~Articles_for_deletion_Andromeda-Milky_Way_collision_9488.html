However, the article definitely needs cleanup. Even at my optimistic I doubt that I "will also be able to see part of the collision occuring" ... in 4 billion years.

<li><b>Delete</b> The scientists who are quoted clearly must have written peer-reviewed articles. This WP article will be very feeble if it can incorporate no references to peer-reviewed literature. (MSNBC.com doesn't count). Someone who looks up this issue on Wikipedia will figure that we are naive followers of everything published in the New Scientist. If appropriate references can't be supplied before the close of this AfD, I'm voting to delete. I'll watch the ensuing debate to see if anyone can remedy the situation. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 22:51, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This is a non-notable subject. No serious references are given to show that this "theory" is even being considered seriously by even a minority of the scientific community. It is idle speculation that was turned into a simple gee-wiz story. According to WP policy, notability is not the same as "newsworthiness". See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>. Beyond this major policy issue, I can not see how this stub can be expanded. There is just NO information that has been published. The proponents for keeping such an article should at least give a list of at least a few peer-reviewed articles demonstrating that serious scientists have published in this domain. The contents of this article could easily be incorporated into another article, and there is no need to have a redirect from this page to, say, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milky_way.html" title="Milky way">Milky way</a> <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 23:44, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Can someone point me to the WP guidelines which call for peer reviewed articles? Why is <a href="../../../m/u/3/User%7EMu301_1a75.html" title="User:Mu301">mikeu</a> not discussing the references to U of Toronto research and NASA. I put some of the critisized articles in the bibliography for additional background to demonstrate the breadth of recognition. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 04:36, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry, I didn't mean to imply that the article needs a peer-review reference to keep. It is just that the reference links only mention the original theory in passing. I'd like to see that original publication to judge the merits of the prediction. The Toronto reference looks more more like a generic computer simulation of what might happen if the galaxies collide rather than something based on telescope observations of the galaxies aproaching each other. The opening statement of this article is likely incorrect. It does not appear that the authors of the Toronto and Harvard links were the ones proposing this theory.--<a href="../../../m/u/3/User%7EMu301_1a75.html" title="User:Mu301">mikeu</a> 05:08, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
