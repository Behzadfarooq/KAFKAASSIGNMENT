<p>Article looks a lot like another essay that is not <i>quite</i> encyclopedic material. Several definite statements are made which are everything but uncontested or uncontestable. For example, the first four sentences contain four statements which would provide enough questions for about 40 books; they can under no circumstances be left like this. Same is true for much of the rest. Maybe there is some usefull stuff in there, but I'd say that if one takes anything out that is questionable, there isn't much left. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 22:36, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)<br />

<li>"Don't delete". This material is encyclopedic in reviewing orginal rsearch on the subject of gender studies in early modern visual culture, a topic not otherwise found in Wikipedia. It organizes the material according to topics in use in the field and summarizes the state of the issues. Gender issues are not well covered with respect to visual culture.

From what I've seen so far, the articles that you and your students have been contributing have been little more than student essays or perhaps journal articles, and certainly not the type of article that would go into a general encyclopedia.

You might also take a look at some of the other online encyclopedias such as <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encarta.html" title="Encarta">Encarta</a> and the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Britannica_0925.html" title="Encyclopedia Britannica">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> to see if they have any similar topics.

<li>Frankly, even though I welcome collaborative efforts and everything, there is a difference between articles and essays, and this is not an article. Weaseling around with the definitions will not help, either - for WP purpose one does not re-define a term, although of course one can concentrate on a particular usage. Then there is the title, which is extremely useless for this article. "Gender construction" could be a much wider topic, after all, the world does not consist of Europe in the Renaissance only. And "why gender" is a question (which is not even remotely answered in the article/essay, either), and a question is usually not exactly a good article title. Not to mention that WP lives from the linking between articles, and who is ever going to link to an article with that title in a text link? Same, BTW, goes for some of the other titles of other articles you choose. Making tons of redirects which, should articles be written which fit those redirect titles much better than this one, will not lead to it any more, and are therefore not exactly helpful, either. Seriously, you missed the point of the Wikipedia with this article (but also with at least parts of the other articles). Articles are articles, and essays are essays. If you want to put essays somewhere, try Wikibook. If you want to edit Wikipedia, you will have to write articles. Oh, and kindly stop that renaming, doubling, and making of redirects. Somebody will have to clean up after you, and the admins have better things to do. Lastly: I did not write this to discourage you from participating in Wikipedia, but to help you become better contributors. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 19:54, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Userfy</b> It's a draft page in a subspace of Why Gender. And redirected from there? What's this? Oh hmm, well anyway, right idea, wrong spot. Move it to the relevant user space, and users can stick it back on the wiki when done. Essays are okay, we can wikify them better later, especially from user space. This page is still being worked on, so it's really REALLY too early to make a call on doing anything else to it anyway. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 20:06, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Userfy</b> is OK with me; presumably, under these circumstances, it would be understood that a subsequent re-creation of the article, in proper form, would not be a candidate for speedy deletion. To the authors: I've looked at this article and a few of the others, not the whole set, but your main problem is that we don't publish original research. A scholarly paper would try to add something new to further the discussion, but an encyclopedia article merely reports on the discussion. I assume some passages in these articles are intended to summarize the thoughts and arguments that have already been presented by experts in the field. In those instances, you should step back one pace from the discussion, and describe the different views or schools of thought, with proper attribution. For an example from a completely different field, see our article on <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steady_state_theory.html" title="Steady state theory">Steady state theory</a>. It tells the reader about a group of physicists, summarizes their beliefs, names the most prominent proponents of the theory, presents its strengths and weaknesses, and assesses its current status among experts in the field. You should be especially careful to avoid stating a conclusion or an interpretation as if it were an observed fact. (A prime example in this article is the beginning of the second paragraph. These statements may be considered self-evidently true in some circles, but Wikipedia articles are written for the general reader, and statements like these should be attributed to the scholars who've propounded them.) <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 08:41, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>If this article is really causing anyone distress, then why not help by posting your own research. This would be much more productive than merely throwing around juvenile put-downs. It is important to realize that regardless if you agree with someone's work, it doesn't discount the effort and time that went into writing it.</p>

<dd>Well, sorry to have to say that, but Wikipedia is <i>not</i> the place to publish original research, no matter how much work went into it. Wikipedia is for articles, not essays. So if people do not want to write articles, then deleting the results of that is not a "juvenile put-down" but simply household cleaning. As I have told you before, if you want to publish essays, or course efforts that are not articles, or the like, do it on Wikibooks (or get a webpage). Oh yes, and sign your comments with -- ~~~~ ; otherwise somebody has to do it for you, as Eric119 had to. Otherwise, after a while, nobody will know who said what. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 01:28, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
