<p><b>Don't Delete</b>. Stumptown (as it's called) is a point of pride for many Portlanders (of which I am one). It's a bit tricky to say why without breaking neutrality. Some factors that contribute to Stumptown's local reputation are the quality of its coffee, the manner in which they purchase and roast their coffee (fair trade, organic, and otherwise), the local celebrity of many of their workers (Stumptown put out a record called "Worker's Comp", featuring musicians that are also employees), and the cultural events (music and art) that they host at their cafes. They are a Portland success story, thriving even as the region faced economic depression. I'm not now, nor ever have I been, affiliated with Stumptown except as a patron. I set up the entry for <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stumptown_Coffee_Roasters_6e50.html" title="Stumptown Coffee Roasters">Stumptown Coffee Roasters</a> as a disambig. of the term <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stumptown.html" title="Stumptown">Stumptown</a>. If adding the above facts will validate the article, I will gladly update. My impression was that, since it was a stub, it could be expanded upon later. -- <a href="../../../o/e/d/User%7EOed_a08a.html" title="User:Oed">Oed</a> 18:01, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>OK, but here's what I'm looking for: There is a bar near where I live called Miller's that is widely regarded in the Detroit area for having the best hamburgers around. Obviously some people will disagree with this statement, but in general many people believe this to be the case. If you look on <a href="http://cityguide.aol.com/detroit/bestburgers/" class="external autonumber" title="http://cityguide.aol.com/detroit/bestburgers/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, Miller's took 1st place. GQ listed Miller's at #8 on their list of "places you have to eat a hamburger before you die". Local newpapers, magazines, etc. have all consistantly ranked Miller's #1 in the area. There is adequate evidence to make a case for notability if someone wanted to write an article about this business and support it's notability. This is the kind of information I'm looking for about Stumptown. Newspaper articles, media, press, etc.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:14, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>OED: Not only would you want to add those facts (looks like you have), but you'd want to cite the reputable sources they came from. You're an editor compiling other people's published facts and opinions; you're not to insert any facts and opinions of your own. If Stumptown coffee has enough local notability that the local paper has written articles about them, and you can cite such articles, that makes this article a keeper. <font color="#2000C0">ikkyu2</font> (<a href="../../../i/k/k/User_talk%7EIkkyu2_7356.html" title="User talk:Ikkyu2"><font color="#00FF00">talk</font></a>) 21:46, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>That makes sense, I will add citations to specific awards and articles in paper publications. -- <a href="../../../o/e/d/User%7EOed_a08a.html" title="User:Oed">Oed</a> 15:30, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Don't Delete</b> I have lived in Portland for most of my life and Stumptown has become very well-regarded and well-known name around Portland. They are held in extreme high esteem for good business practice, excellent coffee, and supporting the community in a variety of ways. These are exceptionally good folks that are held up as a model as what a successful, locally owned socially conscious business can be. --C0r 10:09, 16 February 2006</p>
<p><b>Weak Keep</b> When I went to college at Southern Oregon, a buddy of mine from portland had some Stumptown beans shipped down once a month. It was quite a devotion to a paticular coffee. That said, I can't assert any other notability. -<a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask">AKMask</a> 20:08, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Citations/References Added</b> On the advice of various parties, I've created a "References" section to cite a number of publications which support the local importance of Stumptown.

<ul>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I (disclosure: a Portlander) believe Stumptown Coffee Roasters to be <i>significant</i> and <i>unique</i> enough to qualify being kept, despite its commercial nature. In particular, I think the following reasons describe their signficance:
<ul>
<li>The large number of small, independent coffee roasters in Portland which now exist can be traced back to the success of Stumptown Roasters. Prior to their existence, there were no small, in-cafe roasteries, let alone ones which use small batch, European antique roasters. Now I can name three such cafes within 2 miles of my house, for example.</li>
<li>Stumptown Roasters helped raise the bar for both coffee quality (as grown, roasted and served) and, perhaps more importantly, for treatment of workers. Stumptown not only pays top dollar to workers, but they get many benefits (health and dental), numerous vacation days, get long periods off for such activities as touring with bands, etc. Many cafes have (had to) follow suit. In return they demand quality and expertise from their barristas, thus furthering the quality of the coffee drinks made.</li>
<li>To say the owner and coffee-selector of Stumptown Coffee Roasters is choosy is an understatement. He gives a huge amount of time to making sure both the coffee beans are good and the people who grow them are treated right. He often pays <i>well above</i> the "Fair Trade" standard price of coffee, and very frequently visits the farms the coffee comes from in South America, Africa, and else where. He has set the highest price ever paid per pound for coffee because he thought the farm's work was worth it and deserved it. It is another example of Stumptown raising the bar in the industry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand the desire to see the proof of these things. I will try to do my best to add sources to what has already been put in this article. I simply believe the impact of Stumptown Roasters is far beyond "quality of coffee" (re: good hamburgers). The impact and following of Stumptown is near cultish at this point (for better or worse; an entirely different discussion there). Now I shall attempt to verify some of this info via sources on the web. Thanks for hearing me out. <a href="../../../m/u/m/User%7EMumonkan_0fd2.html" title="User:Mumonkan">Jon Lon Sito</a> 07:48, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>ok, i added a whole bunch of references. (sorry the oregonian one had to be to a google cache, but that article has a substantial amount of reference material and is the biggest newspaper in the state.) the article reads pretty crummy right now, but i hope this reflects the impact stumptown has had on portland. <a href="../../../m/u/m/User%7EMumonkan_0fd2.html" title="User:Mumonkan">Jon Lon Sito</a> 09:35, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
