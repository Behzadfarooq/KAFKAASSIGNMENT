<li><b>Merge</b> Merge with main article. There has been more than enough public discussion of the french riots visavi Islam by well-known authors, writers and columnists to justify a Wiki reference. The article itself is sourced from start to finish using mainstream news reports, experts, opinion polls and research, I therefore see no basis for claiming "unsourced". The burden of proof therefore lies on those making that claim. By the same token, claims of non-NPOV will have to be backed up by legitimate arguments. Any less-than-stellar prose can always be cleaned up, that seems like a minor issue to me. I can't see how that would be grounds for deletion.<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimothyHavelock_9967.html" title="User:TimothyHavelock">TimothyHavelock</a> 07:54, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Question: How is it that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOBA" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOBA" rel="nofollow">DOBA</a> entry qualifies as a valid article, when DSDI's does not??? It seems that there is a great degree of subjective preference regarding inclusion into Wikipedia. Most readers will benefit from the content mentioned within DSDI, whereas the entry for doba contains no substantive value (and certainly does not qualify for notable inclusion).

<li><b>Keep</b> (if it counts, for I'm the guy who removed the speedy) I have just added the list of the recent10 or so of his 24 books, the more important of his awards, and a selection of a dozen reviews for his two most-reviewd books of poetry and book of criticism. I have also added that he holds a named chair at FSU, but I left out the University awards. I do not think the nom for AfD was wrong, because this material was not in the original skimpy article. However, the original article stated he was a professor at FSU; though that is not enough N for WP, it is enough of an assertion so that a speedy was not justified. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 02:17, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>All physical descriptions in this article are verifiable physical characteristics of the photon and any hypotheses referred to on the PhotonStructure.com website were omitted for this reason. I would suggest the so-called experts go back to the standard texts. Next entry: I had deleted the link to the website in response to the accusation of "advertising" it, but after reading SupaSoldier's comments, have decided to reinsert it. This work was first published in Los Alamos in 1979 and encouraged by Carlo Rubbia of CERN at that time (before he got his Nobel Prize). Documentation for this is available. As to refereed articles, the masters thesis describing this concept was an interdepartmental (Philosophy of Science &amp; Physics) research project at the University of New Mexico. George Gamow was instrumental in providing the interaction of the charged sub-quantal components which, incidentally, rotate 360 degrees per cycle providing a resultant charge of zero.

<dd>I'm giving this advice so that you can try to rework it (quickly!) and we can all see if it's salvageable. I think a major problem with the article is that it doesn't make it clear to non-scientists exactly what it's all about. Quite honestly, the article is pretty incoherent at this stage. I've had some courses in physics years ago, so some of the concepts are vaguely familiar. Other concepts are over my head. Here I am trying to reword what I understand of the article. Feel free to use this in the rewriting, and to correct me if I'm wrong.</dd>
<dd>From what I gather, <i>photon structure</i> is an attempt to explain <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wave-particle_duality.html" title="Wave-particle duality">wave-particle duality</a>, or how <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light.html" title="Light">light</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matter.html" title="Matter">matter</a> can show properties of both <a href="../../../w/a/v/Waves.html" title="Waves">waves</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Particles.html" title="Particles">particles</a>, depending on what is being looked at. The article seems to use the word "light" in the broader sense of anything in the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electromagnetic_spectrum.html" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a>, from gamma rays to ultraviolet to visible light to infrared to radio waves. If this is the case, then the photons here must refer to gamma rays.</dd>
<dd>Two observations that form the basis of this theory are:
<dl>
<dd>1. A <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamma_ray.html" title="Gamma ray">gamma rays</a> with an energy level of 1.0216 <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronvolt.html" title="Electronvolt">MeV</a> (so-called "pair formation threshold") will spontaneously split into an <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electron.html" title="Electron">electron</a> and a <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positron.html" title="Positron">positron</a>. (energy or waves becoming particles)</dd>
<dd>2. When an electron and a positron collide, they produce two gamma rays of 0.5108 MeV, each one exactly half of the "pair formation threshold". (particles becoming energy or waves)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>At this point, I can't follow the rest. Am I even close?</dd>
<dd>The article also needs external references that postdate the theory. It sounds as if the theory was published in 1979, right? There should be third-party references to it that are more recent.</dd>
<dd>If these concerns are addressed, and addressed quickly, I may be persuaded to switch back to keeping the article. --<a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETachikoma_4c40.html" title="User:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#8652B9"><i>Kyok</i></font></a><a href="../../../t/a/c/User_talk%7ETachikoma_1ad2.html" title="User talk:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#BA55D3"><i>o</i></font></a> 14:07, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Upon rereading the references, it seems as if the most recent references are by the same person who wrote the Wikipedia article. While I'm not disputing his authority in the matter, I think that Wikipedia requires <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">some sort of third-party published review or mention of scientific theories</a> in order to ensure notability. --<a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETachikoma_4c40.html" title="User:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#8652B9"><i>Kyok</i></font></a><a href="../../../t/a/c/User_talk%7ETachikoma_1ad2.html" title="User talk:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#BA55D3"><i>o</i></font></a> 05:56, 2 March 2007 (UTC) <s><b>Weak keep</b>. I've read over the article, and it doesn't make it clear whether or not <i>Photon structure</i> is a theory or not. I assume that it <i>is</i> a theory meant to address the paradox of <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wave-particle_duality.html" title="Wave-particle duality">wave-particle duality</a>. The article needs extensive rewriting, and more explicit (and better formatted) references to make it understood that <i>Photon structure</i> has been discussed throughout the scientific community, and that it isn't just <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research that hasn't been reviewed by outside analysts</a>. I'm saying "Week keep" for now, in the hope that the article will better explain just what it is talking about, though if these concerns aren't addressed, I will likely choose to merge it with either <i>wave-particle duality</i> or <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photon.html" title="Photon">Photon</a> in the future. --<a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETachikoma_4c40.html" title="User:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#8652B9"><i>Kyok</i></font></a><a href="../../../t/a/c/User_talk%7ETachikoma_1ad2.html" title="User talk:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#BA55D3"><i>o</i></font></a> 05:05, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</s></li>

<dd>Yes, that was my concern as well, which is why I've been trying to point out that proof of outside scientific review is needed, not just what appears to be self-published sources.

<li>I just studied the article, and chased down some references. I concluded that most of the content was unverified assertion or gibberish, and I cleaned it accordingly. However, the concept of "photon structure" is clearly serious. The article should not be deleted for not being notable. Due to lack of content, a redirect is a good idea. Given the image, and the method for study, perhaps the appropriate target is <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electron-positron_annihilation.html" title="Electron-positron annihilation">Electron-positron annihilation</a>. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokeyJoe_6cd1.html" title="User:SmokeyJoe">SmokeyJoe</a> 03:18, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Electron-positron annihilation is not an approprite redirect; photon structure happens to be studied in e-p colliders, but not in annihilations---you'd do equally well looking at it in non-annihilating e-e colliders, if such existed. I'd stick with <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photon.html" title="Photon">photon</a>, where it'd be reasonable to write a few sentences about it. <a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBm_gub_59c9.html" title="User:Bm gub">Bm gub</a> 04:20, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The reason you don't "get it" is that it is an <b>incorrect</b> crackpot model of the photon. The author thinks that the photon is made up of a bound electron-positron pair, that this explains e+e- pair production and annihilation, and that it photon wavelength relates somehow to some sort of magnetohydrodynamic waves in plasma. Please stop thinking of this as a badly-written article about photons. It's actually a reasonably clear article about a work of pseudophysics. <a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBm_gub_59c9.html" title="User:Bm gub">Bm gub</a> 15:10, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>“incorrect crackpot model” and “pseudophysics” are not reasons for deletion. Wikipedia covers pseudoscience, discredited or obscure theories, as long as they are attributable. It is unfortunate that the article appears to describe what the “author thinks” as opposed to what the secondary sources describe, but we can try to encourage him to change his style. There are sources corresponding to the title, although its not clear how the article content connects to the title. A second new contributor has now expressed an intention to improve the article. We should give them time to do this, and failing the emergence of attributable and sensible content, merge the article with photon. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokeyJoe_6cd1.html" title="User:SmokeyJoe">SmokeyJoe</a> 00:10, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Strong Delete, and prevent recreation until further notice</b> Lets ignore the fact that right now all this page is is a messed up incomplete template. <a href="../../../s/a/w/Saw_IV_7686.html" title="Saw IV">Saw IV</a> hasn't even come out yet. We don't know the plot about it yet or who will be in it or whatever. Yet people are starting to make articles about the <i>fifth movie</i>?!

The same thing happened with Saw IV's article in that people kept on starting up topics so it had to be deleted and prevented from recreation.

<li><b>weak keep</b>::comment: actually it is a term. Its a military term. After an enemy is defeated and they are fighting from small areas within its called 'pockets of resistance' Though the article makes it sound as if its a new term for Iraq from the media. Its been around for years. Commonly used to describe holdouts in island hopping in WWII.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Far too generic to be worthy of an article, since it's not a technical military term, just a figure of speech which happens to have a military application.

<li>Not so sure about that. "Pockets of resistance" means small encircled groups of regular army soldiers, bypassed after an enemy offensive (short time frame ... days or perhaps a couple of months), probably relying on conventional tactics. "Resistance movement" means an army of irregulars primarily based among and recruiting from the civilian population, perhaps lasting for many years and relying on guerrilla tactics.

<li><b>Support</b> this proposal. Seems sensible. One significant difference between the two is that 'pockets of resistance' is often used to refer to guerrila and insurgent activity, where there is short, or long periods where the enemy's location isn't really known, except that they're somewhere in the area.

Even the merge votes here cannot agree which article to merge to. Also, the article could be expanded a little. Possibly the right method is to have an article on <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tolkien_family.html" title="Tolkien family">Tolkien family</a> (a redirect at the moment), and put Baillie, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Tolkien_12ea.html" title="Simon Tolkien">Simon</a> and <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Tolkien_0bea.html" title="Tim Tolkien">Tim</a> there (plus other minor members of the family, such as <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edith_Tolkien_6cfc.html" title="Edith Tolkien">Edith Tolkien</a> [though she currently has, and maybe should keep, her own article] and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Tolkien_5963.html" title="Arthur Tolkien">Arthur Tolkien</a> (ditto, as for Edith), though <a href="../../../m/a/b/Mabel_Tolkien_0907.html" title="Mabel Tolkien">Mabel Tolkien</a> is a redirect), along with the family tree, and change existing uses of this family tree template into link to the family article. Christopher Tolkien and J. R. R. Tolkien need their own article. The others are more borderline, and a full family article would be a natural place to include the family tree and add what is known about the other members (such as Tolkien's brother, Hilary). So I'd say keep or create the article <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tolkien_family.html" title="Tolkien family">Tolkien family</a> (currently a redirect to <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tolkien_Estate_8efd.html" title="Tolkien Estate">Tolkien Estate</a>). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 09:43, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> After viewing the edit history and seeing a majority of this article come from one person over the course of ten months, the aforementioned Google hits, and the lack of any really notable information in the article. Other than achieving academic administrative successes and the works he has written (which the article has not specificed any <i>notably</i> major performances, except for the one in Virginia) I am swayed to vote to delete.

<li>Technically, the # of ghits is not an indicator of notability or lack thereof. But speaking from my prior experience with articles at AfD (and I'm not claiming that you do not have equal or greater experience--I've not even viewed your contribution history), 1100 hits is actually rather good.

<li><b>Keep</b>. As the creator of this article I've watched it be plagiarized by MSM reporters since I posted it--which demonstrates relevance and need as well as a few less savory things. DG shaped the Fine Arts program at BJU. He was dean for forty years and has a large building named for him while still alive. Hardly your average academic. Much of the information I used to write the article came from a print history of BJU rather than the Greenville newspaper.--<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Foxe_d99d.html" title="User:John Foxe">John Foxe</a> 11:22, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak delete</b>: The fame and importance of the individual seems to rest within a narrow geographical and occupational area. I.e. he's important in South Carolina and among administrators at religious colleges. Otherwise, he does not appear to have made a significant dent in public fame or public affairs.

Furthermore, the very nature of sports fansites, means that rival boards entails that they will be puff pieces and likely will soon get into edit wars. I think this is not the reason that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> exists.

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't buy the slippery slope argument by the nominator. Because we don't have more notable sites doesn't mean this isn't notable on it's own. It has many references by third party national sources. A potential for vandalism is not a reason to delete. Should we delete George W. Bush since it's highly vandalized (although not currently, since it's protected...)? --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 15:50, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Article seems to indicate that it is more than just a fan website. Charity work and activities beyond the scope of the internet seem to establish it more as a club/organization, and given the amount of sourcing and references available, seems to meet inclusion standards. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 15:57, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: "More than a website" is incorrect. It is the function of sports fansites to organize get togethers, hold raffles, and offer promotions. Therefore, that this one has succeeded in getting hoo-rah parties and the like is not testimony to its surpassing "college sports fansite" status, but merely that it succeeds in fulfilling that status. Given that it's a fansite for a very large U. with an extremely high sporting profile, that would be assured. The question is whether this is appealing to people <b>outside</b> of the fan world. The answer to that seems to be "no." Are visitors to Tarheelblue (for UNC Chapel Hill, and a gigantic site) going to go to Hornsfans for some reason? Are Georgiadogs.com (even bigger) visitors going there? Are Buckeye fans going to go there to debate? This is just a website, and being #13 among college fan sites fits with the college's rankings. &lt;shrug&gt; An everyday site doing an everyday job. <a href="../../../u/t/g/User%7EUtgard_Loki_9cc9.html" title="User:Utgard Loki">Utgard Loki</a> 18:31, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - if we are going to argue that only fans of the team will visit the article, we might as well argue the same thing about the school athletic article, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Longhorns_7b8f.html" title="Texas Longhorns">Texas Longhorns</a>, or about the school itself, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Texas_at_Austin_7a6d.html" title="University of Texas at Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a>. For that matter, does anyone outside of <a href="../../../a/p/_/Ap_Lei_Chau_fc9c.html" title="Ap Lei Chau">Ap Lei Chau</a> care about that island? People visit articles to learn about the subject. That includes people with a keen interest as well as people with a passing interest. It is entirely reasonable to believe that people interested in discussion boards will browse articles belonging to such a category. It is also reasonable to assume that a football fan will visit articles related to competing teams, etc. There is virutally no Wikipedia article that will be of interest to every single person in the world. This article in question is useful to enough readers to make it valuable, and it is well sourced. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 21:26, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Longhorns_7b8f.html" title="Texas Longhorns">Texas Longhorns</a>]. The article appears to me to be in large part a puff piece ( though some criticisms have been added ), and, references notwithstanding, this is not appropriate for us here. Please remember that popularity is not the same thing as notability: there are numerous fan websites, and the article provides no reason to believe that this one does anything that its peers don't. It is already a well-established principle here that audience size is only a very minor factor in consideration of notability. Finally, inspection of the references suggests that these tend simply to mention the website in passing, and are not about the website per se. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 14:22, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Lack of reliable sources proving notability. eillusionist.com is actually somewhat of a laughing stock within the magician industry for its self-promotion, and should not be relied on for anything.

<li>Eh... not a particularly constructive comment here. Please calm down and try this "debating" thing ocassionally. =) Anyway, the sad fact is, Wikipedia is being swamped with stuff about websites, and we <i>have</i> to set the bar somewhere. Regrettably, we get so many articles about apparently irrelevant sites that we have had to implement some dangerously huge obstacles and see what sticks - regrettably, it may mean that "sort of famous <i>in their own circles</i>" sites get axed, which is a shame but setting the bar is very difficult. Anyway, it is also my opinion that websites make lousy article material <i>in general</i>, unless there's something absolutely remarkable about them; Nectarine is, um... basically just a net radio station. I don't really see how this article could be expanded a lot; it's certainly worth putting it as an external link in some article or like. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 13:29, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The high school is definitely existent. However, this article is completely fact based. From looking at the history, it looks like a particular IP began to invalidate the article with obnoxious comments that brought about the speedy deletion discussion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by DizzleDixon (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DizzleDixon_1244.html" title="Special:Contributions/DizzleDixon">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I can't find a good version of the article to revert this to. Much of the article seems to be devoted to satirical and unsourced negative comments about the school; it would be better to warn the vandals, delete the article, and allow the creation of a more serious-minded article later. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 05:05, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep,</b> as the school is legit and as deserving of its own article as any of the other 46,000 high schools on here. But obviously it's full of schoolboy crap. I might delete everything but the infobox and a sentence with a stub tag, with hopes that someone will add legit info later.

<li>Those "all stay or go" comments don't mean much.

If you're referring to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a>, that doesn't seem to cover villages, towns and counties where notability is hardly ever asserted and deletion nominations are hardly ever made. (But if I'm missing some other rule or guideline, please point it out.) If a rule for schools exists, maybe some of the Wikipedians who are voting to keep the schools articles, including me, should start participating in the discussions at those guidelines talk pages, because there are plenty of us and Wikipedians, after all, make the rules. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 18:49, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I had some time on my hands and (inspired by Realkyhicks' cleaning up the page) I was interested in seeing what the article would look like with statistics from the "Great Schools" Web site, which has state Department of Education statistics on schools. I also included a list of clubs. It isn't much and doesn't address any notability issues, but you get a picture of a school that, despite some advantages (teacher experience and education, higher-than-Florida-average wealth) is not very good academically. If some people in that community who don't pay attention to the news down there happen to see the article, it seems to me it would be useful to them. Why is this relevant to our deletion discussion? Turn the question around: We're the one's who should be relevant to our readers' concerns (while staying within the context of an encyclopedia/almanac). Our encyclopedia is better off if it's relevant to some of the concerns of communities. What we do with community articles (on villages, towns, cities, counties) which don't need to assert notability, we should do with high school and school district articles: present a good encyclopedic description of the subject that people in the community can use. We can do it like no one else can. We should do the same thing for all hospitals and for the same reasons. We can get verifiable information on these institutions, and they're intensely, overwhelmingly important to their communities. I doubt any other types of institutions are as important (libraries, elementary and middle schools, fire departments), but if a good case could be made, I'd want articles on those as well. There's a limited number (even though it's vast, but Wikipedia is vast), we can still have standards for articles, and Wikipedia is none the worse for them, in fact, Wikipedia is better for having them. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 18:24, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I strongly disagree with this sentiment. I believe that Wikipedia is worse for the inclusion of this article. If we continue down the route that this poster advocates, we will end up with articles on pretty much everything - schools, hospitals, post offices, roads, churches, shopping malls, broadcasting towers, et cetera, ad nauseam et ad infinitum. Of course this is great if you want Wikipedia to be a collection of indiscriminate information - a kind of Google, with people editing the directory entries for ease of reading - but it does mean that Wikipedia will cease to be an encyclopedia under any commonly understood definition of the term. I certainly wouldn't see any point in working on this project if it were to evolve in the way that <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> wishes, and my hunch is that many of our best editors ( from which category I explicitly exclude myself ) would feel the same. The idea that "all must have prizes" was discredited in the educational establishment by the 1980s, at least in the UK, and surely it must be time for us to realise that where the "prize" is a Wikipedia entry the same is true for schools. If everything is "notable", nothing is. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 14:40, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response:</b> WMMartin, although we disagree, I respect your point of view and have no doubts about your sincerity, although I think you'd benefit by rereading my comments above. I think it's easier to respond point by point:
<ol>
<li>"this sentiment" — I'd call it a "point of view", it's not just emotional, but considered.</li>
<li>"we will end up with articles on pretty much everything" — as I said in so many words, I would limit wholesale acceptance of local institutions to those that have a powerful influence on most members of a community. That leaves out most schools other than high schools (I would also include private high schools for other reasons). That criterion would certainly include all hospitals but leave out the other institutions you mention: post offices, roads, churches, shopping malls, broadcasting towers, unless they could show a similar powerful influence on a broad swath of the population.</li>
<li>You can include any of these already if you find two newspaper articles focusing on them, correct? And it doesn't matter how small the independent publication or source is, as long as it's considered reliable, correct? (This is the way I read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a>, perhaps I missed something.) And do you seriously doubt that <i>any</i> high school in the country, no matter how small or obscure, could meet that criteria? The effect of this criterion is to hurt schools in rural or lower-income areas that don't have newspapers with good enough advertising revenues to support much of a Web presence. I live in one of the wealthiest areas of the country. My town of about 18,000 people has two weekly newspapers full of ads, daily newspapers in each of two small cities bordering the town and a glossy magazine in addition to coverage it occasionally gets from other publications. This wealth alone ensures that there are reliable independent sources about nearly every institution in town. We can't eliminate all Wikipedia biases, but we can short-circuit some of them, and this is one, regarding high schools and hospitals, that should be short-circuited. Although all high schools get newspaper coverage, the poorer, more rural schools would have to wait longer to get Wikipedia articles as editors for those articles have to do a lot more scrambling to get the information. And to what purpose? Nearly every high school has its own Web site, and it's hard to imagine that those Web sites do a lot of exaggerating about the schools, so they provide some basic information to start building an article on. We've also got state statistics on each school, which is the thing schools would be most inclined to lie about if they were going to lie. What other purpose is a "Notability" criterion if not to establish that something exists and is important to enough people that it's worth having an article on? Why would you doubt that high schools wouldn't meet this criterion?</li>
<li>"Wikipedia will cease to be an encyclopedia under any commonly understood definition of the term" — As an open-source, Web-based, electronic encyclopedia it is already a new thing. In subject matter it already includes topics that would not go into other general encyclopedias -- Pokemon characters, gay porn stars, video games (we've all got our own list of outlandish types of articles, I'm sure). So your idea that Wikipedia will "become" a grab bag of odd articles is too late in the game. No open-source project like this can avoid popular taste unless it gets much tighter with its criteria for article inclusion — and what makes you think that's going to happen? The milk is spilled, the horse is past the barn door, the toothpaste is out of the tube. It is also inevitable that a nonpaper encyclopedia would expand to cover details that paper encyclopedias just didn't have the economic ability to cover.</li>
<li>"All must have prizes" — You won't find anything I've said that supports that idea. I love my home town in Connecticut (well, at least I like it), but when I read that it was the home to the head of the state Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s and a center of Klan activity, I included that in the article about it. I regularly have to check the article because that bit of information has often been removed by anonymous editors, some of whom make comments in which, I swear, you can just hear the howls of pain. An NPOV article, particularly as we get more information about the subject, is often far from a prize. I'm particularly suprised you would make this statement in a deletion discussion about Cape Coral High School. As I mention above, the statistics I put in the article show the school has embarassing problems.</li>
<li>"I certainly wouldn't see any point in working on this project if it were to evolve in the way that <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> wishes, and my hunch is that many of our best editors ( from which category I explicitly exclude myself ) would feel the same." Why? And why leave if post offices are covered when you haven't already left since pokemon characters and porn stars are covered? What is the reasoning behind this idea that separates it from mere sentiment?</li>
<li>There are at least two major differences between Pokemon and porn star articles on the one hand and articles on high schools and other local institutions on the other — the local institutions (a) will likely last over time, meaning that the articles will get many more readers long after the P. and p.s. articles are forgotten; (b) the latter category is one readers will find useful in non-trivial ways, including as a source of negative information that the institutions themselves will hardly ever put on their own Web sites and which might be difficult to find elsewhere.</li>
<li>"If everything is notable, then nothing is" I agree, but expanding automatic notability to high schools and hospitals doesn't mean everything else has to be included. We will always have some boundaries to defend. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 17:41, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I believe that now we should focus our ideas collectively, to help in fairly representing this school with accurate data and up to date information. Its amazing that a group of silly school kids have uninherently helped there school by aiding in disseminating information that is relavent to their school. I would request that if anyone does intend to add to this article, that it be as up to date as possible.

Since deleting them all won't happen, there's no reason to delete this. This information is not told in the parent articles so it needs its own.

<dd>Chandra Davis is her real name. London Charles is her stage name. If you read the notes I put in the table on the Flavor of Love page, you would have known that. The funny thing I've noticed is that people have been so quick to shut this page down, but the other winner, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicole_Alexander_13db.html" title="Nicole Alexander">Hoopz</a>, has had a page that has never ever been in danger of AFD. I just find that a funny double standard. Going back and trying to AFD it now just seems spiteful. If one can be kept, why not the other? Hoopz is not more well-known than this girl. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Halterman_044d.html" title="User:Mike Halterman">Mike H.</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Halterman_f64b.html" title="User talk:Mike Halterman">I did "That's hot" first!</a> 06:26, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hoopz was up for AFD, and I did "vote" delete. Not my point. Why do we need an article for her real name, and an article for her stage name? <a href="../../../c/k/e/User%7ECkessler_bf72.html" title="User:Ckessler">Ckessler</a> 06:27, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>At the time you did an AFD, there was not an article for her stage name. It had been redirected. I had simply changed the redirect to her real name and not Flavor of Love. So at the time of the AFD, there was only one article about her.

An editor asked the following question at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_William_Sledd_%282nd_nomination%29_60f2.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/William Sledd (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/William Sledd (2nd nomination)</a>:
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>Then tell me what makes these youtubers so special. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Dorm_Boys" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Dorm_Boys" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Dorm_Boys</a> Why do they rate a wikipedia article, but not William Sledd? I demand an answer. James Allen Starkloff 75.89.17.161 23:14, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
So, I looked at the article to try and find an answer. I noticed that it asserted more notability than did the Sledd article, but at the same time there were <i>no</i> reliable sources cited. The article states that "[t]he Back Dorm Boys received mainstream media attention in the United States through The Ellen DeGeneres Show" but provides no further information, and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22back+dorm+boys%22+%22ellen+degeneres%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22back+dorm+boys%22+%22ellen+degeneres%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">this Google search</a> yields little. Another claim, that the pair were signed by <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorola.html" title="Motorola">Motorola</a>, is similarly <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22back+dorm+boys%22+%22motorola%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22back+dorm+boys%22+%22motorola%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">difficult to confirm</a> with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and a marginal assertion of notability anyway.

<li>Keep, straight up. It makes no sense, no matter how any of you look at it, to merge, or delete this. This is not, I repeat, not redundant. First the PSN is a community experience, where as the PS store is just that, an online shopping mart for games and other entertainment media. The PS Store, will soon vastly eclipse the size of the PSN page here, and honestly the subject matter in each are leagues different. PS STORE, PS NETWORK, = 2 different situations completely.

<li>Like I said: I'm not really sure what counts as a reliable source. But intuitively, I wouldn't have regarded a webcomic and its blog (which isn't even directly cited as a source) as a reliable source for Wikipedia. (Disclaimer/Clarification: I really, really like webcomics and follow 25+ webcomics regularly, but I somehow don't see them as reliable sources to cite in an article about an online marketplace. If there is a ruling declaring PA as a reliable source, please show it to me, I'm genuinely interested since Wiki Rulings often enough surprise me.) --Sid 3050 16:35, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I like the art, but the references are just self promotional. We don't see independent critical review of his work. I may like his work (I do), but we don't see unrelated sources with some stature offering an assessment of the work. His work hasn't come to the attention of publications in the business of offering comment on visual art. I think that is what notability is about. The Chamber of Commerce of Woodstock are not experts on art, are they? And their real business is promoting anything that involves economic activity in their area. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 17:00, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I see nothing wrong with that. His references look good on the surface: Canadian Art, Montreal Gazette, CBC, Global-TV, these are all more than legit. However, there is no specific info on this, publication dates, air dates and so on. But giving the article time to get these in order sounds reasonable. If they don't check out (i.e. just not found or provided, or made-up outright), then put it up for deletion again. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 19:48, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response:</b> You are right that this article does need better referencing, however as the person who pretty much put this whole thing together, I can tell you that I used not only clear markers in the texts themselves, but many secondary sources such as Keith Topping's unofficial guides which place books in the timeline, and the Buffy/Angel episodes in relation to each other, a Dark Horse Comic timeline that was at the Dark Horse site, 'Historian notes' at the begining of many stories, as well as comments in interviews by authors and script-writers about how stories relate to each other. Putting together this article was a <i>lot</i> of work, and I'd really appreciate if people allowed it time to reference itself rather than deleting because they assume its based on original research because of the current lack of clear referencing. -- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 16:59, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Why does it matter who wrote it? The article should be judged on its merits.

<li><i><a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a></i> is an essay and not a reason for deletion.

<li><i><a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">Unsourced original research</a>.</i> Please note that this is a chronology and <i>all</i> of the entries are blue-links, so the sources are likely <i>located in</i> those articles.</li>

<li>Just to comment a second, the practical difference between this index article and an article indexing just the Buffy-related books is that this article is attempting to organize information related to the Buffy franchise across all media types (books, television, comics, films, etc). It seems to me to be a fairly useful sounding means of organizing the large amount of information available on the franchise, and places all these varied articles in some sort of chronological perspective for the reader. Personally I think this sort of indexing also sounds like a possibly useful idea for similar cross-media franchises, such as Star Wars or Star Trek, etc. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:00, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree, Pax. The argument that "policy might not actually say this violates anything, but in my opinion it should" doesn't hold water. Either it breaks the policy <i>as written</i> or it doesn't. There's a good reason the words "cruft" and "trivia" don't appear in WP:NOT, and that's because there is not strong consensus on how or when to delete articles based on those criteria or even how to properly define those terms. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:54, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> as most of the reasons for deletion are either invalid or little more than veild ad homium attacks. Furthermore there are many, many, many other <a href="../../../f/i/c/Category%7EFictional_timelines_91af.html" title="Category:Fictional timelines">fictional chronologies</a> on Wikipedia. If one is voted for deletion on grounds that can be applied to all of them, then ALL of them need to be deleted. Singling out a single article for deletion by processes that can be used to delete an entire category of articles is just wasteful. The Simple precidence of other chronologies is a good piece of evidence to keep this one.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Black Falcon's reasoning. Can always been cleaned up, etc. but AFD is not a place to judge content. The claim that it's not sourced doesn't make sense because every entry includes the title of the book or other work from which the information is taken, and most of these works have their own Wikipedia articles from which (in theory) info such as ISBN and publisher can be obtained rather than doubling the size of the chronology articles with bibliographies. I do have a concern regarding the images which, under Wiki's increasingly draconian free use rules probably aren't kosher anymore.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Although it may appear like original research and many will argue for deletion because they think it is, I can see why people would think it might be OR. However there is actually <b>no original research in this article. All it needs is clearer referencing.</b> Many sources were used, including Keith Topping's unofficial guides which place books in the timeline, and the Buffy/Angel episodes in relation to each other, a Dark Horse Comic timeline that was at the Dark Horse site, 'Historian notes' at the beginning of many stories, as well as comments in interviews by authors and script-writers about how stories relate to each other and more. As well as clear markers in the texts themselves.

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> The nominated articles serve as source material for a navigational tool for Buffy-related articles; I think the <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> policy would successfully argue against its removal, as right now Wikipedia is served by hundreds of articles on Whedon's universe that are currently quite easy to navigate. <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> is a <i>very</i> dicey rule, but it can support this as well: ignore rules <i>when doing so improves Wikipedia.</i> Does <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> grant utter immunity to the chronology? Of course not. But it does support the suggestion that facile navigation between tightly related articles does indeed improve Wikipedia, and leaving a article navigation system in place long enough to grant editors enough time to properly reference the article serves Wikipedia much better than ripping it out (presumably userfying it in the process), which would require the rebuilding of linkage and structure once a referenced version of the article was posted. Witness how Esperanza, instead of being deleted, took instruction from its MfD and came out of it a better organization. This can be done here. Lack of references is a problem that can be resolved by editors with an interest in Joss Whedon's writings providing references, and does not need to be resolved by removal of the material. To remove the material and disrupt the very nicely prepared navigation system already in place is disruption simply to serve a point, a practice strongly discouraged by <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.

<li><a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> suggests discussion is better than unilateral action. The disruption to Wikipedia would be the resultant damage to the various navigational templates used in each and every Buffy/Angel/etc. article and the sheer manpower required to either eliminate the navigational templates altogether and/or re-repair them once a referenced version of the chronology is available; the point you would be trying to make is Wikipedia's policy of articles being referenced (I do not suggest malicious intent); the preferred method of discussion-based resolution would be withdrawal of the AfD (or failure of same) in order to allow Whedonverse editors enough time to properly reference the chronology. Moreover, allowing editors time to address problems in an article, instead of deleting it outright, (a) is a common practice in AfD, and (b) in no way contravenes core policies such as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. — <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhedonette_62db.html" title="User:Whedonette">Whedonette</a> <small>(<a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWhedonette_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Whedonette">ping</a>)</small> 15:26, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep (might need some cleanup)</b> First of all, references to "cruft" can pretty much be ignored - there's no cruft in policies or guidelines. Second, this appears to be the equivalent of a list article for an episode index for a television series. The main difference I can see between this and an episode index is that this article covers multiple related products in the same franchise. Since episode lists for television series are permitted, I don't see a problem allowing for this sort of cross-product list as well since it probably would help interested readers more efficiently navigate the related articles. The main short-coming, which appears to be correctable, is that currently the references for the "in world" dates and other information are buried in the corresponding articles. However, since those references almost certainly exist, and can be appended to this article, I'm for keeping the article in place and allowing for its contributors to clean it up a little by providing some in-article sourcing and removing any statements that might not be verifiable. Note that the article does <i>not</i> appear to be an extended "plot summary", and does serve as a useful index for a larger multi-article topic, thus not violating the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> section on Plot Summaries or violating <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:50, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>99% of the sources on the BttF timeline article are the BttF films themselves.

<li><b>Delete</b>, a load of mostly original research about pop culture. Go put it on BuffyWiki. Wikipedia should confine itself to discussing the real-world importance of fiction, and not spend a great deal of effort on documenting the fictional universes found within pop culture; such content is far better suited for special purpose projects. With respect to Buffy, that means that perhaps a discussion on how the name "Xander" has pervaded popular culture is in order, but there is no encyclopedic purpose to a detailed chronology of the fictitious Buffyverse. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 05:08, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>A lack of sources is not proof of original research. Original research is something that we as editors have made up ourselves and requires that information is <i>inherently unverifiable</i>. For instance, a claim of membership in a truly secret organisation is original research. An unsourced claim that Tony Blair is the PM of the United Kingdom is not OR. Despite that, a number of references are provided <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_episodes_594e.html#References" title="List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes">here</a>. Moreover, the information could be sourced using primary sources (e.g., "The WB Buffy promo, "History of the Slayer", states specific dates"). The article may have issues of verifiability, but it does not meet the criteria for original research. I hope this clarifies my initial response.

<li><b>Keep</b> The nominator is incorrect in three respects:
<ul>
<li>It is not a "single... line" but used several times in the movie (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Transformers%7E_The_Movie_6230.html" title="The Transformers: The Movie">The Transformers: The Movie</a>).</li>
<li>It is not a "throwaway line" but is a movie joke that comes back to the main characters.</li>
<li>It is also not a "throwaway line" because it has had huge impact on the Transformers community, on a par with a major (though not leading) character, e.g. like <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jetfire.html" title="Jetfire">Jetfire</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobinson_weijman_cd79.html" title="User:Robinson weijman">Robinson weijman</a> 07:41, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Even if <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobinson_weijman_cd79.html" title="User:Robinson weijman">Robinson weijman</a> is correct with his comments, I still don't think it's a notable subject worty of it's own article. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules1975</a> 09:52, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, it cannot. The line is drawn at <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">prohibiting original research</a>. Many science fiction topics have already been written about outside of Wikipedia in books, articles, and papers about science fiction. To make a case for having an article on this aspect of a fictional universe, you must provide sources that demonstrate that writing about it is not original *research. Where are the books, papers, journal articles, or other published works outside of Wikipedia that have analysed this greeting, its spellings (in the games and by fans) and its occurrences?

<p>List is not particularly useful, and is the only list for NHL players regarding race (ie. there are no lists for black NHL players). Also, many of these are not verified, and are "Asian" judged by looks or surnames (the articles themselves don't give sources or even indications of race).</p>
<p>A similar deletion request was posted the other day, for a category for Asian NHL players (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_February_28#Category:Asian_NHL_players" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2007_February_28#Category:Asian_NHL_players" rel="nofollow">here</a>). -→<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuchanan-Hermit_699c.html" title="User:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="#FF8233"><b>Buchanan-Hermit™</b></font></a>/<a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBuchanan-Hermit_6a2c.html" title="User talk:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="#948663" size="1"><b>?!</b></font></a> 06:39, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> the band definitely meets the requirement here: "Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country, reported in reliable sources." by doing TWO tours of the US (and one of the West Coast of the US), as well as touring New Zealand and Australia (though I know the article does not YET mention the last two). As well, the article lists two independent write ups of the band that are not press releases or anything like that. pointing out that the first four google hits are a myspace, wiki entry, and flickr accounts seems irrellevant to me. of the 2,240 hits that come up, of COURSE the first ones are going to be a wiki entry (most of the google searches i do list a wiki entry first), and a bands own page, as google lists by relevancy, and by having a bands page linked from other pages it automatically jumps up in "relevancy" in google searches. as well, i'd like to know what makes an article's source "non-trivial". i'd ask A1octopus to define that in a NPOV way. <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurderbike_fb35.html" title="User:Murderbike">Murderbike</a> 22:14, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

The following is a formal statement to Wikipedia from the McElroy Gang organization:
<blockquote>
<p>The problem is that I keep trying to update the page with more credible sources, yet while I'm editing the page with more credible sources, the Wikipedia officials keep deleting it. I fail to see how allowing this page to exist in its draft states is detrimental to the overall credibility of Wikipedia. I have listed in the talk pages several times that the organization is continuing to work on making the article more reliable. Moreover, if the article as as inconsequential as the editors insinuate, then it is unlikely that the article will be seriously referenced until the article is complete. The McElroy Gang organization firmly believes that Wikipedia is an amazing and innovative breakthrough in the way knowledge is shared and as of right now, the organization also believes that this editing and drafting process is fulfilling the purpose of Wikipedia by facilitating an environment for the members of the organization to share information that can later be referenced to the public. That being said, I would like to ask the Wikipedia organizations officials to please bear with us during this drafting process.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> so basically what you're saying is if a band doesn't have a .com, .org, .net...ect site they're not a notable band. so, if a band doesn't have a website behond a myspace and purevolume that automatically makes them not notable??

<dd><b>Comment</b> No, it doesn't mean that, but if you read <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> you'll see that Wikipedia needs secondary, not primary sources for notability. Now, UsaSatsui has pointed you towards some in his above posting, so why not update your article with some of those and rewrite it so it reads less like advertising, and perhaps some of the Delete votes will change to Keep. <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 11:32, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Sometimes, I don't know why I try. It's apparent that some people think that Wikipeida is just some <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#WEBSPACE" title="WP:NOT">webhost</a> that puts up any old crap people care to type in, and that you can establish that something is "nottible" by just repeating some drivel about how it's "bullshit" and that "just because we haven't heard of it" and how everyone's out to get you because your two-bit band IS SO worthy, and they <i>don't even bother to read</i> the policies that would <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">prove notability</a> and get the article kept. Instead, they shout, and shout, and shout, and think that will guilt people into giving in or something. I went out of my way to help provide the information that could get this article kept, and the result? Whine, whine, shout, shout, bullshit. Doesn't exactly encourage people to keep being friendly. Listen, Scubster (for the record, <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">sign your posts</a>), there's rules around here. Play by the rules, or at least pretend you want to, and I'll bend over backwards to help you...I'm sure 90% of Wikipedia would.

<p>Pointless page. The editor give the rationale that they are as important as Kenny but at least Kenny is a character. The aliens are just an easter egg. This seems to just be a way to link to the two sites and to display numerous pictures with no fair use rationales. The way this article seems to be going, the user is going to add more pictures until the user shows every single alien shown. Sure there is a way to make this a good article but it is hardly <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> and frankly little more than <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">cruft</a>. <a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 08:17, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is almost entirely the work of a manufacturer of these beds, and the images are uploaded by her from her website. It reads like an infomercial. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 08:22, 1 March 2007 (UTC)<br />
REPLY FROM AUTHOR: Actually, the two beds pictured are from different manufacturers, and there is no way for somebody to click over to any particular retail site based on this listing. Due to that, I think your fears that this is an infomercial designed to bring the author traffic are unwarranted. I have received zero traffic from wikipedia, nor do I expect to.</p>

<li>There are articles on the Oscars, Emmies, Grammies and so on, so why shouldn't there be articles on these Indian awards?

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, it is useful to have a reference on film awards that don't happen in Hollywood, on the other hand the total lack of secondary sources makes it questionable if these are notable even in their own country.

<p><b>Another user, <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">User:Jreferee</a>, proposed that this article should be deleted</b> according to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">Wikipedia:Proposed deletion</a> guideline, bacause the person supposedly "does not meet Wikipedia:Notability". <b>I disagree strongly</b>.

<p>Looking at the contributions of <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">User:Jreferee</a>, it turns out that the same user has also added "proposed deletion" tags to a large number of other biographies of people who appear to meet any reasonable interpretation of the term "notability", including a winner of the <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Poetry_9763.html" title="Pulitzer Prize for Poetry">Pulitzer Prize for Poetry</a> (<a href="../../../y/u/s/Yusef_Komunyakaa_ab32.html" title="Yusef Komunyakaa">Yusef Komunyakaa</a>), and several winners of <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_medal.html" title="Olympic medal">Olympic medals</a> (<a href="../../../y/v/e/Yves_Mankel_d3b2.html" title="Yves Mankel">Yves Mankel</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/r/Yuriy_Krymarenko_9573.html" title="Yuriy Krymarenko">Yuriy Krymarenko</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/r/Yuriy_Melnichenko_545d.html" title="Yuriy Melnichenko">Yuriy Melnichenko</a> and others).</p>
<p>It appears to me that <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">User:Jreferee</a> has simply tagged articles with titles beginning with the letter Y more or less at random. Some of these are not great articles, perhaps, but it does not seem reasonable to me to use "notability" as an excuse to delete articles which are simply incomplete or undeveloped. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharamond_ed49.html" title="User:Pharamond">Pharamond</a> 08:01, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Prodded as lacking independent sources to demonstrate notability. De-prodded as "useful". None of the links cited in the article are independent and reliable all are to the company or sellers. A google search reveals nothing else. Even if cited, I don't think a mere list of notable users shows that a particular product is notable. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 09:11, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I created the article, in response to several biographies on WP that claim that the biographee, see <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glen_Dettman_0660.html" title="Glen Dettman">Glen Dettman</a> for example, were awarded this medal. It was claimed to be some great achievement when it is a non-notable bit of metal. I'm inclined to think that it should remain because it informs people that it isn't a Government medal, as its name implies. If it is deleted, it will reduce the ability of people looking at biographies where the medal is claimed to understand the medal's true character. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaustrauser_bb16.html" title="User:Maustrauser">Maustrauser</a> 11:27, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Just to be boring. The Legion of Frontiersman and the Legion of Frontiersman (Australian Command) whilst 'born' from the same organization, appear to operate independently and therefore a merge or redirection may not be appropriate. Given this, I think the original article should remain.<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaustrauser_bb16.html" title="User:Maustrauser">Maustrauser</a> 06:07, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've begun revising the article, and it'll cover the whole shebang. There hasn't been a unified LoF movement since WWI, and there are only splinter groups scattered throughout the Commonwealth that individually are small and non-notable, IMO. They all lay claim to the same history, which will be the focus of the article. If articles on individual factions do get written, they should be daughter articles of this main one (currently, it's the only LoF article). <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobanny_136f.html" title="User:Bobanny">Bobanny</a> 05:26, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As the original creator of this page, I say <b>delete</b>. I created this page when I was very new to the project. The point of it was to demonstrate the considerable overlap of many comedic actors and shows in Australia, and how a very small number of people have been responsible for most of the quality comedy to come out of Australia in the last 15 years or so. But after being here for three years.. yeah, it's not really suitable, is it? I disagree about the notability comment though - every single show and person linked on this page will demonstrate that. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 06:46, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Danny, owner/founder has asked for my help to put his film company up.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It may be a legitimate explanation but that does not equate to a reason to create an article for it.

<li>Well, I addeded some references and copyediting. However, it needs to be clarified what the topic of the article is. About the imaginary language there is relatively little to write and I doubt that the term has even been invented by this campaign. Because of a rather widespread reception in blogs and groups, this may rather become an article about an advertising campaign, if someone sees a notable case.

<p>I would like to nominate this article for deletion. I was one of the members of this band and the person who created it was not in the band. It's my feeling he only created it to promote himself as "producer," which I've already deleted. The previous arguments for keeping the article online are laughable at best. True, we did receive a number of 3rd party reviews and a spot on the CMJ Charts for a couple of weeks, the importance of the band is trivial to anyone outside the band's inner circle, which did not include the aforementioned "producer." Most of the good stuff we recorded was right before we broke up as a 4 piece, something this article doesn't even mention. Please delete. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Evertonpalmer (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Evertonpalmer_801a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Evertonpalmer">contribs</a>) 2007/02/28 21:21:35.</small></p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - the Allmusic review reads <i>...begins interestingly enough, but a few short moments later, it devolves into sadly conventional indie rock -- the big chords, big melodies, and big dynamics are all there and handled competently, but there's not enough content behind them to attract a great deal of notice. File with the vast number of indie bands who sounded tolerably good during the mid-'90s, but can't hope to stand any test of time.</i> Perhaps there are some better sources available? --<a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebsuls_76d4.html" title="User:Debsuls">Debsuls</a> 01:19, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> You might be the only person who remembered us as a band. While I'm interested as to how you know about us, anyone who does remember us doesn't need Wikipedia to remind them. If they know, they know. Besides, the lack of any kind of real information available makes this entry even more questionable. Delete. --Evertonpalmer</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I created the original article because I wanted to learn more about the band whose CD I picked up in an open-air market in Union Square ten years ago. I still think the reasons for keeping this article the first time around continue to apply. I don't believe that a little vandalism is grounds for deleting an article that would otherwise stand. If this article is missing important information about the history of the band, the proper response is to add that information, not to delete the article. skoosh <a href="../../../s/k/o/User_talk%7ESkoosh_c112.html" title="User talk:Skoosh">(háblame)</a> 01:37, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - maybe I'm missing something but an award given by an "association" of 13 members doesn't strike me as particularly notable. Unable to find anything indicating that this is considered to be any sort of honor, let alone a major one. No sources found for which the award is the primary subject. When it is mentioned it's part of a laundry list of other similarly minor awards that studios mention in press releases and on the back of DVD boxes. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 20:01, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Non notable company. Link spam within the article itself, only edits of the author were to this article or to other articles in an attempt to link to this particular one. The article has held the notability tag for days, and not been touched. <b>Delete</b>, unless notability can be established. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 22:27, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have just been notified of the request for deletion tag. I have added some of the articles in America that reference the company's products in major American newspapers and magazines. I hope this clears any of your concerns for notability. Thank you.</p>
<p><br />
I know employees of this company personally. I know that they have some great products and they have many customers. They were featured in last Sunday's Boston Globe. Please read up on the american press this company has. 24.218.204.89 04:42, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here's a quick quote from the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> article: "...smaller organizations can be notable, just as individuals can be notable, and arbitrary standards should not be used to create a bias favoring larger organizations." Also: "A company, corporation, organization, group, product, or service is notable if it has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works, the source of which is both:</p>
<pre>
   * independent of the company, corporation, organization or group itself, or of the product's or service's manufacturer or vendor, and
   * reliable.
</pre>
<p>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as (for examples) newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations..." In addition to being at the same location as Lotus 123 and Anderson Consulting first began - clearly the articles provided in the page do meet this criterion.</p>

<p>The subject of this article was for some time member of a cover band. Most important feat of this band were two nominations for the San Diego Music Awards for Cover band of the Year. After leaving the band, Ediger released two solo albums, but no information about the notability of these albums is provided. The name "Grayson Ediger" gets only four Google hits, none related to this particular person. The subject seems to be just another well-meaning amateur guitar player, nothing that sets him apart from others. I say we <b>delete</b> this for lack of notability. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">Brievenbus</a></sup> 13:24, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This was an actual Japanese release that never quite made it to the states, not a hack or fangame. It needs some sourcing and rewriting, as well as some fact-checking (the gambling elements weren't what kept it out of the states, it was mainly a lack of interest from American gamers and the fact the NES was pretty much dead by 1993), but the subject itself is valid for an article. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 12:40, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not trying to be argumentative, but if the game never made the Anglophone world, is the article really proper here, instead of on the .jn -pedia? What drove me bonkers was that the thing was so darned gamecrufty. It starts with all sorts of jargon that gamerz would know and that readers wouldn't, and then it goes on to want to give a feature list! That's really a case of "Wikipedia is not GameFAQs" to me. <a href="../../../u/t/g/User%7EUtgard_Loki_9cc9.html" title="User:Utgard Loki">Utgard Loki</a> 13:18, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>It shows up occasionally in the English-speaking world, and I disagree that something can be notable in only one language. I agree with you that the article itself, for lack of a better word, sucks. I'll try and improve it when I have some spare time. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 14:30, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. While the current state leaves much to be desired, I don't consider it good policy to delete something based on whether English people know about it. If that were the case, we've have to delete multiple things that are <i>notable</i> (i.e. <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Seal_of_Japan_ecee.html" title="Imperial Seal of Japan">Imperial Seal of Japan</a>).

<ul>
<li>"Know about it?" It didn't get <i>released</i> in Anglophone nations. Comparing an orphaned platform's single-nation game to the Sea of Japan is astonishing. This is not a case of "know about it," but rather "had <i>any effect</i> of." Describe some way in which this game affected anything except bank accounts. <a href="../../../u/t/g/User%7EUtgard_Loki_9cc9.html" title="User:Utgard Loki">Utgard Loki</a> 18:01, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I dunno. Describe how any individual game, English or not, affected anything but bank accounts. "It wasn't released here!" isn't a good enough reason to delete and this reasoning doesn't help our extensive bias towards English subjects, when we should be covering all notable things, whether they were only released in Japan or not. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostrophe_4563.html" title="User:Apostrophe"><b>'</b></a> 12:15, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. An actual commercial release, likely reviewed in Japanese.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Unfortunately it seems as though the Orange Juice website is defunct now, but I feel it still has historic value as a demoscene portal. We just need some reliable sources to back that up. If the consensus of this debate leans toward delete, then I would strongly suggest to <b>merge and redirect</b> to Nectarine (radio) instead, since ojuice.net redirects there now and the sites share much of their content. --<a href="../../../v/o/s/User%7EVossanova_19f2.html" title="User:Vossanova">Vossanova</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/o/s/User_talk%7EVossanova_e002.html" title="User talk:Vossanova">o&lt;</a></sup> 15:15, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Assuming the other article isn't deleted (which appeared likely) I'm not as sure about this article.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a very promising stub, someone with a bit more knowledge i.e. someone from Omaha I guess, could turn this into a very interesting article. The building seems notable from the description of it in the article and that notability is confirmed by the sources referred to.

<dd><b>Note:</b> The reason I nominated it, is because I don't know of any other circumstances where we keep articles on condominium projects, and it may be a case of <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecentism_cde3.html" title="Wikipedia:Recentism">recentism</a>, and thus not really notable per say. However, if the majority consesus thinks this news related article is worth keeping then that is fine.

<dd>As far as housing projects go, <a href="../../../c/o/-/Co-op_City_7ca8.html" title="Co-op City">Co-op City</a> comes to mind. Granted, that one is a bit more famous and established, but from that page's categories I see that there are actually quite a few other articles about buildings like this.</dd>
<dd>I don't really believe in recentism; a subject might seem trivial now, but someday it won't be "recent" anymore and maybe then someone will be glad we compiled this information while it was readily available. 50 years from now, kids might be doing class projects on this building. Who knows? As long as it has the sources to establish its notability (which this does), we can't be expected to predict how significant today's trivia will be in the future. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 15:06, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Nearsourcing - is the concept, that was worked out by the company and it is company's property. There is no need to use any sources for brining out a new concept as the company has wide experience in the outsourcing and software development field and enough data to make its own conclusions - I think it is fair enough. One of Wiki's concepts - is to bring knowledge to everyone who needs it... Why not share our knowledge with other people? You stated right... that you were not aware of this term - so here is our contribution to the community.

<li><b>Delete</b>-- article is promotional and self-serving, and much of the information about "awards" is incorrect and/or deceptive (two alleged "awards" mentioned in the article don't even exist as per se awards). As with many independent internet radio stations, particularly a bevy at Live365 and/or iTunes, there was no major or "noteworthy impact on the industry," or at least it would be more comforting to see specific empirical examples of things this station did that numerous other internet -based broadcasters DIDN'T do, have or accomplish. In fact, there are numerous longer-term independents at Live365 and iTunes alone (not to mention on other networks) that have more aggregate tuning hours, that got more involved in the community there, that lasted longer, that sacrificed both time and money in the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel hearings and other major historical events that developed the industry, etc. This one broadcast for a while... it got its share of listeners and a little publicity... then it went away.

<li><b>Do not delete.</b> The article as I see introduces facts and nothing more. They do not say, "this is the greatest station ever" or anything like that. While it does not exist anymore, significant information has been provided to show that they were well recognized while in existence. I would argue that those who use to listen may want to know what happened and/or what they are doing now. Just because a company goes out of business or a person of history dies, we do not erase them from the history books. This station was obviously more than just a flash in the fire. It appears from the article that those who were involved moved onto other stations as well. According to the articles history page, this article has been on Wikipedia since 2005, that too, should mean something. I say leave it here, its not doing any harm. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.58.71.75_ee60.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.58.71.75">71.58.71.75</a> (talk) 14:58, 6 March 2007 (UTC).</small><small>— 71.58.71.75 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.58.71.75_ee60.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.58.71.75">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Neutral</b> <s><b>Keep</b></s> . I added the Mathematics Genealogy Project, a 3rd party RS frequently used in WP. The interpretation of <i>about</i> in science and academic life generally means citations. (Almost no academic gets a biographic article until they retire or die, and to have one is not the standard, as can be seen from most of the scientific bio articles in WP.) Unfortunately, upon looking for the number of citations in WoS, I find a total of 37, which is not very high, even in math, where citations come slowly. I therefore change the keep to a neutral She may not be notable yet, but she appears to be working on a very recently important topic, and the citations may be forthcoming. She is referred to as an authority on the interpretation of Perelman's work in many professional blogs, but they aren't sources. But its close enough to be worth the investigation. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 19:31, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think it makes much difference whether one looks at "Bio" or "Prof" – those are just guidelines, and the judgment of whether a particular person is notable or not is always going to be subjective. Here's a more objective comparison for your consideration, Vassyana. Another mathematician was added to Wikipedia recently – the bio on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vera_Pless_e5e9.html" title="Vera Pless">Vera Pless</a> was created 2/26/07. I ran an author search on her using Google Scholar. I got 64 hits, of which four were books (not articles). The search turned up 731 citations by other authors. I ran the same search for Christina Sormani, whose Wiki-bio was created 01/19/07. I got 13 hits, of which none were books, and 7 were preprints. I counted 53 citations in total (31, excluding the preprints).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know exactly where an objective cutoff line should be drawn. I am asserting that a mathematician with so few published papers, with no books in print, and who is not the recipient of a major prize, is not notable by Wikipedia's standards. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCBryant_f1d6.html" title="User:DavidCBryant">DavidCBryant</a> 12:10, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. When one considers an article on an associate professor of mathematics, there has to be some sign this person is above the norm (relative to the usual associate professor) in terms of research or some extra-mathematical event (such as some kind of notoriety in the press). I see nothing like that. DGG's comments are reasonable (excepting my clarification above). If she is indeed an "emerging figure", I say let her emerge and then she can write a Wikipedia bio.

<li><b>Keep</b>.

Some editors are removing the information about Marcotte's comments about the Duke lacrosse and that people other than conservatives and Christians were offended by what she said. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldfritha_cc31.html" title="User:Goldfritha">Goldfritha</a> 01:39, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Her only notability is for the Edwards controversy, and while it was covered in major media, it was pretty much an ephemeral news story that should be a paragraph or so in the John Edwards/2008 Campaign article. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 23:23, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This issue will continue to be discussed as the campaign goes forward, and it will be helpful to have a Wikipedia reference for the story. Its incomprehensible to me that someone would think this article deserves deletion. <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages--Kromagon 18:20, 6 March 2007 (UTC) comment was added by Kromagon (<a href="../../../k/r/o/User_talk%7EKromagon_408f.html" title="User talk:Kromagon">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kromagon_0beb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kromagon">contribs</a>) 18:19, 6 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The multiple sources establish notability (even excluding the 2 Ms. Marcotte wrote herself). It may or may not be appropriate to eventually merge this into the 2008 Edwards campaign, but that's an editorial issue for the talk pages of the two articles. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 08:54, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I believe it is notable, but there are problems asserting that notability. I spoke to BenBurch about adding a little to make the assertion better. He's a bit hesitant, because he might be accused of having a conflict of interest. I told him not to worry about that, and make a little bit of improvement. I believe that some of the content archived there cannot be founde elsewhere.

<li><a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> defines notability as being the subject of secondary sources. Now, since the target of this AfD is this website (and not the subject contained therein), we must be able to establish that the website itself is the subject of multiple, reliable secondary sources for it to stay on Wikipedia. For the life of me, I cannot find any other reliable references to this website. The only hits on Google are the website itself and this Wikipedia article we are discussing. In other words, it does not matter that the subject matter of this archive/website are notable and have given the website permission to archive their material.

<li><b>Comment</b> - It isn't immediately obvious that this is the article's second nomination for deletion and the fact is easy to overlook. That fact should be more prominent here. That said, I will vote <b>delete</b> per nom. The article reads like promotional material and makes a number of claims regarding importance and notability that are not sourced. The mention in "Groove Magazine" is the best that this article can muster, and as to whether that is a sufficient source to establish notability, of that I am highly dubious. If additional sourcing can be added to the article, AND it is massively cleaned up to read more like an encyclopedia entry and less like promotional materials I may be persuaded to support a keep. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 20:40, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> notiability was previously established during last AfD, all issues raised were addressed then, Also AfD notified at WP Australia, and WP:Western Australia. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnan</a><a href="../../../g/n/a/User_talk%7EGnangarra_4843.html" title="User talk:Gnangarra">garra</a> 05:18, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. The article is virtually unchanged from when it was AfD'd four months ago. The result of that AfD was a strong and clear consensus to keep. "Keep" means "keep", not "you have four months to improve the article or it will be deleted". <a href="../../../h/e/s/User_talk%7EHesperian_5634.html" title="User talk:Hesperian">Hesperian</a> 05:42, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> with strong support for the sense of above keep - with concern that the second nomination is not actually kosher - per Gnangarra and Hesperians comments.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Fully support comments of Hesperian, Gnangarram and SatuSoro comments as above. The notability of the article's subject has already been well established and it forms an important part of the development of the WA music scene through those early years. If you are concerned about notability or other matters, use the propper method of tagging the article first and discussing your issues in talk before jumping the gun and moving to AfD. As for 23skidoo's comments, it might be appropriate for a disambiguation note to be placed at the top of the article as per his comments. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewinchester_2be0.html" title="User:Thewinchester">thewinchester</a> 08:36, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Clearly verifiable and notable from Western Australian sources, 30 hits on Factiva (which indexes newspaper articles by the West Australian and Australian) going back as far as that engine will allow. - it's a notable record store which has also served as a small venue for a range of artists. Article does need improvement on style and content, but AfD is not the vehicle to make that happen. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 08:40, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> – It obviously means something to the club members and if you look at point 3 has safety in mind when it is used. Think about it, it is a very identifiable term and the fact that it is said twice may emphasise its safety nature - If a shooter only hears part of it say the second “whoop” he will still be alerted to some element of danger.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also think about the mechanics of the sound – it is one that is easy to repeat at the top of your voice and will carry well on the wind/air, quite important in the shooting environment.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> It is the offical callsign of the University of Plymouth Clay Pigeon Shooting Club, which can be used as above in a manner which befits the shooting environment and gives the club an identity all of its own.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - Is there anything to verify that it is the "official" callsign of the club? Even then, it is probably not notable enough for inclusion in an encyclopedia, but at least it would give the reviewing editors <i>something</i> to consider. As it stands right now, the article is in clear violation of a couple policies, particularly that no sources are given to verify its accuracy, and it does not provide us with evidence that it is notable outside a very small group of people. This last one is especially important since it is a generic term, and was certainly not "invented" by any recent individual. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 00:33, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> - There is noting to say it is official as in documentation due to the phrase being introduced after the start of the year academic year (Sept 06 – Sept 07). The books/club material is distributed in sept each year to new members so it should go in for next year. As the phrase was widely used at the nationals many other clubs are aware of it as well as shooting elements around the local area of Plymouth and club member home towns. It tends to be used by younger members of the sport that know of it. As for the invented comment it is now quite clear that we are not the first to use it (so invented can be change to implemented) but…… as products can have patents obtained for different use or slight modification we are the first to use it in a safety sense or to signify an event. 04/03/2007 @ 13:30</p>

<dd>Okay. Take a look at the article as it reads now. I removed most of the content which was specific to PUCSC, especially the list of PUCSC's achievements, which have nothing whatsoever to do with the notability of this term. What are you left with? A dictionary definition of the term, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> - This appears to be a lobby group looking for publicty. It doesn't matter if their cause is just or not, just that this isn't what Wikipedia is for.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I created the page. We definitely aren't "looking for publicity" from Wikipedia, and I can't imagine how this even qualifies as publicity. We are a citizen's group making a significant impact on the state of Alabama. That seemed to be something worth noting in an encyclopedia. It sure matters to the many businesses that will be affected by the outcome, to the tourism industry of AL, and to the many citizens of Alabama who will see hundreds of new beers become available. --Danner Kline</li>

<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - Please see the discussion about the other lobby group who were trying to make a significant impact on the entire United States. Their topic sure matters to just under half of current population, as well as doctors and religious leaders. The importance of your cause is not the issue. The importance of your group is. Please see that discussion. --<a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalter_G%C3%B6rlitz_3e2a.html" title="User:Walter Görlitz">Walter Görlitz</a> 21:37, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Many other non-profit organizations are described in Wikipedia articles. For example, when I want to find out information about the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Cancer_Society_165c.html" title="American Cancer Society">American Cancer Society</a>, I know I can go to Wikipedia to get information. Similarly, <a href="../../../n/o/r/NORML_b5f7.html" title="NORML">NORML</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parent-Teacher_Association_e7fc.html" title="Parent-Teacher Association">Parent-Teacher Association</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_Coalition_for_Reproductive_Choice_f278.html" title="Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice">Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_We_Stand_America_6c08.html" title="United We Stand America">United We Stand America</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_American_Suffrage_Association_9999.html" title="National American Suffrage Association">National American Suffrage Association</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_Liberties_Union_b228.html" title="American Civil Liberties Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/g/Raging_Grannies_2860.html" title="Raging Grannies">Raging Grannies</a>, etc., etc. etc. There are hundreds if not thousands of pages on Wikipedia that provide information about organizations around the world. I guess Walter could say these groups are just looking for publicity also, but I hope reasonable people will know better. There is a big difference between an article that provides factual information about an organization vs. a page that is nothing more than lobbying in an of itself. If the article at issue contains lobbying, that can be edited. But don't delete an informative article about the origin and activities of an organization just because the organization engages in advocacy. Review the discussion archives on Walter's profile page, and you'll see he's been a little too aggressive with his deletion activism in the past. Apparently, he's still at it. --<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanjolawyer_442a.html" title="User:Banjolawyer">Banjolawyer</a> 19:50, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. This was perhaps one of the first <b>scholarly</b> discussion groups that ever dealt with India.

A picture of Great Neck Village School, put there well before this deletion discussion. Is there anything particularly notable about the school that gets its picture on that page? Well, yes: It happens to be one of the oldest alternative schools in the United States, founded in 1970. Read the first few lines of the Alternative schools article. So here we have one of the oldest examples of the type. I'd say that's pretty notable. I added a new third paragraph to the article to reflect that. Also, alternative schools tend to be small by design, so I don't think that should be a criterion for deletion. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 03:24, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Maybe this AfD will also bring some visibility to the contributions of User:209.177.21.6, who has added many dubious or unsourced statements to Great Neck school and other articles. She has said that she is a high school student there, and she was the one who added the 1970s text to <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_school.html" title="Alternative school">alternative school</a>. I am assuming she made up this "fact" on the spot, and chose this year because that was when the school was founded. Clearly we can't rely on this statement to conclude that Village School is one of the oldest alternative schools in the U.S. That claim would require some sort of scholarly reference. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 04:40, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete.</b> I think Village School should be deleted because there's nothing important about that school. It's never been rated in Newsweek Magazine's recent listing of "America's Best High Schools". I feel that Village School is like in a complete different universe than South or North. Village School have different rules...first the students are allowed to be disrespectful to their teachers...i.e. calling their teachers by their first names...that's messed up...as children we were always taught to call teachers by their last names. And now the VS can do it...The Great Neck School district is a hypocrite...they teach us as children to always call teachers by their last names...if we don't it's disrespectful. Village School has no problem for students to call their teachers by their first names. What is this school district teaching our children?

<li><b>History</b>: Once there was an NPOV list with a table here, then a debate in June 2006 moved it to a new title and another debate in October (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_songs_with_titles_of_twenty_or_more_words_34d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of songs with titles of twenty or more words">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of songs with titles of twenty or more words</a>) brought about its removal. <b>Delete</b> the current version as it is indeed POV and cruft, but I have to say I miss the old list even if it wasn't entirely encylcopedic. -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 04:18, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>I really don't know</b>. I made this article just for fun and because there were several (dead) links to an article about extremely long songtitles to be found in other articles. To me, there is no difference between an article such as this and, say, an article about recorded extreme human longetivity. It's a source of information, nothing more, nothing less. And I think that 'a matter of opinion' being an ante seriously disables the very core of much information that is to be found on Wiki. In the end, all matter is subjective and depends on the eye of the beholder. But then again, it isn't an important article. So go ahead, delete it.&#160;:P <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarachte_93f9.html" title="User:Harachte">Harachte</a> 10:08, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is about Internet phenom Kimbo Slice, a streetfighter whose videos are quite notorious. I acknowledge the popularity of these, but there simply is not enough verifiable information about "Kimbo Slice" for a proper biography. I have found exactly five reliable sources that mention Kimbo Slice. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>This <i>Rolling Stone</i> <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/10963294/online_a_neverending_supply_of_gruesome_streetfighting/3" class="external text" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/10963294/online_a_neverending_supply_of_gruesome_streetfighting/3" rel="nofollow">piece</a>. Pretty good, we get the age and occupation of Slice, and he is named "King of Web Brawlers", but that's it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next four are all <i><a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Herald_f08a.html" title="Boston Herald">Boston Herald</a></i> pieces centered on <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Gannon_%28fighter%29_d97a.html" title="Sean Gannon (fighter)">Sean Gannon (fighter)</a>, a Boston cop who defeated Kimbo Slice (and directly because of this was picked up by the <a href="../../../u/f/c/UFC_e9e8.html" title="UFC">UFC</a>). But these pieces have only trivial mentions of Kimbo Slice:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Brawlin' cop goes extreme; Caught on `ultimate fighting' video" (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_3.html" title="December 3">12-03</a>), <i>Boston Herald</i>
<ul>
<li>Mentions: "Seven-year Boston police Patrolman Sean 'The Cannon' Gannon and Miami 'pro streetfighter' Kimbo Slice beat each other to a bloody pulp in the vicious eight-minute video for sale on extreme fighting Web sites." and says Kimbo's brother is a pro boxer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Cop buddy backs brawler while brass broods" (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_4.html" title="December 4">12-04</a>), <i>Boston Herald</i>
<ul>
<li>Mentions: "On the tape, Gannon and 'pro streetfighter' Kimbo Slice trade vicious bareknuckle punches, elbows and knees until both are bloodied."</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Say what you want about the sources, but the guy exists, he has verifiable videos and you can piece together enough biographical info (interviews, etc.) to warrant a page. His fight explanations are narratives of what happens on the video. If you want to take down sublimedirectory.com, just use the YouTube links. Fact is, a lot of sites link to Kimbo's entry, including blogs and message boards. He has a very strong cult following, and the information reflects this. It basically compiles all of the info -- fact or myth -- into one central location. Isn't that what wiki is for? If I want to quickly find out who Kimbo is, I can do that via this page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Kslice (<a href="../../../k/s/l/User_talk%7EKslice_e885.html" title="User talk:Kslice">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kslice_368f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kslice">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>I wouldn't say that the purpose of Wikipedia is to compile myths. This is more of a fan page than an article, and it's blatantly biased. I don't think this article does anything more than a fan page could, so my vote is a strong delete. MatthewLiberal 03:39, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, no, compiling "fact or myth" is not what Wikipedia does. The <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">sources</a> absolutely determine what can be put in the article, and the only sources we have are not sufficient for an article. The Internet videos are primary sources and hence the "explanations" of them are <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Other sites linking to this article and a cult following do not change the fact that there are not enough independent, reliable, non-trivial sources about Kimbo Slice.

<li><b>Comment</b> Even that version is on shaky ground. The sources cannot be improved; that's the best we have. We'd have to remove Gannon's post to the message board. The table of fights I suppose is tolerable although not attributable to any reliable source and backed only by Internet videos. There is still no reliable source backing SublimeDirectory.com as the official source of the videos, and I'm not too comfortable with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AKimbo_Slice&amp;diff=110497905&amp;oldid=109868350" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AKimbo_Slice&amp;diff=110497905&amp;oldid=109868350" rel="nofollow">the methodology</a> used (by myself) to justify linking to it. We have these few facts:</li>
<li><i>Biographical details:</i> an inexact birthdate, a Miami location, a pseudonym, a vague employer (porn empire)</li>
<li><i>Notability</i>: Rolling Stone calls him "King of Web Brawlers"</li>
<li><i>Accomplishments</i>: fought someone who was subsequently signed by the <a href="../../../u/f/c/UFC_e9e8.html" title="UFC">UFC</a>. Defeated "Rasta", "Byrd", "Afro Puff", "Big Mac" and some other non-notable unknowns.</li>
<li>Those who come looking for the truth about Kimbo—what can be gleaned from message boards, etc.—will be disappointed at what they find here. Those looking for an encyclopedic treatment will find only a tenuous one. This is directly caused by the unfortunate fact that <i>there are no non-trivial, independent reliable sources about Kimbo Slice</i>. -<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpuriousQ_693d.html" title="User:SpuriousQ">SpuriousQ</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESpuriousQ_b285.html" title="User talk:SpuriousQ">talk</a>) 16:44, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very Weak Keep</b>. There are admittedlsy several problems in fleshing out Kimbo's notability as discussed in the nomination. However, the article in the Rolling Stone does point to at least some notability inasfar as him being an Internet Fighter. Perhaps the article can only contain his fights and the verifiable information. Otherwise, I'd reluctantly support deletion. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamsquire_182a.html" title="User talk:Ramsquire">(throw me a line)</a></sup> 19:57, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure what you mean here by "only his fights and the verifiable information". Right now, the article has just this: all the verifiable info we know and a table of his fights. Do you mean we should give narratives of the fights? The problem with that is it's content based on primary sources—not very encyclopedic. But just listing the fights themselves is equally silly since no one knows who his opponents like "Afro Puff" and "Big Mac" are. -<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpuriousQ_693d.html" title="User:SpuriousQ">SpuriousQ</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESpuriousQ_b285.html" title="User talk:SpuriousQ">talk</a>) 20:36, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry for the lack of clarity. I am endorsing the current version of the article as the one to keep (but just barely). Also if there is verifiable biographical information it could be added. However, I suspect that over time there will probably more additions of unverifiable information. If the article continues to go in that direction, then it should be deleted as unverifiable. FTR-- I agree that the names of the opponents are silly since no one know's who these people are outside of the Internet Community that follow Kimbo's fights. But I confess I am not impartial here. I follow Kimbo, so I'd like to keep the article in some form despite the obvious and admitted warts with it. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamsquire_182a.html" title="User talk:Ramsquire">(throw me a line)</a></sup> 21:32, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Cable television countdown show - not in any way an official music chart measuring airplay or sales. This show has been on for years so there is no way this could possibly be comprehensive.

<li>Because this isn't the place to discuss whether or not misandry is an artificial construct.
