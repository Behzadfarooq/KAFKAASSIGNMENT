<p>This article represents the Shia point of view which sharply contradicts with the foundation of the faith of the mainstream (Sunni) Islam. Worldwide Sunni Muslims (comprising 90% of world Muslims) believe that this list is nothing but a fabrication by the Shia sect. This is not new; this has been going on for centuries. This online encyclopedia is NOT the proper place for those kinds of extremely controversial issues, especially when they represent points of views of a minor sect (Shia) of the global religion of Islam. Of course the Shia scholars will continue to claim that their views and deviant beliefs are supported by Sunni references and sources. However, all they have been doing over centuries is misinterpreting those references, taking them out of context and twisting them to support their views. They've had a historical enmity towards the 3 rightly-guided Caliphs of Islam which are revered by over 1.2 Billions Sunni Muslims and have been revered for the past 14 centuries, while Sunnis never carry any sort of enmity towards the sacred figures revered by the Shia such as Ali ibn Abi Talib or Fatimah. There is not one single Sunni Muslim or Sunni scholar that will accept the Shia interpretations of the references otherwise, if they do, then over a Billion Sunni Muslim will convert happily into Shia. Therefore, further attempts to quote the so called Sunni sources to support those Shia views should be discredited and not to be accepted a valid argument in any way. According to Sunni Islam, this list does not even exist. Ali, Fatimah and all those Sahaba enlisted in this list have given their full allegiance to Abu Bakr and to believe that they were at odds with him is totally absurd. Again WIKIPEDIA is NOT the proper place for those minority views. Thank you TrueWisdom1 02:20, 22 January 2007 (UTC)TrueWisdom1</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> If the problem is that these views are disputed by Sunnis, then that should be reflected in the article, having proper regard for the rules about point of view.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> I have no idea if it is notable or not, but re-nominating it less than a day after a previous AfD points very strongly to a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - There's dozens of arguments I could bring up regarding the merits of this article, but they're all rendered moot by the clear evidence that this is a bad faith nomination.

<li><b>delete</b>, this list is an attempt by early Shia writers to distort history, it is NOT a historical fact! is this encyclopedia supposed to be grounds for any group to express their own point view of history?

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> And the Roman Catholic view is that the Protestant Reformation is bogus, but we are not going to delete all articles about Martin Luther, Anglicans, Presbyterians, and other protestant religions and religious personages. The Jewish view is that the Christian scriptures and religious beliefs are bogus, yet we will probably be keeping them. Wikipedia is not the source for Truth, just for things notable enough that people write about them. Articles about a religion must be written in a non-point of view way, so they never say "The truth is.." but instead say "Followers of the religion believe that....". It would be completely appropriate to add to the article reliable and verifiable sources which claim that each and every one of the "Sahaba" gave "bay'ah" to "Abu Bakr" so as to make the article NPOV. This could be integrated throuout the article, or incorporated in a "Criticism" or "Alternative views" section if that works better stylistically. A big problem is that ancient religious doctrines and disputes are unlikely to have very many sources for such issues which are independent of the followers of the religion, and there are unlikely to be any surviving manuscripts of first hand accounts. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 22:51, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The reason why "the Sunni view [is] getting deleted from this article" is because the Sunni view consists of deleting the bulk of the content from this article.
