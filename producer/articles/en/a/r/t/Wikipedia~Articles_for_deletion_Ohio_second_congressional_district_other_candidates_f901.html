<p>A bunch of deleted articles have been recreated in this space, which sort of makes a mockery of the term "deletion". I think, in the 200+ years that it's been a state, more than these hanbdful of insignificant fellows have run for representative of Ohio's second district. Some of them may have even been nominated. Not these guys though. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:06, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Keep. The people who appear here had their original articles deleted. One suggestion was creating a "minor candidates" page, which I have done. And now I find that's up for deletion to.

Sorry, the c ompleteness argument is not persuasive: simply listing the losers in the article for the election fulfills the encyclopaedic purpose of this article.

<li>Personally, I think one of the biggest weaknesses of the wikipedia is the {afd} procedure. When I look at some of the nominations which generate discussion what I find is the same bunch of regulars. And many of those regulars show no interest in following procedure, or even giving the articles a fair reading.</li>
<li>Some of the regular habitues have personal axes to grind. Some regulars use the {afd} fora <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Guantanamo_Bay_detainees&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24281607" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Guantanamo_Bay_detainees&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24281607" rel="nofollow">to suppress information</a> that they regard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FSabir_Mahfouz_Lahmar&amp;diff=23895791&amp;oldid=23895339" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FSabir_Mahfouz_Lahmar&amp;diff=23895791&amp;oldid=23895339" rel="nofollow">as "anti-American"</a>, without regard to its verifiability or how neutrally it is expressed.</li>
<li>Many regulars base their vote on whether they regard the article as POV. Some even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCarolyn_Wood&amp;diff=25538753&amp;oldid=25538706" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCarolyn_Wood&amp;diff=25538753&amp;oldid=25538706" rel="nofollow">base their nomination on their opinion that an article is POV</a>, even though the <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">wikipedia deletion policy</a> says that the correct response to a perception that an article shows a biased POV is to raise that issue on the article's talk page.</li>
<li>I think the wikipedia would be improved if steps were taken so that there was a monthly cap on how many times per month people could vote in the {afd} fora. This would rein in those regulars who use the fora as a venue to trot out their personal prejudices. Regretably, this would also cap those responsible wikipedians who come regularly to the {afd} fora, and actually read the articles nominated for deletion, and make an independent choice every time they vote. But that would be better than the current situaiton. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 21:57, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
