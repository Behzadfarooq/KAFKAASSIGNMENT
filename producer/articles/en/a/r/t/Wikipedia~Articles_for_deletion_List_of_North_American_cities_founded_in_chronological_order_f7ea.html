<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus</b>. Okay, bear with me on this one. I count: 8 moves, 4 deletes, 3 keeps, with two of the moves being "well, maybe keep" or "well, maybe delete". I personally find the arguments for moving to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_North_American_cities_by_founding_year_dbc5.html" title="List of North American cities by founding year">List of North American cities by founding year</a> to be the more persuasive, but I'm not prepared to go on' move just based on that, given the wide variety of opinions expressed here.

This hardly qualifies as a robust list. I find it highly unlikely that this list will ever reach a robustness that would qualify it a NPOV due to the ungodly large number of settlements before any written historical accounts. Unless we expect to gather data from the Inuit and other earlier settlers than Europeans, the entire premise of the article as named currently, or as suggested, is flawed.<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a> 16:17, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> , per Durova and others. Inherently biased, not to say Eurocentrically bigoted. POV. If kept and limited by date, <b>rename</b> to reflect the Euro-bias. "Post Columbian" would satisfy the need for clarity. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a>
<ul>
<li>That still doesn't resolve the bias problem. Native peoples had massive migrations in the centuries following Columbus. How would a list treat Seminole settlement of Florida? What about the Trail of Tears? Would it ignore Mexico City altogether as a renamed version of previously settled Tenochtitlan? An NPOV article on this subject would have to be an essay. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 00:05, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, Mexico City isn't just comprised of former Tenocjtitlan; it also takes in the former lakeshore cities - Chapultepec, Tlatlelolco, Texcocp, Xochimilco and another one or two (seven in total I believe); and Tenochtitlan was actually the youngest of the lot, and considered an upstart by the others...and all still relatively young compared to Tzintzuntzan, Monte Alban-Mitla-etc in Oaxaca and even things nearer Mexico City like Xochicalco (in Morelos). I agree there's a bias problem; the idea that something is "earliest" is inherently "Colombiano" in ethic. In BC, BTW, there was this place Dimlahamid (Temlahan in Barbeau) which was destroyed by some natural/supernatural catastrophe, possibly older than Tenochtitlan; but I suppose legendary existence doesn't qualify either; of course somewhere like Cahokia does.</li>
<li>A further issue that struck me when I first saw this discussion is when is a city founded vs when did it appear as a settlement. New Westminster brags that it's the oldest city on the mainland of BC; by which I guess they mean their date of incorporation, although I suspect that a now-abandoned town somewhere might be slightly older (not sure which); and there are older settlements - Lillooet, Yale, and Lytton, as well as vanished Port Douglas - that did not become incorporated until the mid-20th Century, even though they were created BEFORE the Crown Colony of British Columbia came into existence (except Douglas); and on an aboriginal timeline, they were founded/named thousands of years before (Lillooet and Lytton are considered two of the oldest-inhabited sites of settlement in North America. So is "founded" only in reference, or to incorporation? Vancouver's founding date is June something 1885, but Capt Stamp's Mill was there in 1867, with Gassy Jack opening his bar in the summer of that year (the opening of his bar is considered to be the founding of the city).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 05:33, 23 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Another good example of that problem has just been added to the article in the entry "1896: Miami, Florida, from early Spanish settlements dating back to 1566". The date 1896 is correct in that Miami was incorporated that year. There had been a Tequesta town there for perhaps 2,000 years when the Spanish came. There are records of a Spanish mission there off and on, but that doesn't qualify as "early Spanish settlements" in my book. In any case, any remaining Tequestas were removed to Cuba when the Spanish gave up Florida. The area was then uninhabited until the Seminole Wars pushed the Seminoles into the Everglades, and the Army built a fort on the Miami River. The fort was abandoned after the Seminole Wars, and the few remaining Seminoles stayed deep in the Everglades. The area wasn't resettled until the 1870s. My point in all this is that it is already very difficult to verify and maintain this list, as it is quickly becoming a junk pile of civic boosterism and unverified, and probably unverifiable, 'facts'. Add the POV problems, and it is a mess. - <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Dalbury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 10:48, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think that some sort of list like this could be useful, but how do we limit it? Founded by Europeans? Make that clear. Still in existence today? Then throw out Jamestown and the Roanoke colony. Otherwise, include L'Anse-aux-Meadows, the Popham colony, and the French colonies in Florida. By minimum size today? To keep St. Augustine in the list the minimum population would have to be no higher than 10,000. What does North America mean? Does it mean just the U.S. and Canada? The article includes "towns or former colonies of major historical note". I can see arguments over what is "major". The list as it stands is strongly biased to places founded or taken over early on by the English, and therefore prominent in U.S. history texts.

<dd>1. Settlement constitutes habitation: this is true for agricultural societies, but not for nomadic peoples. However, most nomadic peoples return to the same locations on an annual circuit. By definition this list excludes all such people on a technicality.</dd>
<dd>2. Settlement by date: many of the earliest North American settlements are questions for archaeologists. It would be difficult to cover them adequately in a list by geographic region. A list by date, consciously or not, inherently excludes most of these questions by rendering them impossible to resolve.</dd>
<dd>3. Inherent bias: the first two factors favor Europeans, who had settled agriculture and written language. This fosters the illusion that previous habitation was insignificant. We can't correct for these problems and still have a list. We <i>could</i> correct for these problems in essay format.
