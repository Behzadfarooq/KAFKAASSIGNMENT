<li><b>Keep</b> I've known Bryce Case Jr. (A.K.A. YTCracker) for about 5 years now. I can honestly say a large majority of this information is factual and true. YTCracker is the pioneer of Nerdcore rap, i remeber hearing one of his first AOL rap songs about 4 years ago, whoever came after him is just jumping on the nerdcore groupie train.

<li>Certainly you can vote; but the admin closing this VfD is likely to give less weight to your vote since you're the topic. I would recommend that, while the VfD is in progress, you add links to the article's talk page which verify the activities, such as mainstream media coverage. Other editors can review them and add material they find appropriate.

Every item on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Americans_3ace.html" title="List of Americans">List of Americans</a> page should be deleted if this one ends up going.

<li>What you are proposing is inherently problematic. What you will end up with is various editors warring over what is notable enough and what is not. Are there any real advantages of making this a list rather than using existing categories?

<li><b>Keep</b> I was going to point out that it should be [[Category:African Americans]] and then the wiki software would keep the list up to date automatically as long as the articles were properly categorized, but I see that there is already such a category, and this list does something the category does not, viz. give a brief description of each.

Like many suggestions I've seen on the page, break up by why they are notable figures. A name can appear on two lists if they are notable for separate reasons. Breaking up lists makes the reference more worthwhile for the reader, and prevents <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trolling.html" title="Trolling">Trolling</a>.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a real Digimon, made official through the FAX Digimon contest in Japan. Several notable Digimon (like Cyber Dramon) have been such Digimon. There's no information on Babydramon other than his name, but if we're going to have Digimon entries, why not have all Digimon entries, even if they have to all be merged into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Digimon_7cfb.html" title="List of Digimon">List_of_Digimon</a>?

<li><b>Keep</b>. 1. Babydramon is an official Digimon as cited by Shining_Celebi. 2. Whether or not this is fancruft is highly dependant on whether one is a fan of the series and as such by putting this entry on vote, you place all individual character entries of not just television series but movies as well on trial. Whatever should happen to this entry should be applied to other individual character pages as well. 3. Whether or not this entry is fancruft is irrevelant as the purpose of Wikipedia is to be and I quote: <b>The Free Encyclopedia</b> and as such should be an Encyclopedia as defined by <a href="http://www.dictionary.com" class="external free" title="http://www.dictionary.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dictionary.com</a> , "A comprehensive reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects or on numerous aspects of a particular field, usually arranged alphabetically.". The keyword is comprehensive and this entry indeed fulfills the job of an encyclopedia entry by contributing comprehensive information on the subject (Babydramon) and its parent (Digimon). 4. This article does not merit deletion according to the Wikipedia Vote For Deletion policy page. This is not a hoax, and if deemed to be so minor as to not merit its own entry, then should be merged with an appropriate entry. Takato 01:47:34, 2005-08-18 (UTC)</li>

If it's real, adding the history <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShining_Celebi_c782.html" title="User:Shining Celebi">Shining Celebi</a> mentioned to the article would be useful (rather than just "he's rumored to exist since he was mentioned in passing in one episode"). - <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew0028_15bc.html" title="User:Matthew0028">Matthew0028</a> 04:35, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Needs Improvement</b>. I've done a lot of work creating articles for "rumored" characters, and to make such an article work, it needs to be longer than a few sentences and backed by reasons why this character was rumored to appear while never actually appearing. For example, my articles on rumored <i>Mortal Kombat</i> characters <a href="../../../n/i/m/Nimbus_Terrafaux_7e66.html" title="Nimbus Terrafaux">Nimbus Terrafaux</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belokk.html" title="Belokk">Belokk</a> contain real facts and reasons, rather than speculation. I'm not a fan of Digimon, yet I'm not going to say anything about fancruft. I just don't think the article itself is encyclopedically noteworthy unless it is expanded, merged, and/or improved.

<p>This article was just VfD:ed under the title <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiangchun.html" title="Chiangchun">chiangchun</a> and voted to be moved to this page, though without voters actually paying any attention what the VfD was actually about, which is why I'm resubmitting this again in the hope that people will try to focus on the relevant this time.

<p>Since I added the stub notice in February, this page wasn't significantly expanded. In a Google search for "True metal" all the pages were either about music or clones of this page. I can therefore reasonably assume that someone made up the term <i>true metal</i> without a serious reason.

<li>If it is just that, IMO the page is useless. Why not make tons of pages about "true foo" and "true bar" which redirect to "foo" and "bar" because the phrase "true foo" is often used to contrast with pseudo-foo?

I'm not at war with geogre. At most I'm in dispute with him. His actions in the dispute are to delete, concealing a blatantly non-speediable article from editors who are not also sysops; my actions in the dispute are to restore, making the article visible, and give the editors a chance to decide. This isn't war, it isn't even a police action, it's just a man with an ego being silly enough to think he can push it so far as to repeatedly delete content from Wikipedia without any scrutiny and get away with it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:00, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't want you punished. I just want you to edit like a normal user. You "undeleted without scrutiny" when all you had to do was create a better article. You resorted to VfD after you realized the revert/delete war wasn't working. Why list an article that now only has what you created on VfD? To make a point.

<li>I think you are pushing it a bit. I undeleted only as a result of a bad speedy. I have no problem referring such restorations to VfD and indeed see no reason to do so <i>unless</i> there is a serious dispute--administrators on Wikipedia perform hundreds of speedies every day, performing a great job with no immediate supervision, and make one or two mistakes, and I don't see any problem with other sysops like me exercising the same scrutiny on their speedies and fixing the very few mistakes they make. If you ever have a problem with any of my resurrections, it's a doddle to spot it in my deletion log and list it on VfD. There is absolutely no reason to introduce onerous procedural obligations. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 23:33, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The first speedy by Geogre was perfectly valid, there was no claim to notability: <i>Warren Benbow- drummer, songwriter, music producer and educator; b. New York, NY . Born December 22, 1954</i>. However, Tony Sidaway created a new entirely different version which was encyclopedic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Benbow&amp;oldid=21166223" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Benbow&amp;oldid=21166223" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> and Geogre's second, third and fourth speedies of this new version were entirely unjustified.<br />
<br />
A clueless newbie or vandal cannot "poison" a topic by creating an unworthy article that meets the speedy criteria. A speedy delete merely says the current version fails the very low threshold for retention and wipes the slate clean. It's simply a botched article; no judgement is made on whether the topic itself is unencyclopedic or non-notable (only a VfD does that). No vote for undeletion is needed to create a new article ‚Äî the slate was wiped clean and it's as if the speedied article never existed. Nevertheless, a bad faith attempt to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> by recreating the speedied article with only cosmetic changes (such as merely adding the adjective "notable") would be very dimly viewed. However, that's certainly not the case here.<br />
<br />
Tony Sidaway should have recognized that the first speedy deletion was perfectly valid, and probably should have just created his new article without restoring the old speediable stub. By restoring it, he (wrongly) implicitly criticized Geogre's action in speedying it, and Geogre perhaps reacted with indignation. However, Geogre should have realized that the new article rewritten from scratch was in no way a speedy candidate. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 03:12, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If someone is described as a "drummer, songwriter, music producer and educator" this appears to me to be quite a strong assertion of notability. I accept that geogre may not see it that way (this could be seen in my original note telling him I'd undeleted). This ambiguity in CSD7 is systemic so each administrator must use his own judgement. There is no absolute here; to me it's obviously an assertion of considerable notability, to you it isn't. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:11, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is not at all an assertion of notability. There are many, many people who could fit that description (such as, a high school teacher who plays in a band on weekends). <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_of_vanity_articles_63d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion of vanity articles">Wikipedia:Deletion of vanity articles</a> suggests: <i>For instance, if the person's profession is cited, a reasonable guideline would be how many people have the same profession: there are tens of thousands of porn models, but very few senators.</i> Even if you dislike the relatively recent "no assertion of notability" criterion for speedy deletion, it's not a solution to simply declare nearly anything to be "asserted notable". -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 08:37, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think it's pushing it a bit to say that this description could be applied to a high school teacher. Most people would expect "music producer" to mean "a person who produces recorded music" and in fact this is precisely the case here. VfD is *good* at discerning when an assertion of notability is bogus (as with your hypothetical high school teacher). Individuals on RC patrol, historically, are not so good. It is therefore inappropriate to speedy. I objected to CSD 7 for one main reason: it relies on a vague phrase, "assertion of notability" that means different things to different people. And here we have a classic case. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:47, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Well here's the confusion: the anon author first created a non-speediable version (but badly formatted and indented, so that an entire paragraph was contained on one line, with most of the content invisible unless you scrolled horizontally way beyond the right edge of the browser window ("first version"). A few minutes later, the anon himself then truncated that first paragraph to one short sentence ("second version"). That second version was correctly tagged for speedy deletion and correctly speedied. I suppose it was that "first version" that you found and rescued. That "first version" was not speediable (though TenOfAllTrades reports it was a copyvio), but personally I never would never even have looked at it... when there are multiple editors, you check the history, but when there's just one editor you just look at their final revision. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 08:26, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks for pointing that out, but actually because of the bad formatting I would not have seen the extra text in the original even if I had looked at it (it scrolls off the right hand side of the screen). To me that looks like a copyvio of an entry I've seen elsewhere, probably allaboutjazz.com. So to reduce the confusion I want to make it absolutely plain: I considered the second, truncated version to be a good stub. It correctly identified the subject and told me absolutely everything I needed to know in order to expand the article. The problem of these bogus speedies would not exist if those doing RC patrol would use google before speedying. We are, after all, here to edit an encyclopedia, not just play with the delete button. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:47, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Please Keep!</b>.Technically you are all right, of course: my contribution about the concept of Spaceship Earth is not widely recognised. Thus, your rejection of it as being just the author‚Äôs opinion. However, it happens to be true and extremely important. Sometimes it is appropriate to bend or even break the rules for a higher cause: if we screw the planet (which we are well on the way to doing) we screw Wikipedia and everything else as well. I hope that you will allow me to continue contributing to the article.

<p>Unencyclopedic. Died as baby. Did nothing prominent, represented nothing prominent.

I have earlier stated some thumb-rule criteria of royal babies having an own article, such as if the baby in question left a country in a succession crisis when dying. Or possibly, if the history may have altered significantly, had the baby lived. Otherwise, all the pertinent details of the baby in question fit into articles of parent(s), and an own article is undeserved. For encyclopedia, it is fragmenting to make these separate articles. <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.140.193.123.html" title="User:217.140.193.123">217.140.193.123</a> 09:02, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

Second, while this has been a wiki-internal dispute, the topic has frequently been brought up in non-wiki discussions both online and offline. This can be easily demonstrated by the sheer number of texts written on this question by experts (e.g. Edward Gobetz, Professor Emeritus of Sociology, Kent State University and founding director of Slovenian Research Center of America and others) and at the same time this also demonstrates that the topic can be covered in two sentences no more easily than any other.

<li>There is no relevant encyclopedic POV involved in any of the links. This information belongs in a Manual of Style or just general Slovene info webpages.

<p>Suspect vanity. User made two contributions on 3 August and hasn't been back. Article claims person has won several international titles. I can not find evidence of any international titles. I have found evidence of at least one age-under-16 Australian state title, and possibly a similar national title (hard to decipher). Does this make this person of interest sufficient for an encyclopedia entry? Frankly, I'm uncertain. Normally, this would be placed for speedy under the new vanity rule, but I'm putting it up for VfD because of the titles this person has received, rather than speedy. Your thoughts? --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 17:42, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>:I find it ludicrous that there are votes to delete this. Everything in this article is 100% factual seeing as I have written all of it and I founded the game. As for it being "non-notable" it is the single most notable Government Simulation game that exists. It was the FIRST comprehensive government simulation, and I pride myself knowing that this game is very much a learning experience as everybody who plays gains significant knowledge about american politics and government. Continuing, "AGS" another government simulator that came after this one, has a page here on wikipedia, and you dont see me voting to delete that, or the biased page on "Government Simulation" written by somebody not affiliated with USG and who conviently, it seems, left USG information off that page except for 1 or 2 lines. I am relatively new to wikipedia, so excuse me that I had the line "advertising" the game. I removed it, so there are no more qualms.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:Clie, Sorry, but AGS, NPS, and PolUS arent "passing USG up" (and by the way, get your facts straight...PolUS MERGED INTO USG!, Thanks for bringing your garbage into the discussion) and USG is certainly not being "outpaced". Thank you for wasting my time. I would really like to know what all these random people have against having this page up? So far, nobody is really giving any good reasons for these votes to Delete. Now, if a Admin from Wikipedia would like to contact me to discuss making this page more suited for Wikipedia, I would have no problem editing to meet these guidelines. However, outright deletion would just uphold the double standard of letting a copycat game, AGS, have its own page on here and USG not. Also, I am not going to vote on my own page, because I dont think deletion is a valid option. If a Wikipedia Admin wants to contact me, my AIM is PillagerConclave</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:NationStates is a BUSINESS-backed game made by somebody promoting his book and the idea of corporate government. USGovsim is not a business, its is just a free web-based forum game. It is THE MOST notable of any Government Simulator game, so the fact that you want to delete our page, but AGS (American Government Sim) a game that has been around alot less longer than USG and more or less a copycat game is allowed to have a page is a double standard. This is a FREE encyclopedia, and this page is 100% Fact. USG was *the* pioneer in Govsim-based gaming, so if there are going to be pages about Govsims on here, then I am going to make sure the facts are known.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:If this site is "THE MOST notable of any Government Simulator game", then you should have no problem citing refrences that establish its notability. Unless you can cite a large google result, a media or a news source that has done a report on this game, or some other piece of material by an independent site/organisation/whatever, then there is no reason why this page cannot be mentioned in <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_simulation.html" title="Government simulation">Government simulation</a> instead. Furthermore, this debate is not about AGS, nor does anyone here care about what % of this article is fact.

<li><b>Comment</b>:Cane we just end this nonsense now and let us keep our page? I mean seriously, the only "delete" votes are coming from people totally clueless about the gaming world of govsims. The fact that they are passing judgment on us in such an ingnorant manner is really out of line. I implore Wikipedia Admins to remove the "deletion discussion" as soon as possible.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The question isn't whether the article is <i>factual</i>, but rather whether the game is <i>notable</i> enough for its own article. That a number of passionate fans of the game have come here to "stuff the ballot box" and to counter what they perceive as an attack is all-too-common. There are thousands of games out there, all who would claim to be "unique" in some way, with some passionate fans. Should they all have their own article? Wikipedia is not a webgame directory.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Mr. Joffey, calling people ignorant does not help your cause. All we are asking you to do is to give proof that your site is notable, which you repeatedly avoid doing. It should not be that difficult; after all, this site <i>is</i> "THE MOST notable of any Government Simulator game", isn't it? Also, it is irrelevant whether or not Google picks up someone mentioning this site on a message board; that does not mean it is notable. Unless you can find a good number of <i>different</i> people on <i>different</i> boards (preferably ones with a large userbase) that have mentioned this site, then there is no notability here. Groton here also mentions that this site had been on Avidgamers (a statement which I have yet to see any evidence for); and even if it was, then why is it not <i>currently</i> there? And is that the only site that this game was on? Mr. Joffey, please give evidence supporting your claims. <a href="../../../j/a/x/User%7EJaxl_09f9.html" title="User:Jaxl">Jaxl</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/x/User_talk%7EJaxl_d9b4.html" title="User talk:Jaxl">talk</a> 14:00, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>:Not a single one of you can tell me why USG cannot have its own Wikipedia page, yet AGS and the other Govsims/Internationalsims already have their own pages? DOUBLE STANDARD.

<p>USGovSim.com was mentioned on the September 1, 2004 edition of "Cafe Politics" on WKNT Knightcast, which is student radio for the University of Central Florida. UCF is one of the largest public universities in the nation with over 40,000 students. This discussion was not advertising based and discussed government simulators in relations to the study of politics during the 2004 US Elections. If necessary, I will attempt to attain a copy of that night's show for verification. -Roary Snider, Executive Producer, Cafe Politics on Knightcast WKNT 67.8.248.211 02:48, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Unencyclopedic. Thin of noteworthiness. Has done nothing prominent, represents nothing important. All details can be put into his father's article. Just the fact that he was born a royal, does not suffice. As this boy is going to have a cousin who is the heir presumptive, thus Nikolai is not presumed to ever succeed to the Danish throne (barring unexpected events). He is the heir of his father, thus deserves article a bit better than his own younger brother, but IMO does not yet deserve it. I have earlier stated some thumb-rule criteria of royal babies having an own article, such as if the baby in question left a country in a succession crisis when dying. This boy could expect an own article when in his teens and gaining individual attention from media. Not yet. Otherwise, all the pertinent details of the child in question fit into articles of parent(s), and an own article is undeserved.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I cannot believe this is on VfD. What is that supposed to mean, "Wait until he gets the nomination"? Should we have waited until John Edwards was nominated (or as it turned out, not nominated) to make an article (Yeah, I know this is an amazingly imperfect analogy, but my point is still made at least to that extent). And "Wikipedia will have to list EVERYONE that stands for public office, ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, so as to not to have perceptable bias." That is even more ridiculous. For one, United States Senator is not "any public office anywhere in the world." Writing about a candidate for U.S. Senator is not the same about writing about a candidate for Bergen County Freeholder. Please don't make really stupid hyperbolic statements like that one. And because we make one article on bananas doesn't mean that to "be fair" or "not have bias" we have to send osmeone out to make one on every fruit ever at that moment. <a href="../../../d/g/_/User%7EDG_58ec.html" title="User:DG">D.</a> <a href="../../../d/g/_/User_talk%7EDG_200a.html" title="User talk:DG">G.</a> 04:38, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Avoid calling other persons opinions ridiculous, that does not help. To me "Everyone" means "everyone candidating to a similar public office". Is a candidate to be a candidate of the US Senate anyhow more important than a candidate in any national parliament around the world? It doesn't look like so to me. Now, here in Portugal we have 5 major parties, each presenting 230 candidates to the parliament. That's 1150 candidates. If we include minor parties that would easily double, and it would also double if "possible" candidates were included. But let's stick to a nice round 1000 figure. That was Portugal alone. Multiply that for 100 countries with similar institutions and you reach a nice round figure of 100,000 similar candidates around the worls every 4/5 years. Do we want them all? I don't. <a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENabla_d282.html" title="User:Nabla">Nabla</a> 00:09:14, 2005-08-21 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Based on what is there, there isn't sufficient reason otherwise to keep the article, and I don't know enough about Utah politics to judge whether he even has a chance to get the Democratic nomination or not.

<dd>Nonetheless "strong negative" and the strict classification of yours is original research. If you wish to cite what the books say that is another matter. Cities in Georgia is more objective fact than this... a completely different ball game. I am contesting the use of ranking in the first place. Sourced descriptions would be fine, but not a ranking. Which is why I believe it should be moved. I would also prefer you not imply that this has anything to do with it being a Shia article. The common denominator in Shia articles up for deletion seems to be your hand placed on them. My reasoning is this. I don't want anyone coming to wikipedia and being under the impression that Sunnis and Shia have some sort of ranking system for Muhammad's companions. -- the different groups will generally have different <i>views</i> and I acknowledge that, so source it and place it in context. One shia site does not mean that that view is correct. Make notable citations Striver and say whom your citing. That is my problem. I haven't editted it because I thought it was such a mess I didn't know what to do so I avoided it.

<li><b>Comment</b> This entire enterprise is 'seriously' flawed. It would be interesting to discuss the Sahaba in the context of an emerging Shia &amp; Sunni orthodoxy, particularly why different companions came to be viewed as they were (beyond the bullet point summaries here). But a laundry list like this is difficult to accept. It would be like Cathars ranking of early Saints, or Arianist ranking of the Disciples - a meaningless exercise. Would the author be willing to pen a more detailed exposition of the changing view of the Sahaba within an emerging Shia tradition, complete with proper sources and references? That would be a great article. If the article is kept, the existing content needs to be largely replaced. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 01:28, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, you've come to the right place to find co-editors.

<li><b>Move</b> I agree with Dottore So, the idea can be tweaked to be much more encyclopedic with a further discussion of the views of individual members of the Sahaba, providing reasons for just how these views came to be with sources of course. Gren is right as well: it seems "ranking" screams "POV list" and Shia Views of the Sahaba would be more appropriate. The idea of ranking gives the impression that the concept is black-and-white, when in reality it's not. <a href="../../../s/o/r/User%7ESorna_Doon_fdf4.html" title="User:Sorna Doon">Sorna Doon</a> 02:45, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>In light of the discussion above and the general agreement that seems to have emerged, I will vote to <b>Move</b> either per my own or the original suggestion, with the hope that the article will undertake a more systematic examination of how Sunni/Shia views on the Sahaba were formed, and - as importantly - the significance for both communities. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 18:14, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Unfortunately I haven't heard of him, so I can't contribute and I'd prefer to <b>abstain</b> from voting. The main problem with this is that the article was written by an anon, and he has not revealed much about this person. But a google search on the term <i>Sultan Madaris</i> reveals that that it is a reputed seminary and they have produced many notable people. He could be one, but as you rightly said, anon hasn't mentioned anything out of the ordinary. He could have been as notable as <a href="../../../s/y/e/Syed_Kalbe_Hussain_91b5.html" title="Syed Kalbe Hussain">Syed Kalbe Hussain</a>, a cleric from the same city.

<p>I don't know what this is. But it's not an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen-w_c1ef.html" title="User:Ben-w">Ben-w</a> 23:58, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. While there are only 176 Google hits on this alchemist from the 1920s and 1930s, they are from a wide variety of sources and there appears to be a fair degree of notability (keep in mind that his 15 minutes of fame ended way before the Internet was around). However, the article is very POV given that many of the sources claim that he <i>was</i> a con artist. The article needs work. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 00:09, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>cleanup</b>. The article does contain some real information, though presented in a highly POV fashion. Also agree with <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a>'s arguments. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManoaChild_4445.html" title="User:ManoaChild">ManoaChild</a> 00:15, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I've started the cleanup process. It isn't that bad really - it won't take much for someone with a knowledge of the subject to turn it into a good article. <a href="../../../o/s/o/User%7EOsomec_c7d4.html" title="User:Osomec">Osomec</a> 00:28, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b>. Another example of something that may not get many google hits, but that doesn't mean it should be deleted. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">Trollderella</a> 00:33, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per above. Interesting story. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 01:45, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Interesting article and he seems notable enough. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 01:57, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
