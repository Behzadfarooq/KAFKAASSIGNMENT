<li>Comment: Are there any stories of this person, before the "marriage". I'm somewhat concerned, that while there are ample news stories, the info on this person doesn't seem that reliable. She's repeatedly referred to as a millionaire, and as a rock concert promoter in various stories. But, I haven't found any pre-dolphin verification of this. It seems what we know about this, is only what she told tabloid reporters, who then got picked up by other reporters, but there may not be truly reliable facts on this person. I'm happy to be proven wrong on this. But, I just don't think reporters covering dolphin marriages worry to much about fact checking. I think, any decent bio seems to require one know reliablely what the occupation of the subject is, or was. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 04:34, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Based on logic from Rob. This is not an expandable stub, and has no biographical information. So although the stunt may have been notable for 15 minutes, the person is not notable.

<li>So there's no reason that someone interested in unusual marriages or human-dolphin relations should be able to read about this? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 06:24, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Kappa, the catch here is that it's not real. Saying you're marrying a dolphin, is like saying you're married to your job. Neither are legal marriages. The dolphin relationship has even less legal signficance. She loves the dolphin, how nice. Good for her. There are *huge* numbers of people who make expressions of love for animals (usually, but not only their pets), that, tooken out of context, sound rather bizarre, and amazing. I know somebody who calls her cats her "fury babies". Now, if the <i><a href="../../../w/e/e/Weekly_World_News_8c7a.html" title="Weekly World News">Weekly World News</a></i> runs the story "<i>Woman from Canada has cats as babies!</i>", shall we make an article for her? --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 06:59, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This story has been reported more far more widely than a single tabloid, enough to make it signficant in fields of interspecies relationships or unusual marriage. Anyone writing an essay or thesis on either of these topics would be likely to mention this event. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 19:06, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's *printed* widely, but there's actually little reporting that's been done. It seems a local paper covered a human interest story, the tabloids caught wind, and a single AP story got picked up (one AP story counts as scores or hundreds in Google News). But almost nothing is reliable known about Tendler, beyond unverified statements she made after the ceremony. I find claims of her being a rock concert promoter, clothing maker, and millionaire, rather dubious (but a bio article is void without such details). Also, how could this be used for researching "<i>interspecies relationships</i>". This woman lives in London, and visits Israel 2 or 3 times a year. She doesn't live with the Dolphin, and won't live with the Dolphin. Despite some puriant speculation, there's no likely "marital relations" (at least not in the "biblical" sense). She concedes there's no legal signficance to this. A basic problem here is that the same news agencies (like AP) that would srutinize bio facts for an election candidate, don't much care for fact-checking on a Dolphin story. The fact people think any knowledge of "interspecies" relationships can be gained, shows the potential harm of this article. Gossip always has many sources, but few good ones. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 19:30, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't see how anyone could be harmed by an article which explains everything you have done.

<li>I would agree with you if she had a legal marriage. As that would be the first in world in history (that I know of). But, this is as "real" as two five year olds playing marriage. Also, as a bio article (not an event article) we need verifiable biographical information on this person. I suggest, despite the huge number of stories, we don't reliably know if she's a milliionaire, rock promoter, or what she is. We really only know what she told a couple tabloids (who's stories were repeated world wide). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 06:44, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>In the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cindy_the_Dolphin_44c7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cindy the Dolphin">other AFD</a> you argued:
<dl>
<dd><i>It’s irrelevant whether the dolphin agreed to the marriage because the marriage is legal in Israel. It is the first marriage to be legal between a human and a dolphin anywhere in the world, that itself makes it notable enough for wikipedia regardless of the morals of it and the human’s stupidity.</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Well, it's now verifiably proven that the marriage is not legal. The so-called "bride" herself conceded that point. She doesn't live with Dolphin, and simply visits as a tourist 2-3 times a year, and that won't change. There's no official marriage. There's a source confirming the legal issue in the article (and *many* more available). So, the whole basis for retention is now gone. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 20:23, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm basing it on what my original argument was, which was it gained loads of media attention blah blah which makes it notable. Regardless of whether it is legal, it is still a sign of the times and a notable event which makes it an article that should be included in wikipedia. On top of that, the story is quite famous.

<li>Hi Kappa - in terms of your question I'll say that it goes in the same vain as other stuff here - for example we don't insert the insane speculation about the hollywood divorces in the pop star articles here every time it happens or every boyfriend they ever had. Some of those events might be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> but they are crufty in that they don't really have any real impact on anything. This is the same thing - yet another person who "married" an animal... it would have an actual claim to notability here if the marriage had actually taken place - but it didn't and it's variafiable that it did NOT take place and/or was not legal so the only other claim to notability is the reach of the event rather then the event itself, which as other people mentioned didn't even last for long at all since it was disproven early so it hardly had a lasting effect on society and isn't really historical in any concievable way. The reason "Sharon Tendler" doesn't need an article is precisely because there's really nothing to write about other then this minor dolphin blurb. If there was a list like "People who have claimed to marry animals" it might go there, for example. If and when she has something else to write about to write a real article THEN someone should start an article about her, but not at the moment. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">WhiteNight</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 23:32, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The result of Cindy the Dolphin was "no consensus", which automatically reverts to a "Keep". Cindy the Dolphin has now been altered to a redirect to Sharon Tendler. If this article gets deleted, then Cindy is going to redirect to nowhere. I'd suggest restoring it and putting this article in as a "See Also", then if this article survives AfD, merging the two.

<li>People seeking the Dolphin should see this article, so they know there is an AFD, and can participate. If this is deleted, the dolphin article (unfortunately) would survive, but would be subject to yet another AFD if somebody wishes (due to lack of prior consensus and new information coming to light). But, I do agree, no backdoor deletion should occur. Without a dolphin-specific AFD consensus delete, the dolphin lives, even if his bride perishes here. Anyway, it's all moot if this article is kept. Also note, there's really no more merging left to do. The dolphin article has no verifiable facts that this one doesn't. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 00:26, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Sham marriage, dolphin recently proved not of legal age. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 03:21, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I voted "keep pending verification" on Cindy the Dolphin, but as Rob points out, this is not a legal marriage at all. Thus, it's equivalent to a farmer "marrying" his cow. Funny story, but of no real significance. If this results in a deletion, I'll renominate Cindy the Dolphin too. <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color: #33C;">howch</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0F0"><i>e</i></span></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color:#33C">ng</span></a></b> <small>{<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">chat</a>}</small></span> 17:17, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
