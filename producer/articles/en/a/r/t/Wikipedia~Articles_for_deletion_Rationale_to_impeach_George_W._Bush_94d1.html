<li><b>Keep</b>, first show how this is a POV article. That has already been discussed and disproven.

Bush">original article</a> would make that too long.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'll admit my first reaction was "Huh?" but at a glance it looks well-referenced. Maybe merge to <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a> and break out some other section, such as public opinion? The title Public opinion on the movement to impeach George W.

<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>rename</b> and <b>clean up</b>. This article was split out from <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W.

This article should be moved to a title that reflects that these are the reasons being put forth by people in the movement, not just "hey, it's a good idea because..." statements floating out there in the mists of emprical truth. Something like Rationale provided by persons advocating the impeachment of George W. Bush.

<li><b>Delete</b>, obviously POV, but as per EricR it seems like OR as well. It also seems a bit self-contradictory in parts, although of course this isn't the place to consider those issues. I'd go along with the others advocating a merge and move, but in that case that would require such a fundamental rewrite of this article that maybe it's best to clean the slate. --<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 14:53, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Since the legal criteria for Impeachment is the very broad "high crimes and misdemeanors", any categorization of a criticism under "rationale for impeachment" amounts to a POV argument that his actions rise to the level of impeachment.

<li>Hesitant "keep, <b>rename</b>, and improve" per BD2412. Although this is not a good article, it is easily the best one we have in the subject area, and I think deleting it at this time would be a mistake. The article on its own has POV issues, but this is the most NPOV article we have on the subject. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 20:36, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, rename, improve</b> - Most of the "charges" here are from the fringe, but describing why certain (mostly fringe) activists want to impeach Bush is interesting, encyclopedic, and notable. They are significant enough to attract mainstream media coverage. However, the title is POV, and the article needs a little more work to make it clear it is about certain people's political beliefs, and not a platform for them. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 21:06, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are conflating organizations which have criticized or challenged President Bush's activities with ones which have actually called for his impeachment. These are two very different things.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think that depends on how you define <i>serious</i>. There have been a number of scholars and one major magazine which have put forth arguments that his activities rise to the level of impeachable, and a very few Democrats in congress have publically stated that they feel that he should be. It appears to be a small, but not fringe, segment of US left-wing politics which is in favor at this time of doing so. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 17:10, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article doesn't claim it to be a single movement, it just shows reasons that some people believe George Bush should be impeached. Given that there are many people calling for his impeachment, including members of Congress, the idea is notable. Many people site these reasons, or some of them as reasons why they want Bush impeached. If the information presented is incorrect, it should be corrected, not deleted. If it is POV(and I definitly agree that it is), it should be made NPOV, not deleted. Also, though I'm not a contributer to this particular article, I do think it would be nice if you focused on describing why the article should be delted rather than assuming bad faith and making <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attacks on its editors. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowoftime_3763.html" title="User:Shadowoftime">Shadowoftime</a> 03:51, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, no member of Congress has called for the president's impeachment.

Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a>, only asserts that 31 members have called for an investigation into <i>possible grounds</i> for impeachment. Second, the POV nature of this article can not be cured by any editing. The very act of including an alleged misdeed under this heading is by definition POV (either of an editor or a partisan outside source) since no actual articles of impeachment have even been propsed in draft form. Note that all the alleged misdeeds cited in this article already have their own articles. If there is any basis at all for having this content in wikipedia, the article <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W.

<dd>Hold the phone! Several arguments are presented and none of them apply.
<dl>
<dd><b>1</b> Organizing the rationale that has been put forward by many, and certainly not limited to the fringe as can be seen by my explicit naming these, hardly constitutes an anti-Bush agenda.</dd>
<dd><b>2</b> Since I started the page I admit I have a POV (who doesn't) that is exactly why I said: <i>Feel free to improve that article.</i> To those of us that <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> this evidently means, "if you find any incorrect information or the article is POV, please help by adding information to make the page NPOV". By asserting I only want this page to be POV indeed assumes bad faith and is a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>.</dd>
<dd><b>3</b> There is no suggestion in the article of impeachment proceedings being started. It is a collection of arguments used by several individuals and organisations of reasons they think suffice to start such proceedings. However, if that is not evident please help to rephrase it in a way that this is clear. And yes, congress members support investigating the possibility. To suggest that two geeks after a binge last friday night (metaphorically speaking), decided this would be a good prank is absolutely ridiculous.</dd>
<dd><b>4</b> Regarding the suggestion these things are already discussed this is incorrect. First, criticism is not equivalent to impeachable offenses. To discuss both in one article is unwarranted. Second, although it is possible to make a comment in every separate article this is of course a ludicrous idea. Somebody who would like to know what these offense are certainly won't find it. Making a comprehensive list only accomodates these users. Furthermore, what exactly is your problem with this article?

<dd>If I may interject, I thinkg the problem here is that the topic is just too large, empirically. That is, there are numerous substantial organizations approaching impeachment from significantly different angles. Also, there are numerous rationales for impeachment, that run the gamut from neglect of duty (Hurricane Katrina) to giving false information to the Senate (Iraq War), to breaking the laws passed by congress (FISA), to name a few. These things don't compress very well, so solid and bold editing really isn't going to make an article about the movement <i>and</i> the rationale a reasonable size. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin Baas</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_baas_1af8.html" title="User talk:Kevin baas">talk</a></sup> 23:28, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article is about a POV held by certain people. I'm sure this point of view can be reported on without having the article itself be POV.

The disagreement to me seems centered on whether it's notable to have a separate article for the rationale behind that movement, or whether they should be in the same article. As you can't really separate the movement from why they want to act, I think that a strong case should be made that they should be merged back again.

<dd>The phrase that you're looking for, Georgewilliamherber, is <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a>. However, I do not see anyway that that could apply here. Were you are were you not arguing that articles should be merged and then trimmed to fit the size constraints, as a matter of principle? That's how I read it. Though I concede that there is some interpretation there, so I might be wrong. The safest way is to go with a variation of <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">Occam's Razor</a>, and restate what you said with out alteration. However, to demonstrate how the argument would apply in what is theoretically an equivocable context, he choose a different example. This is a common and, in my opinion, fairly polite way to show someone their bias. But in good faith, perhaps you were misinterpreted. Perhaps your argument was more centered around "you can't really separate the movement from why they want to act". That would make your recent response make sense. The reason why I, and I would venture to say Nomen, didn't think that was the center, was because it is weak, perhaps the weakest part of the argument, and one usually picks the strongest part as the center. There are two reasons it is weak: 1. It is completely unsubstantiated. why can't you? what prevents you from doing so? 2. It is directly contradicted by the very existence of the thing that we are discussing: it IS separated. There can be no better proof that it indeed can be separated than it being separated. ... regarding retraction and apology, wikipedia has a strong policy on personal attacks, and i very much agree with it, but i don't see any personal attacks there. I don't see what he would apologize for. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin Baas</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_baas_1af8.html" title="User talk:Kevin baas">talk</a></sup> 18:20, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Sometimes, when an article gets long, a section of the article is made into its own article, and the handling of the subject in the main article is condensed to a brief summary. This is completely normal Wikipedia procedure; the new article is sometimes called a "spinout" or "spinoff" of the main article, see for example wikipedia:summary style, which explains the technique. Even if the subject of the new article is controversial, this does not automatically make the new article a POV fork.
