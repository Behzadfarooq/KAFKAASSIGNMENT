<p>I recommend this Australian psychedelic trance project's article should be removed if the following can be established: That playing "to countless festivals &amp; parties around the globe including Japan, Portugal, Sweden, New Zealand, Switzerland, Holland, France &amp; Belgium" since 1997 does not count as an international concert tour. Because otherwise it meets none of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">Music notability criteria</a>. It has 536 unique google hits, but that is the approximate number of psychedelic trance junkies who log into blogs. The sole individual behind the artistic project, Paul McCosh, gets 39 unique google hits. The project released two albums on Boom! Records, a label which has released a total of 19 albums. It is not mentioned on All Music Guide. 216.119.136.157 02:45, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Meets the 2 album requirement (see <a href="http://www.users.bigpond.com/fractalglider/music2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.users.bigpond.com/fractalglider/music2.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> for complete discography). I hereby disclose that I am the author of this article. -<a href="../../../l/d/_/User%7ELd_4f39.html" title="User:Ld">Ld</a> | <a href="../../../l/d/_/User_talk%7ELd_dfe2.html" title="User talk:Ld">talk</a> 02:52, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The criterion's requirement is fulfilled not just by the artist releasing two albums. The label on which it is released must be major or an important independent label with other notable artists. As I already said, Boom! Records, Fractal Glider's label, has released a total of 19 albums including Fractal Glider's two, and not including, I should add, any other notable artists.
<ul>
<li>Of course, using circular logic you assume other artists who have released on this label are not notable as well. In fact, those artists include Rastaliens, Logic Bomb, Battle of the Future Buddhas, Chi Ad, Cosmoon, and Ubar Tmar. -<a href="../../../l/d/_/User%7ELd_4f39.html" title="User:Ld">Ld</a> | <a href="../../../l/d/_/User_talk%7ELd_dfe2.html" title="User talk:Ld">talk</a> 04:40, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How is that circular logic? Do any of those bands satisfy the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">notability guidelines for musicians</a>? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> 04:48, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Indeed. For instance, Logic Bomb has 2 albums released on <a href="../../../t/i/p/TIP_World_a237.html" title="TIP World">TIP World</a> and Spiral Trax (two of the bigger psytrance labels). Chi Ad has 3 albums released 2 of them on Nova Tekk (a well-known German label). Finally, Fractal Glider is fairly represantative of the psychedelic trance scene in Australia. -<a href="../../../l/d/_/User%7ELd_4f39.html" title="User:Ld">Ld</a> | <a href="../../../l/d/_/User_talk%7ELd_dfe2.html" title="User talk:Ld">talk</a> 04:59, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Neither Logic Bomb and Chi Ad have released <i>individual</i> albums on Boom! Records, they have only allowed some of their songs to be released on <i>compilation</i> albums, so Boom! Records is still <b>not an "important indie label"</b> according to the criterion. And being "fairly represantative" of the psychedelic trance scene in Australia is <b>not the same</b> as having "become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both)" <b>which is the text of that different criterion</b>. Wikipedia has to draw a line at creating new entire music articles somewhere. 216.119.144.33 08:09, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ld, you haven't established the notability of the bands you've listed as "notable" on Fractal Glider's label, you've only made articles for them. What's more to the point is the actual text of the criterion: <b>"Has released two or more albums</b> on a major label or <b>one of the more</b> <i><b>important</b></i> <b>indie labels (i.e.</b> an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a <b>roster of performers</b>, <i><b>many</b></i> of which are notable) [emphasis mine]. You list 6 bands. Only 4 of them have released actual albums for Boom! Records (FG's label). The other two have individual songs on <i>compilation</i> albums for that label. Of the 4 with actual albums, they all have fewer google hits than Fractal Glider does [run with the name of the band and the word "trance"]! Ubar Tmar, admittedly is in the All Music Guide and the only one there, but he no longer releases albums with Boom! Records and besides, he would be only <i>one</i> notable performer rather than the <i>many</i> that is required for meeting the criterion. 216.119.144.33 08:09, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please see <a href="http://www.overdrive.com.au/flyers/dreamscape2003.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.overdrive.com.au/flyers/dreamscape2003.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, where it clearly states "FRACTAL GLIDER (Melbourne) returning to Cairns after a <b>hectic international tour</b> launching his new Digital Mandala Cd throughout Japan, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Switzland, Portugal, Hungary and Austria." -<a href="../../../l/d/_/User%7ELd_4f39.html" title="User:Ld">Ld</a> | <a href="../../../l/d/_/User_talk%7ELd_dfe2.html" title="User talk:Ld">talk</a> 16:17, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><strike><b>Delete</b>. Does not meet notability guidelines for musicians.</strike> <b>Keep</b>. Recent edits establish notability, particularly the international tour. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> 16:02, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, though it would have been easier to vote this way if there was more there there. For an outfit of this type, "festivals and parties" is exactly how one measures success. <a href="../../../j/g/m/User%7EJgm_096b.html" title="User:Jgm">Jgm</a> 04:53, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Two albums is more than enough. And also, I would say that playing multiple gigs on several continents in the course of a year or two counts as the equivalent of a tour. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 05:36, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But it's not over the course of a year or two. Its over the course of <i>eight</i> years. McCosh says he started in 1997. 216.119.144.33 08:09, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, just under the bar of notability. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 05:49, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, if just under the bar of notability, but still together/producing music, and meeting the musician criteria of 2 or more albums, should keep. <a href="../../../s/r/c/User%7ESrcastic_abc8.html" title="User:Srcastic">Srcastic</a> 06:27, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But it doesn't meet the criterion <i>of</i> notability, <i>because</i> Boom! Records isn't an important enough label according to the same stated criterion you mention. See above. Should we change your vote to delete to reflect this? 216.119.144.33 08:09, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, but thanks for asking - I still vote to Keep. I admit that from the newspaper research I have done, it seems that they are more of a regional group, notable for their influence in an underground genre of music (that I know little about), but that they are considered influential in that genre seems to weigh for keeping them in. There may be an argument for merging them with the genre they are a part of, but there is little argument for eliminating them altogether. <a href="../../../s/r/c/User%7ESrcastic_abc8.html" title="User:Srcastic">Srcastic</a> 09:10, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable band, albums should be released by an established label or they don't count. Just like books published by 'vanity press' do not count for a writer. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 08:49, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
