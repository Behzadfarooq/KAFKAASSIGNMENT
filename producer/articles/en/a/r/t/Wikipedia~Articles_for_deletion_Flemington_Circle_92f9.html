<li>Now hold on there. This is definitely a notable road feature, if not an infamous one. Technically, it's in Raritan Township, not Flemington. And, you can't go purely by the population of the town. In New Jersey all of the towns seem to run together. There are many, many more than 4,000 people living in the area. <a href="../../../a/e/v/User%7EAeverett_b346.html" title="User:Aeverett">Al</a> 19:25, 29 September 2005 (UTC) <b>Keep</b>
<ul>
<li>How am I supposed to know from the article? Here in Britain there are tens of thousands of roundabouts, dozens in each town. The article should mention why that particular roundabout would be of importance to a non-local, otherwise it has to go. Is it the first in New Jersey or a known accident blackspot? Please note that I am aware of <i>two</i> British roundabouts in here, the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_Roundabout_%28Swindon%29_3124.html" title="Magic Roundabout (Swindon)">Magic Roundabout (Swindon)</a> and the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_Roundabout_%28Hemel_Hempstead%29_56ac.html" title="Magic Roundabout (Hemel Hempstead)">Magic Roundabout (Hemel Hempstead)</a>. <s>129.215.194.205</s> <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 19:37, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article as it stands is a stub, and therefore patently incomplete. If we were to delete all incomplete articles on Wikipedia as soon as we noticed them, a new article would be a rare thing. And the fact that no one has seen fit to add a comparable set of articles on British roundabouts is neither here nor there. It's not the fault of <i>this</i> article. The correct solution is to add them, not to delete other articles out of some misplaced sense of "fairness". <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 21:41, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Add <i>highway junctions</i>? This is insane! <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 21:41, 30 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why not? We have webcomics here, for instance. I guarantee you that more people have been directly affected by the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerville_Circle_cd91.html" title="Somerville Circle">Somerville Circle</a> than have ever even read a webcomic. When people moved to the area from out-of-state, negoitating the traffic circles was often the <i>very first thing</i> they'd remark on.<i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 22:16, 30 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But they wouldn't remark on this particular exhibit, unless they were local to the area. There is a section (than can probably be expanded) in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traffic_circle.html" title="Traffic circle">Traffic circle</a> on the Twenties-built NJ roundabouts, that's where the information belongs. And I have seen a slew of webcomics on VfD in the last few days. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 23:00, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think they probably would, but you've never had to take the Flemington Circle to get to anywhere I've lived. But I think I agree with you that a section (or article) discussing them collectively and singling out prominent ones is a good idea; better than seperate articles. I had hoped for some future historical information which I do not have access to, but was assured was available, and have been somewhat disappointed that they have not been developed further. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 23:31, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>It is sometimes amazing to me the things that get to have the "notable" tag around here (e.g., <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fish_on_stamps_of_the_Falkland_Islands_f1e3.html" title="List of fish on stamps of the Falkland Islands">List of fish on stamps of the Falkland Islands</a>). Anyway, I would support Traffic circles in New Jersey as TCC describes. It is a unique feature of New Jersey roadways. It might do to have an article on that unique Jersey road feature of the <i>jughandle</i> too, but none of them are named nor are any particularly notorious. <a href="../../../a/e/v/User%7EAeverett_b346.html" title="User:Aeverett">Al</a> 12:22, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a very heavily travelled roadway, one of the few remaining intact traffic circles in New Jersey, and certainly is therefore notable. Besides, to call Flemington a "village of 4000 people", as if those who lived in the borough were the only local inhabitants, is to ignore the rather dense suburban housing of the surrounding area. But even if the borough were all there were to it, it's a historically significant locale. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 20:57, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please remember <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a>. Calling the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> contributions of other editors "ridiculous" is not civil. If Dr. Who fans can indulge their every tiny interest on Wikipedia, I don't see the problem with granting a little of the same courtesy to traffic engineers and those who are interested in that subject. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 18:29, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>It isn't personal at all. Claims of "notability" and "not notable" can only ever be judged on a relative scale by personal POV. Civil engineering topics are, in my opinion, far more notable than obscure details of a British television series that only fans will recognize. I never proposed deleting such Dr. Who trivia, only that the reasons for keeping it are similar to the reasons for keeping items like this fine article. We're having this discussion because we have POV differences, and Wikipedia is supposed to be NPOV. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 21:50, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is personal because you based what you said on what you perceive about me and how I edit wikipedia. It's a matter of scale and if you think a traffic circle is a major piece of civil engineering, that's fine, we are all entitled to opinions. I find it extremely minor. What you call "obscure details" have so far formed three featured articles, because there is much to write about a television programme that has been around for over 40 years. This traffic circle is hardly in the same league of fame, which had it not been given a name noone would know of. I have the same opinion of the "obscure detail" of Doctor Who and if you don't believe me you can check out <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Doctor_Constantine_a629.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Doctor Constantine">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Doctor Constantine</a>. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimPope_0d3a.html" title="User:TimPope">TimPope</a> 22:09, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It still isn't personal, it's a simple comparison of POV. If you hadn't called someone else's good faith contribution "ridiculous", I wouldn't need to compare POVs to make a point. You're welcome to your own opinion of what is appropriate for an article, but your incivility is very unwelcome. Again, I don't really care how many featured articles come from your interest set, but calling someone else's good faith contribution "ridiculous" is just plain wrong. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 23:50, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>From <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>: <i>starting a comment: "Not to make this personal, but..."</i> is a serious breach of civility. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimPope_0d3a.html" title="User:TimPope">TimPope</a> 17:30, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It <u>still</u> isn't personal nor is it uncivil. If you're not willing to calmly and rationally debate the relative notability of subjects you're interested in as compared to those that others are interested in, then simply don't use "ridiculous" or "not notable" as your argument to delete. Comparison of our POVs regarding notability, when notability is used as the reason to advocate deletion of retention of an article, is neither personal, nor an attack; its the <u>only</u> avenue available for debate. You've taken words from a policy completely out of context. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 19:02, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
