<li><b>Delete</b> - article was previously nominated and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cultural_depictions_of_Sammy_Davis%2C_Jr._946e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cultural depictions of Sammy Davis, Jr.">closed</a> with no consensus. There has been little improvement to the article in the intervening time. The article remains an indiscriminate list and directory seeking to capture any time the words "Sammy Davis Jr" are mentioned in any film, song, TV show or podcast. Reasons offered for keeping last time boiled down to "there are other articles like it" which is not a good reason for keeping an article and a suggestion that the article be "cleaned up" and "verified," which did not happen.

<li>My opinion on that would be that the only part of it that <i>might</i> possibly be acceptable in the main article is a list of the people who played him.

<li><b>Keep</b>. As the editor who created Wikipedia's <a href="../../../f/l/_/WP%7EFL_362d.html" title="WP:FL">featured list</a> called <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_depictions_of_Joan_of_Arc_d22a.html" title="Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc">Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc</a> I can see what this editor has been trying to do here. I've reorganized it a bit and removed the lone podcast. The other entries are notable and verifiable. Actual verification would help, as would a clearer inclusion criteria: depictions of Sammy Davis Jr. ought not to include instances where he acted or sang. Wikipedia has plenty of articles of this sort of varying quality. Slap a cleanup template on this rather than delete. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 13:05, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is simply no comparison between the Joan of Arc list and this one. And as noted in the nomination, "<a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERSTUFFEXISTS_ee3f.html" title="WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS">Wikipedia has plenty of articles of this sort</a>" is not really a good reason for keeping. Many of those articles, including the ones linked to in the nom and dozens more, have been deleted for the same reasons this one should be. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:57, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No comparison? Have a look at the featured list's embryonic form as it was on October 26, 2005 (two days before I started editing).<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joan_of_Arc&amp;oldid=26535630#Trivia" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joan_of_Arc&amp;oldid=26535630#Trivia" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Doesn't look promising, does it? Wikipedia has a large contingent of deletionists who probably would have jettisoned that material from the project. A similar wholesale deletion actually happened at <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, but fortunately a deletionist was conscientious enough to repost the material to the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlexander_the_Great_Archive7_41d9.html#In_Popular_Culture" title="Talk:Alexander the Great/Archive7">talk page</a> so that it could <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_depictions_of_Alexander_the_Great_d3a1.html" title="Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great">get rescued</a> as a separate list. Where's the dividing line? The facts on this page are notable and verifiable - maybe not so highbrow by today's standards, but exactly the sort of information typically discarded as ephemera until it's nearly impossible for later generations of scholars to recover it. In the late twentieth century it took a <i>doctoral dissertation</i> to track down all occurrences of Joan of Arc in film. Many of the early prints no longer exist at all. Electrons are cheap - let's not repeat that destructive cycle. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 03:15, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Electrons are cheap" is also not particularly compelling. We have policies and guidelines and articles that don't meet them are deleted regardless of how cheap electrons are. And no, there is no comparison between the JoA or the ATG lists and this one, which seeks to capture such vitally significant items as Adam Sandler's singing the name in a song, which is in no way notable. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:46, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sarcasm is not particularly compelling. Social historians read such data as evidence that this individual remains known to younger generations. One of the principal questions such people must address is whether a celebrity of the past is a forgotten name or an iconic figure. If one happens to be a biographer preparing a book proposal about Sammy Davis, Jr., the ability to cite recent references such as Adam Sandler's is quite meaningful. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 00:07, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I wasn't being sarcastic at all. Perhaps that word doesn't mean what you think it means. And may I also add, free of sarcasm, that if any writer proposing or publisher considering a book proposal about Sammy would even <i>mention</i> the Adam Sandler song in the course of the negotiations, let alone sell the book on it, I'll eat Sammy's glass eye. "Oh yeah, all the kids'll be running out to snap up the book based on their intense curiosity about Sammy that was ignited by Adam Sandler's throwaway line in a novelty song!" <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:14, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Durova. She had shown these list are inherently doomed and the suggesting to clean up and maintain the list is much better than to delete the text and see the references to jump back into the article. Those who disagree with this kind of articles have chance as anybody else to propose effective Wikipedia policy to deal with them (including 3RR &amp; blocks). It would be much better than to move even more burden on maintainers of the main article. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 09:25, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Basically you're arguing <a href="../../../b/h/t/WP%7EBHTT_103f.html" title="WP:BHTT">better in a separate article than in the main article</a> because it's more convenient for the people who monitor the main article. That is a terrible argument. If the information is garbage, then it's garbage no matter what article it's in. All splitting it off does is shift the responsibility from one group of editors to another. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 15:13, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
