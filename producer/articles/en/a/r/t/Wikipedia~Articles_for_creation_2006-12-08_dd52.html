<p>Heesok Chang is a formidable English professor under the auspices of Vassar College, in Poughkeepsie, NY. He is noted for his awe-inspiring knowledge of the Modernist writing movement. If asked, Heesok Chang will overwhelm a student or layman with myriad citations of theory, textual examinations, and pure, unalloyed insight into the Modernist texts in question. He is the author of one definite book on Modernism and is currently working on another. His personal life is shrouded in mystery, but it is known that he was born and raised in Canada, and enjoys hockey to this day. He also owns a small Chihuahua, and is an excellent pet owner. Heesok Chang is a fashionable dresser, and an aloof conversationalist, but is nonetheless transcendent.</p>

<p>The man who invented the first torpedo was Captain David Bushnell, who tried it out in New York Harbour in 1776. Bushell named it after the torpedo fish, a ray with an electric apparatus for killing its prey. Bushnell's torpedo comprised an explosive charge fixed to an enemy hull and was set-off by a clockwork fuse. These early torpedoes were stationary devices which exploded against vessels and were later classified as mines.</p>

<p>Speaking Up as a Cambridge Charity and social enterprise is one of the largest providers of advocacy services in the United Kingdom for people with disabilities. It is also dedicated to facilitating self-advocacy to empower those who are excluded by societal barriers. Moreover, supporting people with disabilities to develop their confidence and find their voice. Enabling people to build up the skills to assert themselves not only on immediate decisions, but for the rest of their futures. Speaking up does this through a range of different projects, from individual advocacy; intensive skills courses; localised forums on public services; work with young people in special schools and external training to service managers. All of which is directed by disabled user-led feedback from those involved.</p>
<p>Speaking Up has recently launched several publications. The largest one being a Big Box; a large resource of intercative activities as well as a facilitators toolkit on how to deliver each module. This resource targets young people and supports them to develop esteem, confidence and communication. It was actually developed as a result of direct consultation with young people across 9 schools and colleges and the tried and tested actvities they enjoyed.</p>
<p>Also published are a range of life guides, written by and for people with learning difficulties. These range from issues of bereavment to making choices to sex and sexuality.</p>

<p>“We are delighted to have Speaking Up at our school… the work they do with our young people gives them the confidence to voice their opinions both to other young people and to adults. We feel it makes them ready for the world of adulthood and equipped to leave school with the power to go out and say ‘this is what I want, listen to me”.

<p>Borovo naselje is a Vukovar borough located on the right bank of the Danube river in the Croatian region of Slavonia, 4 km northwest of Vukovar town centre; elevation 90 m. Economy is based on rubber and shue industries.</p>
<p><br />
Borovo Naselje was built around the Borovo factory, it grew and finally merged with Vukovar. Borovo Naselje sprung up around the rubber products factory, built and owned by Tomáš Baťa before the World War II. The entire town was built around the factory to provide housing and other necessary institutions for the employees. After Borovo Naselje merged with Vukovar, it shed its name and became a part of Vukovar, but it's still known as Borovo naselje among the locals.</p>
<p>Borovo Naselje was also known for its vast sporting infrastructure and facilities that were some of the best in the former Yugoslavia. It was home to tennis facilities, swimming pools, an aerosport club, football clubs and fields, boxing and karate facility as well as a main indoor sports arena, which hosted sometimes even held national Yugoslavian and international matches. Since the war much of these once grand sporting facilities lie in tatters and ruin and are slowly being rebuilt.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-08_dd52.html" title="Edit section: Mirza Hasan Askari">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mirza Hasan Askari</span></h2>
<p>Mirza Hasan Askari was born in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi.html" title="Delhi">Delhi</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>. After schooling in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi.html" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>, he did his graduation from <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucknow.html" title="Lucknow">Lucknow</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">University</a> in 1944 and joined the Indian army's public relations section. He was a direct descendent of <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Syed_Ahmed_Khan_5cc0.html" title="Sir Syed Ahmed Khan">Sir Syed Ahmed Khan</a>.</p>
<p>Released from the army at the end of the war, he joined The Statesman, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi.html" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>, and worked there for a year before joining Dawn, Delhi, as a senior reporter. Migrating to Pakistan, M.H. Askari worked with Radio Pakistan's news department for several years, but later went back to Inter-Services <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Relations_94f2.html" title="Public Relations">Public Relations</a>.</p>
<p>In 1962 he was the Chief Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Agricultural Development Corporation.</p>
<p>In 1972, M.H. Askari was posted as press counsellor at the Pakistan embassy in Paris and later was minister for press at the high commission in New Delhi. When he settled in Karachi in 1980, he renewed his association with Dawn as a columnist and then as assistant editor, specializing in South Asian affairs. Even after he left Dawn, he continued to write a weekly column for the paper.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Close to the literary circles of his time, M.H. Askari had kept company with eminent writers and was himself a writer of short stories. He was a founder member of the Pakistan Writers Guild.</p>
<p>Although his first love was short story writing, he was a wide-awake <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalist.html" title="Journalist">journalist</a>. He kept abreast of contemporary thinking. Liberal at heart, his sympathies for the underdog could never be missed. It would be difficult to label him a leftist. He was too</p>
<p>He was very close friends with the eminent poet <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faiz_Ahmed_Faiz_62af.html" title="Faiz Ahmed Faiz">Faiz Ahmed Faiz</a> who used to shun all other accomodation when in Paris, and stayed with Askari instead.</p>
<p>He was an avid reader and his English prose was simple and functional, suitable for serious journalism. In mid-1980s he returned to journalism. He wrote leaders and a column in a leading newspaper. In his column, he usually chose South Asian subjects. In the journalistic fraternity, he was regarded as a specialist on South Asian themes. He wrote columns, usually on India-Pakistan subjects, to the last week of his life, though he had left leader writing and instead became one of editorial consultants of <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_9d97.html" title="Oxford University">Oxford University</a> Press.</p>
<p>He was a social animal par excellence, was in great demand by those who threw parties for the highbrows. His presence enhanced the parties. The 1990s saw Askari also as an activist. He became, in view of his fascination with South Asian peace and progress, a member of Pakistan-India People’s Forum for Peace and Democracy quite early. When its sister organisation, the Pakistan Peace Coalition, was formed in 2000, Askari joined that too. For two decades, MH campaigned for normalisation of relations between India and Pakistan with a view to developing it into a grassroots level friendship.</p>
<p>He was a great believer in a true people-to-people rapprochement. He thought it was vital for Pakistan as well as the people of all South-Asia. Consequently, he was a great believer in the utility, indeed necessity, of SAARC. Its success alone could lift South-Asia out of its slough of underdevelopment and poverty. This was the leitmotif of most of his columns.</p>
<p>He wrote and spoke at seminars on these themes at some length. Insofar as these goals were concerned, he was a committed person and went on campaigning for them. His was a restless spirit and, although he spent so many decades doing PR work, he was never cynical, nor, of course, naive. He would always appeal to the rationality of people rather than to their prejudices.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife. Nafees and three children Sherry, Lala Rukh and Ali Hasan Aksari.</p>

<p>Like most fungi, Serpula lacrymans grows by elongation and branching of delicate filaments called hyphae. The overall mass of hyphae is known as the mycelium and this may appear as white fluffy growths or as pearly grey or white sheets, depending on the humidity. There are often tinges of lilac and patches of bright lemon yellow. During active growth, the advancing hyphal edge forms a silky fringe. Serpula lacrymans is light in weight, crumbles under the fingers and has a dull brown colour. It removes the fresh or resinous smell of sound wood.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-08_dd52.html" title="Edit section: UCKG From a UK Perspective">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">UCKG From a UK Perspective</span></h2>
<p>The wikipedia article on the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God would seem to have been written from a Brazilian perspective, and perhaps by a writer who prefers to concentrate on material rather than spiritual values.</p>
<p>It contains both facts and misunderstandings about this modern global church, which is now active in over 90 countries around the world. Rather than address the errors one by one, the aim of this article is to capture both the spirit of the church and its spiritual values, on the basis of its activities in the UK. As a human organisation it is always working to improve, however it is inspired and motivated by the Divine, and so it achieves much good.</p>
<p>In Britain and Europe UCKG has two simple objectives, to  advance the Christian faith  implement general charitable purposes</p>
<p>UCKG’s values are those of the Bible, and particularly the New Testament. They call for honesty in all business and personal dealings, respect for oneself and other people, especially parents, a high standard of morality, and above all, love for God. Its bishops and pastors do not add to or take away from the Bible but make it relevant and applicable to modern day life, so that it is more meaningful for church members and the community. They follow Jesus’ instruction to go out into the world and tell the good news of Christianity and its message of hope.</p>
<p>The result is that UCKG is honourable in all its activities, seeks to do good, and reaches out to all who need help and all who will listen.</p>
<p>As a Pentecostal church UCKG puts great trust in the Holy Spirit, which brought strength and courage to Jesus’ disciples and apostles a few weeks after the crucifixion [which we commemorate at Easter]. It believes that many of the benefits and blessings that the earliest Christians received are available to today’s believers.</p>
<p>UCKG believes strongly in connecting directly to God without formal religious ceremonies getting in the way. This frees members to get close to God in an informal and relaxed environment where they can focus on what He is saying. Man-made religious traditions and practices found in other Christian denominations are bypassed, however UCKG occasionally uses symbolism to illustrate a point and teach the people.</p>
<p>The church is highly adaptive, listening to and identifying the needs of its members and as a result many of them see great benefits. These may be at a purely spiritual level or may be material as well. UCKG offers extensive practical help – relating to training and jobs; in the form of counselling and support; through work with the UK’s national blood transfusion services and through social activities. UCKG believes people are entitled to a good life here as well as in the hereafter.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-08_dd52.html" title="Edit section: Richard John Bayntun Hippisley (1865-1956)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Richard John Bayntun Hippisley (1865-1956)</span></h2>
<p>Richard John Bayntun Hippisley was born in Ston Easton, Somerset in 1956, the only son of John 'Ivan' Hippisley and Christine Ellen Lydia Boodé, a granddaughter of Admiral Sir Henry William Bayntun. Richard Hippisley, or Bayntun, as he was known, attended Rugby School in Warwickshire from 1880 to 1882 and Faraday House in London where he studied engineering and mathematics. His grandfather, known as the "Old Squire", was a member of many of Europe's leading scientific societies, and Bayntun inherited this interest in science.</p>
<p>When his father died on 6th February 1885, Bayntun, aged nineteen, became heir to the family's estates. The Hippisley family had been Lords of the Manor of Ston Easton since 1544, and Bayntun inherited these estates upon the death of his grandfather in 1898.</p>
<p>Bayntun married Constance Amy Francis on 4th January 1905 in Tiverton, Devon. She was born in Tiverton in about 1876 and was the daughter of Augustus Lawrence Francis and Emily Constance Unwin. Bayntun and Constance had three children together - John Preston, born 19th October 1905; Christine Elizabeth, born 30th September 1908, and Claude Francis Bayntun, born 28th September 1910.</p>
<p>Bayntun became interested in wireless telegraphy and in 1913 was appointed a member of the War Office Committee on Wireless Telegraphy. In September 1914 Bayntun and Edward Russell Clarke, a fellow amateur, were recruited by Sir Alfred Ewing, who had been appointed by Churchill to run the Admiralty's codebreaking team based in 'Room 40'. Hippisley and Clarke were sent to Hunstanton to set up a wireless station, which became known as 'Hippisley's Hut'. They subsequently set up a string of stations around the British Isles as well as in Italy and Malta.</p>
<p>Bayntun was awarded the O.B.E. in 1918 and the C.B.E. in 1937. He died in 1956 and was described in his obituary as "an almost unique personality" who "inherited a remarkable mechanical and scientific gift, which put him in the forefront, if not ahead, of most of his contemporaries". He was also described as "one of the men who really won the war."</p>

<p>Skip Farlow is a thirty year old gas station worker. He is a fictional character in the short running comic series "Godwin is for Haters" The series, which was only printed for three days in Virginia, was cancelled due to a local school, Miles E. Godwin High School, complaining that the name was offensive. Skip was half black half asian. He enjoyed Pokemon, Magic, and many other card games designated for five year olds. It is said that he is based off of a thirty year old senior at Jackson High School. Skip believed that books were the work of the devil, so he never learned to read. His big catchphrase was "Well that's a poopfest."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-08_dd52.html" title="Edit section: Error Rounding">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Error Rounding</span></h2>
<p>When scientific data has an estimate for its error attached to it, it may limit the need for retaining all of its digits both in the error and in the number it refers to (called the "central value" here). Indeed the results of data after processing by computers typically has 16 digits many of which can often be removed without degrading the data.</p>
<p>It is often desirable to convert such data (by removing digits) to the form that will be most efficient for human memory, legibility, typing space, ink use, etc..</p>
<p>That process of removing digits almost harmlessly, from the "central value" and its error, based on the size of the error, is called "error rounding" here.</p>
<p>We use two types of error rounding: "1.5 digit" and "2 digit".</p>
<p>"1.5 digit error rounding" (actually 0.5 to 1.5 digits): First map the error to the interval [03.55,35.5) by moving it's decimal point. Then "round to nearest" to an integer in the interval [4,35].</p>
<p>"2 digit error rounding" (actually 1.0 to 2.0 digits): Same as above except the appropriate intervals are: (0,infinity)--&gt;[09.55,95.5)--&gt;[10,95]</p>
<p>(Those tailing digits are chosen to make the last mapping an equal partitioning approximately, and to enable a naive inverse mapping: [10,95]--&gt;[09.5,95.5) which approximately reproduces the original interval of [09.55,95.5) (a better match is impossible)).</p>
<p>Then "round to nearest" the "central value" at the decimal place that is aligned with the first digit of the (rounded) error.</p>
<p>The error can then be appended in parentheses to the end of the rounded "central value" thus forming a compact notation, or it's original decimal point placing can be restored and it can then be placed after the rounded "central value" with a "±".</p>
<p>"1.5 digit error rounding" is roughly the minimum number of digits required to preserve knowledge of: the width of the uncertainty; and the position of the "central value" with respect to the size of the uncertainty range. Thus it is the form most efficient for human memory, legibility, typing space, ink use, etc..</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the application of that process to data:</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Form of data coming from a computer or equations:</p>
<p>case #1: "0.827... ± 0.119..." case #2: "0.827... ± 0.367..."</p>
<p>After "1.5 digit error rounding" is applied to that data it becomes more efficient for human memory, legibility, typing space, ink use, etc., and if the error limits were correct no important information should be lost when it is expressed in the following form:</p>
<p>case #1: "0.83 ± 0.12" or "0.83(12)" case #2: "0.8 ± 0.4" or "0.8(4)"</p>

<p><br />
The Comfortex BlindCrafter Program: A Strategy for Small Businesses The early 1990’s presented a changing business landscape in the US. The growing number of “big box” stores was squeezing independent window treatment retailers into bankruptcy. In 1992, Comfortex created what was called the Composer Alliance, to keep its core customer base in business by providing independent window treatment reteailers with the ability to fabricate custom window fashions on-site. This allowed them to stay competitive with larger chain stores.</p>
<p>The Composer program evolved into the BlindCrafter program in 2002, which provides these retail fabricators with marketing and advertising support, and on-site training from Comfortex. There are currently over 200 window fashion dealers in the BlindCrafter network, and they can fabricate any of the Comfortex product lines.</p>

<p>Christina Dawidowicz blessed the world on January 26, 1990. Fame and Fortune would soon follow her way. Christina is well known for her short height which in the past has been looked down upon compared to the present day; millions of girls have been to plastic sergeons to "shrink" themselves. Christina's good friends include the founder of Saudi Arabia, Naif Bartlett and the infamous Karl. His last name must be kept a secret. Christina has friends all over the world. Friends that she still keeps intouch with are Michelle Mrogenki etc. Michelle is also good friends with Naif Bartlett (the founder of Saudi Arabia).</p>
<p>Christina has made several important contributions to the world over the years. She is involved in PETA2. She has stated that she loves animals and that the only fur she would wear would be fake, never real. She has also helped to clean the enviornment. She never liters and respects mother nature. She hopes that the next generation will follow her example to keep the earth "healthy, clean and safe."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-08_dd52.html" title="Edit section: History of Luuq Aw-Madaow.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History of Luuq Aw-Madaow.</span></h2>
<p>LUUG. One of the most important commercial and political centers for the Reewin in the Inter-riverine region, about 260 kilometeres northwest of Mogadishu and 104 kilometers from Baidoa. Luug in Af-Maay means a loop or an enclosure. The town is located on high land surrounded on three sides by the meandering Juba River, called Ganane by Luug's inhabitants, in the Juba valley.</p>
<p><br />
Luug was the royal seat of the Gasaaragude sultants and was separated from the mainland by a wall tree meters high with only one gate that was shut from dusk to dawn. The Italians, finding this location favorable strategically, built a stronger brick wall and a twin-towered fortress. The fascists built an asphalt road from Baidoa to Luug, where in 1935 Italian colonial forces gathered to invade Ethiopia. General Rodolfo Graziani, the commander of the fronte sud, considered Luug vital both for protecting the supply route from Dolow to Harar and for defending the security of the fronte Sud as a whole.</p>
<p><br />
In addition to its strategic and historic importance, Luug was the southern gateway to the Horn of Africa, from which all trade arived and departed, the crossroads between the commercial towns of northeastern KENYA, southern Ethiopia, and central Somalia and the meeting point where merchants exchaged goods. The Juba was navigable from the Ethiopian highlands to the Indian Ocean. Thus, in the 19th century, Omani Arabs traded with the merchants of Luug. The Omani Arabs, from Zanzibar, and the Ethiopians, from the highlands of Ethiopia, both attempted to capture the city; later, the Ethiopian emperor Menelik II invaded in campaigns from 1892 to 1895, but the city successfully resisted his forces. European explorers recognized how useful the river was for colonial penetration and domination. However, several early explorers were killed, among them the German Carl Claus Von der Decken (1865) and the Italian Vittorio Bottego (d. 1897), whose diaries were immediately published and used as guides for exploration and colonization.</p>
<p><br />
Another Italian explorer, Ugo Ferrandi, lived in Luug for 17 months and wrote many useful reports on the city and the surrounding region. Because of Luug's reputation, Germany, Britain, Italy, and Ethiopia competed for colonial dominance. Luug is famous for its suuq(market), where people from all over the region with their different clothing and languages gathered to buy a great range of goods, from vegetables to gold and silver. The town is well laid out and is perhaps the earliest example of urban planning in Somalia. In addition to the royal residence and the merchants' houses, there are residential quarters where the houses have no windows and are fenced with wooden gates. Different parts of the town are designated for specific purposes, such as the slaughter of animals (kawaan), schools(dugsi), worship(masjid), the courts (beitul-hukun), the dead, that is, the cemetery(howaal), and finally, the farms (beer). The town is exclusively Muslim, mostly from the Gasaaragude clan, with the Gobawiin, their subjects, the second most numerous. The are mixed-race groups; Gallas, mostly from Ethiopia; and Swahilis from Zanzibar and the mainland coast of East African.</p>
<p><br />
During the Italian colonial administration, Luug was part of the Alta Giubba(Upper Jubba Region), but Mohamed Siad Barre, in an anti-Reewin move, created a new regional entity called Gedo, so that Luug would lose its central economic, historical, and political role. Indeed, from 1974 the nomadic Marehan clan, to which Barre belonged, settled in Luug and drove out the original inhabitants, particularly Gobawiin who became refugees in Baidoa, Huddur, and coastal cities. The Reewin people became landlocked in the dry lands of central Somalia, because they no longer had access to the Juba River or to Luug. Moreover, Barre's internal partition cut Luug off from its century-old history as a center of Reewin political and juridical life.</p>

<p>Luke Derek frost had an enjoyable childhood, growing up in a little village known as sedgeford, later after he left school with very little education he went on to become a professional tree surgeon. this job aspired Luke to live his life to the max, although he couldnt afford much, he managed to buy a renault 5 for his first car. A great car and bike lover he was very pleased with himself. With the Help on an ex-teacher known only as Paddy, luke started to get into car racing. Paddy encouraged Luke to modify his renault 5, so that he could enter low cc front wheel drive competitions. This was the begining of a blossiming career and also affair. Luke went on to get sponsored for his races and soon upgraded many car classes until he had hit the epitome of all classes, British Touring Cars championship. Lukes career was very succesful and he was well renowend by all the other racers. He had the potential to become possibly the best racer this series had seen in decades. Now racing the Citreon Saxo Vtr, he was well set to race the season. But luke had other things on his mind such as Paddy, Paddy was a beast of a man, scottish infact. and throughout the many diffucult times they had endured, they had grown dependant on each over. This has been seen to be the reason why Luke never made it as the best racer that the series had ever seen. once the news was out that Luke was gay, he wasnt idolised by his f w racers nomore. he lost his sponserships and also his cars, you could say his life. But he still had Paddy! and that was until he ran away with one of lukes friends known only as Jopseph Galloso, a small spanish boy, who had been in a prevoius relation ship with a russian lad known only as dimi. Luke was set to be a famous racer but because of this discrimination it never happened. this was worded in an interview which took place between myself an luke derek Frost.</p>

<p>The Silver Hammer, or Hamrus Agrecious in Latin, is the hammer used to kill the Pope when he is decidedly too old to maintain the throne. This point is determined by Jesus, who tells the Pope. The Pope must give in, realizing it is his time, and tell the hammer. The hammer will then strike, with the force of the four horses and horsemen of the apocalypse, the Pope on the head, directly above the portion of the brain known as the Cowper's gland, which produces 50% of semen. The Pope then goes to Heaven!</p>
