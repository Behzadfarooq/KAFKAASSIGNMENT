<p><b>Omid Saramad</b> is rumored to have been born on January 7, 1978 in Edison, New Jersey. He is currently a hat size analyst. Not too much is known about his early life, but the earliest known date of his activity occurred when he was only 13 years old. At this time he had moved to Warren, New Jersey and was currently attending the 7th grade. It was at time where he discovered his hidden talent of bird calling. While other kids his age were going to the local park to play basketball or tennis, he would sit in his tree-house calling out to birds.</p>

<p>Owad (nou., Polish) is a rare breed primarily found in the mid region of New Jersey, though some have been spotted as far north as upstate New York and as far south as North Carolina.</p>
<p>The average size for an Owad is upwards of 6 feet tall, with offspring averaging 33 pounds at birth. Owad's also are notorious for their somewhat bipolar nature, being nurturing and loving creatures one moment, and violent the next. Owad's are also noted for their in-fighting, particularly the malicious intents generally associated with the youngest member of the herd.</p>
<p>The mental capacity for an Owad ranges greatly, from SAT scores of 1300+ to under 900, however the species are typically interested in the same hobbies, such as combustion engines and various violent sports.</p>
<p>While Owad's are omnivorous creatures that sometimes scavange, their primary diet consists of calamari and "Checker's" branded fast food, however Owad's have been known to consume almost anything.</p>
<p>Although some belive it to be mythical, Owad's are sometimes thought to be the desendants of dragons, due to their large size and the fire coming out of their mouth.</p>

<p>Ballroom queen is a slang reference to participants less known as ballroomers, voguers and catwalkers mostly of GLBT orientation. In its early stages it was purely underground and was means for members of the GLBT community to come out and participate in a competition purely for recreation. Members of this community each would represent a team, or house as they refer to it. A house is a group of GLBT that would care for eachother and help one another when needed. Most of the members of these houses would come from broken homes where they would not receive support or encouragement for their sexual identity. The ballroom scene was a means for escape from the cold reality into a fantasy world where they would find acceptance for whoever they wish to be, be it a man or woman. status, wealth and glamour are the key factors in the ballroom culture.</p>

<p>Natas is composed of 3 rappers, Esham, TnT, and Mastamind from Detroit. Esham while in high school was friends with TnT(T.Jones)heard a demo tape from Mastamind(Gary reed) and asked him to join the group later to be named Natas. Natas are legendary and highly respected in Detroit as well as most copied in their area. Natas doesn't use many guest artist just a few local artists but two stand out named Dice and Razzaq. Dice released a cd on Reel life(esham's label)called Theneighborhoodshittalka in 1996. Razzaq never released a cd on Reel life but appeared on Esham's Dead Flowerz. In the booklet of Dead flowerz Razzaq had a scheduled cd called Pharmaceutical products which never came out due to Dice and Esham having a personal issue. Tnt also had his cd get cancelled called Tony montana mob music, hopefully it will resurface with the rebirth of Reel life productions. Natas inkblot was renamed to the Multikillionaire and Mastamind's Pieces of my mind renamed to Themindzi. Natas as of now is over from Mastamind feeling that Esham owes him past money but Acid rap is still runs strong with Esham and TnT.</p>

<p>MatMice (www.matmice.com) is a free online homepage builder for children. The innovative Web site makes it easy to create a homepage simply by choosing pictures and writing text; no technical knowledge is required. It was developed entirely by three Australian sisters, Emily (20), Sarah (18), and Elise (14) Boyd, who started building the Web site in August 1999. To date, 1,496,461 children from more than 150 countries have created their own homepages using MatMice.</p>

<p>Many online homepage builders are aimed at adults, but we found that there were few catering to the needs of children. The project aims to make it easy for children to create their own homepages, and express themselves on the Web. It allows them to not just be onlookers, but participants!</p>
<p>By creating their own Web pages, children become more digitally literate and comfortable with publishing on the Web. MatMice can be used in schools as an introduction to Web page design. The project also aims to encourage communication by students across countries and cultures, promoting understanding and tolerance.</p>

<p>A computer connected to the Internet and a Web browser.</p>
<p>Role of Telecommunications</p>
<p>The project provides the means for children to easily create their own homepages. A powerful aspect of the project is that it allows children of all technical abilities to publish on the Web; they don't need to be "computer whiz kids" to use the Web site.</p>
<p>Even though there are other methods for publishing Web pages, MatMice greatly improves on existing Web-based technologies, making it easy for children as young as age 6 to create their own Web pages, while still maintaining flexibility for those with more advanced skills. As far as we are aware, it is the only children's Web page builder that allows this. Other technologies such as Microsoft FrontPage are difficult for children to use as they involve the extra step of uploading before the page is visible on the Web. With MatMice, the homepage is automatically available on the Web.</p>

<p>MatMice can be used in any subject area, from history to science, to publish projects online. We see it as being more valuable than displaying a project in a classroom; while in a classroom your audience may be limited to the other kids in your class, on the Web it's possible to show off your project to kids on the other side of the world. Many schools have already used the MatMice to publish students' work.</p>
<p>The Web site can also be used in technology classes as both an introduction to publishing on the Web and for more advanced topics such as HTML.</p>

<p>The children who use MatMice are generally ages 8–14. However, it has been used by a number of younger children with some adult assistance, as all that's needed to build a Web page are basic computer skills.</p>

<p>The suggested duration for the project is three weeks. The amount of time to allocate for a given session will depend on the age and experience of the students.</p>
<p>Week 1—Students choose a title and topic for their Web page. They research the topic on the Internet or in books and plan out their page.</p>
<p>Week 2—Material should be ready to put on the Web page. This may include scanned drawings, all information, and photographs. Students can experiment with page layout.</p>
<p>Week 3—Students may change their Web page by introducing HTML. Once pages are complete, finished work may be shared with other students.</p>

<p>“What Does FEMATM Have to Do with Your Company’s Website?”</p>
<p><br />
One of the most common questions I get is “how can I get more traffic to our website?” Most companies by now are aware of how many dollars are shifting daily to Internet advertising and that 80% of America’s consumers and businesses look for even local services on the Web.</p>
<p>But asking how to get more traffic to your website is like asking “where do I put the gasoline” before asking “which car should I buy?”</p>
<p>The Web can be a great, cost-effective way to find customers and to help customers find you. But before you move too fast into the world of on-line advertising (aka pay-per-click or PPC) or “Search Engine Optimization” (SEO) both of which are designed to get buyers to your website, first ask yourself, “if they come, what will they do there?”</p>
<p>In the past, if you advertised using traditional means, and got the buyer to pick up the phone and call, you were a big step of the way to getting the business. That is not true in the age of the Internet. The process of dialing a phone, involved a psychological commitment to the effort. The buyer had already made a “selection.”</p>
<p>There is no psychological commitment in a click.</p>
<p>In the “insta-click” mentality of the Internet, with so much junk to wade through, searchers general begin with the conscious or subconscious notion that their click will likely yield a bad result. Next time you watch someone shopping the web, watch where they place their mouse after clicking a search result. Very often they move the mouse to top left, hovering over the ‘Back Button” - ready to go back to the million of other search results.</p>
<p>The point is, it is a waste of ad money if you get searchers to your site, but they don’t stay long enough to consider you and your proposition, to say nothing of taking the action you want them to take.</p>
<p>Almost every business should be seeking to expand on the Web, that is clear. But it is not enough just to create any old website and toss it up on the Internet. If you are going to invest in getting customers to your website, invest in keeping them there.</p>
<p>We follow four simple principles in our web design – what we call the FEMATM principles [the coincidental acronym has nothing to do with the Federal agency]:</p>
<p><br />
You never get a second chance to make a first impression ...Anon</p>
<p>First Impression: Before people think they react. The website must make a solid first impression. Unique custom designs should be employed which effectively represent the organization. Color, shape, animation, all designed to engage, so as to keep the visitor from clicking the ‘back button” and hold them long enough to formulate an emotion. How long is this? One to five seconds on average.</p>
<p>Get to the WIFM ("what's in it for me") fast!</p>
<p>Though the Internet is still in its infancy, it is already well understood that the key to success is at least hinting at what your value will be - FAST. Too often, websites begin with the assumption that the visitor knows what the business of the company is. In a brick and mortar world that assumption might be safe. On the Web, if a user doesn't get it in seconds from your home page, he's a click away from the search results that brought him there. Thus, the purpose and the vision of the website has to be clear from the start.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Any emotion, if it is sincere, is involuntary” ...Mark Twain</p>
<p>Emotion: Depending on the business objectives of the website, color, look, feel, motion, all must be used to garner the proper emotion appropriate to the site’s goals - design to hold the visitor long enough so he begins to “get the message”. How long is this? A few more seconds.</p>
<p><br />
"It's not our fault our generation has short attention spans, Dad. We watch an appalling amount of TV." ...Lisa Simpson</p>
<p>Message: Message only comes if first impression and emotion have done their job. Content must be designed for maximum usability, ease-of-navigation with language and images ideally designed around each target audience.</p>
<p>Content must be high quality and served up in easy-to-digest, approachable content chunks, designed to be attractive and inviting (not long and intimidating).The insta-click mentality does not necessarily mean that to be successful content needs to be restricted to sound bites. But it does mean that even more thought and attention must be given to each word and phrase as well as page placement, etc.</p>
<p>The fact is, in our world of information overload, people do have shorter attention spans. We are more successful if we recognize that and work with it. Design that keeps visitors happy and engaged, makes websites more effective. As most US businesses migrate to broadband, the use of novel interactive elements can be employed to present the message and further engage the audience. However, all such elements must be appropriate to the site’s business objectives.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I never worry about action, but only about inaction” ...Winston Churchill</p>
<p>Action: The desired action(s) should be obvious and easy to take from almost any point on the website. Action can come in many forms. For most clients this includes making contact - a phone call, an email, live chat, etc. For others, action may include an e-commerce purchase from the website or a donation to a non-profit cause. But another big use of the Internet is to easily empower friends to help friends! So referring (i.e. emailing a page) to a friend can also be a very important action for the website. The whole equation only comes together when the desired action is taken.</p>
<p>FEMATM principles are not only for e-commerce websites. All businesses and organizations should consider the fact that their websites are the first place buyers, sellers, investors, career candidates and virtually everyone else go to get information. In the old economy, great thought and money went into making the “front office” make the right first impression (remember Arthur Andersen’s famous mahogany doors?). In the new economy, this all must now be directed to the company’s new “front office” – their corporate website.</p>

<p>In Professional Wrestling, the "Devil's Bunkbed" is a structure (between 4 and 7 feet tall) made from wood that has barbed wire covering it's top and laced through it's center, with light tubes pushed through the barbed wire in an erratic fashion, located near ringside.

<p>The aforementioned structure is referred to as the "Devil's Bunkbed" because of it actually being 2 plywood tables (2-3.5 feet tall) stacked atop each-other in the fashion that 2 beds would be stacked to create a Bunkbed. then it is adorned with excessive amounts of barbed wire (attached to the tops of both tables) and light tubes (held in place by the concentrated and abundant placement of the barbed wire).</p>
<p>As with all cases of using a foreign object in professional wrestling, there is a larger amount of risk when performing wrestling moves with these tables.

<p>The Devil's Bunkbed Match: is a Professional Wrestling match where the Ring Ropes are taken down from all sides and Devil's Bunkbeds are placed in a manor as to surround a Wrestling Ring so that the only way for a Wrestler to leave the ring is to be thrown into (through) a Devil's Bunkbed (at-least 6 Devil's Bunkbeds are required). These matches are rarely done in wrestling due to the danger level involved because of the unpredictability of items necessary to hold the match (plywood Tables, Barbed Wire, and fluorescent Light Tubes).</p>

<p>The College of Open Rabbinical Education (CORE) is a UK based rabbinical training center which offers ordination and training programmes to ordained rabbis, rabbinical students, and Jewish service professionals on the basis of the teachings of Mordechai <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Buber_69dd.html" title="Martin Buber">Martin Buber</a>, especially his reinterpretation of hasidism and dialogical philosophy. Beside a highly decentralised rabbinical ordination programme, the College offers a course of study in Jewish pastoral counselling which may or may not culminate in ordination as Rabbinic Counsellor.</p>
<p>Training methods include distance education, residential intensives, mentoring and supervision by an approved rabbi or counsellor (depending on the programme), and studies at other approved institutions of higher learning. Admission is open to Jewish men and women of all backgrounds and from all denominations.</p>
<p>While remaining formally unaffiliated with all major Jewish denominations and movements, the College of Open Rabbinical Education, by combining a liberal social approach with the depth of hasidic spirituality, shows certain parallels to the Jewish Renewal movement which was created by the neo-hasidic rabbis Shlomo Carlebach (z'l) and Rabbis Zalman Schachter-Shalomi.</p>

<p>Cartesio Marconcini Born in Pontedera (Pisa, Italy) on February 25th, 1884. Achieved degrees in Literature and Philosophy at the Pisa University and first published in 1910 the monography «L’ACCADEMIA DELLA CRUSCA dalle origini alla prima edizione del Vocabolario (1612)» («THE ACADEMY OF CRUSCA from the origins to the first edition of the Vocabulary (1612)») printed by Valenti, Pisa (pages 279) that received a significant appreciation in Italy and abroad, particularly in Germany, among the students of the Italian language history. Teacher of literary subjects in secondary schools, from 1910 to 1915, he peregrinated in several north and central Italy towns: La Spezia, Montepulciano, Santarcangelo di Romagna, Porto Maurizio, Civitavecchia, and finally Rome, in 1916, where he established the permanent residence in 1923 as winner of a special competition that granted him the teaching post at the Technical Lower Institute «Vincenzo Gioberti». Between 1910 and 1921, alternately to the teacher’s job, he made a pretty good literary activity with works that received good favour both from the readers and from the critics. He collaborated with articles and tales to magazines like «Il Secolo XX», «Tutto» and «Gran Mondo». Ideological opponent to the establishment of the fascism regime in Italy, from 1922 he started a long silence period, even if continuing to write per il soliloquio (for the soliloquy), as he loved to define his disdainful literary retirement. Around the end of 1934, at fifty, he married Viviana Fascetti and after a year, in 1935, while his wife was affording a difficult pregnancy, he was compelled by the Minister of the National Education, Cesare Maria de Vecchi di Val Cismon, to accept – with no attention given to his motivated claims – the mandatory order to move to Savignano sul Rubicone and to cover the job of preside (headmaster) of the Lower Technical Institute, that was going to be transformed into Scuola Media (Middle School) under the reform made by the philosopher Giovanni Gentile. In april 1936 was born his unique son, Mario. In 1940 he received the membership of the historic Rubiconian Academy of Filopatridi. When Mussolini, inebriated by the glory of the recently conquered empire and fatally attracted by Hitler, adhered to the war adventure, Cartesio Marconcini was first falling into despair as he had an idea of the lack of preparation and, especially, the poor equipments available to the Italian army; hence he was presaging a tragic result of the conflict. But in the meantime, feeling a strong love for his country, he kept at a distance his friends that, in secret, were foreboding the defeat of Italy assuming that it was the only way to “get rid of the tyranny” (i.e. Mussolini). Though still opposing the regime, he sided with those that where hailing the victory. It was at that time that he broke his silence and, even if after many esitancies, he published a beautiful collection of poems «NEL TURBINE» («INTO THE STORM») (Pisa, Nistri Lischi, 1942), pervaded of patriotism, by which he celebrated the immense sacrifice of the italian soldiers on the battle fields, the heroism of the Duke of Aosta and the desperate hope in a positive conclusion of the war for his country. The book was greatly appreciated also by the fascist hierarchy and the author remained very embarrassed and displeased of it. Refugee in 1944, with his family, in the village of Montalbano, on the hills near Rimini, he assisted to the passage of the war front and to the liberation by the anglo-american army. In 1945 moved to Cesena as headmaster of the local Middle School, where he remained until his retirement in 1954, at seventy. Then he moved again to Rome. In 1964 the President of the Italian Republic granted him the silver medal for the merits of teaching, culture and art. Taking up again the writing activity, between 1947 and 1972 he published several books: tales for young people, a novel, a collection of stories and pieces of poetry. After the sudden death of his beloved wife in 1974, he withdrew definitively into himself. He died in Rome on August 5th, 1981 at ninety-seven still being in possession of all his faculties. He left an unpublished diary of the period 1935-1945 bearing the title “LA CASA DISTRUTTA” (The destroyed home), whose a typed copy has been deposited in the archives of the Academy of the Crusca in Florence, and an interesting collection of original letters and cards received from writers an other personages from 1910 upto 1972.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-16_c0f1.html" title="Edit section: marine gearbox">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">marine gearbox</span></h2>
<p>Marine gears meet a wide variety of marine applications in a variety of configurations and installations to meet the most critical applications. They are used in yachts, work boats, fishing boats and other marine applications. Selection of the appropriate viscosity grade for marine applications is based on speed, load, operating temperature, and gear geometry. The viscosity required increases as the speed decreases.</p>
<p>Specific marine applications include main propulsion, centrifuges, deck machinery such as winches, windlasses, cranes, turning gears, pumps, elevators, and rudder carriers.</p>
<p>Worm gears - They offer corrosion protection.</p>
<p>Bevel gears - They are used as special reduction gears for cruise. They are also used for transportation task.</p>
<p>Helical gears - Transmit power and motion between parallel axis.</p>
<p>Planetary gears - These are used foT co-axial drive</p>
<p>Helical gears connect parallel shifts but the involute teeth are cut at an angle to the axis of rotation. Two mating helical gears must have equal helix angle but opposite hand. They run smoother and more quietly. They have higher load capacity, are more expensive to manufacture and create axial thrust.</p>
<p>Helical gears can be used to mesh two shafts that are not parallel and can also be used in a crossed gear mesh connecting two perpendicular shafts. They have longer and strong teeth. They can carry heavy load because of the greater surface contact with the teeth. The efficiency is also reduced because of longer surface contact. The gearing is quieter with less vibration.</p>
<p><br />
Gear Configuration They can be manufactured in both right-handed and left-handed configurations with a helix angle to transmit motion and power between non-intersecting shafts that are parallel or at 90 degrees to each other. For shaft at 90 degrees, the same helix angles are used and the tooth contact area of the gear is very small. If the angle of gear teeth is correct, they can be mounted on perpendicular shaft by adjusting the rotating angle by 90 degrees. The inclination of the teeth generates an axial force. As the angle of inclination increases the axial force also increases. Thrust bearings can counter these forces.</p>
<p><br />
Applications These are highly used in transmission because they are quieter even at higher speed and are durable. The other possible applications of helical gears are in textile industry, blowers, feeders, rubber and plastic industry, sand mullers, screen, sugar industry, rolling mills, food industry, elevators, conveyors, cutters, clay working machinery, compressors, cane knives and in oil industry.</p>
<p><br />
Disadvantage A disadvantage of helical gear is the resultant thrust along the axis of the gear, which needs to be accomodated by appropriate thrust bearings. This can be overcome by the use of double helical gears by having teeth with a 'v' shape.</p>
<p>Gearbox is defined as a metal casing in which a train of gears is sealed. Gearbox is also called gearhead, gear reducers or speed reducers. They are available in broad range of sizes, capacities and speed ratios. Their job is to convert the input provided by a prime mover into an output of lower RPM and correspondingly, higher torque.</p>
<p>Input and output configurations for gearboxes include hollow shaft or coupling or bushing. A single input shaft can drive multiple output shafts. The output shafts are usually parallel and in-line. However, some unique configurations exist that allow for offset shafts to be driven at different speeds. Some gearboxes are supplied with a reaction arm. A reaction arm prevents the reducer housing from rotating when there is no base mounts or flanges. Shaft alignment can be parallel in-line, parallel offset, right angle and non-perpendicular angled shafts.</p>
<p>Gearbox is intended to be incorporated in a transmission for vehicles, particularly terrain vehicles, preferably driven by an internal combustion engine.</p>
<p><br />
Gearing Arrangement for Gearbox Gearing arrangement for gearbox includes spur, helical, planetary, bevel, worm, and cycloidal. Bevel gear is a gear wheel meshed with another so that their shafts are at an angle less than 180degrees. They connect intersecting axes. Helical gears connect parallel shafts but the involute teeth are cut at an angle to the axis of rotation. Two mating helical gears must have equal helix angle but opposite hand. Spur gears connect parallel shafts, have involute teeth that are parallel to the shaft and can have internal or external teeth. Planetary gears are a set of gears usually two or more on or inside a larger gear. They make drastic gear ratio possible. They are used when one wishes to turn the input in the same direction as the output. Planetary reducers can be designed with gear sets or a set of planetary cones. Cycloidal gears are used in pairs and are set at an angle of 180 degrees used to balance the load and are driven by multiple crank shafts to share the load and increase torsion rigidity. Cycloid reducers use rolling elements and a multilobe cam to transmit torque and provide speed reduction. A worm gear is an inclined plane wrapped around a central axle. It is a gear with one or more teeth in the form of screwed threads.</p>
<p><br />
Types of Gearbox</p>
<p>There are two types of gearboxes: Automatic gearbox: Several factors have contributed to the development of automatic gearbox. Firstly, the advent of electronics in the nineties and secondly, the wish of having more gear speed. It is used for power transmission and offers automatic gearshift. Automatic gearboxes are easy and pleasurable to drive. The only thing to be done after engaging a gear is to press the accelerator to go and press the brake to stop. The automatic gearboxes relies on hydraulic fluid pressure to shift the gears up and down. This fluid needs to be checked regularly.</p>
<p>Manual gearbox: Manual gearbox has widely spread into the market but Europeans still remain faithful to manual gearbox. The manual gearbox has been as old as the car itself. These gearboxes use conventional clutch that is activated each time a gear is selected by an electronically controlled motor. This then disengages the clutch, the gear is shifted and the clutch engages once more. It all happens within a second and the system even allows for the car to come to a stop whilst still in gear. The manual gearbox is virtually maintenance free except for the checking of the oil level occasionally.</p>
<p><br />
Controlling Gear Box Contamination Wear and tear is common in gearboxes. Wear commonly occurs as a result of the contamination and degradation of the lubricant. Proactive maintenance is a well-documented concept. It leads to longer life of the gearbox. In a gearbox, there are moving components that transmit power through rotation and so degradation of lubricant can lead to adhesion, abrasion and corrosion of component surfaces, which finally leads to component failure.</p>
<p>The oil used for lubrication must be free from contamination. Seals have the ability to seal against oil leakage. Breathers are used for allowing airflow on the gearbox. This is to allow for changes in volume as a result of top-ups, leakage and temperature-related volume changes.</p>
<p>An annual check of all switches and sensors should be performed to verify operation as per lubrication system settings. Pumps and other motorized accessories should be checked at scheduled intervals. Flows and pressure drops at the cooler, filters and inlet to the rotating equipment should be routinely monitored and recorded to identify any adverse trends. An annual check of cooler condition is important to maintain cooler efficiency.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Power Take-Offs ________________________________________</p>
<p>Power take off is a mechanical device used to transmit engine power to auxiliary equipment. Power take offs can be mounted on either a main or auxiliary transmission. If the power take off is operating on the transfer case and its operation is distance dependent, its rotational speed is given in revolutions per meter off distance covered.</p>
<p>All power take offs are specially designed for driving hydraulic pumps to SAE J744C series 'B' specification with spline input shaft and either two-bolt or four-bolt fixing. The maximum power which can be transmitted is 22KW(29.5bhp) per 1000rev/min engine speed, this equates to a torque of 209 Nm.</p>
<p>Power take offs are desirable in many applications. They are used in oil field pumping service, hydraulic application, in automotive industries, agriculture industries, etc.</p>
<p><br />
Types The characteristics of PTOs must conform to one of the types described in the table: Type Nominal diameter Number of splines Nominal PTO rotation speed - 35 6 540 and/ or 1000 2 35 21 Involute serration 3 45 20</p>
<p>PTO can also be transmission mounted or engine mounted. In transmission mounted PTO, it is located on the side, bottom or rear of the transmission. For manual transmissions the PTO is generally driven from a countershaft gear, but can also be found being driven by the reverse idler gear. For automatic transmissions, the PTO will either be driven before the torque converter and be subjected to torque converter slip. In engine mounted PTO, it is located at the rear of the engine. The PTO can be driven from the timing gears, or a special gear train, and provides a constant drive for special applications.</p>
<p><br />
Power Take Off Guarding A power take off and the power take off drive shaft of a machine are very dangerous if not correctly guarded. Every year people are killed or seriously injured in accidents. Most of these accidents involving are preventable if the PTO and PTO drive shaft are fitted with guards of good design which are properly used and maintained. PTO should be protected with a shield that is well constructed and capable of supporting a downward load of at least 120kg. When the PTO is not in use, it should be covered with a fixed cap. The inner and outer surface of the guard should be cleaned daily and lubricated weekly with lithium-based grease. Torque limiters, free wheels or clutches should be located at the power-input connection of the PTO drive shaft.</p>
<p><br />
Maintenance &amp; Care One should never try to clear blockages from the PTO- driven machine while it is moving. One should always disengage the power drive or stop the tractor engine. Ensure that controls are in neutral and the hand brake is applied. Wait for all movement to cease before attempting to clear any blockage and use a tool to clear the blockage. One should not drive the machine too fast. If a machine is used in excess of its design speed it will come under too much stress and there is a possibility of it disintegrating.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-16_c0f1.html" title="Edit section: [ [ Global Capitalism ] ]">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">[ [ Global Capitalism ] ]</span></h2>
<p>When people talk about global capitalism they are generally refering to the 'globalisation' of capitalist networks and of capitalist society. Global capitalism differs from earlier forms of capitalism in the way its political-economic structures relate to political states, social interests and local cultures.</p>
<p>In earlier periods capitalism and its political economies were much more intergrated into the international system of the great nation-states. Economic structures were more particular to individual national locations. For example there were German capitalisms, French capitalisms and British capitalisms. Each individual nation-state and the national political and civil society within each state was both a creator of and a consequence of that nation's particular take on capitalism. Part of the reason why people today discuss a new global- as oppose to national and international- capitalism is because they are recognising a shift away from these arrangements.</p>
<p>Global conceptions of capitalism can also be derived from recognising that there is a clear 'globalisation of production' taking place. More specifically there may be a globalisation of capitalist modes and relations of production. Industrial, commercial, urbanised and buisness orientated production was for most of the twentieth century (and since the beginngs of capitalist accumilation and industrialisation) concentrated in Western Europe, North America and Japan- what is often called the'First World'. It was here that one would find the great factories, steel producers, mines and refineries. It was here that all the main production of goods, the provision of services and the creation of profits was performed. Here were the great industrial cities and the masses of 'blue collor' urban workers, the white collor workers and the privalidged professionals that the system creates and requires. The 'First World' produced and consumed and its poltical states grew rich and powerful, and so too did the elites who profited from capitalist enterprise (Veblen's 'leasure class', Marx's Capitalist Bourgeoisie). The great coporations and finacial institutions were based in these nations and invested in them.</p>
<p>The rest of the world was kept, first directly through European imperialsm and then through a myriad of economic relationships, as an under developed periphery- the 'Third World'. The periphery was sparsely industrialised and in a system of 'world trade' between nation-states and empiers they sold only raw materials and natural resources in a cut-rate 'market'.</p>
<p>After the Second World War the United States assumed control of the international system and a capitalist hegemon- a position it retains today. Under the 'Pax Americana' international political economy the intersts of 'westeren' capitalism were rigidly protected. Whilst industrialisation was encoraged in major caountires in Latin america and parts of East Asia the basic model of an advanced capitalist 'core' and a undeveloped 'periphery' was continued.</p>
<p>What has chaneged is that over the last thirty years the process of spreading acivities noramally found in the'core' to the 'perphery' has rapidly accelerated. Today industrial production, commercial exchange and buisness for profit is found in more and more parts of the 'Third World', in what development theorists call the 'Newly Industrialised Countries' (the NICs). This is also called 'Third Wave Industrialisation'. Capitalism's productive and commercial networks of technolagy, work forces, management and corporations are spreading out into new areas and incorporationg new populations into the centeral aspects of the system- on a global level.</p>
<p>The rise of new technologies in ICT and transport have enabled buisness in finance and production to be carried out on a global scale. Distance has become negligable. The process is also helped by the undeniable domination of the USA in its militarist, and 'diplomatic' relationshiops with other political states, which ensures governments and populations play by the rules of the game. Corporate enterprise has thus been able to spread far beyond the limits of home countries and can directly invest (a process called Foriegn Direct Investment) in more and more places. This has given rise to a greater number and variety of multi-national corporations (MNCs) and transnational corporations (TNCs). These corporations have relocated and outsourced vast areas of their activities out of the old 'core' and into the NICs.</p>
<p>This has given rise to a huge urbanised working class that is to be found from Malaysia to Mexico. There are also huge populations of white collor consumers and professionals in India, China, Brazil and elsewhere. The number of billionares in NICs is on the rise. Basically everything about capitalism, once concentrated in the'core'can now be seen as spreading to new frontiers.</p>
<p>However this should not be equated with an ipso facto spreading of wealth, an equality between states and regions. Indeed global capitalism is regarded by many as quite negative for most working people whether they live in the older industrial countries or in the NICs. This is because of a number of inter-related factors. One is that, as stated above, in the past economic and buisness structures were tied to political states and national societies. Nation-states proved effective political instruments in the middle of the 20th century in curbing the worst aspects of captalism. After the war there was a 'liberal compromise' or a 'class compromise' organised at national level in all capitalist countries which gave some political economic power to workers and ensured higher wages, secure employment and good welfare provision.</p>
<p>In the 1980s and 1990s this brand of political economy was severley attacked by new ideologies, especially 'neo-liberalism' which reduced the powers of both workers and the state in relation to capital. The opening up of countries to investment, the 'market led' development plans and the disciplined 'macro economics'of 'prudent' states all fules and is fueld by gobalising capitalist networks. Led by institutions such as the WTO, the IMF and the World Bank as well as regional bodies such as the E.U., APEC and NAFTA; neo-liberal (capital orientated) political economy is the setting in which this global capitalism develops.</p>
<p>Workers in Chinese and Phillipino 'Export Processing Zones'(EPZs)- that governemnts in NICs are told bring 'development'- have no union protection, no rights against harsh and unfair treatment and no job security. Wages under global capitalism for most workers are so much lower then thirty years ago because the work can now take place in poorer places and capitalist buisness is employing less powerful people. Labour in China, according to 'The Economist' website's labour costs table; is over 15 times lower then they are in the UK.</p>
<p>The need to be 'cost efficeint'and 'flexible' is a microecomonic discipline imposed by global capitalism through the power of the spectulators and mega-corporations to place downward pressures on every aspect of the capitalist network. This produces huge profits for corporations and the finacial and capital markets.</p>
<p>Global capitalism also creates a greater level of inter-dependence between the populations of the world. Whilst international capitalist networks created interdependence between countries, global capitalism creates new interelating networks between workforces, conumsers and societies on more local and more global levels. The movements on a finacial market in Hong Kong can have a direct impact on production of car parts in Brazil, whilst a board meeting in New York can mean lay-offs in Calcutta. Global capitalism, in short replaces knock on affects between states in an international capitalist system with direct human relationships that span thousands of miles.</p>
<p>Capital, once French capital or British capital, that worked through the medium of political states and international networks of 'trade'now operates as global capital, which is much less specific to a particular political state or even a particular enterprise.</p>

<p>Colonel Rookes Evelyn Bell Crompton, a British industrialist born on 31 May 1845 at Sion Hill, near Thirsk in Yorkshire, England, was one of that breed of Victorian explorers, inventors and adventurers who took the Industrial Revolution, then in full swing, and set about helping to create both the British Empire and the world that we know today.</p>
<p>In his autobiography, "Reminiscences", Crompton tells of a trip to London's Great Exhibition of 1851. "For me, the unforgettable part and focus of the whole exhibition was the Machinery Hall...neither Koh-I-Noor diamond, nor Osler's crystal fountain...had any attractions for me to compare with those of the locomotives, with their brilliantly polished piston roads and brasses burnished like gold."</p>
<p>His schooling started at Sharow, near Ripon in Yorkshire, along with 19 other boys, aged between 7 and 15. One of his fellow pupils there was Charles Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.</p>
<p>But Crompton's education was interrupted by the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1854 and he was keen to see action, despite his young age. He was taken on by the Royal Navy as a cadet on HMS Dragon, commanded by his mother's cousin Captain Houston Stewart and headed for the Crimea. While there he witnessed the horrors of trench warfare but developed a taste for life in the military.</p>
<p>As a young man he served in the British Rifle Brigade in India and, after returning home, built a company that, in the 1880s and 1890s, became England’s leading manufacturer of electricity generating and lighting systems. Crompton's reputation was such that, in 1880, the chemist Joseph Swan sought his opinion when he first developed incandescent lamps for indoor use. Crompton immediately saw the potential and, within a couple of years, his firm was selling Swan's lamps and the generating equipment to go with them. His rapidly developing profile in the industry meant that he was soon asked to join the fledgling British Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE), an organisation he was later to head as president.</p>
<p>With Swan's lamps and further developments of generators, Crompton and Co became involved in public lighting schemes. The success of his British projects, led to a number of commissions in mainland Europe between 1885 and 1889. One such project was the Viennese Opera House, the first large theatre to be lit electrically anywhere. Crompton's best remembered public scheme opened in London in 1887. Kensington Court, a new housing estate of a hundred residences was connected to a subterranean direct current generating network powered by seven steam engines. It was one of the earliest public power supply schemes and became a model for much of what was to follow.</p>
<p>The onset of the Boer War saw Crompton return to military service, as a colonel in the Royal Engineers. His own arc lamps started to be used as military searchlights. This was not his only contribution to military technology. During the First World War, he was asked to submit designs for "landships" that could cross trenches. These became the blueprint for the modern military tank.</p>
<p>After the Boer War ended, Crompton became involved in standardization. He had long been concerned about the lack of a common terminology to describe the electrical phenomena he was seeing and the huge number of different schemes in operation. Virtually each different electricity generating network ran at a different voltage and interoperability of equipment was a huge problem.</p>
<p>In August 1904, he was asked by the Institution of Electrical Engineers, to participate in representing Britain at the Great International Exposition in St Louis, America. At the Exposition, Crompton presented a paper on standardization which was so well received that he was officially requested to look into the formation of a permanent International Electrotechnical Commission, to deal with electrical standardization from an international standpoint. Crompton admitted afterwards that he foresaw "great difficulties" in the proposed scheme but these were eventually overcome and the IEC began to take shape.</p>
<p>In 1906, Crompton and Charles le Maistre, whom Crompton had asked to act as permanent secretary, drew up a constitution for the fledgling organization. The IEC's first plenary meeting was held on 26-27 June 1906 in London and was attended by representatives of 14 countries.</p>

<p>In Professional Wrestling, the "Devil's Bunkbed" is a structure (between 4 and 7 feet tall) made from wood that has barbed wire covering it's top and laced through it's center, with light tubes pushed through the barbed wire in an erratic fashion, located near ringside. The Devil's Bunkbed has become a staple in modern professional wrestling as a device for Wrestlers and Wrestling Promotions to "raise the bar" when it comes to over the top all out violence.</p>
<p>The aforementioned structure is referred to as the "Devil's Bunkbed" because of it actually being 2 plywood tables (2-3.5 feet tall) stacked atop each-other in the fashion that 2 beds would be stacked to create a Bunkbed. then it is adorned with excessive amounts of barbed wire (attached to the tops of both tables) and light tubes (held in place by the concentrated and abundant placement of the barbed wire).</p>
<p>As with all cases of using a foreign object in professional wrestling, there is a larger amount of risk when performing wrestling moves with these tables. Unlike the standard tables used in professional wrestling, the Devil's Bunkbeds are made of plywood (instead of particle board) which as a result: (when stacked) provides nothing more than a cuckooing barbed wire and light tube delivery system often resulting in a confining effect in which the wrestler that has been sent crashing down through the Devil's Bunkbed will be on the floor completely surrounded by (and encased within) barbed wire and broken glass.</p>
<p>The Devil's Bunkbed Match: is a Professional Wrestling match where the Ring Ropes are taken down from all sides and Devil's Bunkbeds are placed in a manor as to surround a Wrestling Ring so that the only way for a Wrestler to leave the ring is to be thrown into (through) a Devil's Bunkbed (at-least 6 Devil's Bunkbeds are required). These matches are rarely done in wrestling due to the danger level involved because of the unpredictability of items necessary to hold the match (plywood Tables, Barbed Wire, and fluorescent Light Tubes).</p>

<p>Wally Shoup Bio (b. 1944, Charlotte, N.C.)</p>
<p>Wally Shoup grew up in the South (Charlotte, N.C) in the 1950's and was heavily influenced by Black Music of that era: blues, R 'n B, Soul and, later, in the 60's, free jazz. After moving to Colorado in 1970, and hearing Britain's groundbreaking Music Improvisation Company, he simultaneously discovered free improvisation and his calling as a musician.</p>
<p>After a period of intense study and obsessive listening, he became active in 1975 as an organizer, D.J., and player of free music ­ merging free jazz, free improvisation and noise into a highly personal and idiosyncratic style.</p>
<p>He released his first LP Scree-Run Waltz in 1981, making it one of the first independently produced documents of American free improvisation.</p>
<p>He then moved to Birmingham, Ala to become involved with its thriving improvisation scene, which revolved around the Trans Duo of Davey Williams and La Donna Smith. He performed w/Trans, wrote for the Improvisor magazine and worked with dancer, Mary Horn, in a multi-disciplinary duo, culminating in a European tour in 1985.</p>
<p>Wally moved to Seattle in 1985 and became a central figure in the improvisational world. He performed with the New Art Orchestra, Catabatics and took part in the 1st Seattle Improvised Music Festival. Since that time, he has helped guide that festival to its present-day status as the longest running improvisation festival in America.</p>
<p>A compelling and original saxophonist, Wally is featured in the Encyclopedia of Northwest Music, noted for his ability to "draw crowds from diverse audiences due to his fierce intensity and explorative saxophone performances."</p>
<p>He formed Project W in 1994 with cellist, Brent Arnold, and released the CD Project W (Apraxia) in 1996 (named a top ten release in Cadence Magazine) and the LP Obliquity (Shrat), which documented their opening set for Sonic Youth in 1998.</p>
<p>His alliance with Thurston Moore (of Sonic Youth) has yielded two CD's: the highly acclaimed Hurricane Floyd (Subliminal) in 2000 and the upcoming Leo Records release Live at Tonic (w/Paul Flaherty and Chris Corsano)</p>
<p>He formed the Wally Shoup Trio in 2001 w/bassist Reuben Radding and drummer Bob Rees. The group has played to great acclaim in Seattle (see feature article in the Stranger by Mike McConigal ­ <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/2001-11-29/music.html" class="external free" title="http://www.thestranger.com/2001-11-29/music.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestranger.com/2001-11-29/music.html</a>) and has recently released Fusillades and Lamentations on the London-based Leo Label.</p>
<p>Additionally, Wally is a painter of repute in the "Outsider Art" circles and is represented in Seattle by the Garde-Rail Gallery (<a href="http://www.garde-rail.com/artist/wally.html" class="external free" title="http://www.garde-rail.com/artist/wally.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.garde-rail.com/artist/wally.html</a>). His textural, expressive art merges the sophisticated with the primitive in much the same way as his music, and his art graces a number of his record releases.</p>
<p>He also has written numerous articles and reviews of music. His writing has appeared in the Improvisor, Art Papers, The Stranger, Earshot Jazz Magazine, Perfect Sound Forever, and on Amazon.com, where he is an editorial reviewer. A book of his music writing will be forthcoming on Thurston Moore's Glasseye Book series.</p>

<p>Do you go to Universities to study Mexican Food ? Bad idea ....</p>
<p><br />
The Flea market ( west on Valencia rd , in Tucson AZ ) has 12 Mexican restaurants ( lean to's ) and little else . Strange flea market ! Owned by the Papago Indian tribe .</p>
<p>You will find ONLY original Mexican food ( NO yellow cheese ). It's what the Mexicans eat while in the U.S. . Not one dish is hot/spicy ( even Jalapenos are hard to find ).</p>
<p>They will sell you queso fresco and cocido ( both white ) . I'd like to study queso cocido more . How is it made .</p>
<p>Mexico was so poor they ate goat cheese ONLY , today they have more cows milk .</p>
<p>Most Mexicans don't eat flour anything , better flavor from Corn Tortillas .</p>
<p>When a restaurant has only one kind of Tamale , it is always Red ( mild) chile and pork . No raisins , NO Olives , No anchivies , nada ...</p>
<p>Mexicans don't add much to their food . They Love Masa Harina ( corn masa ) .</p>

<p>This E-Story and Web Site are dedicated to the tens of thousands of people from all walks of life, from all areas of the country, who have been age discriminated against in the IBM &amp; USA workplaces simply because they were “older folks”.</p>
<p>Foreword &amp; Author’s Background By John Mellon</p>
<p>While “IBM Age Discrimination” may not be front-page news, IBM &amp; other American Corporations continue to pursue it on an ever-widening basis. A new E-Story called IBM Discriminates “Big Time” On “Age”, written by John Mellon, is designed to reach the average reader &amp; help stimulate a broader understanding of IBM &amp; USA AGE DISCRIMINATION.</p>
<p>Mr. Mellon makes a fervent stand that we've only seen the tip of the iceberg, and it will take an attitude change on the part of IBM Corporation Executives and IBM Policy Makers to ensure that “Work For Older IBM Americans” is still viable in the U.S.A. &amp; the World.</p>
<p>This E-Story is good reading for anyone wondering how IBM Age Discrimination developed; how it is likely to continue (if not stopped by the Courts or “The Honest IBMers Still Left”). What sort of changes can IBM help to mitigate the impact on older American &amp; International IBM workers?</p>
<p>IBM CEO SAM PALMISANO: “Do you have the honesty to fix this?”</p>
<p>THE QUESTION IS SIMPLE:</p>
<ul>
<li>"WHAT IF THIS "AGE DISCRIMINATION &amp; LOSS OF INCOME, MEDICAL</li>
</ul>
<p>BENEFITS, PENSIONS &amp; OTHER IBM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS" WAS HAPPENING TO YOU, YOUR SISTER, BROTHER, FATHER, MOTHER, WIFE, HUSBAND, COUSIN, NIECE, AUNT, UNCLE, FRIENDS?"*</p>
<p>John Mellon’s background consists of being on the USA Space Program; being a National Telecomm Director for 3 different multi-billion dollar corporations, State Budget Director for a Major Telephone Company &amp; top Senior Sales Executive for the likes of IBM, AT&amp;T and other companies. He also spent about 10 years doing work for 2 different USA Government Agencies on 3 different continents. He is also a 25-year member of Mensa &amp; has held positions with local Mensa chapters.</p>
<p>In addition he has Honorable Discharge(s) from the US Army National Guards after 3 years &amp; US Army Ready Reserves after 7 years.</p>
<p>He also was a student instructor while at college; belonging to their Honorary Tutoring Fraternity &amp; National Professional Electrical Engineering Fraternity.</p>
<p>He has also delivered editorials on local TV stations &amp; written newspaper editorials regarding Telecom Legislation, Age Discrimination, &amp; Fairness in America.</p>

<p>In the Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game, there are two core types of magic: divine and arcane. The former comes from the game's deities, and often has a focus on healing or exacting retribution upon the enemies of the god granting the spell's power. The latter, on the other hand, comes from studying lore or from innate talent. Arcane spells tend to be flashier than divine spells, and often can have a greater variety of effects.</p>
<p>Arcane magic in D&amp;D is subdivided into "schools:" Illusion (creating figments or deceiving senses), Divination (discerning things through magical means), Necromancy (controlling or creating undead, among other powers), Conjuration (summoning or creating creatures or objects), Transmutation (changing reality in some way), and Evocation (manipulating energy, often in spectacularly flashy ways). There are also a handfull of universal spells, which do not belong to any particular school.</p>
<p>The arcane casters given in the Player's Handbook are the wizard, sorcerer, and bard.</p>

<p>Please look to this link for the official website of the University of Sint Eustatius School of Medicine. IT is one of a number of Offshore Caribbean-based Medical Schools available to U.S. students. After completion of the first 2 years of medical school on the tiny 2-mile x 5-mile island country of St. Eustatius (affectionately called "Statia" by local residents), American students return to the States to complete the next 2 years of medical school clinical rotations in a handful of states across the country. Upon the completion of these total 4 years with the University of St. Eustatius School of Medicine, graduates will receive their U.S. M.D. title and will match for residency in the States. This is a viable option for those U.S. students who have a passion to pursue a career in medicine yet are not accepted into the standard AMCAS Medical Schools due to lack of space, less competative transcripts &amp;/or MCAT scores, or weaker applications for any other reason.</p>

<p>"4 Bolt Main" refers to the bolts on the part of an engine which holds in the crankshaft. These parts are called the 'Main Caps' and also house the bearings which the crankshaft rides on.</p>
<p>The significance of the these bolts are that they provide support for the crankshaft, preventing it from blowing out through the bottom of the engine. By increasing the number of bolts, the strength and load bearing capacity of the caps increases allowing for more horsepower before failure.</p>
<p>examples of main caps:</p>
<p>Chevy L98 - 2 bolt main, Chevy LS1 - 4 bolt main, Ford 32 valve cobra engine - 6 bolt main</p>
<p>It has been found that the use of one large girdle that connects all the bearing provides more strength and rigidity than traditional caps.</p>
<p>Example of main girdles:</p>
<p>Honda - F20C, Chevy - Northstar</p>

<p>Having regard to the fact:</p>
<ul>
<li>that in the fast growing urban sector there is a proliferation of poor hawkers and vendors including those who are children;</li>
<li>that because of poverty, unemployment and forced migration and immigration, despite the useful service they render to society, they are looked upon as a hindrance to the planned development of cities both by the elite urbanites and the town planners alike;</li>
<li>that hawkers and vendors are subjected to constant mental and physical torture by the local officials and are harassed in many other ways which at times leads to riotous situations, loss of property rights, or monetary loss;</li>
<li>that there is hardly any publicity consistent with the needs of street vendors throughout the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>We urge governments to form a National Policy for hawkers and vendors by making them a part of the broader structural policies aimed at improving their standards of living, by having regard to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>give vendors legal status by issuing licenses, enacting laws and providing appropriate hawking zones in urban plans,</li>
<li>provide legal access to the use of appropriate and available space in urban areas,</li>
<li>protect and expand vendors' existing livelihood,</li>
<li>make street vendors a special component of the plans for urban development by treating them as an integral part of the urban distribution system,</li>
<li>issue guidelines for supportive services at local levels, · enforce regulations and promote self-governance,</li>
<li>set up appropriate, participatory, non-formal mechanisms with representation by street vendors and hawkers, NGOs, local authorities, the police and others,</li>
<li>provide street vendors with relief measures in situations of disasters and natural calamities.</li>

<p><b>Russ Castella</b>, commonly known as <b>R. Cas</b>, is a producer and an artist from Philadelphia, PA. He is currently known for his collaboration with the Canadian singer <b>Elissa</b> on the single of <b>"Truth"</b>.</p>
<p>Russ Castella has began producing since late 2001 concentrating on dance material. His first milestone in his career was a track called "Let Go" which quickly picked up fame after the #1 selling DJ Louie Devito began playing it in clubs all over the country. A few years later, a collaboration with <b>Karen Vazquez</b> on "Angel Eyes" increased his popularity significantly. The record, however, failed to rock the air waves. Nonetheless, "Angel Eyes" was a significant success in the club scene in 2004 along with "So Exotic" which was released at the same time.</p>
<p><br />
In early 2005, Russ Castella was able to secure contracts with many labels for original and remix works only for a few months after he began running into problems with the law and IRS. Arrest in Virginia, suspicious bank withdrawls, and IRS audits slowed down Russ Castella's progress. These factors caused him to lose those contracts due to "lack of determination" in the summer of 2005. However, he quickly went back on track continuing the persuit of the producer stardom by going back to the labels to prove his worth. Today, Russ Castella hip hop productions are attracting new deals with labels such as Def Jam, So So Def, and Universal.</p>
<p>In December 2005, Russ Castella paired up with Elissa to produce "Truth" which features over 10 different versions of the song. The song is poised with success as it enters the playlists on FM radio stations across the nation.</p>
<p>Russ Castella's credits include <b>Rihanna</b>, <b>Rockell</b>, <b>Mike Rizzo</b>, <b>Aliie</b>, and others.</p>

<p>Camp Wolters</p>
<p>Camp Wolters is an ARNG Major Training Center located four miles east of Mineral Wells in Parker and Palo Pinto counties.</p>
<p>Fort Wolters, established as Camp Wolters in 1925, was named for Brig. Gen. Jacob F. Wolters, commander of the Fifty-sixth Brigade of the National Guard, and designated a summer training site for his units. Mineral Wells donated fifty acres, leased 2,300 acres, and in World War IIqv provided land to increase the camp's area to 7,500 acres. The camp became an important infantry-replacement training center with a troop capacity that reached a peak of 24,973. Audie Murphy went through his basic training at Wolters.</p>
<p>From 1942-1945 a German prisoner of War Camp with about 300 soldiers was located in the center of the camp. It was surrounded by a high mesh fence around the area with sentry towers at intervals around the compound. Flood lights illuminated the tower areas which could be seen from the highway.</p>
<p>Six months after the end of the war the camp was deactivated. Local businessmen purchased the land and facilities and converted them to private use. The tensions of the cold war, however, resulted in the reopening of the camp in early 1951, under the authority of the United States Air Force. At the installation, then named Wolters Air Force Base, was housed the newly formed Aviation Engineer Force. Special-category army and air force personnel were trained there until their mission function reverted to Army control.</p>
<p>In 1953, a U.S. Nike Guided Missile Site for the protection of the Fort Worth-Dallas area in case of enemy attack was activated. On July 1, 1956, Wolters Air Force was reverted to Army control with the mission to train helicopter pilots.</p>
<p>In September 1956 the base became the Primary Helicopter Center directed by the United States Army. In June 1963 it was renamed Fort Wolters. At the time all army rotary-wing aviators received basic and primary flight training there. The Vietnam War increased the need for pilots, and the base became the home for training not just army personnel, but also helicopter pilots for the Marine Corps in 1968 and for the Air Force in 1970. By 1970 Fort Wolters covered 8,500 acres and leased an additional 1,700 to help handle the 1,200 helicopters used at the camp. Training was done at the Main Heliport &amp; two others: Downing &amp; Dempsey, as well as 25 smaller stage fields. The first seven stage fields were given "western" names (Bronco, Pinto, Ramrod, Mustang &amp; Sundance), while the rest were named after towns in Vietnam to get the students used to the names (An Khe, Vung Tau, Tuy Hoa, Cam Ranh, Hue, Chu Lai, Soc Trang, My Tho, Bien Hoa &amp; Vinh Long).</p>
<p>By January 1, 1973, 40,000 students had completed the twenty-week training program. The base was also the home of the Beach Army Hospital, the Eighty-fourth Military Police Detachment, the 328th United States Army Band, and United States Army Reserve Detachment 20, Sixteenth Weather Squadron.</p>
<p>In 1975 orders deactivating the base were issued. All government property on Fort Wolters was turned over to the General Service Administration for disposal. With pressure from the Texas National Guard, GSA was seriously considering transferring Fort Wolters to the National Guard for week end and summer training with a six man permanent party. This theory was reversed by city fathers who were looking for very much needed tax revenues. A disposition plan was submitted to GSA for consideration, which was approved.</p>
<p>All property not designated for the National Guard, Mineral Wells State Park, Health and Education would be sold under the supervision of the City of Mineral Wells with GSA price approval. Part of the land and facilities became the property of the city and private businessmen; ninety acres and thirteen buildings became the Education Center of Weatherford College. A portion of the land was also transferred by the United States government to the state of Texas for development as part of Lake Mineral Wells State Park.</p>
<p>Today, the site is known as Wolters Industrial Park and is privately owned, but the roads are still quite driveable and many areas are open for business, a drive and a few photographs. One of these businesses is Fort Wolters Helicopters, which maintains the only active aviation facility at Fort Wolters, the Fort Wolters Helicopters Heliport. Their business is located in the former engine shop of the Army Primary Helicopter Training Center.</p>

<p>Recently, many new buses have been bought and lots of money invested. Since the buses have to travel more longer distances compared with other bus routes, they have better suspensions and engines to cope with longer travel. In 2004,2005,2006 all the old buses except 2 have been replaced giving the average fleet age of being about 3.5 years old.</p>

<p>I have a need for information concerning this Autism-like 2 year old I am currently working with in a Daycare Center. From the breif glances I have just taken of the Autistic page at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#Effects_in_education" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#Effects_in_education" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#Effects_in_education</a>, and other related sites I've checked out thus far in my researching. I have been familiar with mentally-challenged-kids in my past. I just can't seem to find that "niche" as of yet in the breif span of time that I've had under my belt of working with this child. I am aware that no two Children are the same, nor will the same method of interaction work well with two different individuals. I'm basically just lost as to what do do now with this boy, my Job-coach told me today of a token proceedure, will that work well with a 2-year old? 67.98.23.118 21:09, 15 June 2006 (UTC) Brian Young [Jesuslovefor@yahoo.com] is my email, if you think you might be able to help me out, send me a note or something, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>These semi-permanent structures dotted the Silk Road and the Middle East to serve as waypoints and inns for caravans on well-established trade routes; they were safer than camping in the wild and could resupply the caravans with water, food, and feed for draft animals. In essence, they were large walled courtyards with some outbuildings. I don't know enough about them to say much more--I was hoping to learn more here at Wikipedia.</p>
