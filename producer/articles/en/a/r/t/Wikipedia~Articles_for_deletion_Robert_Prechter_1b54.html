<p>I'm sorry to say that I'm one of the people considered to be edit-warring on this page, but I don't think that is just in that I've always attempted to add things and not delete.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say that Prechter is not notable, since he has had an article dedicated to him on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, and all the following make significant reference to him (I can add several articles from the Financial Times as well - he is also notable in Europe)</p>

<p>The trouble with this article is that Rgfolsom (Robert Folsom), who confirms that he works for Prechter, refuses to let this material into the article. I don't know how to make Folsom not revert this material - perhaps it is impossible. But I think that the article should be kept, if material from reputable publications is allowed. Of course if only material straight from Prechter is allowed, then the article should be deleted.</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> per Smallbones. Edit warring is not a deletion grounds. I tend to agree that promotional links should not be included. If it can be confirmed (the link given is broken) that the man had a NYT best seller and was mentioned on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, he seems to be at least borderline notable as a stock analyst. If the man's predictions got this much commentary, he almost surely merits an article. Argument about the content of the page should be taken to a dispute resolution process; it ain't a deletion matter. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:57, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Prechter has authored or edited 14 books, including Conquer the Crash, a New York Times bestseller.[1] He has also published monthly financial commentary in the Elliott Wave Theorist since 1979.[2] In recent years Prechter has supported the study of socionomics, a theory about the dynamics of human social behavior.

<dd>[1] is a blocked website (you have to register to read the review) ... BTW, is having one of his 14 books on the list for only one week sufficient for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>?</dd>
<dd>[2] is a reference to his self-published monthly newsletter, <i>Elliott Wave Theorist</i> - hardly a 3rd party claim of notability; it's just support for the assertion that he's been writing his own tip-sheet for almost 30 years.</dd>
<dd>[3] is a reference to his book, published by his own company, New Classics Library - again, very <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If someone should include Real Citations (with ISBNs) for that list of books he has authored, we'd see that they are self-published as well ... I could write a dozen books and start my own company to publish them ... does that mean that if I can get a periodical with a Wikipedia article to write a review of one of them, then I can have a biographical article, too?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So far, the only 3rd party references for him (including those mentioned above by <a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmallbones_ca2c.html" title="User:Smallbones">Smallbones</a>) appear to demonstrate that his <i>noteriety</i> (not the same thing as <i>notability</i>) stems from his failures as a stock prognosticator.

<p>Looks like I'll be the first editor who actually bothers to quote the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> guidelines. That article says, "People who satisfy at least one of the items below may merit their own Wikipedia articles," and I will show that Prechter is a public figure who meets several of the "items" in the guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.</i></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Prechter was the primary subject of "Business books take a bearish turn," a <i>USA Today</i> article on Aug 23, 2002, p. B3. Since 1987, Prechter has been mentioned by name 71 times in <i>USA Today</i>.</li>
<li>Prechter was the primary subject of "2 Theorists Split On Elliott Wave," a <i>New York Times</i> article on Feb. 6, 1989, p. D6. Since 1981, Prechter has been mentioned by name 25 times in the <i>New York Times</i>.</li>
<li>Prechter was the primary subject of "3600 on the Dow?," a <i>Barron's</i> front page article on Jan. 5, 1987. Since 1996, Prechter has been mentioned by name 34 times in <i>Barron's</i>/<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>.</li>
<li>Prechter was the primary subject of "Storm Warning! How Social Mood Drives Markets," a <i>Futures</i> magazine cover article, Nov. 2004.</li>
<li>Prechter was the primary subject of "Why Bears Growl," a <i>Kiplinger Personal Finance</i> article, October 2005, p. 46.</li>
<li>Prechter was the primary subject of "Bob Prechter Interview," <i>The Technical Analyst</i> cover article, July/August 2006 issue.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><i>Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Contrary to the false claim that Prechter's books are all self-published, <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471988499.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471988499.html" rel="nofollow">Elliott Wave Principle</a>, <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471979546.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471979546.html" rel="nofollow">At the Crest of the Tidal Wave</a>, and <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470870907.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470870907.html" rel="nofollow">Conquer the Crash</a> were published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, a large and reputable publishing house. Click on the links, the reviews are quoted on the Wiley pages.</p>
<p>Challenging the bestseller status of Conquer the Crash is silly. I'll remove the link that requires a subscription, but I also provided the page number in the citation for the NYT Book Review, which is for the actual list of best sellers <b>with Conquer the Crash listed</b>. It wasn't just on the best sellers lists for one week, either -- it was on the Wall Street Journal's bestseller list for 2 1/2 months, 12 July 2002 through 27 Sept. 2002. (Look it up online if you're a WSJ subscriber, otherwise you can hoof it the nearest library if you're motivated enough to check my facts.)</p>
<p>Prechter was also published in a scholarly journal, "Unconscious herding behavior as the psychological basis of financial market trends and patterns." <i>Journal of Behavioral Finance</i>, 2 (3), 2001, pp. 120-125.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Search Engine Test -- Does a search for the subject produce a large number of distinguishable hits on Google…</i></li>
</ul>
<p>A Google search for "Robert Prechter" brings more than 60,000 results -- and those EXCLUDE results from elliottwave.com, socionomics.net, and socionomics.org. What's more, some 28,000 of the Google search results are non-English language, so Prechter has wide international notability.</p>
<p>Finally, for the record, my edits to Prechter's bio have NOT included ANY links to Prechter's products or commercial web site. This claim is rubbish, as anyone who checks the list of my contributions will plainly see.</p>
<p>This AFD is unnecessary and a waste of time. Prechter clearly meets Wikipedia's notability criteria. Before this AFD, I had politely said I was willing to find and include additional third-party sources for the Prechter bio.

<p>You instigated an AFD on notability that has been steamrolled by the weight of the facts in every relevant Wikipedia criterion, including a few I didn’t even address -- such as the “widely recognized” and “professor” tests. You also made demonstrably phony claims about me using the article as a soapbox.</p>
<p>Yet in the face of this… you patronize me about Guidelines vs. Policy, the meaning of “may,” and where else to put all the evidence I offer? Oh my.</p>

<dd>The guy's marketing hype works overboard and lures in suckers by the day. He was ONCE good, in the 1980's when the waves were "easier" to read. Not any more. But the hype keeps luring suckers in. Despite having admitted that he's called 1998 to 2006 completely wrong (recent Elliott Wave Threorist said this period "has not been tradable using my tools"), the marketing machine works overboard.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Traders Big 5 Flash service has produced such atrocious results that EWI hid them once people realised they were listed on their website. And they neglect to mention that this service has turned over 4 analysts in a year. But the marketing hyperbole continues: <i>Whichever category you belong to, you probably don't have time to scan the markets for high-probability trading opportunities all day long, day after day, all through the year. That's what Flash does for you.</i> In my opinion, even <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a> would find such bending of the truth stranger than fiction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I think the WP article, with it's fair criticism section, does a public service. There are few places on the internet where the other view can be heard. If Prechter's analysis was any good, the results should speak for themselves. Don't take my word for it, ask EWI for some statistics to prove the results that are achieved. They will probably decline and point to a trading contest win ... from nearly 25 years ago.

<dd>I am asking that you promptly remove the Robert Prechter biography as an article for deletion. The editor who requested the AFD spurned my <i><b>prior</b></i> good-faith attempt to resolve the primary sources issue. This editor also made false claims about "links to the subject's publications," plus other reckless accusations; and, given what we can all read <a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.75.93.131.html" title="User talk:72.75.93.131">here</a>, there is strong reason to believe that this AFD process should not have happened at all.</dd>

<dd>Even so, I have since added reputable third-party citations to the Prechter bio. In this AFD discussion I've shown that Prechter surpasses the standards explained in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>, and the evidence I've presented on this page has not been challenged; it's also self-evident that the opinions expressed to "keep" the article already go beyond the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html#Rough_consensus" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">rough consensus</a> standard.
