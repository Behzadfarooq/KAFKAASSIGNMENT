<dd>Absolutely. They are both veterans of the Iraqi war who then became candidates for Congress. The only difference is that Hackett has lost, and Murphy is still running. --<a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbl_629a.html" title="User:Asbl">Asbl</a> 23:33, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Some candidates or campaigns receive so much attention that they are notable, even in losing. That campaign gathered a huge amount of press, not just in the district, but in the national press, which makes it notable. The point is that merely being a candidate (and gathering some local press for being one) is not sufficient to be considered notable, and right now we're seeing a lot of articles for people who have no claim of notability other than that they're running for something. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 20:17, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That is a ridiculous policy and it's unhealthy for democracy. If you consider Patrick Murphy non-notable, then what the hell is notable about Mike Fitzgerald? There are certainly many notable Congressmen, but he's not exactly one of them. Why is Wikipedia arbitrarily deciding that US Congressmen are all notable regardless of whether they've done anything notable but their opponents are not. I especially don't like being told by some British wanker that Federal candidates aren't notable. What do you know about anything American anyway? You can't even spell valour.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. I just checked that the challenger in my district doesn't have an article (yet). Despite the fact that I'll vote for him, I don't think he deserves an article, either. (As an aside, I might be willing to support a policy change to keep such articles if someone could arrange a self-destruct mechanism to delete them the day after the election unless they win. The problem is that these things get created and, like the campaign signs by the side of the road, the people who put them up never clean them up afterward.) <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 17:26, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, they come through here, regularly, as someone finds them.

<li><b>Keep</b>. For one thing, being a candidate for Federal office in a general election certainly makes someone notable. Second, do we really want Wikipedia to be in the business of deciding that incumbents are notable but challengers aren't. That's not really serving the public. Third, there are many wikipedia pages for Congressional candidates, like <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Lampson_8e09.html" title="Nick Lampson">Nick Lampson</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francine_Busby_438f.html" title="Francine Busby">Francine Busby</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diane_Farrell_6b4b.html" title="Diane Farrell">Diane Farrell</a>, [[John D.

<li><b>Comment</b> The reason there are so many WP articles for candidates is that they have put them there and we haven't found them yet! Unless those candidates are notable in their own right, and I am not prejudging this, an AfD will follow. We are an encyclopaedia and record notable events. If the candidate wins they become notable by definiton. It is the candiadtes who are playing politics not us. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlueValour_0082.html" title="User talk:BlueValour">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BlueValour_6735.html" title="Special:Contributions/BlueValour">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<dd>You seem to be missing the point that being a candidate for federal office in and of itself makes them notable people. I don't understand how you can't grasp that. Ortcutt 05:11, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are many, many people who do not share that viewpoint. I live in a district where the Democratic candidate for congress is usually whoever volunteered to be the sacrificial lamb against a safe incumbent. Is that candidate notable? No, he's just being a good sport on behalf of the party, becuase the guy who did it the last two elections decided it was someone else's turn. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 13:19, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree that many (probably most) mere candidates are neither credible candidates nor important people. Downticket candidates, sacrificial lambs, and crank third-party or independent candidates don't deserve pages. However, there are surely some major races (in the U.S., governor, Senate, and highly competitive House races) for which a major candidate should be kept. Just a few weeks ago, I was disappointed to find that Jon Grunseth (disgraced 1990 candidate for Minnesota governor) lacked a Wikipedia page, even though he was part of an interesting chapter in Minnesota political history. 14:46, 1 July 2006 (UTC)<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bschak (<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschak_7508.html" title="User talk:Bschak">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bschak_4a64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bschak">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
