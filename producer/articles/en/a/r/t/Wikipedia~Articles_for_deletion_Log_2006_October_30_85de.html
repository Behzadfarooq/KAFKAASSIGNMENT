<li><b>Delete</b> This is what categories are for.

<li><b>Delete</b> It's useful. It's much easier to read than a category page. It makes Wikipedia easier to navigate and thus easier to use. If I have understood this project's objectives correctly, the aim of the Wikipedia project is to gather information that can be found elsewhere, but make it harder to use. Therefore this excellent article should be deleted. --Multivitamin 22:58, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Tribadism seems to be notable, both as a sex position and historically, but tryin to figure out the difference between "frot" and "frottage" is making my brain hurt. There's also a surprising amount of anti-anal-sex POV propagandism in the 'frot' page that should go out if both pages are merged. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 03:05, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Men can do both frot and anal. Nevertheless the cultural importance of frot (as equivalent to tribadism) emerged as part of a polemic against anal sex. Especially in relationship to the threat of AIDS to gay men. This is simply a historical fact. Describing the polemic neutrally doesnt necessarily reflect the opinion of the Wikipedia article. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldrik_30ef.html" title="User:Haldrik">Haldrik</a> 19:25, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep/Against delete</b>Term is a neologism, but Wikipedia does not have a policy against neologism, just a bias, since most of them require original research to support. In this case, there are supportable references (even though few), and so being a new term is not a problem. Content is distinct from other articles, including frottage. As for the "POV propagandism", well the term is primarily about non-anal-sex, so what would anyone expect? Should we delete it because it is a type of sexuality we ourselves don't practice? That wouldn't seem right. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 03:28, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep/Against merge</b> - Frot refers to male-male genital-genital sex, frottage does not. The term <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frottage.html" title="Frottage">frottage</a> can't be used because it refers to MANY methods of sex, whether heterosexual or homosexual, clothed or naked, genital or non-genital. Frottage doesn't connote male-male genital-genital sex. Only frot specifies it. Frot exactly parallels <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribadism.html" title="Tribadism">tribadism</a>, which is female-female genital-genital sex, and to keep tribadism while deleting frot would be severe discrimination. Frot refers to an extremely notable, primordial method of sex (it even exists among <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonobo.html" title="Bonobo">bonobo</a>), despite the fact that Greek/Latin and thus traditional English lacks a word for it. It is customary in Wikipedia to use whatever term is prevalent for a specific sex position, regardless of whether its origin is slang or the porn industry, because medical jargon is often useless for describing specific positions. In this case, frot is the prevailing term. Genital sex doesn't automatically require penetration, and to imply that frot isn't real genital-genital sex because real sex must include penetration is a male heterosexual bias, and discrimination against other forms of genital sex, including <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribadism.html" title="Tribadism">tribadism</a>. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldrik_30ef.html" title="User:Haldrik">Haldrik</a> 18:36, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I dont think people are questioning the act, nor denying the convenience of it mirroring tribadism. The deletion revolves around whether the term is notable, not the act.

Go look at "My Waking Dream" (its under construction right now but here's an internet archive <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050204072328/www.keepstill.com/wakingdream/main.html?v=20040822" class="external free" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20050204072328/www.keepstill.com/wakingdream/main.html?v=20040822" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20050204072328/www.keepstill.com/wakingdream/main.html?v=20040822</a>) there's a section for "Dick2Dick" but nothing whatsoever for "frot". I'm pretty sure these sites weren't created with a heterosexual male bias.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore "frot" (<a href="http://www.salon.com/people/col/cintra/1999/05/19/povparty/print.html" class="external free" title="http://www.salon.com/people/col/cintra/1999/05/19/povparty/print.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.salon.com/people/col/cintra/1999/05/19/povparty/print.html</a> , <a href="http://www.upsideclown.com/2002_09_02.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.upsideclown.com/2002_09_02.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.upsideclown.com/2002_09_02.shtml</a> ) and "frotting" (<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Frotting" class="external free" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Frotting" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Frotting</a>) can apparently be used as synonyms for frottage, including heterosexual frottage.

<li><b>Comment</b> There are no serious sources, there's just that ridiculous website and porn, actually I would say porn is a good deal more serious because it actually caters to peoples desires without all that silly preaching, mentioning the source of this neologism would be one thing, but naming the article based on their term is blatant POV, if "Male-male genital-genital sex" is too long why not just call it "penis-to-penis sex" or "penis-penis sex" (which is already what its been called for some time now on the informal redirect found on Frot and Frottage), thats essentially what the pornographic sites call it except we would be using penis instead of "dick" or "cock". --Onhm 17:45, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

In fact, the only reason Onhm tries to vandalize the <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frot.html" title="Frot">Frot</a> article now, is because the word "frot" was coined to specify male-male genital-genital sex as a notable way for the gay community to have an alternative to avoid the health risks of anal sex. There is nothing wrong with defending the legitimacy of anal sex. But, it is vandalism to delete notable points of view that critique anal sex.

<li><b>Comment</b>I didn't mean it as a "term" I ment it as a description, some wikipedia articles use descriptions of things, rather than names of things as titles, but if thats a problem we could always merge to frottage, which is what its usually called anyway. Frot is <i>not</i> a technical term, its a neologism used pretty much exlusively by a highly POV webiste and people making reference to that website, the technical term is frottage, even gay porn sites <i>one of which speicalizes in penis to penis sex</i> call it frottage, theres not a more specific technical term, it doesn't exist, and its not prejeduced or discriminatory to refuse to pretend otherwise.</li>

<li>The point is, quite simply, that "frot" <i>is not</i> the term in general use for this type of sexual activity. It's a valid article, because the <i>practice</i> certainly exists, but "frot" is not the correct title for it, because nobody <i>calls it that</i> except for one agenda-driven website. Wikipedia does not exist to promote new terms that people would <i>like</i> to apply to their favourite things; it exists to document the terms that <i>are</i> in general use. This term has <i>no</i> actual currency in normal discussions of sexuality; the article needs to be titled with a term that people <i>actually use</i>. <b>Move</b> to any appropriate alternate title. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 01:25, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Frottage isn't the technical term. Frottage is an archaic term which has an entirely different meaning.

<li><b>Comment</b> in any event "frot" is not a word that is used outside this narrow little community, its not some widely recognized real-life term used by all men who like frottage (which is not an archaic term, I just showed everyone an online porn site that still calls it frottage not "frot") NPOV is about more than opinions, group-specific language is just as much a part of someones POV as their values, if most conventionally reliable sources as well as pornography call men rubbing their penises together "frottage" then thats what wikipedia should call it. Docking, mutual masturbation and intercrural intercourse can involve penis to penis contact as well (the penile bulb or "root" goes back between a the legs along the perineum) so the whole deal with keeping it to preserve "equal time" for different types of genital-genital sex shouldn't be an issue because frottage isn't the only sexual act that may or may not involve genito-genital contact depending on the sex and position of the participantsOnhm 17:18, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Maybe you're taking yourself too seriously here. Your proof that frot should be deleted is a porn site, while there is more than one community action group that is serious about promoting it (and not exploiting it for money) that uses the term "frot". Maybe we should change all words in wikipedia that don't meet the criteria of some pornographic website's lexicon? You complain about group-specific language and then discredit your argument by basing it on the group-specific language of the porn industry. Meanwhile you're ignoring the reality that outside of wikipedia, even if you succeed in your petty little quest to destroy this entry, the term "frot" will still be used as separate and distinct from the term "frottage." The end result of a merge for this term won't be increased accuracy of wikipedia, it will be the increased marginalization of wikipedia as innaccurate, out of date, and ultimately unreliable. Isn't increased reliability of wikipedia something that the community here should be fighting for ABOVE AND BEYOND any other personal problems with a group?Xsaithx 01:15, 1 November 2006 (UTC)xsaithx</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Despite the fact that frot has always existed, English didnt have a word for it. Now "frot" is the word that has come to be used for it, and its etymology is notable. Similarly, the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribadism.html" title="Tribadism">Tribadism</a> article talks about the etymology of term "tribadism". Originally, the Greek word had nothing to do with female-female genital-genital sex, but came to mean this only in relatively recent times. Originally the Greek word referred to a woman who used a dildo, which is irrelevant to its meaning today. The etymology of "tribadism" is notable, and must be described. There is a paragraph or so explaining (quite well) the origin and evolution of the term. It is the same with the <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frot.html" title="Frot">Frot</a> article. The etymology is notable. The term didnt emerge in the context of Greek women who wanted to sexually penetrate others, but in the context of American gay men who wanted to avoid anal sex. It's just a description of the origin and evolution of the term. Today, the term "frot" simply means male-male genital-genital sex. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldrik_30ef.html" title="User:Haldrik">Haldrik</a> 00:32, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

The difference between "frot" and "Klingon" is that entries like "Klingon" have no pretense of applying to the real world.

<li>Can you kindly show some of those sources? Because I can't find a single example on Google of the word existing in general use; the only people using it out there on the web are those with a vested interest in <i>promoting</i> the term. Anyway, just on the off chance that my lack of experience with the term was somehow not representative of actual usage, I asked five different friends today what <i>they</i> would call this act. <i>Every single one</i> of them came up with "frottage". I then asked if they would ever abbreviate that to "frot", and every one of them looked at me like I was speaking Klingon. So is frot the term in general use? Is it the <i>only</i> term for this particular sexual act?

<li>Not independent reliable sources, in all the few cases I've seen of anyone writing the word "frot" anywhere outside that website they are either self consciously adopting the terminology of that webstie because they are commenting on it, or using it as a slang shortening of frottage like in those examples ealier where straight people were saying they liked to frot; when people talk about frottage in the same sort of contexts where people would say <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual intercourse</a> rather than fucking. <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">oral sex</a> rather than blow job, and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a> rather than jerking off, they call it "frottage", even on the other end of the spectrum in gay porn its called frottage (I think I've already cited both of these). Just like mutual masturbation is still mutual masturbation when the men's penises are touching, intercurural intercourse is still intercrural intercourse when the genitals are touching, just like heterosexual frottage is still frottage when the penis and clitoris are touching. Yes they are all genito-genital sex, thats wonderful, but the term doesn't change. If it had some prior (verifiable) existence as a regional slang term than it might still be notable only as a slang term (like <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a>), not the proper place to list information on the sex act.

<li><b>Comment</b> -- The sheer size of the radio industry makes such a list pointless. A category is at least somewhat maintainable since the category process is largely automated, but lists have to be updated manually, and a list of talk radio personalities would be overwhelming in that regard. Even just national personalities or those limited to a major radio market would be rather long, never mind a comprehensive list. What I'm getting at is that such a list could never approach any reasonable standard of completion. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 18:20, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I just wanted to add some info for the debate - The Acolyte's works have only recently begun to appear in more known areas (DDR), the lack of songs goes against him, but the fact they exist there and are noted (I forgot to add the reference for DDR Universe, where one of his songs will be featured: <a href="http://www.hurricanejapan.com/home.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.hurricanejapan.com/home.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.hurricanejapan.com/home.asp</a> Hurricane Japan works with companies like Konami to find individual artists and then submit their work, thats how he's gotten into other DDR games). What really is the problem, advertising? The fact that references are made to the artists own website?

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Does every gang in Detroit deserve article in Wiki? No it doesn't. But "Gangs in Detroit" I think deserve separate article. User that <b>currently</b> works (in vain) on gangs of Detroit should expand current article, instead of creating stub for each gang. As to verifiability - 50-70% of what he writes can be verified, he knows what his writing about. He simply does it the wrong way, and sadly Wiki community does not want to help him at all. Sure "Delete it all", that's the easiest solution. Why should we get bothered. -- <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopaedia_Editing_Dude_97c1.html" title="User:Encyclopaedia Editing Dude">Encyclopaedia Editing Dude</a> 08:02, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Therein lies the point. How can we verify that any given gang on this list is in fact (A) a gang and (B) a notable gang which is worthy of inclusion here? Except in the most exceptional of circumstances, I doubt we can. By their very nature, gangs only really get mentions when their members are arrested. What we have in this list is a bunch of names which people call themselves when they hang out with their friends and (probably) commit petty crimes. Writing an article on any of those gangs currently redlinked doesn't mean that they suddenly become more than your run-of-the-mill petty hoodlums. If the articles which are being created are being deleted, it probably says more about the lack of sourcing than anyone else's commitment to the project. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 08:39, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, the user currently writing about gangs has problems with sourcing, but the sources are there. For example recently speedy deleted article on Dexter Linwood Area could have been sourced <a href="http://www.statenews.com/op_article.phtml?pk=14272" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.statenews.com/op_article.phtml?pk=14272" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. I agree that DLA maybe does not deserve article of its own, but it was worth putting into main Detroit gangs article. If hostilities between gangs drag on for more than 25 years, there is more to it, than just quarrel between bunch of hoodlum kids. -- <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopaedia_Editing_Dude_97c1.html" title="User:Encyclopaedia Editing Dude">Encyclopaedia Editing Dude</a> 09:32, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's true enough, and it may well make the particular gangs in question notable. What it doesn't, though, is warrant the existence of this very large and open-to-abuse list. I'm not saying that there aren't notable gangs in Detroit or anywhere else, just that having a list where every single self-described gang can list itself is a recipe for disaster. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:00, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's what Wiki is about. Its concept (that anyone can write anything) is a recipe for disaster, and the only articles not open-to-abuse are ones that are currently blocked for editing (due to previuos abuse). But yet Wiki manages not to turn into complete chaos. Article about gangs is also managable - quick google check can separate sourced and notable gangs from bunch of kids from the hood. But who gets bothered with fact checking and finding sources these days, then there is such a quick and easy solution as AfD, or Del per nom. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopaedia_Editing_Dude_97c1.html" title="User:Encyclopaedia Editing Dude">Encyclopaedia Editing Dude</a> 11:48, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why is it not better policy to create a series of well-sourced articles on Detroit (or anywhere else) gangs first and list them later, rather than doing it the other way around? If the sources are out there and added, the articles won't get deleted in the first place. Typecasting me as a deletionist is hardly a useful thing to do either. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 12:06, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not typecasting YOU as a deletionist, I'm just saying that most of people (not all), that are complaining that "this or that" is unsourced or unverified, didn't try to find sources or verify facts for themselves. Further more I have noticed, then the article is dealing with certain subcultures, standarts become very high. When a bunch of white boys are singing in Catholic church choir we don't need much sources for that, but then a bunch of not so white boys engage in social activities rarely admired by general public, in that case the need for sources suddenly arises. But even if sources are provided, that does not always help, for example DLA article was tagged for speedy deletion, I've put hangon tag, provided source in the talk page, never the less, the article was speedy deleted. Another example then provided sources seem not to help can be found here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Order_of_the_Left_Hand_Path" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Order_of_the_Left_Hand_Path" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopaedia_Editing_Dude_97c1.html" title="User:Encyclopaedia Editing Dude">Encyclopaedia Editing Dude</a> 12:39, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Standards are (in my experience) roughly the same across the board. Have a look at the number of AfDs on college acapella groups - the overwhelming majority of which at least verifiably exist but aren't notable. These gangs are largely the same case - verifiable existence (at best, something which doesn't necessarily apply to every single one) but lacking in notability. In terms of sources themselves, all these examples prove is that it's about the strength of what's provided. In the case of the DLA, you've said earlier on that perhaps they don't deserve an article, and that view was supported by the deletion of the article. Adding a hangon tag doesn't magically make the article immune from deletion, it warns the admin who sees it that there's perhaps more to the story - perhaps not enough more to make it keepable, but more nonetheless. In the case of the Order of the Left Hand Path, I'll post my comments at that AfD to spare everyone here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:35, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Conclude your search then cycle through the number of pages until there are no more, tell me how many are listed at the top entries C - X of Y. That X is the total of unique hits, meaning if one page mentions it 8000 times, then you will get 8000, however 1 entry. Hits and unique hits are different. This also counts for pages on a domain, so if we use livejournal as an example, it will consolidate all of the livejournal hits into 1 entry, that is a unique hit.

<dd>It would be good in that case to strike your argument about '575 unique Google hits,' which is based on methodology specifically warned against by the Google Test article. In comparison, the figure of 55,000 ghits represents an uncontroversial and indeed near-universal observation in regard to VfDs. I don't believe you're claiming that ghits are inadmissible on principle.

<li>(many colon marks) I believe my argument is that in addition to 55,000 ghits, the film was shown at at least one major festival, was budgeted and professionally made, and as such is not equivalent to a YouTube video.

<li>That's a succinct summary. Thank you. My disagreement comprises three points: 1) Participation in a major film festival is notable, and is not fairly described as 'one screening,' which implies that the film was only screened once, somewhere. In fact, there seem to be <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=kGx&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=votergate+festival&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=kGx&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=votergate+festival&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">multiple screenings</a>. 2) Ghits are generally considered a quick-and-dirty test of notability, despite claims made in this discussion that they carry no weight at all. This is an uncontroversial statement that would ordinarily be regarded as <i>a priori</i> true. My position is that it is inconsistent to create an estimate of 575+/- unique hits (from a total of 55,000) as an argument toward deletion, and then to disallow ghits entirely when such methodology is shown to be faulty. 3) Re: distribution, theatre release, etc., yes, you may have a point. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 15:48, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps those film festivals are not widely recognized that the IMDB page does not often recognize them, some seem to be specifically guaged at that genre of work, meaning its not a industry film festival. If it was Cannes, I would think there would be a sense of notability, at least if it won an award. However appearing in festivals that are crafted for tis type of film is not the same as industry festivals like Cannes. The basic idea is notability, appearing at non-notable places does not increase that. As for the ghits arguement, sorry if you misunderstood me. I do not believe in the google test and attempted to argue on your basis before just dropping the bomb that the article itself says its not reliable. It was an attempt to reacha middleground, perhaps us stating its something to attribute but not establish, like a piece of the puzzle. However that went south. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 21:17, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

If someone creates an article about a serious documentary, I see no reason why we can't keep the article. A move to Votergate (film) would be called for only if we had another article at Votergate, but I could see moving it now on the theory that we might well have a more general article in the future. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 01:12, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Agree with the comments of JamesMLane above and would add the following. First, an observation: it is clear from the comments here that there is by no means any consensus about the deletion of this entry and that therefore it should be retained as is. Second, with regard to the handful of comments above alleging that this film is non-notable and/or political, I strongly disagree. Such comments run counter to the facts and the evidence is readily available on line and in the pages of the thousands -- that's right THOUSANDS -- of mainstream and alternative media articles, both in print and online, on the subject of electronic voting. The Votergate film series was the first to identify the security defects in touchscreen voting systems. These are systems that 80% of Americans will vote on this November. Votergate catalogued the 3 ways that the machines may be hacked: (1) physical; (2) smartcard; (3) central tabulation. These revelations provided the basis for numerous investigations and governmental reports, including the Carter-Baker Commission (a bi-partisan Commission). The aftershocks of this film are still being felt, and the issues raised by the film have been taken up by grassroots organizations (both partisan, non-partisan, and bi-partisan) across the country. It has been a rallying cry for election protection in this country. This film played an essential part in the fight for honest elections across the United States. (And, in light of the comments here I must again reiterate that honest elections implies an expressly non-political point of view.) The goal of this film is to have every American's vote count as cast. And, that is something that everyone who values knowledge, truth and the right to be heard -- whether American or not -- should support. In the final analysis, this film series deserves recognition and retention as an entry both for its prescience on the issue of voting systems and because it has served a purpose only the rarest of films achieve: it moved hundreds of thousands of people to action.Heat Miser&#160;20:03, 1 November 2006 (UTC)<small>— <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_miser_7ab4.html" title="User:Heat miser">Heat miser</a> (<a href="../../../h/e/a/User_talk%7EHeat_miser_7362.html" title="User talk:Heat miser">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heat_miser_f12c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heat miser">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Please re-read my post. I have not made "the claim that this movie started the entire movement to take a look into voting machines." Rather, I made the claim that this film publicized the movement and moved hundreds of thousands of people to action after these issues were disclosed. So, first, I would agree with Auto movil below as to the fact that Bev Harris was one of the first ones to start this movement. I am not aware of her "Black Box Voting" films. (Bev does however make several strong appearances in the Votergate films, and these films are historical records of her work.) Nonetheless, if there are such films, I would submit that they also would be entitled to a separate entry, since this is the singlemost important issue facing our democracy. If people's votes are not counted honestly, then we do not have a democracy. Second, I note your certain contributions to wiki so let us look at your entry for Timbaland. You must feel that Timbaland is notable and worthy of an entry here on wiki, or else you would not have wasted your time. Surely we can agree that Votergate had at least as much impact on American society in the last 2 years as Timbaland and Dr. Noyd? Third, in response to your comment to Auto movil above, Votergate is clearly not just a "YouTube" video (although the director/producers seem to now be savvy to using YouTube as an avenue for advertising). It is in the IMDB database. If there is time for me to find additional sources before this comment period closes, I will do so, but a simple Google search will turn up a plethora of reviews, entries and media about the films, including the IMDB entry. Finally, I am of course interested in continuing this dialogue with you, but I must note again that at this point there is clearly no consensus here on deletion, which is the standard set by wiki for removal.Heat Miser;15:06, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>Ok so the new claim is "and moved hundreds of thousands of people to action after these issues were disclosed", do you haev a source for this that satisfys WP:RS and WP:V? else this is all just your personal opinion on the movies and not really anything that cna be added to the article to allow it to meet requirements. Also since you do not know, IMDB is now editable by readers. Further I am not sure what you see as no concensus, so far the only arguement made is lots of ghits and claims that it motivated hundreds of thousands, which I would like to see a source for, and your bickering at my edit history, which i remind you, discuss the content, not the editor. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 12:58, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is not MY "new" claim. This is the claim I made in my original statement, that you deliberately misinterpreted in an attempt to make my case more difficult to prove. Similarly, the standard you have set here also overreaches. As shown by Derex above with regard to the Clinton Chronicles, the standard for notability you have set is not the standard for material here. You have moved from one argument to the other in an attempt to provide a basis for deletion. Why are you doing this? I don't know. I do know that your entry on Timbaland suffers from the same defects you are trumpeting here. And, no, I did not give the example of Timbaland to get into your edit history. Only you seem to be concerned about that. Rather, I sought to use your entry on Timbaland in order to communicate with you by using an example you were familiar with. I did so in the interest of moving this discussion forward. I ask you, if you feel Timbaland is worthy of entry here, why not Votergate? This brings up another point. Timbaland is ancient history. The Votergate films are a continuing series of films about a seminal issue of importance to the maintenance of real democracy in the world's only superpower. They are continuing to be produced as we speak. They will continue to have impact. They are therefore not "history" but reality. They deserve inclusion for this reason as well.

Simply because it is "edited partially by registered accounts" does not in any way reflect on its prominent position in the industry as a respected and authoritative source. I in fact submit that IMDb is run by people far more expert than those here on the subject of whether or not a film is notable or has an impact, and they take that responsibility very seriously.

<dd>Well, just to be clear, according to your link, this is a wiki guideline, although there is a box on the link that claims it is the subject of dispute. Nonetheless, I just reviewed it, and I can tell you unequivocally that I believe in sourcing and verification. You sound like you agree with the guideline and believe in this too. I will therefore attempt to provide you with some reliable sourcing regarding IMDb's authoritative status in the industry, and also regarding how IMDb operates (you have assumed it operates in the same manner, but in fact it operates differently than wiki, and the differences are critical to this discussion). First, I must reiterate that IMDb is an authoritative source and well-accepted in the motion picture industry. Here is an independent, reliable source for that proposition: <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/general/deadline-hollywood/do-you-imdb/9084/" class="external free" title="http://www.laweekly.com/general/deadline-hollywood/do-you-imdb/9084/" rel="nofollow">http://www.laweekly.com/general/deadline-hollywood/do-you-imdb/9084/</a>. A simple Google of IMDb will turn up numerous similar articles about IMDb's history, bios of its founder, and details about its operations. I invite you to educate yourself about this reputable, established, authoritative, reliable source before you comment further so we can have a meaningful discussion. In a nutshell, IMDb is similar to wikipedia in that it will allow members to submit material, but it is not identical. There are significant differences, and these differences relate specifically to how editing is executed. Unlike wiki, at IMDb, new material and revisions are submitted to a board of editors who are primarily based in Seattle. The LA Weekly article discusses this as well: <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/general/deadline-hollywood/do-you-imdb/9084/" class="external free" title="http://www.laweekly.com/general/deadline-hollywood/do-you-imdb/9084/" rel="nofollow">http://www.laweekly.com/general/deadline-hollywood/do-you-imdb/9084/</a>. Thus, as you can read in the article, no revisions are carried out by the community without prior review, fact-checking, and judgment FOR NOTABILITY, ACCURACY and other criteria by VERY savvy industry professionals. There can be little doubt that if a motion picture is listed at IMDb, especially one that is 2 years old, it has been vetted, the information is accurate AND it has been found to be notable.<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_miser_7ab4.html" title="User:Heat miser">Heat miser</a> 05:38, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please answer the question, you make claims like hundreds of thousands were motivated, yet you didnt provide a source, I am still waiting on one please. Also the fact that IMDB is wrong, is a good reason why its also not reliable. Thank you for proving that point. Also please note votergate was a term for the situation before the movie came out. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 21:39, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Friend you have now mischaracterized at least two of my posts. Either you have a problem with reading comprehension, or you are deliberately misstating my written words in an attempt to railroad this community into deleting this entry. Why? If you actually read my post above, or the article itself, you will find that it DOES NOT say that IMDb was wrong, rather, it said that the company, Diebold, was wrong and HBO/IMDb were correct. I stand by the fact that IMDb is an independent reliable source of experts on film. The folks there, of course, watched the film prior to ruling on its inclusion. Have you even watched the Votergate film? By your own admission you have not. And yet you would delete an entry here about it. Again, I must ask why? Is it hurting you to have this entry? What is your deal? You still have not responded at all to my Timbaland example. Are you interested in reaching a consensus here on what to do? Why does Timbaland deserve an entry and Votergate does not? Finally, as to your last point, whether or not Votergate was around as a term prior to the creation of the film has no bearing on the notability of the film or this entry. Was "Godfather" in use as a term prior to the release of "The Godfather?" Maybe that entry should be expunged as well? Heat Miser 20:57, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I didnt say you said IMDB was wrong, reading comprehension indeed. I am stating IMDB was wrong, Votergate and Hacking Democracy are two different movies, Diebold mistook one for the other, the movie the article is about, is Hacking Democracy, not Votergate. Also IMDB is not a independant reliable source ran by film experts, I am not sure what gave you taht idea, can you name these experts on film you believe run IMDB? I am sure you cannot. Since you cannot grasp this concept I will reiterate it one more time for you, The movie is not notable for anything, there is nothing that makes it stand out, its has not broken any records, screened anywhere important, been released in theatres (which still wouldnt be enough), its not notable, the more you go on about it leading hundreds of thousands to be inspired to the topic and refuse to give a source stating it, instead go on a tangent about something new and my edit history instead of providing such a source which you have been asked for now 3-4 times, the worse it makes your point look, which is that its notable cause it inspired people, something you have yet to prove, prove it already instead of writing paragraph long diatribes. Also I ask you not make foolish comparisons between Godfather the movie and the term Godfather, since if you bothered to read what I wrote, I was stating the phenomenon came before the movie, hence the google hits, its not a rationalization for deletion, its a rationalization for the high google count, which itself does not signify notabilit,y per its own article <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_test.html" title="Google test">google test</a>. Now before you write another diatribe and again attempt to harp on my edit history, how about you provide that source. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 15:10, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, with regard to IMDb: IMDb is a reliable source by any definition, for reasons I stated in my response to GRBerry above. To summarize, IMDb is not a user-edited site. It is run by VERY savvy industry professionals and any new or revised material is FIRST submitted to those professionals BEFORE it is posted. The professionals who run IMDb can be readily identified and sourced by running a search for "IMDb" on Google. They are "players" and their large editorial staff is well-financed by their corporate parent, Amazon. The article I cited for GRBerry is one of many that comes up in the search results. IMDb is therefore reliable and it is both relevant and probative of Votergate's notability that it is listed there. Second, with regard to the Hollywood Reporter source, I respond to your comments here in my post on Smeelgova's thread below and I would ask that we continue dialogue on this source there. To summarize, the fact that Diebold thought that a new Votergate was coming out, and that they acted with strong-arm tactics to stop it shows the great extent of Votergate's impact and how notable Diebold believes it to be. Finally, to reinforce the fact that it is not just Diebold who believes Votergate was notable and worthwhile, and also to put to rest this "notability" debate, I include this link to Alexa: <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=votergate.tv" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=votergate.tv" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=votergate.tv</a> If you examine the 3 year time frame, easily accessed by clicking the "3yr" tab, you will see that over 60 million -- that's right -- 60 MILLION people accessed the website showing portions of the Votergate film in the days leading up to and following the November 2004 election. I hope we can agree that Alexa.com is a reliable source, and that this readily demonstrates the notability and incredible significance of this film. You are correct that I originally said "hundreds of thousands." But it was actually over 60 MILLION people. Even I did know it was that high. I hope you will agree that this reliable Alexa.com source, plus the previously-mentioned 55,000 ghits sourcing mentioned by Auto movil and Derex above, puts the notability issue vis-a-vis Votergate to rest. Since Votergate is clearly notable, and furthermore, people are working to fill out the entry to bring it up to wiki standards, I would ask you to revise your "delete" opinion and change it to a "strong keep." <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_miser_7ab4.html" title="User:Heat miser">Heat miser</a> 07:55, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also you must be new to certain internet phrases, but hits do not equal people. A hit is registered when a page is reached, so if the site has 50 pages and 5 people visit and hit all 50 pages then they generated 1250 hits. If one of those people come back and review all 50 pages again, you are not at 1500 hits, get it? Hits do not symbolize individual people, nor do they even symbolize 1 person per visit. So 1 person can check out the site everyday for a week generating millions of hits on their own. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 14:39, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>From the producer...</b> Hello Wiki!! I am a producer of Votergate, the film in question. Permit me to thank all of your for your passionate arguments on both sides of this debate. Everyone involved in our documentary film believe in what you are doing as active members, and we use wikipedia regularly, even if we do so on a drive-by basis and (like me) are not "members" or regular contributors. So, thank you for your efforts to make this the best online encyclopedia. We truly believe it is a privilege to be included on your site at the moment. For several reasons, I would like to make the following contributions to this discussion and I hope this will bring about a positive discussion. Thank you for your consideration.
<dl>
<dd>A. As I documentary producer, I must do extensive research on my issues of interest, and this often includes documentary film history. I have used wikipedia over the years for film and cinema research on a variety of topics, and I plan to continue doing so. As a general matter, one of the most difficult topics to find information about is documentary. I have often been hard-pressed to find important information on obscure documentary topics that are nonetheless important to me as a film researcher, and as a film historian. Wikipedia has already made unbelievably important contributions in this area.</dd>
<dd>B. I believe the category of documentary film is special. Often, documentary is shot on extremely low budgets, and distribution is extremely difficult. "Getting the word out" is also not easy. On the flip side, documentarians have produced some significant material about the human experience. Now, I'm sure by now some of you are singing "Cry Me A River", but my point is this: if Wikipedia is to be the world's encyclopedic resource, it seems that one of the best things it can do is retain significant information about a very underreported area of art with a high level of social importance.</dd>
<dd>C. I don't believe that retaining information about documentary film, so long as it is accurate, will cost this site money or prestige. Far from it. As evidenced by a number of documentaries over the past few years, the category of documentary film is growing and I think wikipedia should be a resource for such films.</dd>
<dd>D. I won't pretend to have an answer for how to distinguish a notable documentary from one of lesser quality. In these days of reality television and YouTube, such a distinction is likely to become more difficult, not less. In any event, I believe this to be a very important issue, and I pledge to stay involved with it.</dd>
<dd>E. Turning to this debate specifically, I would make the following proposal and commitment to the Wikipedia community. (i) We would be wholly comfortable if the suggestion above to move our entry to Votergate (film) was approved. (ii) We would be willing to undertake the creation and buildout of an "Election Reform (films)" entry, where all the films on this subject, including ours, would be accurately described with the appropriate links. This would obviously be a longer term project and would include a great number of films over the last few decades.</dd>
<dd>F. Finally, to clear up at least a few issues raised above. Votergate is entirely non-partisan. We premiered this film at the National Press Club in early October '04 and had both John McCain's campaign manager Trevor Potter from the Election Reform Institute, and folks from more left-of-center good government groups like Common Cause presenting at the same podium. We have footage from the event and the subsequent premieres that I would be happy to post at YouTube if you require sourcing. In addition, the film was accepted into and screend at both the Hamptons Film Festival and the Eureka Film Festival. It is certainly true that this is not on the level of "Sundance", but it is a well-established festival with significant respect in the industry. With regard to IMDb, we feel very lucky to be listed there. I can tell you with 100% certainty that IMDb is absolutely curated and it is difficult for indie documentaries to get on the site. We certainly felt that was an achievement.</dd>
<dd>G. In conclusion, we feel documentaries of merit should be listed here at Wikipedia. I would suggest that acceptance in one or more film festivals, broadcast on television and budget size (ours was over $100K) could play a role in determining notability. In the end, it is my hope that Wikipedia will err on the side of being overly inclusive where documentary film is concerned, especially where issues of such importance are at stake. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to discussing this issue further with you all. Vgate Producer 19:41, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>a) Wikipedia is not a repository of produced films, its not IMDB. As an encyclopedia it would lose any respect if it just turned into a repository of stuff, people looking for a film to watch should not goto an encyclopedia, they should goto IMDB, Blockbuster etc.</dd>
<dd>b} Wikipedia currently does "retain significant information about a very underreported area of art with a high level of social importance", it has an article on documentaries, your own documentary doesn't fit this bill as its too specific and not about an art, but just a specific topic. However further, its not wikipedia job to promote anything including areas of art with little attention.</dd>
<dd>c} As pointed out in point A, which is something I particularly feared was being argued by the other user, Wikipedia is not IMDB. Its not here to promote or expose anything and its not here to be a respository of every film ever made nor book printed etc.</dd>
<dd>d) We have guidelines and proposed ones, you can read that WP:Notability (films), things such as awards would help, screenings, records, etc. This film particularly doesn't meet any of that.</dd>
<dd>e) If you would like to create an article on the phenomenon of voter films then feel free to do that, this article however is not about that and its deletion or non-deletion would not be based on its creation or lack there of. Further per WP:RS and WP:V you would need sources that meet those requirements to discuss those films and the points in the article you attempt to right, remember to follow WP:OR.</dd>
<dd>f) IMDB entries can be added by the readers, its not 100% "curated", there are also thousands of festivals world wide, determining notability by appearing in the non-notable ones does not work, an appearance at Sundance or Cannes would have went further, an award at one of them even further. However lacking even those leaves little left.</dd>
<dd>g) Its already been established by the general concensus on Wikipedia that not all films deserve articles and surely not all documentaries of there being millions or varrying notability and quality. I keep hearing issues of importance, and that is a problem, as every documentary is created by someone thinking the issue is important, its very subjective, hence why criteria is based on notability, not subject.</dd>

<dd>I disagree. First, I hope we can agree that Hollywood Reporter is a reliable, independent source. (If we cannot so agree, there are several other sources including Forbes Magazine that reported this story.) Second, if you read this article, you will see that Diebold, a multinational, extremely powerful, well-established, public company with billions of dollars (US) in revenue, actually was so affected by the material contained in Votergate, that it took it upon itself to invest significant resources in attempting to shut down a film that it THOUGHT was descendent from Votergate. In other words, Diebold believed, albeit mistakenly, that the HBO film WAS a new/revised Votergate. Diebold felt that they had to shut it down because it was so powerful and damaging to them, and they attempted to do so. If this is not an example of notability, I don't know what is. This particular source article relates directly to Diebold's corporate "state of mind" when they sent the cease and desist letter to HBO, and effectively demonstrates how powerful Votergate continues to be since its release 2 years ago. The Votergate revelations spoke truth-to-power and caused questioning of Diebold's shoddy and insecure system design by activists, legislators and election officials around the country, which in turn resulted in millions of dollars in lost Diebold contracts. Diebold could not afford another Votergate. Diebold could not let another Votergate see the light of day, and, believing that another Votergate was coming out, Diebold attempted to squash it with its full corporate armamentarium. You demand evidence of notability? This article has it in spades. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeat_miser_7ab4.html" title="User:Heat miser">Heat miser</a> 05:38, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Wrong. Notability is only a <i>speedy</i> deletion criteria for those classes of articles. That doesn't mean that it doesn't apply whatsoever to schools. I see no reason to hold schools to a lower standard than companies or individual people. If a school is historically important or otherwise noteworthy, of course include it. If it's been the subject of published studies, sure. If it's had famous alumni... eh, that's kind of borderline, but I'd let it pass. But an article that says nothing more than that it exists? "It's real" is not accepted as an argument for keeping any other class of article, and if that's all it takes to pass <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>, then WP:SCHOOLS is flawed. Furthermore, burden of proof is on those making the claims of notability; however, I did perform some research before tagging it, and I find your assumption that I did not bordering on a <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attack</a>.

<ul>
<li>False. The speedy deletion criterion is, as clearly stated (I did link directly to the criterion for you to read it.), lack of <i>an assertion of</i> notability. That is what your nomination rationale is. Your rationale is <i>not</i> that the school is non-notable. It is, to quote words 3 to 6 of your rationale, that the article contains "no assertion of notability". Once again: That is not a deletion criterion for any but certain, specific, classes of article, which do not include schools.
<p><i>I did perform some research before tagging it</i> — You make no mention of this in your rationale. <i>All</i> that your rationale tells us is that you don't like the article, you tried to have it deleted twice, and when those attempts failed you tried a third time. Indeed, you have <i>still not told us</i> what research you did, even though you claim to have actually done as I suggested.</p>
<p><i>I find your assumption that I did not bordering on a <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attack</a>.</i> — The assumption is derived from what you wrote. The fault is your own; you cannot pass it to others, under the pretense that a suggestion that you do the research is some kind of personal attack (which it clearly isn't) or otherwise. If you don't like people inferring from what you wrote that you did no research, then write down what research you did. It is noticable that you still haven't told us what research you did, even though you vehemently assert that you did some. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:51, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>That is not what my nomination rationale is. Read my entire nomination rather than just the first sentence. It's the first two words of the third sentence: "Not notable." (Ignoring the typo I made earlier, at least.) As to your other points, you should assume that I have done research, rather than that I haven't -- part of assuming good faith, is it not? Since you'd like to know, I performed a variety of searches of both web space and news/article archives (not limited to, but including, Google) and turned up nothing significant. And you are still saying nothing about the article and much about what you assume I have or have not done. This is ad hominem argument.

<li>I would say not. It does not meet criteria 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7, as it stands. There is a suggestion that it meets 5 ("Significant awards or commendations have been bestowed upon the school or its staff."), but no evidence that the award is in fact significant -- and even if it is, it is <i>an award</i>, not <i>awards</i> as the criteria suggests, so it doesn't meet 5 in my mind either way. Nevertheless, supporters of WP:SCHOOLS seem to believe that it does meet those criteria (and did before the award was added), though again, no evidence has been offered. I don't think this is the right place to propose a standard, but I would certainly offer that schools should be judged by criteria similar to those of other articles -- companies, individuals, government entities. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 00:30, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, but it is way broader (easier achievable), and that's probably one reason why it hasn't reached consensus. I personally dislike the 50 year criterium (most schools in Belgium and probably throughout Europe would qualify by this standard), the notability by association (which I dislike in many occasions: if some band barely passes <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, then automatically all other bands where one of the memebrs participated in becomes notable, and all the schools of all the members of the band as well, even if there is no relation at all between the school and the minor success of the band. I think the sport criterium is too broad as well, but that one can be tweaked, and has at least (in contrast to the notable alumni one) a direct connection to the importance of the school (certainly with team sports). Alansohn, you asked for the alternatives for <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> here as well (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Maryville_High_School_d9df.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Maryville High School">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Maryville High School</a>), let's not have that discussion on every school AfD again please. There are enough policies applicable by which we can judge if a school is verifiably notable beyond the trivial directory level, and many schools are not. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 08:11, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think that the notability of schools in the six counties of Northern Ireland is a little different than elsewhere, inasmuch as education at primary and secondary level in NI has historically been provided on a sectarian basis. That being so, I would welcome articles on all schools in NI, with the proviso that such articles should aim to include approximate breakdowns of religious background on a percentage basis among pupils, teaching staff, support staff and and catchment area.

<li>On the contrary, the "stuck record" is the tedious continuation of nominations for deletion of secondary school articles which are almost certainly going to be kept, thus wasting all our time.

<ul>
<li>Well, the "endless previous arguments" have not established that all secondary schools are notable, they have shown that there is currently absolutely no consensus to either keep or delete them, and that most closing admins prefer to look at the raw numbers and not at the policy arguments used (and I know that <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is not policy and will probably in its current form never be a guideline either). The AfD's are not wasting our time, they are a continuing effort to reach a consensus, and highlight the problems many users have with many or even most current school articles: they lack all noteworthy content, and often are uncapable of adding such since no verifiable noteworthy content beyond the directory level is available. This is a serious problem which gets largely ignored by all those wanting to keep all school articles, as exemplified by your and most other "keep" suggestions. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 12:13, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In actual fact, many AfDs are closed as no consensus tending to keep and are therefore kept. The fact that the deletionists cannot accept that is the problem. I frankly find it fascinating (and very telling) that they seem to think that, despite obviously being in a minority, their opinions count for more than those of us who want to keep the articles (i.e. they are somehow "obviously right" and we are "obviously wrong"). The argument that I and many other "keep" voters put forward is that secondary schools are major factors in the lives of a large percentage of people on this planet, ergo they are notable. This doesn't need to be repeated every time, since it holds for <i>every</i> secondary school. Neither does it mean that we should keep articles on every house, fire station, telephone box, etc (as some have helpfully suggested we "must" mean), since although people may be intimately acquainted with these things, they are not individually central to the lives of hundreds of people every year. Your argument that many schools "often are uncapable of adding such since no verifiable noteworthy content beyond the directory level is available" is, to be honest, a little ridiculous. How many schools have absolutely nothing written about them? Verifiable information does not have to be provided via Google (as so many seem to believe - it really is a lame argument that lack of Google hits = no notability, yet still it's endlessly trotted out) or even via the internet. Verifiable information can come from <i>any</i> published source. The fact that some of these school articles do not include such references <i>at the moment</i> does not mean that they cannot or that someone will not add them in the future; this is an illogical argument. If the school exists then it is entitled to an article and being a stub has never been a criterion for deletion. The fact that many of us believe that secondary schools are notable because they are secondary schools and that we have said why numerous times is why I am getting rather tired of continually repeating the same arguments. Because let's face it, the deletionists are repeating the same arguments (not notable, not verifiable), with which we have already said we disagree. The fact we are not likely to reach consensus because of this fundamental disagreement is why I feel it becomes a waste of time to propose these articles for deletion. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 14:48, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

The problem to me seems to be that many people don't argue about a specific article, but "vote" according to their fixed positions on any school debate. But even so, it is clear that even for secondary schools, there is no clear majority and minority in recent debates. And again, it is up to those wanting to keep an article to provide sources: only the opinion that there must be sources is not enough (and they have to be non-trivial, otherwise you can keep all companies by the same standard, as every local company gets an article in the local newspaper once in a while). Being a stub is not a criterion for deletion, but I have that strawman from keepers quite a few times (yes, it's not only the deleters than can get repetitive, you know). Being an article about a subject for which there is no verifiable info beyond the trivial, the directory level is a perfect reason for deletion, and it is up to those wanting to keep it to provide sources to the contrary. Rememeber, there is nothing prohibiting a recreation of an article once such info appears. But to keep articles solely on the unsupported opinion that such info must exist is not a valid argument. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 16:06, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>A couple of secondary school articles appear on AfD every day. The vast majority are kept. That suggests you're in a minority to me. But the simple fact is that we're not going to agree and no amount of accusing the other side of producing strawmen and trotting out different interpretations of the same policy is going to change that. Hence the pointlessness of debating secondary school articles. I am by no means an inclusionist. There is much rubbish here that needs deleting. But in the case of secondary schools I can see a clear case for keeping all of them (and as far as I'm concerned, if the existence of a school is verifiable, which it almost always is, then a stub saying that it exists is perfectly acceptable) and I'm afraid you will not change my mind by endlessly producing the same arguments, any more than I'm sure I will change yours. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 17:03, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Many of these articles have a majority of individuals favoring deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>The argument that I and many other "keep" voters put forward is that secondary schools are major factors in the lives of a large percentage of people on this planet, ergo they are notable.</i> Why? Companies and organizations are major factors in the lives of a large percentage of people on this planet (all but the unemployed), yet we do not automatically keep them. Religion is a major factor in the lives of a large percentage of people on this planet, yet we do not keep every church, mosque, synagogue, or shrine. Nearly every person in the developed world is born in a hospital, yet we do not have articles on all hospitals. Most people can drive, yet not every DMV office (or its equivalent) warrants an article. What is it that should exclude schools from the guidelines that we apply to these other categories of articles? <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 18:32, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hundreds of people attend almost every secondary school for a large part of the day, five days a week. Most schools have many thousands of former pupils who spent an equal amount of time there. There is no comparison with individual places of worship, hospitals, or DMV (or its equiovalent) offices, and I don't see how you could possibly claim there is without tongue firmly in cheek. As for companies, companies that employ the number of people that attend or have attended the average school are likely to have an article anyway. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 19:52, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Attendance is not sufficient. Many restaurants may serve thousands of people every day -- and those people, at least, are not compelled by law to patronize those restaurants. If the best that can be said of a school is "X people spend time there," that school is neither noteworthy nor encyclopedic, as it is not in any way distinguishable from the school in the next district whose primary defining feature is that X people attend. A school, like a person or company or website, should be exceptional in order to warrant its own article. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 01:13, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Oh come on, how many restaurants serve thousands of people every day and how many people spend seven hours a day in a single restaurant for five days a week, 40 weeks a year, for five to seven years? How many restaurants are the centres of their patrons' lives? How many restaurants influence their patrons for the rest of their lives?

<li>More restaurants than you think, I'd wager. For that matter, more schools than you think serve fewer than "thousands," including this one, which claims 500 pupils. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 05:49, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is hardly "clutching at straws" if you prefer we could replace "school" with "hospital" and certainly there are companies that are of the same size (and thus have people there 8 hours a day) with many employees which fail <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:42, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Don't mix quantity with importance please. It is not because we have to spend many hours at school that we consider it the "centre of our life". And anyway, school as an institution is very important, but individual schools are not, as the difference between them is minimal and most schools have no distinguishing, remarkable, noteworthy elements, which would make them worthy of an article. Having an article about most schools adds nothing to our knowledge of the world, and it doesn't even add something to our knowledge of some particular town beyond the fact that such school exists, which couldn't be said in one line in the article about the town. If all that can be said about such important, life-defining places is (as in most school articles) the name of the current principal, the location, the number of pupils, the number of years, the colours of the uniform, the motto, and the nickname of the sports team, then no one is any the wiser as to how and why lives are defined there. If an article can not explain why it is so important to so many people (in a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> way), and if an article likewise cannot make clear why a particular institution is remarkable amongst the whole class of them, then your general principles about schools are very nice but are of null value for the acceptance of any particular school article. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 06:08, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Indeed. Claims that schools are notable based on the amount of time people spend there and how significant that is alleged to be in their lives are grossly overstated. Sure, it would be ludicrous to remove an actual <i>school</i>, but this is a discussion for removal of an encyclopedia article <i>about</i> a school. A defense of the significance of the school itself here is irrelevant. Look at the featured article on the main page -- <i>that</i> is what a notable school looks like: over a century old, with an unusual and exceptional history of academic excellence, which served as a logistics base during the aftermath of the WTC attacks. It may not seem fair or right, but some schools are simply more notable than others, and the vast majority fall into a class which are, for all practical purposes, interchangeable. It does not diminish the significance of the school itself if we don't have an encyclopedia article about it. Wikipedia is not a directory, and it borders on irrational to say that the article under examination here is anything more than a mere directory entry. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 07:07, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>No company that had the same number of current employees and former employees as the average school has current and former pupils is likely to be unworthy of an article. And in any case, employers do not shape their employees' future lives in the way that schools do.

<li>BT is a corporation interested in maintaining good public relations. So they "recognize" lots of local schools for doing mundane things that local schools do.

This is no indication of notability of any of these schools. Significant recognition of the school (or of BT's award) by independent media--not by corporations--is what is needed to show notability of the school (or of BT's award). (In fact, unless there is independent media coverage of the award, it could be argued that mentioning it in a Wikipedia article is spam for BT.) <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:45, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree that "BT is a corporation interested in maintaining good public relations". Any company that was doing this exercise would have no difficulty in awarding some recognition to every single school in their service area. BT doesn't and has not.

<li><b>Comment</b> -- It seems to me there's been a few times in Wikipedia history where precedent has overridden policy, and not only is this one of them, it's probably one of the most significant. And that was before an extensive discussion on the subject, which IIRC largely came out to the current status quo. The nomination was at best naive in the first place, and might be <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, depending on the nominator's history on AfD. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 20:54, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

Why was this nomination naive and/or a case of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>?

(Oh, and when has precedent overridden policy on AfD's?) Seeing that there are quite a few people agreeing with the nominator, I don't think it is a fair tactic to attack the nomination instead of trying to defend the article, perhaps (just a policy suggestion) by looking for some actual <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources for it, which is something most "keep"ers are suspiciously unwilling or unable to do... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 21:06, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, what is clear is that a) most such nominations end in a no consensus, and b) there's a significant enough number of people who believe that secondary schools are inherently notable that there really isn't any point in nominating them to begin with. I do agree that they're schoolcruft, but that's arguing against a well-established precedent. At this point, all that can be said is that the arguments against have been gone over and largely rejected -- there's no point in bringing it up again. (That's why I say the nominator is likely naive -- the discussion was long enough ago (a year or so, IIRC) that we could have quite experienced editors who weren't around for it.) So basically what I'm arguing is that, agree or disagree, high schools do seem to meet the minimum threshhold of notability as defined by the community. It is still a contentious issue, clearly, but arguing strictly from a "common law" standpoint it's a waste of time even nominating a high school. Incidentally, another case of precedent overriding policy is in radio station articles -- despite written criteria to the contrary, it is pretty much consensus at this point that any duly licensed radio station is inherently notable. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 01:23, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Articles need more than one day to develop. They need months or years. The existing reference proves the school's existence, hence this deletion nomination is largely misplaced. Deletion should be the last resort when verifiability can not be established. The ideal should be to build a comprehesive source that provides total coverage of all subjects.

I don't see much of a conflict here. (There's the argument that articles with third-party neutral sources get more coverage on WP, but that has to do with the third-parties themselves, not WP.)

<li><b>Comment</b> Verifiability, - one can easily verify the existence of say, RussArt.com just ordereing DVDs online and get them in the mailbox. Notability, - creating policy like this, Wikipedia builds a huge "barrier of entry" increasing chances for startups to be not notable even further. An encyclopidia, by definition, is supposed to reflect the reality and not restrict it creating its own one. If an entity exists, - it is supposed to be noted and catalogolized. --<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakhteiarov_a69a.html" title="User:Bakhteiarov">Bakhteiarov</a> 21:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Verifiability isn't just about verifying the existence of something - even though in this case "ordering a DVD from the store" would be considered <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> - it's to verify everything that's written about it. If a third-party source hasn't written anything about it, the only things that can be verified are directory-entry style information, and Wikipedia is not a directory of anything. Frankly, barrier to entry problems are not really a concern of Wikipedia, which is an encyclopedia.

<li>Question: I note that the Technical Video Rental article was recently deleted. I looked at comparable firm <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameZnFlix_8083.html" title="GameZnFlix">GameZnFlix</a> and note that TVR (now SmartFlix) has the same revenue, a similar employee count, higher customer count, and has had press mention from <a href="../../../m/a/k/Make_%28magazine%29.html" title="Make (magazine)">Make magazine</a>, Home Shop Machinist magazine, etc. I think that perhaps the TVR / SmartFlix article should be reconstituted, with this information. I note that according to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, such an article would be justified under justification #1 there...but instead of just blindly reconstituting the article, I wanted to run it past some folks who seem to be active editors in the area. So: thoughts? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETjic_e1bf.html" title="User:Tjic">Tjic</a> (<a href="../../../t/j/i/User_talk%7ETjic_fcb5.html" title="User talk:Tjic">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tjic_86d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tjic">contribs</a>) 17:43, 30 October 2006 (UTC).</small>

<li>This isn't really the place to discuss this matter, but the standard for companies is given in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. If you believe that TVR satisfies <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, and have sources to prove it, then create the article, be sure to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> (hint: TVR's website doesn't count), and be prepared for ruthless editing. But basically, if Technical Video Rental was truly notable, then you wouldn't have to create the article; others (who don't work for the company in question) would do it for you.

<li><b>Keep</b>. No case whatsoever for deletion and never should have been listed.. Take the issues to the talk page. Many editors have strived to keep NPOV on this controversial topic. Keeping POV in quotations and citing sources is a good way forward, and to keep talking on the Talk pages.

<li><b>Delete</b> - It seems that most of the editors agree that the NPOV is violated in the current article on the NKT. I assume that’s why editors write things like “neutrality is a matter of cleanup”, “the article needs cleaning up”, and “having a repairable POV”. One editor also describes the article as “very hard to read”. So we all agree that the article can not remain as it is. I understand and agree that this is not a valid reason for deleting the article. At least as long as NPOV can be achieved. The reason for deletion is that NPOV cannot be achieved. I think there are two main reasons for this. Firstly, the current editors of the article are biased in the way that they have a rather negative view of the NKT. This is particularly obvious in the case of the user <a href="../../../k/t/6/User%7EKt66_0fe9.html" title="User:Kt66">kt66</a> who is very open about his attitude towards and emotional involvement in the NKT on his user page, on his home page, on various internet forums, and in interviews. Even if I assume good faith I firmly believe that it is impossible for these editors not to introduce their biased opinions into the article. I can’t even blame them for it. Let’s take a drastic example. If you ask a group of Jews and a group of Nazis to each write an article about Adolf Hitler you would get two very very different articles even if they used the same sources. It is absolutely impossible to avoid that. None of the two articles would qualify for NPOV. Solution? Let them write the article together. Over the past 16 months various pro-NKT editors tried to improve the NPOV by working together with the anti-NKT editors. Together they have produced about 800 different versions of the article and about 200 A4/letter pages of discussion. And? Here we are, 16 months later. No NPOV yet. The pro-NKT editors came and they left. Only the anti-NKT editors are still hanging in and are in control of the article, frantically trying to improve it. Even if pro-NKT editors started working on the article again, NPOV could not be achieved. The last discussions about the NKT article on the German WP lead to an edit war in which user Kt66 was also involved. The article got blocked from editing. After it was unblocked again Kt66 immediately changed the article around the way he wanted it to be. He even changed things back everyone previously agreed on. All this of course without having discussed his changes on the talk page beforehand. On one hand he invites people to contribute on the other hand he rejects all information coming from the NKT editors as wrong, distorted, decieving, and so forth. At one point the German administrator Peter Jacobi sought advice from Jimmy Wales.</li>
</ul>
<p>Peter Jacobi wrote: &gt; There are even topics so obscure (<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Kadampa_Tradition_6cc9.html" title="New Kadampa Tradition">New Kadampa Tradition</a> comes &gt; to my mind), that only vocal opponents and vocal proponents &gt; contribute. Should they already be considered "interested &gt; parties"? Shall we hope, that they will battle it out so that the &gt; result is NPOV?</p>
<p>Jimmy Wales wrote: “The philosophy that NPOV is achieved by warring parties is one that I have always rejected, and in practice, I think we can easily see that it absolutely does not work.</p>
<p>I would prefer to have no article on <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Kadampa_Tradition_6cc9.html" title="New Kadampa Tradition">New Kadampa Tradition</a> than to have one which is a constant battleground for partisans, taking up huge amounts of times of good editors, legal people, and me.</p>
<p>What is preferred, of course, is that thoughtful, reasonable people who know something about the subject interact in a helpful way to seek common ground.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are only opponents and proponents of the NKT who contribute to this article. I think the administrators would be wise to follow Jimmy Wales wisdom and experience and delete this article.</p>
<p>Secondly, it’s impossible to achieve NPOV because there are not sufficient sources available and the few sources that are available are rather negative about the NKT and full of opinions and mistakes. I guess it’s just more fun and a bad habit to look at the faults and not at the good qualities. It also sells better. Many of the sources are quite out of date and hence cannot provide an up do date picture of the NKT. The work of Kay is full of opinions presented as facts. He presents opinions of individuals which are not necessarily the opinion of the majority of NKT members or the NKT itself. The Full Moon Journal was discontinued about 10 years ago, is out of print and circulation. Many of the views expressed in it are not considered official NKT views which was probably the reason why it was discontinued. Some of the British news paper articles were completely over the top. I’ve heard that one of the newspapers later apologized for that. Also user KT66 started producing his own secondary sources by giving interviews and supplying other authors with material (see reference 76). Maybe the NKT should get some of their students to write a thesis about the NKT which can then be used as a veryfiable reputable source on WP.&#160;:-) Unfortunately, that wouldn’t help the NPOV either. I think even some completely neutral editors would find it difficult if not impossible to write a neutral article on the NKT using the sources which are available today. The article also contains wrong information and is very difficult to read. These kind of articles are already destroying the reputation of WP. Last month Larry Sanger, also founder of WP, launched an altenative projekt, the Citizendium Project, with the aim to avoid these kind of problems we experience in this article. I wouldn’t expect to find such an article in a “proper” encyclopedia. So, in conclusion I firmly believe that it is impossible to achieve a NPOV. Any adminstrator who wants to keep this article has to prove me wrong by spending the rest of his live working on this article turning around every single sentence, phrase and word.&#160;:-) I will check the article again in about 10 years time.&#160;:-) For these reason the article should be deleted.

<li>I'd like to add some thoughts which will hopefully make my points clearer. I would love to contribute to this article (which I haven't done yet) but there is a lack of secondary sources that describe the views and opinions of the NKT on many of the subjects mentioned in the article. I can only say "This statement is wrong. It should be like this or that." or "This is not the view of Geshe Kelsang or the NKT. His view is ..." but I only have primary sources for this because secondary sources have not been published yet. The available secondary sources are mainly critical. Some of these sources were a direct response to the demonstrations the NKT followers performed in 1998. I understand that some people were upset by this. I think the reason why all of the pro-NKT editors stopped editing is that they could not support their contributions with secondary sources. What is left is a group of anti-NKT editors who are focussing mainly on one critical thesis and the negative information that was published after the demonstrations. They are searching all the sources for information which they can use to criticise the NKT, which means that even the so called "official NKT sources" (the Full Moon Magazine and many interviews with individuals are not official NKT sources) are not used to balance the article but rather to increase its negative bias. This article is far away from NPOV and more importantly, NPOV cannot be achieved due to the bias of the editors and the lack of secondary sources.

<dd>Response to Marpa - pro NKT have lots of secondary sources - the published works of the NKT themselves! Look at the quote from GKG about respecting others and concentrating on the good qualities - that's in the article currently and reflects very well on NKT and GKG. The fact that most secondary sources are hostile is unfortunate (why is that anyway?) but shouldn't be a bar on using them. 'The New Believers ' is one source which tries hard to be fair to NRMs like the NKT, can we not use more of sources like this?. In my opinion the article is certainly not overly POV ridden, not enough to warrant deletion. Jimmy Wales may not want a battleground of interested parties, but the open nature of WP allows this, until he decides to change it - that's the way it is.</dd>

<p>How about this - what if we put a restriction on the size of the article, so that it is not overly full of complicated criticisms or theology? Put it this way, even if this article is deleted, what's to stop me or anyone else starting another? Should we also have no Scientology article? No SGI article? No Roman Catholic article? Surely we know the answer to that. I also would add that the criticism that the article's 'consuming time and energy' is not any sort of argument - editors can choose to contribute or not as the case may be. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagic_Pickle_06a3.html" title="User:Magic Pickle">Magic Pickle</a> 19:30, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article is consuming the time and energy of many Wikipedia editors and administrator. Since the article has been nominated for deletion it has undergone another (undiscussed) dozens of changes from the main editor. It does not make sense to work for an agreement in the discussion section, knowing that some editors will change the article anyway according to their views when guest editors left the article. Why are there still so many changes each week? Why is the main editor changing his own statements so many times? Because the article is of good quality? Surely not! The fact that there are many sources for this article does not prove that the article is fair and unbiased. If you have a particular presupposition it's not that difficult to find supporting sources: take a look at <a href="../../../e/v/o/Talk%7EEvolution_8c56.html" title="Talk:Evolution">Talk:Evolution</a> for an excellent example. --<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReal_Friends_f566.html" title="User:Real Friends">Real Friends</a> 13:39, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I feel that there is a clear conflict of interest here which underpins the NPOV problem - this is easy to establish from a mere cursory reading of kt66's user page (the main editor of this article) in which he sets out quite clearly his agenda and close emotional and personal involvement with the subject matter. I regard the editorial input from kt66 as propaganda and a clear infringement of the What Wikipedia is not guidelines. Many editors have given up on this article in the face of the incessant barrage of negativity focussed on it by kt66 - perhaps blighted by its poisonous effects. What I consider the undue weight given to the views of David Kay, which is part of what I would argue constitutes a breach of NPOV, is I feel evidence of the partisan approach taken by the main editor of this article. I don't think there is any hope of achieving NPOV if a month of waiting produces no constructive discussion regarding the problems on the talk page and kt66 adds more and more, taking the article further and further away from neutral point of view. This article is not what I would expect to find in an encyclopedia as it is clearly being used as a soapbox for the main editors views, and the sources used are outdated and obscure. I would also stress the fact that this article has been a battleground for far too long, taking up the valuable time of editors that could (in my humble opinion) be far better spent. Last resort it maybe - necessary I believe it is. <a href="../../../e/x/c/User%7EExcellentone_aeca.html" title="User:Excellentone">Excellentone</a> 23:05, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: What makes you or other NKT editors free of "a clear conflict of interest here which underpins the NPOV problem"? Nobody knows who you are, maybe you are James Belither...How can I recognize that you not "set out quite clearly your agenda and close emotional and personal involvement with the subject matter"? User:Billion recognized a constructive environment at the talk page and encouraged us to go on with discussion, but no NKT editor used that or picked up his or my suggestions how to go on. I agreed to a mediation although I have no conflict with you whereas you rejected mediation without even to try at the talk page to find a solution. All my trials to invite you to contribute you didn't pick up at all. So what can be done if you block? I can only interprete your way of solution as that you feel hopeless, but this is no reason for deletion - maybe it shows an emotional involvement? - I am half joking. I do not agree to your and user:Marpa's constant trials to assume I would have an emotional involvement, rather I would say I have some knowledge and this can be used. Although I have a clear opinion on the subject matter, I feel able to balance it and I feel able to look from different angles on the subject matter. If I fail in this you are most welcome to correct me. Maybe we start fair communication?

<li><b>Comment</b> As a layperson, I must say this article is extremely difficult to understand. The text seems to assume significant prior understanding of Buddhism, and the distinctions this article makes between various customs and practices within this tradition vs. others are beyond my understanding to call. While deletion may be an extreme approach to take regarding the NPOV concerns, a sort of "nuclear option," I feel at least the substance of this article may benefit from being broken up into more coherently organized mini-articles, as opposed to one article that tries to address a plethora of interesting particular items that however, to me, don't add up to a clear picture of what NKT is. As far as the POV concern goes, I feel that Marpa and others have presented a compelling case, but the structure of Wikipedia is organized as to favor constant revision through constant discussion, and POV issues within referenced material are normally countered by providing context through other referenced material. David Kay may be biased, but I think the article has begun to do an adequate job of isolating "his comments" as "his comments," as opposed to a presenting him as a non-partisan source. Deletion would give editors the opportunity to begin this article again, but I don't see how you could keep Kay out as a reference or prevent editors with attitudes hostile to NKT from editing any associated articles. There are avowed white supremacists and religious fundamentalists as well as cynics of all sorts with self-identifying userboxes editing articles on WP, NPOV is something we can strive for but obviously not something that can be easily achieved.</li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, why not try the nuclear option as an experiment to see how this article reconstructs itself? Perhaps deleting contentious articles every now and then instead of keeping the same old ones would freshen things up. There certainly are a lot as deserving of the treatment.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/m/e/User_talk%7EAmerique_4d7b.html" title="User talk:Amerique"><font color="DarkRed">dialectics</font></a></small></sup> 02:00, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

If the problem is a possibly undue weight to the views and opinions of one author, David Kay, it can be balanced. As said above Kay is the only one who did extended research on NKT, so he can not be neglected either. Until now nobody picked up the suggestion to use Bluck as a source to balance it or suggested any other source. It seems to me NKT members just prefer to have no article at all and are blocking a solution, but this is no reason to delete it. If you look at the talk page less efforts from the article critics were made to suggest or pick up a constructive solution to improve the article, but this is also no reason to delete it. The suggestions of user:Excellentone, user:Billion at the talk page were put into practice by myself, so nobody can say I blocked the development of the article but can ask oneself why he/she has not contributed. However I prefer a solution by mediation to go on in improving the article instead of deleting it.

<li><b>Comment</b>; that's incorrect. A Google search turned up at least two (apparently) independent sources of information- one dating back to 2000, so it certainly can't be from Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep or merge.</b> Enough examples are present (Marvel Comics, Sherlock Holmes, Doctor Who), and I think having 20 000 Google hits proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the concept is known by more than a small group of people and not original to the article. Sources have also been added since the nomination. Fanwanks definitely need to be discussed if Wikipedia is to thoroughly describe the phenomenon of fanfic. The current article isn't perfect, but a wiki article doesn't have to be perfect right away. There's definitely good solid material there, and it would be a shameful waste to throw it all away. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonMerlin_5f2b.html" title="User:NeonMerlin"><span style="background-color:#000000;color:#00ff00;text-decoration:underline overline"><span style="color:#ff0000">Neon</span></span></a><a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeonMerlin_f87e.html" title="User talk:NeonMerlin"><span style="background-color:#00ff00;color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline overline"><span style="color:#000000">Merlin</span></span></a> 01:59, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep.</b> Asssuming that, as stated above, it's a real term, which it appears to be. Article has had a couple of references added.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - I'm not ever a big fan of giving entries to individual songs (except under special circumstances) but since it is accepted practice, I see no reason why this song should get axed when several other MCR songs already have their own articles (and not just the popular ones). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 17:10, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

It is just an average song on an average album, there is nothing that distinguishes above any other song on any other album, it has not even been released as a single.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Under that reasoning nearly all band articles I've seen on Wiki would be deleted - this page is perfectly fine and follows the rules - this band are notable and are not obscure. This page simply needs some work and encouragement - not just to be deleted. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7ESharonlees_893d.html" title="User:Sharonlees">Sharonlees</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7ESharonlees_db98.html" title="User talk:Sharonlees">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sharonlees_bea6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sharonlees">contribs</a>) 13:17, 30 October 2006.</small>

<li><b>Comment:</b> As an editor who has never heard of the band before, I made this nom in good faith. If "nearly all band articles" would be deleted under this logic, then it a reflection on the quality of the articles, not on the validity of the nomination. The page is not "perfectly fine" and does not "follow the rules" as you claim; notability needs to be proven to the satisfaction of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, which this clearly doesn't. I'm not trying to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, but AfD was designed to run for five days precisely to give people time to "work and encourage" articles along if there were problems that could be fixed without resorting to deletion. <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid">©</a></sup></font><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange"><sup>Please rate me at Editor Review!</sup></font></a></b> 11:39, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is also the case that there is more than one tool in <a href="../../../p/a/g/Template%7EPage_fixing_tools_9088.html" title="Template:Page fixing tools">the toolbox</a>. Your rationale for deletion is not that the article doesn't show that the WP:MUSIC criteria are satisfied, but that the parts of the article that <i>do</i> show that the WP:MUSIC criteria are satisfied (the history and discography) are unsourced. The tag for that is {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}}, not {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd1_cc96.html" title="Template:Afd1">afd1</a>}}.

<li>Fair enough, but the burden of proof lies on the editor making the claim, not on the one seeking to remove it. Anyone can write an article and insert questionable claims, the fact is still, there is no evidence to suggest that any of these claims is in fact true. A Google search backs me up on this (unless I've seriously misread the results). If the evidence exists, it should be a trivial matter of finding it and quoting it in the article. <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid">©</a></sup></font><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange"><sup>Please rate me at Editor Review!</sup></font></a></b> 14:49, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> I'm not making a personal attack by disagreeing - its just me exerting my freedom of speech and the right to a different opinion. I just think its a valid point that deletion should always be a last option and that this article has not for example broken copyright laws, and is not full of slanderous or blantantly untrue comments. And yes it is sad that the quality of articles on less well known bands tend to be fairly poor.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Please elaborate on how/why this does meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. I'm not sure it does. The Allmusic link helps establish that it's not satire, but the band does not appear to have been on a national tour (as documented in notable and verifiable sources) or have released an album on one of the more important indie labels. If kept, the article needs to establish notability and cite sources throughout.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Not being a huge fan this is hard - but they have done a nation wide tour (I believe) - it is documented - somwhat unconventionally on their site. They also have major releases they can easily be found on amazon etc and are called R Borlax and The Mechanical Hand.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Awesome band. They're so funny and cool. Their keyboard player looks AND TALKS just like Napoleon Dynamite! The only hardcore band I like.

<li><b>Weak Keep or Userfy for Now</b> My google search and brief research show that this fellow's achievements, etc., are verifiable and genuinely notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> Sorry there hasn't been a great deal of improvement in the page since it's inception. I didn't create it, I'm only trying to edit it to be the best it can be, but my knowledge of Wikipedia is limited and I can only have a go at it in my spare time when I'm not editing the paper. I would have done more with it this week but unfortunately I'm in the middle of an issue. At the end of this week I'll sit down, read the Wiki help file and add more content (history, links, more images, etc). Is there anything specific you feel I need to do with the page? ----michaeljeffbrown 12:03, 1 November 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: This is a weird one for CSD A7. A7 is more for people, groups, bands, etc. - not for a possibly invented occupation. Even blatant hoaxes aren't speedy material (there's a specific note to that effect at the bottom of <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>) although I'll delete more obvious ones like "John Smith is the greatest person in the world" under a combination of removing all hoax material and then deleting the resulting empty article as CSD A1. But I digress - if another admin wants to overrule and speedy this one, I wouldn't object. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 16:12, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, that example is a canonical "short article with no context". It provides no clue at all as to <i>which</i> John Smith it is about.
<p>For <i>this</i> article, the question is whether there is a recognized sub-field of psychology that concentrates specifically upon Internet. That's not a decision that can be reliably made by just one pair of eyes. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:55, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Right. I mean, in general, even if an article starts with "John Smith is the greatest person in the world" and expounds on 100 different ways he is the greatest person in the world, there is a clear assertion of notability. But, it's so obviously a childish hoax that every sentence can be removed which would leave nothing. Rather than CSD A7, I use CSD A3 for cases as silly as those. &#160;:) But yes, I'm not nearly as confident about the removability of anything in this article. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 17:10, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is John Cooney, Senior Developer of Armor Games and owner of jmtb02 Studios. It has been brought to my attention that this page may be deleted. I am not a normal wikipedia user, but I can confirm that from checking over this information recently, that all this information is factual and correct. The Ball Revamped series has had several awards and honors, and has been played nearly 20 million times. It will also be going into X-Box Development in a short while. While I am not quite sure why this article is flagged, it must be flagged for a reason that can be fixed to save this page. I use this page constantly for referring people to what my series is, and I think many have used this as a reference as well. -John Cooney, <a href="http://www.jmtb02.com" class="external text" title="http://www.jmtb02.com" rel="nofollow">jmtb02.com</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. While I might agree that the game is fairly notable, the article is entirely unencyclopedic and reads like an ad for the game - no wonder considering the creator of "Ball Revamped" has made several edits to it. If there is going to be an article on it, it should be no longer than 2-3 paragraphs. Also, this deletion-nomination has descended into complete chaos.

<li>I agree this thread is out of hand, and I would like the request that if anyone has an argument that they be reasonable and to keep with the organization rules specified by Wikipedia. As I have mentioned before, if anyone has any thing they want to do to make it appropriate, please do so. If it is too much like an ad, feel free to change aspects you find incorrect or biased. But I have trouble distinguishing the differences between this article and articles such as <a href="../../../h/e/l/Heli_Attack_b89b.html" title="Heli Attack">Heli_Attack</a>, which has four articles surrounding it, or any given video game such as <a href="../../../g/e/a/Gears_of_war.html" title="Gears of war">Gears_of_war</a>. Any time you list any feature of a game, its going to sound like an ad. <a href="../../../j/m/t/User%7EJmtb02_7d6a.html" title="User:Jmtb02">Jmtb02</a> 09:51, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Actually, <a href="../../../h/e/l/Heli_Attack_b89b.html" title="Heli Attack">Heli Attack</a> doesn't seem particularly notable--I've flagged it for proposed deletion. The problem is that it's very difficult for editors to find all of these little articles, much less fact-check them and review them for vandalism. The reason commercial games like <a href="../../../g/e/a/Gears_of_War_aeea.html" title="Gears of War">Gears of War</a> tend to warrant entries is that they usually have widespread cultural exposure. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 22:50, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>hi, this is Daperson here. this entry should not be removed because it is about a very wlel known game, admittedly the entry would be better if it was a larger one for jmtb02 and all of his games, but its definatly notable content matter, john cooney the author has been used by adobe as an example of a youngster using flash (ok so im a 13 year old flash designer, your point?), and why shouldnt there be an article about it? its not exactly doing much harm sat there on the site, and if only the members of jmtb02.com forums used it it would be quite sufficently large amount of usage. to quote the message above 'not a particularly noteable flash game', excuse me whoever wrote that, have you been on ANY flash gaming websites recently? just about all of them have a version of ball revamped or another of john's games on them,,here is a list (thwese were got in about 5 mintues from googling Ball Ravamped. www.ebaumsworld.com www.albinoblacksheep.com www.addictinggames.com www.smashingames.com www.gamesloth.com www.flashstuf.com www.channel4.com/entertainment/games www.rubytooth.com gprime.net www.ugotgames.com www.onemorelevel.com www.milkandcookies.com www.newgrounds.com there is even www.ball-revamped.com which wasnt made by the author of Br i dont believe on newgrounds the average score of the ball revamped series is 3.942/5, and has won the following awards: Daily Fifth: 1 Daily Fourth: 2 Daily Third: 1 Daily Second: 1 Daily First: 1 Over 10k views: 1 Over 50k views: 2 Over 100k views: 2 (that makes over 300,000 views on newgrounds ONLY, not counting the over websites) Front Page: 2 To my knoweldge the BR games have been played about 21 million times, and you call THAT a not notable flash game? kindly DEFINE noteable flash game will you? not to mention it is also about the author who is quite frankly an amazing guy! he ahs accumulated a huge thriving community of mainly programmers on his forums, and has inspired us all to start making games using flash (im only 13!), thanks to him i had the motivation to start making a multiplayer game, which has since placed me second in the UK IET Flipside Award for Innovation andEcxellence in Engineering and Technology! to remove this article about a person that has achieved so much, and inspired so many to do the same would be criminal at the best of times, this is a bloody encyclopedia, isnt the object of an encyclopedia to have information on practicially EVERYTHING notable, this isnt just a notable flash game, the author and his work is becoming LEGENDARY!</p>
<ul>
<li>I am going to have to disagree on some of your points. A lot of this has to do with jmtb02.com and not Ball Revamped, so probably isn't a very good argument for this case. And Wikipedia, as we have seen already by the flagging, seems to follow strict guidelines for submission. <a href="../../../j/m/t/User%7EJmtb02_7d6a.html" title="User:Jmtb02">Jmtb02</a> 09:51, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>dapers again, i agree, it would definatly be better if it was a whole jmtb02 wiki thing not jsut ball revamped, so maybe we should make a jmtb02 wiki article and lin kto this one? it would save time not to have to remake it all</p>
<ul>
<li>That probably would be a good idea, Daperson - about making Jmtb02 himself a Wikipedia entry. But the matter at hand is the fact that Wikipedia is about to delete this article. Personally, I think there is nothing wrong with it, and it has gotten many non-Newgrounds awards. I mean, just look at the Google results - 391,000 for the exact phrase. Not to mention the countless people who've played it and haven't even said anything. Ball Revamped is notable, and I think this request for deletion should be taken down. <a href="../../../g/a/e/User%7EGaeMFreeK_0db1.html" title="User:GaeMFreeK">GaeMFreeK</a> 03:25, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Once the game goes into Xbox development and gets more widespread circulation, it might have a better case for inclusion, but otherwise I'm inclined to side with the nominator that the game just doesn't have enough exposure to make it notable. Feel free to archive the content in User-space until then. Also, no, Wikipedia is not about the sum total of human knowledge, it's about the sum total of externally verifiable human knowledge of interest to a reasonably significant portion of the population. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 22:50, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Weak Delete</s></b> mostly because it's already in all the external links for the games they support (I added them to those pages it wasn't already listed in when I saw this AfD. It is a valuable site, and does qualify as an external link), and I don't think that there's much need for the content in this article. It's available on their about page anyway. That said, I could be persuaded otherwise, since they have done interviews and ran a convention that apparently got Sid Meier and Brian Reynolds (among others) to attend. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:47, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - it's more of a specialist media outlet than a fan site (it covers more than just a single title and it even has its own podcast/radio braodcast), and that's how it should be treated. I would compare it to the signifiance of college newspapers, which although small in circulation, have articles too. Note to mention that they *are* after all organizing a convention, which is pretty impressive and worth documenting. It has an extensive history of news surrounding the genres it's involved with and there are scores of things worth noting on their, such as the Apolyton University<a href="http://apolyton.net/forums/showthread.php?s=7ea5d6f23a950d041795ad33e0e93760&amp;threadid=83557" class="external autonumber" title="http://apolyton.net/forums/showthread.php?s=7ea5d6f23a950d041795ad33e0e93760&amp;threadid=83557" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, a game-based educational effort. Also used a google search to find more than "answer and ads" per Imoeng - run a google search on "apolyton "PC Gamer"" and you'll get a *very* different set of links which satisfy rule 1 of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<li><b>Conditional keep</b>. I feel that claims of non-notability are incorrect- the site spearheaded direct working with Firaxis over things like the list of enhancements for Civilization III, and there are certainly elements to the site other than "just another forum community." Even based solely on forum communities, I think Apolyton has a non-trivial rank in size, or at least did back in ~2001 or so. I would see this as roughly on the level of, say, the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_Lexicon_28eb.html" title="Harry Potter Lexicon">Harry Potter Lexicon</a> (found via a quick search for "Harry Potter website"), which is a website that apparently has attracted the notice of JK Rowling. You can find several references to Apolyton at places like <a href="http://www.bighugegames.com/news/archive1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bighugegames.com/news/archive1.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. That said, the concern about verifiable sources is valid. It seems that Krupo has done some work in correcting this. If this deficit can be remedied with the addition of some third-party notice of Apolyton, I would vote keep. Disclaimer: While I haven't posted there for two years, I did formerly post on the Apolyton forums. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 04:52, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Typically, I tend to vote against articles on web-forums, however Apolyton is, as far as I know, the main forum with semi-official backing (so much so that sometimes posters who create mods for Civilization have had those mods incorporated into very notable games). Also, given that it's organizing a convention and the fact that it is actually quite a bit more than a forum I feel it meets notability requirements. Perhaps could use a reference separate from the official Sid Meier site, however. However, in the interest of disclosure, I am an occassional player of Civilization IV and have consulted Apolyton in the past, if this is too much of a conflict of interest (which I don't believe it is: I'm in no way affiliated with the site and haven't used it for some time) then just ignore this. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 05:23, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

As well, although the current article doesn't mention it, Apolyton had hosted the List for Civ3 and Civ4, the CTP2 Source Code Project, an exclusive preview for <a href="../../../r/i/s/Rise_of_Nations_56a1.html" title="Rise of Nations">Rise of Nations</a>, as well as others. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill3000_a574.html" title="User:Bill3000">Bill3000</a> 19:16, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I agree that the current article doesn't really show it to be fitting under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, but Apolyton has been mentioned several times on <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a>, has won awards and has had mentions in print magazines as mentioned above (I can't find a reference to those print mentions right now, strangely). Also, Apolyton forums are linked to from the official Civ4 website, and several forum members have made their way to become employees of Firaxis. This, I believe, shows as it as notable per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, though again, it does need a rewrite citing those references. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolver_6882.html" title="User:Solver">Solver</a> 22:01, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. To the best of my knowledge, Apolyton is the largest fansite for all things Meier, as well as having a significant degree of contact (and approval) from Firaxis. This alone qualifies it as being more legitimate than almost any other site. As noted above, it is used as a source for quite a few articles as well.

<li><s><b>Weak Keep</b>.</s> Apolyton is a long standing resource for the gaming community, particularly given the immense popularity of the Civilization franchise.

<p>RockMFR, consider this. I worked on Civ4 (the primary game both CFC and Apolyton focus on) as a scenario designer. I worked on the sequel as well (both sites also focus on this). You want CFC/Apolyton content that is redistributed? Fine. My "Ages of Discovery" scenario was uploaded to both CFC and Apolyton as content of those sites. Now, the scenario 6 months later is spread across the web being redistributed. Also, this CFC and Apolyton content has been published in magazines (most notable July 2006 Strategy Gamer &amp; November 2006 Computer Games Weekly) with other CFC &amp; Apolyton exclusive content. Jon Shafer, Firaxis scenario designer, has released exclusive official content on both CFC &amp; Apolyton (WW1 &amp; South-East Asia scenarios) which are also now spread across the web.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - After reviewing <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ryan_Sugden_7b9e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ryan Sugden">the previous AfD discussion</a> as well as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_October_25&amp;diff=84629667&amp;oldid=84629207" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_October_25&amp;diff=84629667&amp;oldid=84629207" rel="nofollow">DRV</a>, I stand by the original decision. Although Sugden might qualify for notability by the letter of the law as a pro athlete, I personally believe the spirit of the law does not protect every individual that ever started in a pro sporting event. For example, during the baseball strike of the mid 90s, I saw a bunch of unknowns fill roster spots on the Baltimore Orioles and start for a few months. However, I can only find a couple of them (those that remained in the Majors after the strike) on Wikipedia. If anybody can convince me that Sugden is in any way different from the multitude of athletes with limited pro experience I'll change my vote. If not, let's put this one to rest for good. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 15:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Its on the edge. This is an odd case in that his time in the Conference is better documented than the part which confers notability, that at the higher level. The article covers his transfer between two Conference sides, but provides no information about his time in the fully professional leagues. I think the thing which bothers me is the high likelihood that this article will never progress beyond its current substub + infobox state due to lack of information. Normally in a situation like this I suggest a merge, but there's nowhere to merge to.

<p>These articles consist of original research and speculation. Apparently someone has a personal theory that recent Marvel films are set in the same continuity. This is unsourced, and in any case an examination of the films will show this is not true. Marvel Movie Universe#Differences actually notes the continuity problems without giving the simple reason for this: vis. they are not actually set in the same universe. Further, the Marvel Movie Universe Timeline article is based around the assumption that these films were set in the year of their release, which is not true. I'd have like to see these fixed if possible, but fundamentally there is no reliable sourcing here, and there is no 'Marvel Movie Universe' in this sense. (A supposed statement by Stan Lee, <i>before most of the films here were made</i> doesn't remotely cut it. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 15:34, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - It's not an issue of whether Yorkshire Hip Hop is a genre or isn't. Just as a single language can be broken into many dialects, a genre of music can differ by region. I happen to believe that this phenomenom is of enough interest to be mentioned in an encyclopedia, even if it doesn't deserve its own article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't see a rush of editors trying to Wikify the article, tidy it up, NPOV it etc. If it were that easy I'd have done it myself, I entered the discussion on this one a few weeks ago. It's not just about genre, there are lots of problems with this article.<a href="../../../e/s/c/User%7EEscaper7_36e2.html" title="User:Escaper7">Escaper7</a> 18:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>False. It <i>is</i> a matter of whether it is a recognized genre. To use your language analogy, per our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy we don't accept new proposals for new dialects of languages, or new ideas about regional differences of languages, but only accept those dialects and regional differences that have already been recognized and documented in the literature on linguistics. The same goes for genres of music. Unless this specific genre has been recognized and documented in the literature on pop music, the idea that it exists and that there is something specific to this region is original research and not permitted here. What you <i>personally believe</i> is irrelevant. <i>What the sources say</i> is what counts. Encyclopaedia articles are based upon sources, not upon the personal beliefs of Wikipedia editors. If you want to make a case for having coverage of this purported phenomenon, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">point to</a> where it has <i>already been documented</i> outside of Wikipedia. Without such sources, you have no counterargument for the charge that this is not a recognized genre of music. Sources win arguments, not your personal beliefs. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:25, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Yorkshire hip hop is NOT recognised in the same way that Crunk, or Gangsta rap are, (as sub-genres); and record shops don't have Yorkshire hip hop categories. If the article is kept it should perhaps be renamed Hip hop in Yorkshire (that's how the article starts now) and there's a long list of "groups and emcees" with no articles about them, or their notability. That's my final comment. It should be deleted unless it can speedily be given a major rewrite. <a href="../../../e/s/c/User%7EEscaper7_36e2.html" title="User:Escaper7">Escaper7</a> 19:58, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's the problem for me: Just because something is on the web, does not make it a legitimate source. Clicking on Cash Cow records reveals this: <i>"Welcome to cashcowrecords.co.uk the <b>virtual</b> home of 'Cash Cow Records' and 'Inertia'..."</i> It's just a website - anyone could have set this up. It hardly looks like a part of Def Jam records or an established music company: it lacks <b>notability</b>. Many of those sites also talk about hip hop nights in Yorkshire - there are hip hop nights happening all over the world. Some of the websites are just a shop window to a selection of MySpace links, and if BBC Leeds is talking about hip hop in Yorkshire, that's not the same as BBC 1Xtra or Westwood. If they are, source it, and let's see why it's a growing scene/style/genre of interest to a national audience. See the long list of red names (30 or so), in the main article. <a href="../../../e/s/c/User%7EEscaper7_36e2.html" title="User:Escaper7">Escaper7</a> 14:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You need to do better research. <b>Cash Cow Records is publishing out-of-date copies of Wikipedia articles (and not complying with the GFDL in doing so, moreover), and is not a source at all.</b> (I actually came across that web site when I was checking this article for copyright violation.) The articles on the musicians that are anywhere near to being good sources have nothing specific to say on the subject of Yorkshire hip-hop, since they are autobiographies of the musicians. The BBC article on Yorkshire Terrierz says <i>nothing at all</i> about Yorkshire hip-hop. The BBC user-submitted gig review is just a review of a specific gig and provides no evidence that there's any such subject as Yorkshire hip-hop. That leaves just the digyorkshire article. That article is in fact about <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip-hop_culture.html" title="Hip-hop culture">hip-hop culture</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_hip-hop.html" title="British hip-hop">British hip-hop</a> in general. The only things that it says about Yorkshire specifically can be summarised by saying that <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_hip-hop.html" title="British hip-hop">British hip-hop</a> can now be found in Yorkshire, too, which is somewhat redundant. You've presented a source which can be used for <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_hip-hop.html" title="British hip-hop">British hip-hop</a>.

Although this party is not as disinterested, obviously, the numbers are plausible given what <i>Dope House</i> did after the group's six-year hiatus.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - if Qur'anic literalism entails believing every word of the Qur'an to be truth, then this is something all Muslims are expected to believe by default- so there isn't much of a reason to have a separate article about it. if, and this is more likely, the article is about taking every statement of the Qur'an literally (i.e. that no parables, allegory etc. exist) then i think some satisfactory sources should be provided confirming that this topic is notable enough to merit its own article. for now though i am not convinced. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 17:21, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question:</b> Don't get me wrong-- I think it's good to have a lot of well-sourced articles about Islamic subjects on Wikipedia so that people can learn and broaden their horizons. <b>But do we really do justice to the Islamic topics by simply <i>mirroring</i> the Christian topics?</b> The two religions are very different and must be understood differently. The problem with this article is that <i>it doesn't actually say anything</i>. It just points to other articles that already exist (the same ones that I referenced in the above entry). In an AfD discussion we can talk about all the aspects of the article, not just the aspects pointed out by the editor who proposed the deletion. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 01:00, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Query:</b> It is well written "after being edited??" To what edits do you refer. I went to the article upon reading your post hoping to see improvements to the article that would change my position on deletion. I don't see any changes, unless you mean the infobox of Quranic articles on the side, but that is really only a list of articles- it doesn't say anything about Quranic literalism. <i><b>The article itself doesn't say anything about Quranic literalism</b></i>, either. It only names people and sects that are associated with the concept of Quranic literalism and links to articles already written about those people and sects. If there were anything at all substantive in the article I would change my position, but this is just a spaceholder for an idea with no actual work behind it. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 19:05, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Respectfully, the references that you have given in this discussion have been about Salafis, Wahabits, etc., and I don't see any that directly deal with Quranic literalism. I see only passing references to Quranic literalism. There is no article here. Even as a stub all I see is a proposal for <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" title="WP:OR">a synthesis of minor published references</a>. If there were one or two references cited that dealt EXACTLY with Quuranic literalism that would be a showing that there is a real plan and proposal for real work on a viable article. As it is there is no showing that anyone could make this into an informative article that is not <b>original research synthesizing minor references</b> in other published material. Show me one book or article <i><b>that an editor actually has his or her hands on</b></i> (not just a listing in Amazon.com) that deals directly with the topic of Quranic literalism.

<dd>That article does not identify its authors. Is an <b>essentially anonymous article that is just a few paragraphs long</b> the only thing available? The article says two things: (1) "Salafis believe in literalism." (2) "The way that Salafis believe causes problems between Muslims". It doesn't even tell us what those problems are, whcih would be interesting. The material isn't that helpful outside of a sermon in Friday prayer service. Pity the authors of that website didn't give their names or cite other references that people could go to for further reading. We have no way to <b>verify</b> that they are a <b>reliable source</b>.

<li><b>Obvious Keep</b> as the Ainu are a real ethnic group, on the island of Hokkaido and need an article as much as any other group, if not more. Also, plagiarism is the wrong objection to make here. It's not applicable to Wikipedia, since Wikipedia isn't especially original or innovative in its text. What you're really trying to talk about is copyright violation, and as the 1911 Encyclopoeadia Brittanica is in the public domain, it is not a violation of copyright to use it. So, you'll have to be more specific in your complaint.

<p><b>Comment</b>. Julia Sinédia-Cazour was black and French, and the article was originally written by an Afro-French writer. It may not be intentional racism or nationalism, but I have seen a repeated pattern whereby those of white English ancestry (i.e. Thomas MacMillan, just the latest) have chosen to attack supercentenarian articles for non-English persons, even when the standards maintained exceeded the British cases. This is true both for WWI vets (we see articles on British WWI vets as young as 105, and nearly every veteran with an article) while WWI vet articles for Americans and French have been attempted to be deleted (and in some cases were) when the individual was aged 107 and over (i.e. older than the British articles). From Edna Parker (113), Lucie Péré-Pucheu (112), Anne Primout (114), Florenc Homan (112), Augusto Oliveiro Moreira (110), etc. there has been a constant wave of 'not notable' attacks, yet looking at the English list, we find persons listed aged 110, 110, 111, 111, etc. and some of them were not even the oldest person in England at the time. I find it hard to believe that one can say a 112-year-old, verified American death is 'not notable' but the death of the second-oldest person in England at 111 is. It's not imagination when 71% of 'oldest British vets' have articles when no other country exceeds 30%. It's not imagination when we have 13 British super-c articles and only 11 for France, when France has more super-cs (87 vs 66) and they have generally been older, on average. Thus, it stands that the only thing 'not notable' is not age, but race, language, and/or nationality.→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 16:18, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In particular, this section:</p>
<p>Marie-Julia Sinédia-Cazour was happy to live, she was a cheerful woman and a devout believer. She lived at home up to the age of 101. - - She said: “Si tu crois en Dieu, tu vives longtemps”, meaning "If in God you trust, you will live for a long time". - - The island was very sad at her death, considered a grandmother by all its inhabitants. - - Julia Sinédia is considered to be the <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jeanne_Calment_41de.html" title="Jeanne Calment">Jeanne Calment</a> of Réunion island.</p>
<p>Which was deleted as POV/biased. Yet a closer look...living at home until 101 is a fact. A quote she said is a fact (and we see quotes on the Jeanne Calment page). Even a statement about her religious beliefs or outlook on life can be taken as facts. Further, for the 'white' articles, we see comments such as "Jeanne Calment was the grandmother of all of us." Some people are so hard on eliminating humanistic perspective that they lose some value. People are connected by identity. The Brits love <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Allingham_bca0.html" title="Henry Allingham">Henry Allingham</a> and though, just 110 years old, he is played up in the media as a symbol of not just the 'Great War' but of heroism, valourism, etc. (notice the medals he displays). The Queen of England is a SYMBOL of pomp, ceremony, circumstance, and history. We, in our Anglo-centric perspective, recognize these symbols as important. Yet when we concern others, we devalue their own symbols. Reunion was an island conquered and colonized by Europeans, and Julia Sinedia was a 'militante' (the meaning in French is 'activist,' not 'terrorist') who advocated for the rights of women and minorities. Hence, her age was only a part of the story. Despite the discrimination faced, Julia Sinedia overcame the odds to work within and fit within the French system. The vast majority of Africa has little or no birth records from the 19th century, yet Reunion, being an island, was a more manageable entity. Thus, Julia symbolizes the assimilation and integration of a subaltern culture into a European empire, one which generally gave the minorities a degree of respect and identity not accorded by several other European empires. Even today, we see that the French overseas departements get to vote as part of France (whereas Puerto Ricans, for example, don't vote for U.S. president). Julia Sinedia, like Henry Allingham, was a symbol and context of her age. To devalue her is to not just devalue the extreme rarity of living to a proven 113 years; it is to devalue the history of Reunion, France, the French empire, Africa, and Africans. For more information, I suggest reading the book 'Empire of Love' by Matt K Matsuda and 'The Wretched of the Earth' by Franz Fanon.→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 16:43, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There is nothing "notable" about being old unless one is the "oldest ever". There is no "feat" involved in being old, it is just existing. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiteUnusual_1e3d.html" title="User:QuiteUnusual">QuiteUnusual</a> 21:30, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>. If it were so easy, why isn't everyone doing it? Aside from the fact of the historical connection these people bring (i.e. this woman was 19 when the Titanic sunk), we can also learn context (i.e. that Reunion kept good records as a French colony, that despite discrimination Julia's birth and marriage were recorded) and these people also serve as heroes (i.e. that you can live a long life despite adversity). I find it the height of hypocrisy that these 'not notable' attacks always seem to come to people of non-English background, yet when some 111-year-old English woman dies, there's a Wikiarticle. Age 113 is two years above that.→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 05:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>UNE SAINT-LOUISIENNE A FÊTÉ SES 112 ANS LUNDI</p>
<p>Joyeux anniversaire, Madame Marie-Julia Sinédia&#160;! Publié dans l'édition du jeudi 15 juillet 2004</p>
<p>Le 12 juillet dernier, Marie-Julia Sinédia a fêté ses 112 ans. Née en 1892, la Saint-Louisienne entame son troisième siècle avec élégance et joie de vivre. La doyenne des Réunionnais est abonnée à “Témoignages”.</p>
<p>CULTURE ET IDENTITÉ</p>
<p>MARIE-JULIA Sinédia est une star malgré elle. Vêtue d’une jolie robe blanche ornée de motifs bleus, impeccablement coiffée d’une capeline blanche finement ourlée de bleu et ornée d’une rose de mousseline couleur crème, elle est l’objet de toutes les attentions. On ne vient que pour elle, on ne parle que d’elle. L’événement est de taille&#160;: ce 12 juillet, elle a fêté ses 112 ans. Un âge vénérable qui fait d’elle à coup sûr la doyenne des Réunionnais et peut-être même la doyenne des Français. Chacun y va de son petit cadeau, de son petit compliment, on veut la voir, la prendre en photo. Elle ne parle presque pas, Marie-Julia Sinédia. Mais elle sourit, un peu intimidée par toute cette agitation autour d’elle... Sans doute retrouve-t-elle un peu de cette gaieté, cette ambiance de fête qu’elle a toujours aimée, cette ambiance où l’on sourit, où l’on se retrouve pour marquer le coup.</p>
<p>Une femme militante Elle, la femme active, la femme militante, la femme-courage de tous les combats, a hérité d’un rare privilège accordé au genre humain&#160;: celui d’une longévité qui lui aura fait traverser trois siècles. Une enfance à la fin du 19ème siècle, qui la voit naître un 12 juillet de l’an de grâce 1892 à Saint-Louis. Il faudra toute la bêtise d’un agent de l’état-civil pour que son nom de Latour soit trafiqué en Cazour, l’imbécile officier d’état-civil estimant que ce nom de Latour étant "réservé" aux blancs, et ne devant pas être accordé à une personne dont la couleur de peau tenait plus du café grillé que du lait... Enfant du 19ème siècle, Marie-Julia Sinédia réalise sa vie de femme dans un vingtième siècle qu’elle traverse de manière active et la voilà à l’automne de sa vie, goûtant à une retraite amplement méritée en entamant son troisième siècle. De son enfance et de sa scolarité à l’école des sœurs de Saint-Louis, dont elle fut une des premières pensionnaires, elle a gardé une éducation sans faille et une rigueur morale qui sont toujours en elle. Le personnel de la maison de retraite de Saint-Louis ne tarit pas d’éloge sur sa personne et sur ses traits de caractère. Jamais un mot plus haut que l’autre. Pas de caprice. "Elle a des valeurs familiales très solides. Elle est pudique, très pieuse, fait preuve de sagesse et de solidarité envers les autres résidents de la maison de retraite", assure Fabienne Mardenalom, cadre-infirmière. Elle a aussi gardé une certaine coquetterie, comme en témoigne sa tenue impeccable et sa capeline qui lui confère une certaine élégance...</p>
<p>Le refus de la misère... Son passage à l’école des sœurs de Saint-Louis lui aura permis d’acquérir à la fois une instruction et une éducation religieuse qu’elle a toujours en elle, ne ratant jamais une messe. C’est toujours avec une grande foi qu’elle refuse toute vérification du pace-maker qui lui a été implanté depuis de nombreuses années déjà. "Elle dit que c’est le bon Dieu qui vérifiera", explique une infirmière de la maison de retraite de Saint-Louis. Dans une brochure consacré aux "Centenaires de l’an 2000" éditée par le GRAHTER (Groupe de recherche sur l’archéologie et l’Histoire de la terre réunionnaise), on apprend que jusqu’à l’âge de 98 ans, elle se rendait encore seule à l’église pour assister à la messe, ne se déplaçant jamais sans son chapelet. Elle, qui a traversé ce vingtième siècle de tous les bouleversements techniques et des progrès technologiques, affirme que "le progrès est bon à condition de bien s’en servir, c’est en se sens que le bon Dieu a donné l’intelligence à l’Homme". Marquée par son éducation religieuse, très pieuse, Marie-Julia Sinédia fut aussi une femme courage et une militante active. Tour à tour femme de ménage chez de gros propriétaires terriens, travaillant dans les champs, couturière et lingère à l’hôpital de Saint-Louis, Marie-Julia Sinédia fut aussi une militante active du Parti communiste réunionnais. Elle a participé à de multiples campagnes électorales auprès de Léon de Lépervanche, Hyppolite Piot, ancien maire de Saint-Louis, tout comme elle a participé également à la vente et à la diffusion de "Témoignages" (elle en est toujours abonnée) qui fut longtemps, en même temps que son livre de messe, sa principale lecture. À sa façon, elle fut plus qu’un témoin engagé de son temps&#160;: elle en fut aussi actrice.</p>
<p>... et de la discrimination Mariée en 1915 à Pierre Sinédia, mère de deux enfants (un garçon et une fille), elle a su allier avec rigueur sa vie de mère, d’épouse, de travailleuse et de militante politique dans les grands combats, notamment pour la départementalisation ou contre la fraude électorale. Cet engagement, c’était aussi sa façon à elle de dire non à la misère, à la discrimination sous toutes ses formes. Aujourd’hui encore, même si ses facultés physiques ont diminué, elle garde encore toute sa mémoire et se tient informée de l’actualité, distillant de temps en temps un petit commentaire sur le temps qui passe ou sur l’évolution des mœurs, sur le manque de respect des valeurs familiales de la part des nouvelles générations... Et si son âge vénérable influe sur son état physique, diminuant notamment son autonomie personnelle depuis deux ans, Marie-Julia Sinédia ne suit aucun traitement particulier... à part des pastilles pour la gorge. Sans doute est-ce là le résultat d’une hygiène de vie irréprochable mais aussi de cet optimisme en la vie qui ne la quitte jamais. "C’est quelqu’un qui a beaucoup donné d’amour dans sa vie et qui positive toujours", affirme une des infirmières qui s’occupent quotidiennement d’elle. Si l’on cherche - vainement - des secrets ou des recettes de longévité, Marie-Julia Sinédia affirme, elle, que le secret tient dans sa foi en Dieu et se voit bien vivre jusqu’à "au moins 115 ans". Et pourquoi pas&#160;? Jusqu’à présent, ça ne lui a pas trop mal réussi... Et si, en pareille occasion, il est coutume de souhaiter bon anniversaire, nous sacrifions bien volontiers à la tradition. Sans oublier, pour toute sa vie, ses engagements, sa générosité, de lui dire un grand merci.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b>. The chances of living to 113 are about 1 in 250 million. Please tell me how that makes someone not notable.

<p>And yet we see reports of lottery winners in the news every day. Even that misses the point, though: a lottery winner hasn't been through the history that someone who lived 113 years has. Further, a lottery is an 'all or nothing' draw, but living to 113 is the cumulative result of luck and right efforts. Also, the story began drawing interest at age 109, so the story ran for four years. Thus, I think for historical reference's sake, it makes sense to keep this. Don't agree? What about the Delany sisters?131.96.70.158 00:19, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

Having an article that describes these two games and only these two games is equal to having an article which describes Star Wars Episode IV, and Star Wars Episode V - and nothing else. It is not logical. The two games are not a duology. The article is extremely factually inaccurate, not least in describing the two games as as a duology, when they are absolutely not, and I can't help but think that some things are there are jokes. For example, "Oddworld: Abe; or, The Destiny of the Mudokons (often referred to as Oddworld: Abe by fans or abbrieviated to OAOTDOTM, OATDOTM, OATDTM, The Mudokons or simply Abe)" - as a fan of Oddworld for nearly 10 years, I can guarantee that there is absolutely nothing even slightly factual about what I just quoted. It's all wrong-wrong-wrong. To be honest, the reasons people have put for keeping the article show a vital misunderstanding of the situation - I hope I've helped." <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMika1h_574f.html" title="User:Mika1h">Mika1h</a> 11:20, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Comparing the article with serious books on the topic doesn't yield the result that you are hoping for. The article claims to be about something that also goes by the name of Christian Kabbalah. Books on such a thing exist. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0691005400</a> has a whole chapter, chapter 2, on the subject of Christian Kabbalah, which mentions people such as Martines de Pasqually. It bears <i>zero</i> relation to <i>anything</i> written in this article. For starters, this article is discussing completely the wrong century. The aforementioned book tells us that Christian Kabbalah has its origins in the 15th century. Both the chapter on non-Jewish Kabbalah in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1580910491</a> and the chapter on Caballism in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0521361915</a> (citing the <i>Encyclopaedia Judaica</i>) tell us that Christian Kabbalah lasted from the 15th century until the end of the 18th century, when it faded out. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:43, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article has nothing to do with Christian Cabala. Christian Cabala is a Renaissance Period attempt to synchretize Jewish Kabbalah, Christian Theology, and Greek-via-Islamic Philosophy. The article is different. The article discusses if the historical Jesus himself is using an early form of Kabbalah during the Roman Period. Christian Cabala and Jesus's Proto-Rabbinic Kabbalah arent the same and are not even related. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldrik_30ef.html" title="User:Haldrik">Haldrik</a> 10:33, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The very first sentence of the article claims that it <i>is</i> about Christian Kabbalah. Please read the very first sentence of the article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:45, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Reread the first sentence. It is about "Jewish Kabbalah" which isnt the same thing as "Christian Kabbalah", and it says the article is only related to Christian Kabbalah "in some part". The article is about Jewish Kabbalah. In editing the article, the reference to Christian Kabbalah should be removed from the opening paragraph. Christian Cabala has few if any references to the historical Jesus. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldrik_30ef.html" title="User:Haldrik">Haldrik</a> 12:08, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The first sentence has now been altered. But that only makes your argument for keeping less tenable, not more. Instead of an article about something that we have some books about, that simply isn't in agreement with the books, we now have an article for which you haven't actually put forward <i>any</i> of these purported "serious books on the topic", and for which <i>no</i> "serious books on the topic" turn up in any searches for such books. I cited some books about Christian Kabbalah. I suggest that if you wish to make an argument that this isn't original research, you do the same for what you claim the subject of this article to be and show that there really are books on this subject. So far, it seems that there are not. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:35, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am an expert of the focal point of this topic (subject of kavim in both systems), but not of english writing or wikipedia styling. Wikieditors know this and always help to correct my editing or english errors. I started many religious wikitopics - participating here is too serious to me. So only rare experts of these both fields, understand importance and rising trend of this interesting, delicate and difficult topic. This is not my personal opinion, but clear fact of long years of research and this topic will become widely known and encyclopedic without my participation. If someone knows this topic better - please contribute, my task was to initiate topic of what others saw as separate particles (a lot of sources and studies published), but I already see as whole mosaic. Maybe some terms will be corrected, but the idea is already clear to many students who know both sides. The problem is that there are rare ones who know BOTH SOURCES GOOD ENOUGH, SYMMETRICALLY. Most of students know good enough only one side of question, or even confuse Jewish Kabbalah with some "general kabbalah" or "hermetic kabbalah"; know subject of Christian Jesus, but don't know Jewish concept of Yeshua or Gnostic logia, Gospels of Thomas and Philip etc., what is much different from general Christianity. There are a lot of near or similar studies on this field, but exact focal point is discussed only last 5-10 years. So citations, materials, references and publications will follow soon. To IMHO decisions about this topic can be made only by experts of Jewish-Torah-Hebrew Kabbalah (at least ashlagian or lurian, but there are more and deeper materials). And experts of (mainly non-christian concept of) Yeshua: at least Gospel of Thomas of Nag Hammadi Library in coptic, greek-koine New Testament or Brit Hadasha in hebrew. Please immerse into material deeper! --<a href="../../../f/i/v/User%7EFivetrees_336a.html" title="User:Fivetrees">fivetrees</a> 11:36, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>So citations, materials, references and publications will follow soon and decisions about this topic can be made ONLY BY EXPERTS OF BOTH FIELDS</i> — Wrong. Citations should be given <i>now</i>. And it doesn't require an expert in the field to ascertain whether you are working from sources or not, and thus whether this is original research or not. If you are working from sources, they will be easy to cite. If you are condensing and summarizing the existing literature in a field, you will easily be able to say, right now, what literature you are condensing and summarising.

<li>A quick look at the two sources listed in the reference section: One clearly violates the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source policy</a>. <i>Yeshua as He is</i> by Jake Ashcroft is a self-published work. Lulu.com is a vanity (self) publisher, as it explicitly states <a href="http://www.lulu.com/about/whatislulu.php" class="external text" title="http://www.lulu.com/about/whatislulu.php" rel="nofollow">here</a> "Lulu's not the publisher - <b>you</b> are." Assuming the other, <i>Keys to the Kingdom</i> by <a href="../../../m/i/g/Migene_Gonzalez-Wippler_00cd.html" title="Migene Gonzalez-Wippler">Migene Gonzalez-Wippler</a>, despite its publication by New Age publisher <a href="../../../l/l/e/Llewellyn_Publications_29f1.html" title="Llewellyn Publications">Llewellyn Publications</a>, is a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, nonetheless the requirement of multiple reliable sources is not met.

<li>You have to be careful with this kind of remark. As soon as you try to decide which publishers are 'real' publishers and which are not you are creating a lens through which you filter reality, usually ending up seeing what you set out to see in the first place. Llewellyn are a long standing publishing house of good repute. It is in the nature of the material that they publish that your problem lies. This kind of material is always going to have a high freak out factor. But saying they are a doubtful publisher because they publish things you don't grok is the first step on the road that leads to book burning. Tell me, would you suspect a publisher who only publishes in one field to be suspect if that field was anything other than religion? Somehow its ok if the major strands of major religions self publish their material but once a member of a minority group does so they are vanity publishing! As the wise Mr. Bob Dylan once wrote, "The times they are a'changin'" The existence of so called vanity publishers like Lulu perform a valuable service in allowing people who have written worthwhile books that wouldn't get picked up by a publishing house because their market is so specialised to publish them themselves. This is not vanity. This is accepting the realities of the market and finding your own solution. We are too accustomed to a world in which media of all kinds have a higher acceptance factor if they come from a 'reputable' source. This is prejudicing knowledge and as long as one does this one is a slave to media barons and publishing houses. I find it ironic that this kind of thing goes on on wikipedia! The whole point of wikipedia is to alleviate that slavery. To open people's eyes to the fact that everyone has knowledge and we can help them share it. As soon as you start to try to prejudice some knowledge over some other you are on the road to oppression.</li>

<li>It seems to me that all parts are beyond repair in that the entire articlesimply expresses the author'sown point of view. What parts do you think can be "repaired?" What does "Yeshua" refer to? Jesus? Do you know of any Kabbalistic work or scholarship on Kabbalah that refers to Jesus in this way? I do not. Do you know of any Christian work that refers to Jesus in this way? I do not. Do you know of any of the scholarship on Kabbalah that says anything about Kabbalah and Jesus? I do not. Do you know of any documentation that supports claims that the Kabbalah, as we know it, existed during Jesus'life time? To my knowledge, all kabbalistic texts appear after the destruction of the Temple (and thus after Jesus) and I do notknow of any reputable scholar who has claimed that Jesus had any influence on the kabbalah. Do you? Your vote suggests that you think this is a real, valid, encyclopedic topic. I really just want to know why you think this. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 17:38, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have some expertise in this subject area. This article has great potential. I have had correspondence with the author when editing other Kabbalah articles and he does know what he is talking about. imho this work is not original research, but the fact that the author's first language is not English is really working against him here. I have spoken to the author at some length regarding this article and I believe it can be brought into line with wikipedia's policy regarding original research. He does have the sources to cite to demonstrate that this is not original research. I will help him to render this article into English more accurately. Please don't rush to vote to delete this article as it is an area of research which has few exponents in English and it is worth taking some effort to help get this article to meet wikipedia's policy.</li>

<p>It is widely known, that teaching of Yeshua was based on Torah and on no other source, as he himself states being fulfillment of the law (Torah) and he recites Torah numerous times.</p>
<p>It's widely known, that Jewish mysticism is based on Torah too and main sources of Jewish Kabbalah (Zoar etc.) are mystical commentaries of nothing except Torah or related sources.</p>
<p>So it's clear, that both Yeshua and Jewish mysticism come from the same root.</p>
<p>Could such obvious correlations altered by something other more important?</p>
<p><b>Are there any doubts about this&#160;?</b></p>
<p>I hear arguments in the voting, that Yeshua's teaching is rooted in some other source except Torah/TANAKH. And that Jewish Kabbalah is based on every source except Torah/TANAKH.</p>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> - for blatant advertising. I waited a bit to see how this one would play out before making a decision, but as much good faith as I normally assume, there is no sticking up for this one. The article's <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobius_52ba.html" title="User:Kobius">prime editor</a> (and incidentally, the forum admin) removed the AfD tag from the page and does not take kindly to other editors touching 'his' page. The whole layout of the article is clearly trying to draw viewers into the forums, perhaps to meet the admitted goal of 500,000 posts. Add these to the issues others have pointed out and there's really no need for further discussion. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 21:16, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think it should stay because just like the gamefaqs article and the ebay one it helps people understand a site more. The Anizone is a large site and I think if someone wants to find out more about it they come to the best internet dictionary in the world and they research on of the largest best sites. The site has a largely amount of fair people considering it has been hacked three times. The admin accidently remoe it thinking it would be delete and he was not the maker of the page but it was I. Also we dont want people to help us reach 500,000 post we can do that on our own we just want people to know about usHyuugaGaara 23:07, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In case anybody requires an explanation how I arrived at this decision, as it is a bit borderline: There seems to be only one reliable source, an article repeated in USA Today and other media. What tipped the balance is firstly the weak reasons in some of the "keep" comments (specifically, those of necronudist, Portillo, and I don't understand Minfo); and secondly, I think we should be extremely cautious in having articles about living children. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 12:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Then at the bottom of his page have a look at the categories he's placed in. When someone comes to Wikipedia and searches for "that kid i saw clips of on TV" or "that kid my mate sent me videos of" and who's name give 35,000 google hits...

The artist is certainly notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">our guidelines</a>, but the article seems to exist for publicity purposes (based on the prime editor's comments on the talk page).

I would appreciate it if someone with a better command of French took a look at the two to make sure we are not stealing material.

<li>NWN: World of Torr accepts donations in violation of the Bioware's EULA and brags about the $2000 its raised since inception on their website. Bioware has consistently pressed legal action against any server that accepts money to play. Some sites have tried to skirt this by taking payment as "donations" but this is covered under their "exploit commercially" clause. They've notably kept off the main Bioware forums possibly to escape censure from the company. I've quoted the EULA on the discussion page for that article.

<li><b>Delete</b> because it's original research; however, the argument that it wasn't referenced in the manga/anime is really irrelevent to the topic at hand -- Ranma was until fairly recently far and away the anime with the strongest fanfiction presence on the web, and the pregnant issue came up a LOT. I have in fact heard of this outside WP, but I would agree it's not noteworthy or anything. People really ought to stop bashing everything little thing simply because they had never heard of it before. The Takahashi quote, I'm seen links to the interview with it before, for what it's worth.

<li><b>Comment</b> Melodia, I'm not basing my delete argument on not having heard it before, because I have heard it before.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I know (as do all other Wikipedians) that there are simply too many lists. That being said, some lists are useful and this happens to be one of them. It provides easy access to a bunch of curses, legends and myths that can usually only be found if one knows what they are looking for. I can understand how some might view it as "subjective and arbitrary", but I'd point out that everyone is free to add to the collection, and the few editors that tend the page seem to be open to these contributions. As a final note, I'll point out that the article celebrated its 3 year birthday at the beginning of October, and this is its first time being nominated for deletion. While longevity does not imply signifigance, I tend to view it as a sign that an article deserves keeping. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 21:40, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Not seeing the encyclopedically notability here. I really don't think this is comparable to Skulls &amp; Bones at Yale in terms of significance, though it is verifiable - Ivy fraternities are quite different from Oxbridge drinking societies. A <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> database does indeed turn up hits. It's almost all brief mentions in gossip columns. There is some more substantial coverage from 1988 including a Washington Post story with the headline "OXFORD STUDENT'S HEROIN DEATH SHAKES BRITISH ARISTOCRACY". The story is goes on about drugs and alcohol excess amongst toffs at Oxford and centers on the great great grandson of <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_von_Bismarck_a556.html" title="Otto von Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a> (the dead girl student of the headline was found in his room): <i>Bismarck himself is described as a rich and elegant young man with a somewhat macabre sense of fun. According to one account in Rupert Murdoch's News of the World, at one Bismarck repast modeled on a Bavarian hunting party, two pigs' heads were strung up above the banquet table, dripping blood all over the food. The same article features a photograph of the gaunt, fair-haired Bismarck dressed as a nun. According to News of the World, "Von Bismarck is a leading member of Oxford's Piers Gaveston society. It was originally an all-gay group and the rules say members have to dress in drag and parade openly in public."</i>. So yes, this is a verifiable out-of-control very small elitist drinking society for toff sons and daughters of notable toffs at Oxford. It's not the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Apostles_364f.html" title="Cambridge Apostles">Cambridge Apostles</a>, and well, it's not the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitt_Club_11b6.html" title="Pitt Club">Pitt Club</a> either, as at least that has an actual club building and has substantially more members than 12. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:17, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If I'm reading that quote right, it implies that the Piers Gaveston Society had Hugh Grant and Tom Parker-Bowles parading in drag in public, if indeed they were members. The WP article suggests that the members engage in , ahem, even less dignified activities, although it lacks cites for the claim. Presumably some of the PGS members were at the bloody boar's head banquet as well? That sounds even above and beyond anything Skull &amp; Bones was ever suspected of, although supposedly they have <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pancho_Villa_e0b8.html" title="Pancho Villa">Pancho Villa</a>'s skull. Perhaps notable for its degeneracy? <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 08:28, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As the originator of this entry, I am of course open to the "Mandy Rice-Davies retort", but I would argue for keeping it on the basis that (1) as <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Fys</a> states, the Society makes pretty regular appearances in the media (2) It has done so in connection with notable people mentioned elsewhere in Wikipedia. (3) Deletion on the grounds that it "minimal media coverage" is both factually incorrect, and a pretty weird criterion for deletion (how many times does, say, Felix Hausdorff get media coverage these days&#160;?) (4) Deletion on the grounds that it's an "elitist" club, as suggested by <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a>, is both factually incorrect and POV. For the record, I am an Oxford graduate but I was not a member of this club (though I was well aware of its reputation).</li>

<p>I don't know what makes a notable encyclopaedia-worthy eating establishment in America, hence no recommendation from me. However, I do query whether a hot dog restaurant whose only claim to notability in the article is that "is a popular restaurant" desrves an article in preference to literally millions of other "popular" restaurnats in the USA, here in UK or the rest of the world. The fact that it was supposedly the inspiration of a "larger hot dog restaurant" in a film doesn't do it for me. The whole article reads like it would be a nice little snippet in "<i>Time Out in Grand Rapids</i>" or some similar directory. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 21:44, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete/Merge</b> - I don't believe the article itself needs to exist since I don't even like to consider the possibility that all eateries in the world will someday have their own wikipedia page (my feelings aside, it doesn't satisfy <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECorp_f6b3.html" title="WP:Corp">requirements for notable businesses</a>). I did like the tidbit (if it can be verified) about the influence in American Pie, and I recomend we merge this info into the relevant trivia section.

<p>I agree that a lot of this article should be omitted (i.e., hours, menu items, etc.), I don't think it should be eliminated.

<p>The result was <b>NO CONSENSUS TO DELETE</b>. This whole AfD is basically a dialog between <a href="../../../l/e/w/User%7ELewisskinner_9d75.html" title="User:Lewisskinner">L.J.Skinner</a> and <a href="../../../e/w/e/User%7EEwen_3dbb.html" title="User:Ewen">Ewen</a>. Discounting comments from single-purpose accounts (there were several), two other users commented, both suggestiong Delete. So that gives us 3-1 in favor of deletion. But 4 commentors is not much of a quorum. It's established in the arguments that the entity <i>exists</i>, and that it's "...of particular interest to people in Sheffield and former students of Sheffield University"; neither of these are very strong arguments. That it's one of the oldest rag mags is another argument, but also one that confers very limited notabily, as rag mags are... just rag mags. HOWEVER... on the other hand, the current article is quite different from (and a lot better than) the state of the article when deletion was proposed. So the discussion is pretty much about a past version of the article, not the current version. The two Delete votes were early, so I'm not sure those commentors would have voted the same on the current version. So I'm going to give it a pass. I'm being generous; Delete would also have been a reasonable close. A relist would perhaps have been appropriate, but I don't want to ask editors to wade through the existing dialog. No Consensus allows it to be put up for AfD again, immediately if desired. If so could commentors please keep their comments succinct. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:32, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I <b>oppose deletion</b> on the grounds that <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twikker.html" title="Twikker">Twikker</a> discusses a magazine with a long and interesting history of particular interest to people in Sheffield and former students of Sheffield University and Sheffield Hallam University. In terms of longevity and number of issues it is easily comparable to <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolver_Comic_%28UK%29_1ffe.html" title="Revolver Comic (UK)">Revolver</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deadline_magazine.html" title="Deadline magazine">Deadline</a>. <a href="../../../e/w/e/User%7EEwen_3dbb.html" title="User:Ewen">Ewen</a> 06:47, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Student publications are usually not included simply because there are too many of them. At <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_College_d44f.html" title="Hamilton College">my college</a> of under 2000 students, I know of at least 20 student newspapers and magazines published during my four year tenure. The only possibility for notability comes from the article's claim that Twikker is the longest lasting example of its genre. However, this statement is not backed up, and as such I can't see any reason for keeping it around. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 22:10, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or merge into Sheffield University. Rag magazines are not generally notable of themselves. Now, if they lead to court cases or something of the sort, fine, but that would be notability for that year's issue, not the title itself. BOBBY's comments above reflect the gulf between American and British culture unfortunately and I doubt if he appreciates the significance of a University's rag week and rag mag, nor the extremely high standards of British student journalism (rag mmags excepted!). Nevertheless, for all that Twikker is a good read, it's not really notable. [My own position by the way, is British, resident of Sheffield, but not a student for 30+ years.] <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 22:31, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why merge into Sheffield University though? It is of much less notability and Steel Press/DARTS or Sheffieldbase, the former has a rudimetry article (basically a long list of bigging itself up) and the latter nothing at all. Does Twikker even deserve a mention?

</li>
<li>I also <b>oppose deletion</b> of the Twikker entry in Wikipedia. Over the years literally hundreds of thousands of these entertaining magazines have been sold across the country, and there is still a thriving market for old editions on Ebay, along with other Sheffield Rag and Twikker-related memorabilia. The fact that it was the very first Rag Mag makes it worthy of note alone. Our fifth-year student from Sheffield shouldn't offer his ignorance of the history of his students' union as a reason to delete this worthwhile entry. And just for the record, there are currently moves afoot to bring Twikker back.<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShortofapicnic_f7d1.html" title="User:Shortofapicnic">Shortofapicnic</a> 19:55, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please, please, lets not revert to insults... I was simply stating that I've never heard of Twikker, ergo, nothing of note. Please do <b>not</b> call me ignorant. I know about Sheffieldbase, Steel Press, DARTS, Film Unit, rafting down the river Don, SUTCo etc, I could name all the Working Committees (I'm in one of them and regularly use three others). I can tell you about the major changes to the Union's constitution last year re: Union Assembly/Committee and I have mates who have been here since 1998 and showed me some of their old copies of DARTS etc. I also know last year's inaurgal "Woman of the year"; an active member of the union. To have a student as active within the union as myself and not know about Twikker, well, how many people can it have affected? Nothing against the article, or the person who wrote it, I just don't see it as notable, it is not referenced, has no citations/sources, is biased and is frankly just a long list of names. <a href="../../../l/e/w/User%7ELewisskinner_9d75.html" title="User:Lewisskinner">L.J.Skinner</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/w/User_talk%7ELewisskinner_8921.html" title="User talk:Lewisskinner">talk to me</a> 01:01, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>'Ignorant' could be read as a simple statement of fact: 'You were ignorant of the existence of Twikker', rather than ignorant in general. Anyway, it is a logical fallacy to leap from 'I have never heard of it' to 'It is nothing of note'. There was a time when I had not heard of Lev Vygotsky's work, but does that mean it is nothing of note?</li>
<li>As for referencing: How does one reference a magazine? For example, see <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deadline_magazine.html" title="Deadline magazine">Deadline magazine</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/j/Mojo_%28magazine%29.html" title="Mojo (magazine)">Mojo (magazine)</a>. You could always have a look through the back issues of DARTS: October 1987 was full of news about the Union's attempt to ban Twikker, for example. The Sheffield City Star would mention it regularly too. You could ask at the Rag Office...
<ul>
<li>OK, fantastic, will you show me the references in the 10/1987 DARTS and in the star. Your current references aren't much use.</li>

<li>No, <i>I</i> have made it into a more comprehensive article because <i>you</i> are trying to have it removed.

<li>twikker was/ has been an integral part of Sheffield/the Sheffield universities' lives for many many years, I don't see how it can be dismissed as pointless.</li>
<li>It also encompasses something of a nostalgia, for the "old modes of speech" in the Sheffield area, coming from the saying "in 't'wikker in Sheffild, wheer 't'watter runs oer't weir" * translation:- "in the Wicker, (a street in Sheffield) in Sheffield where the water runs over the weir"
<ul>
<li>Hardly the point, and additionally offensive to Sheffielders...<a href="../../../l/e/w/User%7ELewisskinner_9d75.html" title="User:Lewisskinner">L.J.Skinner</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/w/User_talk%7ELewisskinner_8921.html" title="User talk:Lewisskinner">talk to me</a> 19:51, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>please <b>don't delete</b> the original "wiki" piece about it, as it is a little piece of local history. Added to Twikker:talk on 30 October by <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlain_talker_ee6a.html" title="User:Plain talker">Plain talker</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please dont delete this - in fact expand it - as a ex Sheffield student it is great to read about our Rag Mag, it brings back so many memories of both buying and selling it (expecially the visits to other places in the mini bus).please ask people to write other articles about the history ot Twikker - KEEP IT (U Brassy Tart)</p>
<ul>
<li>It would certainly need expansion (as has been done) and better referencing. If anyone can find any old Twikker mags, Rag mags or the above mentioned october 1987 DARTS, that'd be great <a href="../../../l/e/w/User%7ELewisskinner_9d75.html" title="User:Lewisskinner">L.J.Skinner</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/w/User_talk%7ELewisskinner_8921.html" title="User talk:Lewisskinner">talk to me</a> 11:51, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>How many times do I have to say it? Once more? OK: You can find every issue (1930 to 1991 at least, with Ragout in place of the 1950 Twikker) in the Cambridge University Library. Other copyright libraries should have similar collections. Sheffield City Library has a small collection. You can buy them from time to time on eBay. I have no idea who'd keep DARTS 8-) but I'd guess old Sheffield Stars are not too hard to source. <a href="../../../e/w/e/User%7EEwen_3dbb.html" title="User:Ewen">Ewen</a> 12:04, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So? SHOW ME! I can't see these online, so put them online. If old Star are not hard to source, <i>source them</i>!! It's your article afterall! <a href="../../../l/e/w/User%7ELewisskinner_9d75.html" title="User:Lewisskinner">L.J.Skinner</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/w/User_talk%7ELewisskinner_8921.html" title="User talk:Lewisskinner">talk to me</a> 19:51, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So what if you can't see them online? Since when did verifiable mean 'something I can find on the internet'? Why not move away from your computer and investigate the real world outside? If you check the 'Verifiability' policy you will find that "Verifiable in this context means that any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source." Well, you can. It might take a visit to your nearest copyright library but you can verify the references I have given. There is no requirement for online materials in the wikipedia policy. You know what? I'll meet you at the Cambridge University Library on Saturday at 11.00 am and I <i>will</i> bloody show you if you want. I'll be wearing a pink carnation... <a href="../../../e/w/e/User%7EEwen_3dbb.html" title="User:Ewen">Ewen</a> 20:29, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry mate, I'm in Newcastle this Saturday, how about the following Saturday?
<ul>
<li>So ,that's confirmed then: You are able, next Saturday, to check the references I gave. (I'm afraid I can't make that date but I'm sure the Cambridge Library staff will be very helpful with your request.) Ergo: The references are verifiable. <a href="../../../e/w/e/User%7EEwen_3dbb.html" title="User:Ewen">Ewen</a> 06:50, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Would you have done so without AfD?

<ul>
<li>Well, yes I would. (Or someone would - If I wanted to be sole author I wouldn't have used wikipedia.) A tag for expansion would have prompted me to do something, if you were impatient to know more. AfD? Sledgehammer to crack a nut! <a href="../../../e/w/e/User%7EEwen_3dbb.html" title="User:Ewen">Ewen</a> 20:29, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What I don't understand is how Mr Skinner came across the article in the first place. What were you looking for? And isn't it nice to find something unexpected occasionally? You weren't aware of Twikker's existence, and now you are. Hurrah! I think requests to have articles removed should be reserved for items that are defamatory, inaccurate or just plain made-up. Do any individuals have the right to otherwise censor information based on their own prejudice or (that word again) ignorance? <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShortofapicnic_f7d1.html" title="User:Shortofapicnic">Shortofapicnic</a> 10:15, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Checking over the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion</a> again, I think the following comment is pertinent: "Just because you haven't heard of it, doesn't mean it's not notable!"

<li>I have read this 'discussion' with interest but am slightly confused. If the original proposer for deletion now wants the article expanded rather than deleted, should this discussion be proposed for deletion? As an ex Sheffield University student, myself, I was very happy, if not surprised, to find an article on Twikker in Wikipedia. I can't claim to know how important a publication should be to not be deleted, but, surely, a publication which chronicals the developments of any body of people's sense of humour (or lack, thereof) over such a long period of time is noteworthy. Oh, and by the way, I <b>oppose deletion</b>. --<a href="../../../d/i/v/User%7EDive_Monkey_a61c.html" title="User:Dive Monkey">Dive Monkey</a> 01:07, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I vote to delete based on the fact that is not notable and likely fancruft, however as to whether or not it exists, it does, though there are no references and, well, I couldn't give you one. But even if it was referenced, it's still non-notable and fancruft anyway. <i><b><a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoomsDay349_6323.html" title="User:DoomsDay349"><font color="black">Dooms</font></a><a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoomsDay349_7ac1.html" title="User talk:DoomsDay349"><font color="orange">Day</font></a><font color="black">349</font></b></i> <b><font color="orange">Happy Halloween!</font></b> 23:04, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep It</b> Wheather it is a real life secret society it at least exists in Gilmore Girls. So therefore it does exist. Not all articles are 100% sure. Look at the skulls the whole hitler china thing, we don't no thats true but it's there. If we are getting rid of this page because it is not definitly true in real life we must have a "Wiki Rennissance" deleting anything that is not a a true real life thing.--Fiyero554 06:02, 6 November 2006 (UTC)Fiyero554</li>

<dd><b>Keep and Clean Up</b>, the society is notable, so I would imagine it's leader would be as well. He seems like a rather prominent Canadian, but of course I don't live in Canada so how should I know? The article is in poor shape and needs references, but the subject itself is notable. <i><b><a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoomsDay349_6323.html" title="User:DoomsDay349"><font color="black">Dooms</font></a><a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoomsDay349_7ac1.html" title="User talk:DoomsDay349"><font color="orange">Day</font></a><font color="black">349</font></b></i> <b><font color="orange">Happy Halloween!</font></b> 23:28, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Just because a society is notable doesn't mean its treasurer is. I'm not sure about this one, looks pretty successful in his field, but is he really notable? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 23:35, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If you read the article on the society, the Treasurer is the leader. So, he holds the highest position in the organization, and I think that makes him notable enough. <i><b><a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoomsDay349_6323.html" title="User:DoomsDay349"><font color="black">Dooms</font></a><a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoomsDay349_7ac1.html" title="User talk:DoomsDay349"><font color="orange">Day</font></a><font color="black">349</font></b></i> <b><font color="orange">Happy Halloween!</font></b> 23:38, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's alright, don't worry. Just cause I think he's notable doesn't mean everyone else will. Wait for the consensus, and if it is "keep", don't let it keep you from doing and more AFDs- the goal of an AFD is not to delete an article, but to determine a consensus on whether or not to delete it. If the result is a keep, you haven't failed, so don't get upset. <i><b><a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoomsDay349_6323.html" title="User:DoomsDay349"><font color="black">Dooms</font></a><a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoomsDay349_7ac1.html" title="User talk:DoomsDay349"><font color="orange">Day</font></a><font color="black">349</font></b></i> <b><font color="orange">Happy Halloween!</font></b> 23:38, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep and improve</b> Although the page has no print references, it is a very well-known site for RPG-Maker and offers unique services, such as the generators. The page could use some cleanup but should be kept, in the same vein as how Gaming World was kept. However, because users from the site have removed a deletion notice without knowledge of Wikipedia policies, I have started this AfD to find a consensus. <a href="../../../o/s/m/User%7EOsmose_93be.html" title="User:Osmose">Moose</a> 23:26, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. 103,000 ghits seems notable at first. But then you notice that the first two are the site itself, and the fourth is Wikipedia. And then you notice that almost every single entry seems to be from a forum, and some that aren't appear to just blindly accept user contributions.
