<p>I notice that this has a deletion notice but no comments why. A quick glance at the article doesn't make it clear to me why this article was nominated for deletion; the person seems notable if the information in the article is correct. In the absence of any reason why the delete tag was placed here, my tendency is to remove the delete tag. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Deville_1311.html" title="Special:Contributions/Deville">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>The nominator was 85.182.15.4, who gave the following justifications in his/her edit summaries:
<dl>
<dd><i>AfD - Autobiographical articles are against Wikipedia policy. See <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a>.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christoph_Marcinkowski&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40689542AfD" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christoph_Marcinkowski&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40689542AfD" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>
<dd><i>marked article "Christoph Marcinkowski" as blatantly self-advertisingly autobiographical.

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The lack of text here seems to be due to 85.182.15.4 having run into some trouble with AfD, as he/she explains <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2006_February_22&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40691717" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2006_February_22&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40691717" rel="nofollow">here</a>. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 10:25, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> with revisions to make it less of a vanity article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>First off, autobiographical articles are not forbidden; they are just <i>discouraged</i>. And, unless a great deal of the objective facts on the page are false, this person seems sufficiently important to warrant a Wikipedia article. That said, there are problems with the article:
<ul>
<li>it's is long and excessively detailed. It's densely packed with information, but much of this is not necessary or encyclopaedic.</li>
<li>it's too praiseworthy of its subject. For example, regarding his books, it quotes positive reviews of books at great length, and describes them in superlative terms, e.g.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The magnum opus of Marcinkowski is his award-winning dissertation [...] Dastur al-Muluk (Regulations of the Kings) provides invaluable information on political and religious administration, biographies of eminent personalities, economics, as well as culture and geography, during the early 1720s."</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It seems that the article has been written almost exclusively by <a href="../../../a/d/u/User%7EAdul_99f4.html" title="User:Adul">User:Adul</a>, who is Christoph Marcinkowski, its subject. This isn't a problem per se, but it does lead to a general unencyclopaedic tone to the article at times, e.g.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>"In March 1995, Marcinkowski left Germany, first for Singapore, a city for which he has since then maintained always the deepest admiration,"</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I don't have much experience with how to deal with autobiographical Wikipedia entires. My current, somewhat uninformed, opinion is to keep it, and improve it in the ways described. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 10:25, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I suggest that the author set up a homepage for the content of this article. Wikipedia is not a website for posting resume. In addition, publicising the autobiography article by adding links in other articles such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nanyang_Technological_University&amp;diff=36886671&amp;oldid=36463496" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nanyang_Technological_University&amp;diff=36886671&amp;oldid=36463496" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geography&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36739243" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geography&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36739243" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> (and dozens other articles) is quite unacceptable, IMO. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> (<a href="../../../v/s/i/User_talk%7EVsion_836f.html" title="User talk:Vsion">talk</a>) 05:20, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I find the debate around this entry quite surprizing (following the 'nomination' of this article for deletion by someone who does not identify himself for obvious reasons...). Once we start to nominate for deletion articles written by people who we don't like we can close down as well the whole wikipedia project. I can only hope that there is consensus on this... But anyway, lets be less ideological or driven away be personal motivations... I suggest to keep it...<small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 155.69.4.223 (<a href="../../../1/5/5/User_talk%7E155.69.4.223.html" title="User talk:155.69.4.223">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_155.69.4.223_d9b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/155.69.4.223">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> (if an anon has any say in this) or make it look like a real neutral encyclopedia entry and less like a self-advertising homepage. The wikipedian to make the final decision should note that all but one 'keep' votes were unsigned or anonymous. (Quite an irony considering how they (mostly <a href="../../../a/d/u/User%7EAdul_99f4.html" title="User:Adul">Adul</a>/Mr Marcinkowski himself) rant against the initial proponent's (my) anonymity.)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I first noticed a link to his page in the article about <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samarra.html" title="Samarra">Samarra</a> after the news report about the destroyed Al Askari Mosque, and asked myself why the name of any private person should relate to an Iraqi town. I think that this is something Wikipedia should avoid to become or we would soon have endless lists of remotely relevant consultants in topics of general interest.</dd>
<dd>If deletion doesn't apply here something should at least be done about his irrelevant linking all over the place. 85.182.13.210 08:19, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The issue of anonymouy 'requests' applies also to those in favour of deletion. Anyway, I would like to agree with regard to some of the linking but I think some of those in favour of deletion appear to be driven by some rather personal motives (envy among scholars or personal animosities? who the hell knows and why should that play any part here?...). So, do keep it but decide perhaps with regard to the extensive linking. I guess that should do it. <i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 155.69.4.223 (<a href="../../../1/5/5/User_talk%7E155.69.4.223.html" title="User talk:155.69.4.223">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_155.69.4.223_d9b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/155.69.4.223">contribs</a>) .</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Self promotional article. The pictures are nice, however what do many of them even have to do with the article. I also love the contact info included at the bottom.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A word of constructive advise: It could be edited further by a careful hand. But I think deleting it altogether would be an act of vandalism in itself, especially since some of those who are so keen to delete it seem not to be free from selfish motives themselves. Perhaps the linkings could be reduced somehow. <i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 155.69.4.223 (<a href="../../../1/5/5/User_talk%7E155.69.4.223.html" title="User talk:155.69.4.223">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_155.69.4.223_d9b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/155.69.4.223">contribs</a>) .</li>

<li><i>Question:</i> Exactly who or what do you mean regarding 'selfish motives' of deletion proponents? This has been ominously hinted at several times now. I don't get it.</li>

</dl>
<ul>
<li>If it's that bad (which I don't think it is) or whatever then just delete it for Christ's sake, especially since there seems to be such an "urge" and "serious interest" to do so... Quite tiring all this sissy talk.... I can only hope that wikipedia will be able to deal with this in a professional, less injurious, manner with it. I still think revision would be the best way in dealing with articles which have academic matters as subject. This is just the irrelevant opinion of a non-American.
