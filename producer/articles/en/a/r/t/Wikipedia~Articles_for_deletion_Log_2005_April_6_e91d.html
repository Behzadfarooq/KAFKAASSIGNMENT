<dd>There should be a better way to handle situations like this, where clearly bad articles are made into completely different good articles. The Arabic gibberish was an obvious candidate for deletion; the language article is an obvious keep (if someone were to nominate it for vfd now, they would be denounced for making a bad faith nom, and it would likely be speedy kept). In a case like this, 'by the book' sounds like red tape, given that a stranger to this site visiting the article for the first time will see the vfd banner, and may be confused about the legitimacy of the information there. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">gab</font></sup></a> 15:17, 2005 Apr 11 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Instead of replacing the Vfd on this page to reopen discussion about the redirection, which he clearly disagrees with User:Electionworld Electionworld unilaterally reverted back to the current version in complete disregard for deletion process: This discussion needs to be reopened.

<li><b>Keep</b>. We have similar articles for many countries.

<ul>
<li>As a relative newbie, I have a question about this "process," which SqueakBox is so concerned with protecting. The <a href="../../../v/f/d/Template%7EVfd_41cd.html" title="Template:Vfd">VFD</a> tag says "Please do not remove or deface this notice or blank, merge, or move this article while the discussion is in progress. " Wasn't turning it into a redirect during the discussion itself a violation of process? The <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Votes_for_Deletion_c9d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for Deletion">Deletion Policy</a> page says</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>You must not blank the article, turn it into a redirect, or merge it into another article.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>(It seems to happen with some regularity, however.) (BTW, I have nothing to do with this Honduras page and couldn't care less whether it's deleted.) —<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> | <a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">Talk</a> 01:48, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I'm surprised Guide to Votes for Deletion says that. Redirect during VfD process is not that uncommon, but usually only after a strong consensus has developed, which cannot happen in 3 hours from 3 people. Similarly, moves also sometimes happen by strong consensus. Merging is almost always a bad idea while discussion is still in progress (because it's hard to undo), and blanking is just disruptive. Genuine editorial efforts to improve the article are fine, though. Plenty of articles are salvaged that way during the VfD process -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:55, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>BTW there is a much fuller list of parties at <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Honduras_e30b.html" title="Politics of Honduras">Politics of Honduras</a> which no-one has bothered to update. So this is an out of date duplication of Politics in Honduras. I think Cesar and I acted in good faith, where i think Electionworld did not. All he needed to do was restore the Vfd. instead of which he ignored the fact that there was a 3 majority against him and reverts to his version,--<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 01:58, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whether this was up to date has nothing to do with whether the breakout is a good idea. &amp; I don't really care why Electionworld did what he did. This was newly placed again on VfD, I didn't notice it last time, and I'm voting on the merits of such an article existing, not on an issue of its current text, which is not generally a VfD matter. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:00, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Maybe I acted wrongly to revert the merger, but one cannot say that there is a consensus when only 3 hours of discussion were allowed. I argued my reason in the summary when I reverted: <i>(RV. The debate on the delete page was only open for some hours. This page is part of an extensive series on parties by country, so do not delete it.)</i>. Sorry, I thought that that would be enough. It might have been better when I would have restored the VfD template. Whe had this discussion on several pages about political parties in xxx. There was never a majority for deleting of these kind of pages. There is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_parties.html" title="List of political parties">List of political parties</a> that directs to pages on political parties in every country around the world. Where the Politics of xxx pages are generally meant to provide informtion about politics in a country, the political parties are meant to lead to a more comprehensive information about parties in a country. When I started editing in Wikipedia, these pages were already existings (Honduras was already existing in 2003). Deleting this page would damage a complete and balanced information system on political parties in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilfried_Derksen_4ed6.html" title="User:Wilfried Derksen">Gangulf</a> 06:44, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy deleted</b>. Conntent was: ""Haley" "Slafer" was born on March 21st with red hair. Haley has a decidedly "whimsical" taste in music, and enjoys a plethora of bands most have never heard of. Haley enjoys spending longshore money and tagging walls at her local highschool with various cleverly concocted non-obscenities. She watches and relentlessly quotes from "Arrested Development", a television series she has convinced her lowly friend Bernard to be-fan. In the name of a painfully careless and grunge appearence, Haley rarely changes her pants. However, Haley has also mastered the French language, spent ample weekend time teaching undernourished Jewish children how to think, and been a student of music theory for over a decade.

<li>You are free to disagree with Jimbo, but looking things up in wikipedia is a lot more convenient and slightly cheaper than a trip to my local video hire store, and I don't think everyone on the planet has a local video store with Spongebob in stock.

<li><b>Delete</b> article, <b>merge</b> some information as follows. This is an article on Isolation, Perfectionism, Underachievement, and Depression. These qualities are not unique to "gifted students". <b>Merge</b> any useful information into the pages for these four conditions, but "Social and emotional issues in the lives of gifted students" is unencyclopedic original research with at touch of POV. I can't think of any truly encyclopedic articles with ten word titles, actually. Perhaps this could become a rule of thumb, nothing over 8 word titles or something.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalidecyphon_5f3e.html" title="User:Halidecyphon">Halidecyphon</a> 08:21, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

This is a real issue, which has different origins and consequences for gifted children than for others. However, the title is awkward, and I see no reason for keeping it separate from the entry on gifted individuals. Thus, <b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../g/i/f/Gifted.html" title="Gifted">gifted</a> (and don't merge this with <a href="../../../g/i/f/Gifted_education.html" title="Gifted education">gifted education</a>). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartg76_fbde.html" title="User:Martg76">Martg76</a> 15:38, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

I noticed a while ago that a vacuum cleaner was voted to deletion. Why keep mobile phones, but not vacuum cleaners or Leica cameras? I am not really strongly advocating either side (and it would perhaps be a bit of a waste to throw out all the Nokia stuff), but it would appear more reasonable to keep cameras which have been around for decades and seem to have a kind of cult following rather than mobile phones which are definitly outdated and possibly forgotten in another year or two. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 09:57, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Procedural Question</b>.

<li>The poll page in talk: name space</li>

<li>The existence of Talk:Warsaw/Vote</li>
<li>Conducting the poll presently embodied on Talk:Warsaw/Vote</li>

<p>I'm not sure about this new entry, and would like fellow Wikipedians' opinions. I'm not involved in this field, but my initial question is that while Mr Byers may have done an excellent job, is his work notable, or is it akin to a regular civil servant's? (In which case it may be vanity.) There are a lot of "Mark Byers" on Google, but 500-odd "Mark Byers" "New Zealand" responses. However, since New Zealand is a small country and the internet is not the be-all and end-all when it comes to credibility tests, 500 can be quite a lot (and more than some local celebrities who are in Wikipedia). <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStombs_27f9.html" title="User:Stombs">Stombs</a> 08:22, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Wikipedia is forging new ground as an encyclopedia. Just because traditional encyclopedias don't usually have lists of products (and I'm not sure this is always true - I'm sure examples can be found), doesn't mean that it isn't a good topic for an encyclopedia. Encyclopedias are to learn facts and product lists are factual (albeit dry to read). And specifically to Canon, lots of people are interested to learn what products Canon has produced. For example, I am here because I was at a festival today and saw lots of Canon products. The first thing I did when I came home was to go to Wikipedia to see if I could identify what models I had seen. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Backenstose_1ab1.html" title="User:Jon Backenstose">Jon Backenstose</a> 00:18, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. While I am a bit leery of the problem of "free advertising", only in encyclopedic entries such as these will you find <b>both</b> the positive and <b>negative</b> aspects of the products. No, do not turn to a photo magazine; why would the editors of a photography magazine turn away their biggest source of revenue? So, the fact that Wikipedia does not get any money from Canon is exactly why it should have entries for its products. Wikipedia entries would contain information - given a good length of time for photographers and others to make entries - that would not be available on any Canon advertisement. I guess it's a "checks and balances" thing. JR</li>

<p><b>Delete, non-notable</b>. Article is about member of a band ("The Flowers of Romance;" not the original 1976 band) whose article was sent to VfD (see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_The_Flowers_Of_Romance_cd6e.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/The Flowers Of Romance">here</a>); subsequent article speedily deleted due to previous VfD vote. -- <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyrofrog_366a.html" title="User:Gyrofrog">Gyrofrog</a> <a href="../../../g/y/r/User_talk%7EGyrofrog_91bf.html" title="User talk:Gyrofrog">(talk)</a> 17:45, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comments:</b> I would have suggested merging this content to an article about the band, if the band itself was notable enough to warrant its own article (i.e., band takes the name of a 1976 punk group and meets with success in the Baltic States). As the editor responsible is apparently a fellow band member himself, then this might be deemed <b>spam</b> or <b>vanity</b>, as well. -- <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyrofrog_366a.html" title="User:Gyrofrog">Gyrofrog</a> <a href="../../../g/y/r/User_talk%7EGyrofrog_91bf.html" title="User talk:Gyrofrog">(talk)</a> 17:45, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This "article" is at best speculation. Aside from a small list of names, the only text in the article is <b>The following people are or were—probably or definitely—asexual</b>. This is appallingly imprecise and unencyclopaedic.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I was briefly involved with this article last November, I think it was, and restored it on the understanding that it might be made encyclopedic, which didn't happen.

<li><b>Delete</b>, unverifiable, no potential to become encyclopedic. "Never married, no evidence of sexuality in public record" does not equal "asexual". Lots of us, er, I mean lots of people have sexuality that doesn't make the newspapers and gets misinterpreted as "no alignment" or "unapproved alignment". <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 19:47, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete. Agree with all of the above. This is almost certainly unverifiable and/or potentially lawsuit-inducing. Not only that, but I always understood "asexual" to mean "without determinable biological sex", like worker ants. Isaac Newton may have died a virgin, but that doesn't mean he wasn't a male, or else we could add plenty of Popes to this list as well. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 21:09, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>FYI, any address with 134.226 as their starting two quads are computers in Trinity College Dublin. Just because someone else used a PAC (Publicly Accessible Computer) in college to post other articles or blank other's doesn't mean this is false.</p>

<li>A reference for the article has now been posted (<i>Devils and angels&#160;: television, ideology and the coverage of poverty</i>, Devereux, Eoin (1998), Luton&#160;:University of Luton Press/John Libbey Media). The book does appear on the internet, however, whether it mentions Mr Reddy and associated television show would need to be verified. A copy of the book is not held at my local library (the National Library of Australia) and therefore I cannot verify. I think this is now a matter for the Irish Wikipedians to comment on - to date all comments of logged in users have been that they have not heard of Brian Reddy or the show. --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 22:07, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

I just came across this webisit now. The prgram most certainly existed, and I think I should know, Dickie Hickson, the shows host was my father, The house used to be covered in Bolg memoribilia. The show was a huge success, and is relatively well known in Ireland despite what some people have claimed above. I wonder whether or not they are hoaxing you, as I think I can confirm fairly convincingly it exists.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time, and I urge you to vote to save this important site. Joe Hickson.</p>

</ul>
<p>I am an academic of Trinity College, and despite my IP address (I am on the college network) am of no connection to any of my fellow contributors from Trinity. I am a 51 yr old professor of medicinal chemistry, and thus old enough to be in the 'Bolg' generation. I can confirm to you unequivocally that the programme did exist. Although, I must say I am not quite sure where the Cold War analogy comes from. Overall, however, a wonderful addition to this great encyclopaedic reference. I hope to research, and add more to this article in the future. Please retain it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regardless of whether your statement above is true or not, shouldn't you be posting with your own account rather than using a so-called communal Trinners IP addr, especially one as tainted as it is right now? Furthermore, the Reddy article is still bogus, IMHO. Just like the Reddyb one you posted yesterday that got speedied. In short; give up - the game's over - Pete C <sup><font color="DarkRed">(talk)</font></sup> 17:01, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am unaware of any such Reddyb article, how dare you accuse me of creating such</p>
<ul>
<li>Your IP address most certainly did! If you want to dissociate yourself with that IP, then get yourself a username, as suggested, otherwise people such as me will continue to make "mistakes" like this. At the very least, you should sign and date your comments, as has also been suggested. I still cannot believe Trinners is so restricted in IP ranges that the entire college - professors 'n' all - have to <a href="../../../n/a/t/NAT_e0ce.html" title="NAT">NAT</a> through the one IP addr - Pete C <sup><font color="DarkRed">(talk)</font></sup> 17:24, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Again, I don't know what the problem with this page is. I can assure you it was one of my favourite programmes when I was a young man in the late 1970's. That said, I may have spelt the name wrong as my Irish isn't very good.This might explain the google hits thing. I hope you keep this site up.

<li>The issue seems to be the IP address allegedly originates in a college (see VFD Brian Reddy). It may not be the same author. My recommendation to Paul Fitzgerald (if he is a real person) is for him to get a log in and then he will be separate from other users of the IP address. This recommendation has been made several times in the IP user talk page and that talk page has ben defaced from the IP address - ie some users know enough to look for the talk page and edit it. I have also made the recommendation on the Brian Reddy talk page in response to Paul Fitzgerald's query. --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 22:37, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: What is the significant difference between a "student number" and, say, a "public library user number" or an "employee number"? This article either has to be more generic and speak of registration of people in general, or more specific and limit itself to one specific university (system).

The issue of POV merits an {{npov}} sticker, not a {{delete}} sticker. 3. On particular issues that need to be changed, are you claiming that there is not enough factual material related to criticisms and claims of the Iraq War and its execution? Certainly there's an argument for inclusion in the "main article", but LIC, there is no "main article," and whatever articles there are, are in need of organization. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">==S</a><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">V</a> 23:13, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>The article's <i>current</i> title, "Criticism of the Iraq War", is not inherently POV as the original title "Iraq occupation mistakes" was. However, whether Stevertigo can see it or not, whether he will admit it or not, it was created as a POV fork. "Article is biased or has lots of POV" may not be a reason to delete but "Article is a POV fork" is. Add to this Stevertigo's idea that he is unilaterally entitled to declare the VfD against his article "misapplied" and revert it, and it adds up to a <b>Strong delete</b>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:00, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I might agree with this if someone (anyone) could qualitatively define (and substantiate) for me any practical differences between POV as no reason for vfd (use npov sticker) and a POV fork as reason for "strong delete" of whole article. The term "fork" implies that this material is treated elsewhere in a similiarly complied way. Where? It cant be that hard to provide a link! Does this mean that <a href="../../../w/i/v/Wives_of_Henry_VIII_8558.html" title="Wives of Henry VIII">Wives of Henry VIII</a> should be deleted because it contains redundant info, that can be found accross the related and attached articles?

<dd>Is it your opinion then that "compiling" information from two or more articles together entitles the compiler to create as POV an article as they like, and then that article is actively <i>protected</i> from deletion, because "POV is not a reason to delete" and somehow covering the same ground as more than one article makes it less a duplicate article?

<li><b>keep</b> edit and expand as currently retitled (<i>Criticism of the Iraq War</i>); the war and subsequent peace was one which triggered massive criticism and debate.

<li><b>Delete</b> Critique only does not allow relevant counter-points to be brought up in each section. If <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_Invasion_of_Iraq_a692.html" title="2003 Invasion of Iraq">2003 Invasion of Iraq</a> is getting too cluttered then you can split that into smaller sections such as Motivations for 2003 invasion of Iraq and how it was carried out.

<ul>
<li>That's a bit of a non-sequitur. Whilst the article currently has pretty much only criticism, you can easily and simply add criticism of criticism, which is the whole point. The level of criticism was strong enough to make it interesting in and of its own. E.g. the article claims that the WMD claim is provenly falsifiable (presumably just because the American weapons inspectors after the war claimed it was false). On the other hand George Bush has recently criticised that by claiming that there were WMD in Iraq and that they had been found, which is a different point of view. Both should be stated along with the case for each. Claiming that an article <b>about</b> criticism is non-NPOV is like claiming that an article about "Motivations for 2003 invasion of Iraq" is non-NPOV. Both can be made NPOV or not. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozzerati_67af.html" title="User:Mozzerati">Mozzerati</a> 06:58, 2005 Apr 21 (UTC)</li>
<li>Gren:"Motivations for the 2003 invasion of Iraq" (LOL) might be an "alternate" way of looking at it, but I think that "motiviations" is MUCH more POV than "criticism," which like Mozzerati says, can still be a well-enough written article. But while "motivations" can include criticism, its basic framework is much more limited in scope. Snide comment: Considering also the inconsistenty and shifts in "motivation" (in rhetoric, anyway) from 2002-2005 maybe the title "ever-changing motivations" would be more accurate.&#160;;) -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">SV</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">t</a>|<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Stevertigo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Stevertigo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">add</a> 19:17, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not non-sequitir I don't think. I prefer motivations because the motivations are US policy and US policy is worth reporting. Criticisms stem from US policy, not the reverse. Yes, I know both can contain POV but I think we must keep in mind what is the news and what is in reaction to that. I think the "criticism of the criticism" argument is taking the whole issue backwards. and Stevertigo, your comment might have been snide but it amused me... I do think there is plenty to question about the Bush administrations actions... I am not a staunch Republican trying to keep Wikipedia free of dissent... in fact I dislike most political parties... I just don't like what I see as the implications of such a title. If you want to change my vote to an <b>Apathetic really not going to argue if it's not deleted delete</b> then you may do so.
