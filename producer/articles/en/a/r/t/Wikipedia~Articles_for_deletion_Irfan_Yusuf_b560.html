I'm not sure how many major parties they have, but there must be at least 2, so that means at least 300 people are endorsed by a major party at each election - are they all notable just because of that?

<li><b>Keep</b>...I think. I'm sure I've heard of the guy (and Sydney is over 1000 km from here), but I can't recall why. He seems to be an outspoken representative of the "typical Australian Muslim". The article definitely needs more work though. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 11:02, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm a failed candidate and we're all important! No seriously this guy sounds very interesting - a conservitive candidate who is a muslim in a city that has had significant problems with relationships between muslim communities and the community in general recently. He may well figure in future debate, and it would be useful to be able to access infomation about his background quickly. Just the thing an online reference is most useful for - up to date infomation on seemingly unimportant topics that may quicky become important as things change. Michael Johnson.</li>

Also, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> - we should have an article on him once he becomes important, not in anticipation of it. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 12:10, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd like a definition of important. Some people are putting a lot of effort into writing articles about railway stations in Melbourne, not railway stations in general, or even the busiest, or most architectually interesting, but every single railway station. The balance of importance seems to lean pretty heavily towards unimportant here, and to be honest I don't mind that at all. A paper encyclopedia is limited by the cost of production and pure size, constraints that sure do still apply here but to knowhere the same degree. A good thing. Someone thinks he is important enough to write an entry, he is in public life in this country, so I still say keep him, untill such time as the server is full, and we have to start deleting stuff. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Johnson_75b2.html" title="User:Michael Johnson">Michael Johnson</a> 12:22, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is a risk of setting a precedent if we keep unimportant living people that doesn't exist so much for railway stations. This person is no more notable than 100s of other minor public figures - do we want articles on all of them? His claim to fame seems to be that he's a political activist that writes the odd article.

<li><b>Delete</b> - a token Muslim candidate put up in a dead-safe Labor (non-conservative) who never had any chance of winning. The vehicle for a stunt to get Muslims to vote Liberal (conservative).

<dd>I think that the candidates of the large parties are, even if they don't have a good chance of getting elected. The "tokeness" of a Muslim conservative can actually contribute to one's notability. Of course I respect if you have different opinions, many of the items here are really border cases.

<dd>I agree that token candidates are probably more notable than other candidates, but standing in an election and losing is a single act that doesn't really effect anything. Were it a major position you were standing for (President or something) then the election campaign is notable in itself, but a single seat in a parliament is rarely newsworthy during a campaign, it's the leaders of the party that do all the big talks and things. This is rather a general issue, though, so prehaps we should have a proper discussion on the requirements for a politian to be notable (unless one has already taken place, of course - I'll go look). --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 16:49, 13 May 2006 (UTC)
