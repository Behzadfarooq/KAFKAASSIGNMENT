<dd>You're misunderstanding POV, I think. An opinion is POV, but the existence of an opinion by an individual is a verifiable fact, and hence NPOV. The same holds for the possession of a belief by a <i>body</i> of people. As long as inclusions on this page are circumscribed by this criterion that "a significane proportion of English speakers will find the name of interest" we have a NPOV page. <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 17:02, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>No, I'm not misunderstanding NPOV. What is 'interesting' is ultimately POV. Of course the existence of a opinion as to what is interesting could be a <i>verifiable</i> fact - but that isn't possible here. As to 'a significant body of English speakers will find thisof interest', how do you propose to verify that? If would become an opinion on what a 'significant body' would find intersting - and that again is POV. You could arrive at a consensus - but that is effectively a survey of wikipedians, and would violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. So, yes, it is inherently POV. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 18:10, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Reading the above, I can't understand why you aren't suggesting that virtually <i>everything</i> in Wikipedia is ultimately opinion and should be deleted — we could always find somebody somewhere to disagree with much of what Wikipedia says. To achieve a sensible balance, we have to accept that the Wikipedia editor community will make collective <i>judgments</i> based on their opinions (e.g. it is clearly possible for a collective judgment to be made on the questions you pose above) and that these judgments, whilst POV, result in our best efforts at producing <i>content</i> that is NPOV. I think few editors would agree with you that the Wikipedia editing process is inherently a breach of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, which is in effect what you are saying, if I've understood correctly. In an ideal world, we'd make it clear everywhere that this is they way Wikipedia is edited, but in the real world we have to make compromises (otherwise we'd have article titles like "[[A view arrived at by some volunteer editors who may or may not have been following the proscribed editing process on what material is relevant for a Wikipedia article on the subject of the Battle of Hastings, at this point in time, subject to the possibility that vandalism may have taken place on this article]]") <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 20:07, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> I am of the opinion that arriving at an objective set of criteria isn't impossible, it's merely <i>difficult</i>, hence, we shouldn't be attempting to delete this article, but rationalise it once we have an agreed set of criteria in place. Some criteria are so obvious that we'll all agree on them (places with the same name as a "naughty bit", for example), others not so obvious - let's discuss and agree an approach to this latter group, and then we have the basis for rationalisation. <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 16:56, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
