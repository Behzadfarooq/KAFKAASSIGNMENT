<h2><span class="mw-headline">Discussion</span></h2>
<p>Nice template. Could the dates be formatted (<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_17.html" title="January 17">January 17</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>) so that they display properly for users with this preference set? Also, could the amount of space it takes up on the talk page of the article be minimized? (by default, that is; I know that it supports the small parameter) Thanks. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Peel_9ea8.html" title="User:Mike Peel">Mike Peel</a> 18:40, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The dates are actually intended to be linked to the version of the article on that date, just like in the article history, see for example <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubble_Space_Telescope_566f.html" title="Hubble Space Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a>. I've changed the template so that the history is now hidden by default. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_pda_8c8c.html" title="User:Dr pda">Dr pda</a> 20:49, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could there be an option to add a line about the "Good Article" history of an article, as FA status automatically removes the article from GA status? —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 06:24, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article milestones</span></h2>
<p>This box is currently labeled "Article History", which I suppose has a slight potential to confuse users looking for the article's actual history. Since this box lists only the most notable events in the article's history, how about labeling it "Article milestones" instead? –&#160;<a href="../../../m/x/n/User%7EMxn_bd81.html" title="User:Mxn">Minh Nguyễn</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/x/n/User_talk%7EMxn_f72c.html" title="User talk:Mxn">talk</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mxn_39ed.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mxn">contribs</a>)</small> 08:23, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd ditto that. Also, could someone change the caps that appear throughout the template, like "Article History" (or "Article Milestones"), "Featured Article Candidate", "Peer Review", "Current Status", "Not Promoted" so that only the first word is capitalized? This is how we usually format section headings and templates in Wikipedia. And thanks for the good work and the great template idea! It's very handy&#160;:) <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 09:06, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

</ul>
<p>FTC is now a valid action. The status is implemented differently because it is independent of the status of the article. If the FTC is successful, use <code>ftname=</code>(name of series), and additionally <code>ftmain=yes</code> for the main article in the series. I haven't implemented anything for Former FT, since there aren't any. Nor have implemented a status for for failed FTC, since the current instructions say to put {{<a href="../../../f/t/c/Template%7EFTCfailed_45bf.html" title="Template:FTCfailed">FTCfailed</a>}} only on the talk page of the main article, the failed FTC is recorded in the milestones, and the extra text in the template takes up quite a bit of space. I suppose if it turns out to be necessary we could add a <code>ftfailed=yes</code> option.</p>

<p>Given variance of preferences and desired options already expressed below by another user at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Template_talk%7EArticleHistory_bd9f.html#Show.2FHide_feature" title="Template talk:ArticleHistory">Show/Hide_feature</a> and then by me at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Template_talk%7EArticleHistory_bd9f.html#Show.2Fhide" title="Template talk:ArticleHistory">Show/Hide</a> there should be a line that gives the option to collapse or not.

<dl>
<dd>As I state below, this should be optional since the purpose of having the templates is to make the it clear at a glance to the visitor that the article has a review history and some editors may prefer to have a preference for show instead of hide if the page does not have many other templates such as WP templates. An alternative might be to have it set to show if there are small number of other talk article templates and hide if there is a large number such as 5 or more. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_9324.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger">TonyTheTiger</a> 15:27, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you mean for finding the dates/oldids to give to the template, go to the talk page history, look for for the date {{featured}}, {{facfailed}}, GA, {{oldpeerreview},} etc was added, then go to the article page history and find the last version before that date and time.

<dd>The oldid should be the one when the article was promoted, as many articles/lists get chnaged as a result of discussion during their nominaton.

<dd>The bot is maintaining the FAC process. For future FACs, the oldid will correspond to the version of the article when the FAC director closes the FAC discussion. When the ArticleHistory template is added to other articles with old FAC pages, the oldid will correspond to the version on the date of the last comment on the FAC/PR/FARC discussion page. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 13:46, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's harder than it looks, say, for articles promoted a year or two ago, and whose talk page has been repeatedly archived. Not mo mention the hundred of edit generated by first-page featuring.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Comment on issues with the template</span></h2>
<p>Wow, there's been a lot of activity here since yesterday! Great job by Circeus on making the instructions look nice. Unfortunately they are not quite correct after some of the changes I made yesterday, which I had hoped to document properly today, but will now not have time to do until tomorrow. Just quickly</p>
<ul>
<li>FAC and FAR nomination capability has been removed from the template, per discussions at <a href="../../../d/r/_/User_talk%7EDr_pda_2152.html" title="User talk:Dr pda">my talk</a>. Use of the existing nomination templates has advantages for usability, plus there's less confusion about which dates/oldid's would be referred to.</li>
<li>Maindate showing today's date if left blank: that should be a quick fix, I'll do it when I add some more of the requested features.</li>
<li>BP - Raul654 has said that the original BP nomination date is not relevant, just whether the article was kept or demoted at the Refreshing of Brilliant Prose (which was basically a vote on whether to keep or reject each "Brilliant Prose" article shortly after the switch to the current nomination system for Featured Articles). This process closed on 19 January 2004 (which can be used for the actionXdate), and the discussions are archived at <a href="../../../a/r/c/Wikipedia%7EArchive_Refreshing_brilliant_prose_-_Science_1aac.html" title="Wikipedia:Archive/Refreshing brilliant prose - Science">Wikipedia:Archive/Refreshing_brilliant_prose_-_Science</a> or similar, (which can be used for actionXlink). See <a href="../../../d/n/a/Talk%7EDNA_0ebe.html" title="Talk:DNA">Talk:DNA</a> for an example.</li>
<li>Incidentally, <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFeature_Historian_b697.html" title="User:Feature Historian">User:Feature Historian</a> is very useful for finding dates articles were promoted/demoted. The dates articles were added to the logs of FAC/FAR provide the definitive dates for the end of these processes, however this action is usually accompanied by updating the talk page templates. It's a matter of choice which ones you want to trawl through.</li>
<li>Show/hide feature: default was made hide after a request by another editor concerned about talk page space. One of the advantages of the template is that it does reduce the clutter in 'hidden' mode. Some articles have lots of actions, and there the template does take up quite a bit of space (see <a href="../../../s/e/s/Talk%7ESesame_Street_3a77.html" title="Talk:Sesame Street">Talk:Sesame Street</a>).</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>FAC/FAR</b>: I agree the template should not handle the nomination feature. I just noticed that FAR, FAC and GAR are only pertinent to be added once their result are known: until the article is actually promoted, it's status doesn't change... I'll edit my table ASAP. "FAR", "FAC" and "GAR" statuses should default to FA, GA or any other preceding status (in the case of FAC).</li>
<li><b>BP</b>: Maybe then it's irrelevant to document it on the talk page here, since it's only useful for a finite set of articles... I'll put that not in the table to avoid clutter.</li>

<p>Why is the FAC,FAR not used anymore? All that needs to happen is when it is docummented on the template change result to "current" and not put article id in.

<dd>It's a history page listing, just with a specific start location. It will list edit versions prior to the date code. So if you have a history page with <code>offset=20070123125820</code>, the first edit listed will be prior to that date, and so will correspond to the version that existed at the instant of the offset time. This is what the bot does, in fact. If a FAC discussion is closed on a certain date, it queries the history page with an offset corresponding to that date, and grabs the oldid value of the first entry. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 03:26, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Also, per the comments in the previous section, note that if an article which failed Refreshing Brilliant Prose and has not subsequently been renominated is given <code>currentstatus=FFA</code> it will also appear in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_former_featured_articles_1690.html" title="Category:Wikipedia former featured articles">Category:Wikipedia former featured articles</a>.

<dd>I'm not sure I'm following - doublechecking. Right now, there are 335 articles in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_former_featured_articles_1690.html" title="Category:Wikipedia former featured articles">Category:Wikipedia former featured articles</a> and 333 <a href="../../../f/f/a/WP%7EFFA_4199.html" title="WP:FFA">FFAs,</a> which includes the 12 re-promoted FAs listed at the bottom of the page. One of the extras is coming from "Wikipedia:Templates used for featured content", and I've got to go through and find the other discrepancy. If I'm understanding correctly, you're saying that once the bot goes through again (?), it will remove the re-promoted FFAs from the cat (since they are currently FAs), so I should expect 333 minus the 12 repromoted FFAs to show up in the category? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 15:20, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, a bot is going to (eventually) add this template to any article that has gone through FAC. If you want to help out, you could also make sure that all the relevant templates are OK on the talk page of articles you work on. For instance, I've run across a few where a peer review was archived but the oldpeerreview link was not updated. Or the same with a couple successive failed FACs. So, the bot is capable of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:IPod&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104585153" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:IPod&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104585153" rel="nofollow">doing this,</a> but two of the templates had not been updated as a result of page moves. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 01:45, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>So maybe I'm slow, but I'm still not clear. To help the bot, I should check articles to make sure GA tags have the "oldid" parameter, and what do FA tags need? -- <span style="background-color: #EECCFF;"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatyrTN_0a7c.html" title="User:SatyrTN">SatyrTN</a> <span style="font-size: smaller;">(<a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatyrTN_2573.html" title="User talk:SatyrTN">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SatyrTN_f368.html" title="Special:Contributions/SatyrTN">contribs</a>)</span></span> 15:09, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Most of the FA info is complete - there are generally two problems on talk pages - incorrectly archived peer reviews (as in the example Gimme gave above), and failure to identify oldid on GAs. I also find missing templates. On FAs, just make sure the {{featured}} template is there, and correctly links to old info. In sum, just make sure everything on talk pages is thorough and complete, and the bot can handle the rest. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 15:11, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Since the GA thing is a bit of a pain, I've got the bot prompting for a date when it encounters a GA template lacking an oldid; eventually the bot will find a date similar to how Pda's script works. So, don't worry about prepping GA templates for the bot. Bigger issues are where old peer review and FAC attempts were archived, but the link was not updated on the talk page template. People archive things to all sorts of odd names, like <a href="../../../p/r/e/Wikipedia%7EPrevious_Featured_article_candidates_World_energy_resources_and_consumption_be10.html" title="Wikipedia:Previous Featured article candidates/World energy resources and consumption">this one</a> Sandy handled, so a bot couldn't really find them. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 17:11, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well perhaps I'm naturally stupid, albeit hardworking. I couldn't find any such thing - can you toss me a clue stick? For example, how does one glance through the oldids on history/diffs without having to scroll through each entry? And, since I couldn't find any mention of GA in the talk page history edit summaries, how did you know where to look?

<dd>I looked at the talk page history for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AClimate_of_Minnesota&amp;diff=93789777&amp;oldid=93002728" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AClimate_of_Minnesota&amp;diff=93789777&amp;oldid=93002728" rel="nofollow">date when GA was added</a>("ga status") and then looked it up in the article history.

<dd>Thanks for the clue, Circeus - that's exactly what I did, and I found a series of oldids beginning with 90. After scrolling through about a dozen diffs manually and finding no 93s, I gave up - so I'm still not sure how you did it. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 21:06, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, I'm not sure how you managed to get to the oldids starting with 90 - to me those ones look like they are for the revisions of the article between the 25th and 29th of November, whereas the talk page edit summary with <i>ga status</i> is the 12th of December. Incidentally, if you hover the cursor over a date on the history page (i.e. what you would click to go to the revision for that date) the URL appears in the status bar at the bottom of the browser, which can save some clicking. But have you tried my <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_pda_articlehistory.js_2f3a.html" title="User:Dr pda/articlehistory.js">article history script</a> (I see you've added it to your monobook.js)? This brings up a list of talk page dates for edit summaries with relevant words (like fac, ga etc), followed by the word oldid. Click on this word and it magically (well, javascript-ly) turns into the oldid of the article on that date. Took me 5 seconds to get the oldid. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_pda_8c8c.html" title="User:Dr pda">Dr pda</a> 00:53, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, thanks Dr pda for the hover trick - that will help. I did many templates before I installed your script, so I could teach myself how the whole business worked rather than relying on a script - now I've also used your script many times, and it's great - sold.

<dd>Wikiproject banners are, in almost all cases, nothing more than talk page spam designed to bring attention to the various wikiprojects. Most wikiprojects do *very* little to improve articles they have brazenly tagged as being within their scope. I grant there are few exceptions - a few wikiprojects do genuinely great work, as measured in their output of featured articles. (Milhist, medicine, hurricanes, and the horror-movies wikiprojects come to mind in particular). However, these are rare exceptions.</dd>
<dd>So yes, in this sense, a multi-template project banner does "miss the point", if the point is to use wikiproject banners as shameless advertising. On the other hand, it will dramatically reduce the talk page clutter that has resulted from this unchecked spamming, and that is a Very Good Thing. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 18:37, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough, but you're going to find it very hard to get support for such use. And yes, they are there for advertising the project to get more people into them. I don't plan on "defending" any and all banners, but if I see {{<a href="../../../a/n/i/Template%7EAnime_421f.html" title="Template:Anime">Anime</a>}} or another I feel strongly about in one of these, I'll pull it right out of such a template. A much better idea would be something like, trying to get WikiProjects to have a wording / size limit to their banners, and using the <a href="../../../t/p/t/WP%7ETPT_00a2.html#Small_option" title="WP:TPT">small option</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 23:55, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Possibly a compromise where the 'hidden' version still shows the name of the WikiProject (hence keeping them visible - they are a great way to attract people to a wikiproject).

<dd>Part of the goal here is to reduce multiplication of talk page banners, among other things. Not displaying the FAC text in this situation reduces the space taken up on the talk page, so currentstatus=GA is correct. The only combo status is FFA/GA, for former featured articles that later become GA. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 06:26, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Documenting when a page was moved, plus MfDs and DRVs</span></h2>
<p>Is it possible to also include something in this article so you can document when a page was moved? Sometimes the move history of a page gets quite complicated. Also, it would be nice to list whether a page has been deleted in the past and/or undeleted. I realise the page logs will show some (all?) of this, but could there be a parameter to activate to provide a link automatically to the page logs from this template. Something like "page move=yes" and "deletion activty=yes", to generate automatic links to the page logs?</p>
<p>Also, are MfDs and DRV included here yet? I want to use this template for a Wikipedia namespace page. It previously existed in article namespace and got moved. It has had one AfD, a move from article namespace to Wikipedia namespace, an MfD, a DRV, another MfD, and now possibly another move (staying in Wikipedia namespace this time). Any of the designers of this template have any idea how to document this? Have a look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia_talk%7EList_of_media_personalities_who_have_vandalised_Wikipedia_9e1b.html" title="Wikipedia talk:List of media personalities who have vandalised Wikipedia">Wikipedia talk:List of media personalities who have vandalised Wikipedia</a> to see the current 'templates' in use.

<dl>
<dd>Since the template is explicitly aimed at articles, multiple MfDs and complicated move history are probably better covered by a customized box at the top of the talk page. Moves are trickier because right because there is only so much that can be inserted in the history (15 actions right now,if I'm not mistaken)<a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> 14:11, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So something like {{WikipediaPageHistory}}? I think at least DRVs should be included somehow, maybe linked to the notice of the AfD that was reviewed? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 14:51, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For many AfD's there is {{<a href="../../../o/l/d/Template%7EOldafdmulti_26d6.html" title="Template:Oldafdmulti">oldafdmulti</a>}}, but to include non-AfD items you might want to use {{<a href="../../../m/u/l/Template%7EMultidel_85a5.html" title="Template:Multidel">multidel</a>}} rather than four subst'ed templates. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 16:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This should be optional since the purpose of having the templates is to make the it clear at a glance to the visitor that the article has a review history and some editors may prefer to have a preference for show instead of hide if the page does not have many other templates such as WP templates. An alternative might be to have it set to show if there are small number of other talk article templates and hide if there is a large number such as 5 or more. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_9324.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger">TonyTheTiger</a> 15:25, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, if you are assessing lots of articles in one go, it is sometimes useful to be able to see, say, the importance ratings, or the current quality rating. I turned one template from default hide to default show for that very purpose.

<dd>Almost nobody uses whatever you are talking about. The solution sounds like a pass the buck solution. I think the programmer should make his template neutral. Either make the template's collapsability optional or create a feature to make it dependent on the amount of competing clutter. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_9324.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger">TonyTheTiger</a> 21:28, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nope, no confusion on my part - I know the difference between FACfailed and FFA. As I said, this is about other statuses, not FFA (in the Stuyvesant High School case, it's FACfailed). What you're talking about is a change in practice when promoting articles. In the past, the FA Directory (currently <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a>) deleted the {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFacfailed_9226.html" title="Template:Facfailed">facfailed</a>}}s and {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFac_ebda.html" title="Template:Fac">fac</a>}} and added a {{<a href="../../../f/e/a/Template%7EFeatured_8cc7.html" title="Template:Featured">featured</a>}} (<i>e.g.</i>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Stuyvesant_High_School&amp;diff=57368665&amp;oldid=55947257" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Stuyvesant_High_School&amp;diff=57368665&amp;oldid=55947257" rel="nofollow">S.H.S's promotion</a>). So up until {{<a href="../../../a/r/t/Template%7EArticleHistory_86b0.html" title="Template:ArticleHistory">ArticleHistory</a>}} started taking over the world, FAs weren't also tagged as FACfailed and categorized as such. It appears that the reappearance of this category is an unitended consequence of applying this otherwise great template. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossPatterson_2d77.html" title="User:RossPatterson">RossPatterson</a> 00:01, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is correct. I deleted the former featured article and FACfailed templates because it wouldn't make sense to most people to come to a talk page and see conflicting messages "This is a featured article" and "this is a former featured article". In fact, that very problem was the initial reason we created this template. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 00:34, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reason that switch block is there is for cases where the article has failed one process and subsequently undergone another. For example if an article has failed FAC but subsequently been listed as a GA (e.g. <a href="../../../s/a/l/Talk%7ESalt_Lake_City%2C_Utah_3853.html" title="Talk:Salt Lake City, Utah">Talk:Salt Lake City, Utah</a>), then <code>currentstatus=GA</code> puts in in the GA category, but without the categories implemented in the switch block in {{<a href="../../../h/i/s/Template%7EHistoryoutput_7ffb.html" title="Template:Historyoutput">historyoutput</a>}} it wouldn't be in the failed FAC category. Ditto failed FAC/failed GA, failed FAC/delisted GA etc. Maybe if the category was renamed to 'Articles with unsuccessful FACs' (or something) it would resolve your objection. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_pda_8c8c.html" title="User:Dr pda">Dr pda</a> 14:42, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone suggested that <a href="../../../o/l/d/Template%7EOldafdmulti_26d6.html" title="Template:Oldafdmulti">Template:Oldafdmulti</a> be merged into this, but what worries me a little bit is that this template is normally hidden and one has to click "show" to look at the article history. The idea behind having the prior AfD listings on the talk page is to prevent people from re-listing articles at AfD over and over again. When the previous AfD results are hidden in this template, people with be more likely to miss them and re-list articles. Would it be possible to list the previous AfDs in this template to a seperate section that can not be hidden (meaning that the FAC etc... are still hidden, but <i>not</i> the AfD results)? --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<dd>Thats a clear answer, I've removed the merge suggestion.

<dd>This seems reasonable. WAR and WPR now allows approved/not approved/pass/fail/passed/failed as results. Any other result for a WAR or WPR event *should* display simply Reviewed, except WPR will also support "stable" as a result, displaying "stable version" in the result column. I'm going to see how many articles currently use WAR/WPR events and see what got broken.

The rest will take a while to re-cache. I'll change the documentation once the bugs are cleaned up. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 06:14, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An "approved" result from WikiProject peer review has been added and I'm perfectly happy with that. Thanks all! --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 15:41, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is {{<a href="../../../a/a/r/Template%7EAartalk_2586.html" title="Template:Aartalk">aartalk</a>}} necessary then? Some statistics: 21 pages had a WPR action (12 with review, 4 with empty result, 4 without the result parameter, and 1 now has approved). 4 pages had a WAR action (1 empty, 2 review, 1 pass). I've changed the WAR action results to passed/failed. Seems to me WAR should be kept for A-reviews only. Under the WPR action, "approved" now corresponds to an "approved version"; other result codes should display "reviewed". If another type of review is needed, I think it should be handled by a result code under the catch-all WPR. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 16:37, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I figured some good input could come from posting a notice here, what with all the talk page cleanup that this template has inspired. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 08:06, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
