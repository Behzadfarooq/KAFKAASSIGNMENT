<dd>The only reason people care about "T14" is because the top 14 law schools (unlike, say 25) have been remarkably stable in the past decade or so, leading to the conception among some that there are 14 schools that are, far and away, better than the rest. Of course, the actual difference between 14 and 15 is pretty small. One of the reasons Leiter opposes T14 is because he is a prof at #15 UTexas. <a href="../../../c/z/a/User%7ECzar_Dragon_0a69.html" title="User:Czar Dragon">Czar Dragon</a> 00:27, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep.</b> This is actually a valid, rather useful term. There are an easily discernible 14 "national" law schools, and in the legal industry, "top 14" (or T14) is helpful shorthand. Also, my apologies: I'm a contributor, as you may see from my history, but this is the first time I've chimed in on a deletion discussion. Excuse me if I've posted this in the wrong spot or something. jtl9000</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> As a student applying to law school, I've encountered the term "top 14" in discussions with prelaw advisors, on various internet message boards, speaking with current law students, and listening to admissions officials. Thus, it is quite a common phrase. But more than just a phrase, it is an actual group of schools characterized by 20 years of consistent rankings in published news sources which is in turn derived from the opinions of judges, lawyers, and meaningful statistics (selectivity, job placement, etc.). Note that a law school professor (Brian Leiter) linked in the web resources section of the article rails against the prevalence of this term. This should suffice to show it is in fact pervasive. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.229.201.180 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.229.201.180_87bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.229.201.180">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

The fact that it is generally thrown around by better educated lawyers and students does not in and of itself deny it a place in Wikipedia. Indeed, Wikipedia should be open to compiling well executed articles on field jargon, as they make these terms more accessible to those outside a given area of study. The same holds for medicine, finance, military doctrine, etcetera, where numerous articles of comparable “obscurity” exist. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 140.247.125.153 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_140.247.125.153_b9be.html" title="Special:Contributions/140.247.125.153">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

The only references to this term I can find lie within a very limited universe of law school related bulletin boards and blogs. Though this term is used a lot in those places, limited use in non notable forums does not equal notability. This seems very much like a neologism. Also, I hope whichever admin eventually closes this debate takes into account that many of the above keep votes resulted from the above mentioned coordinated effort. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a> 03:17, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Anyone who spent even half a minute looking at the links in 66.28.244.132's contribution could see that these criticisms are baseless. Again, if we're going to include less-notable and concrete terms like <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Ivy_e6dc.html" title="Little Ivy">Little Ivy</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Ivy_209b.html" title="Public Ivy">Public Ivy</a>, this article unquestionably merits inclusion.160.39.31.71 03:31, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: If you do not think those articles belong on Wikipedia, feel free to nominate them for deletion.

<dd>How can you not see any precedent? Literally hundreds of "neologisms" are well-established and accepted with significantly less verification of their widespread use. At least four books, two college career services sites and a law professor, to say nothing of the literally thousands of discussion forum hits, have been cited in support of keeping this. That's more than sufficient.160.39.31.71 05:34, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>::: Respectfully, I question the grounds on which it is being called a neologism. It’s not new. This term emerged in early 1990’s and has very strong empirical backing. Year in and year out U.S. News, along with major law school admissions commentators, have given it implicit or direct credence. The article documents this.</dd>

<p>Moreover, it appears that Wikipedia is increasingly being hijacked by a group of overly dedicated editors. These individuals, rather than providing commentary in areas which they are actually informed, attempt to monitor the whole institution at large. While their actions warrant merit with respect to cleaning up vandalism or removing the posting of images not under copyright, they are often poor judges of the internal merits of pages.</p>
<p>Indeed, the claim is here that there has been a coordinated effort to preserve the page, by references to its deletion entry on xoxohth.com and lawschoolnumbers.com. While I can find no references by a search of said sites, I will say that if there was one, so be it. Such a posting only brings many individuals from the legal world to the page, who can subsequently weigh in on its accuracy. If such a term was indeed bunk, there would likely be many more votes for deletion than their currently are from actual members of the law profession, as opposed to registered wikipedians. Moreover, where the term appears in specific law school Wikipedia entries (see gulc, the term has not been removed (and they, indeed, are also monitored by a large number of students, faculty, lawyers, so on). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 140.247.125.148 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_140.247.125.148_852e.html" title="Special:Contributions/140.247.125.148">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>You do not have an account on wikipedia, and from that I surmise that you aren't experienced in the way it works. I don't mean this to be offensive, but rather just to note that others here may understand the process more clearly due to their experience. <i>Wiki</i> here implies collective consensus in both writing but also in managing the encyclopedia. The processes evolve over time, but have arrived at where they are today after a long long road involving the consensus of thousands of people. The process may not be perfect, but it is working OK. I understand that you feel the term under discussion here has widespread usage and is therefore encyclopedic. You see many lawyers using the term, feel it is established, and therefore feel that wikipedia should have a page about it. You have pulled together many facts about this term, and feel that as you have an understanding of it you are sure that it fits with Wikipedia. You need to remember that here at wikipedia we have a policy that we do not do <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and the understanding that I've attributed to you <i>is</i> original research. Wikipedia is a tertiary source, and must cite secondary sources only in determining whether to keep an article. The arguments described above are all arguments based on primary research, namely going out to find blogs and books that use the term. I see no references to books <i>about</i> the term, or papers that <i>treat</i> the usage of the term. Accordingly the term is <i>not ready yet</i> for wikipedia. It may be in time, but not now. The term does not need to be in Wikipedia in order to be a "true" term. You seem quite skilled in writing, may I suggest creating a wikipedia account and working on a few other pages for a while. IMHO I think we must let this one go. -- <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a> 22:22, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is not original research. Please familizarize yourself with the term before you use it. If someone were trying to <i>create</i> the idea of a "top 14" by simply citing the USNews rankings and making some kind of an argument, that would be original research. Simply reporting on the existence and widespread-usage of the term while citing numerous examples of such usage is not.160.39.31.71 23:25, 11 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually you are wrong. Research based on primary sources (such as those you cited) is original research. Non-original research would rely on secondary sources. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 00:58, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here's a helpful quote for you guys from the Wikipedia policy: "Original research that creates primary sources is not allowed. However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. All articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources. This is not 'original research'; it is 'source-based research', and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia." This article is not inventing a term. It is not presenting any original analysis or criticism of the term or its use. This is a non-issue. The desperation to delete an article despite an obvious consensus among informed individuals and overwhelming evidence supporting its inclusion really helps illustrate the overzealous editor problem cited above.160.39.31.71 01:37, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why would anyone want to delete this term? T14 refers to schools that have NEVER been ranked out of the top 14 since the inception of the US News and World Report Rankings began.</p>
<p>Keep! Not to get philosophical but obviously if there is such a debate about this term than it is in fact an existing "term"; "phrase"; "expression"; "idiom" or whatever you want to call it. Who cares if its "original research"? Some people (like me) use Wikipedia to look up definitions of words they haven't heard of and this site helps people figure out the definitions of terms that they dont already know. (Plus, as other posters have already indicated T14 is commonly used) This is precisely what encyclopedias are supposed to do: give you the the definition and relevant information of a term,</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, that is not what encyclopedias are supposed to do; that is what dictionaries are supposed to do. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 05:58, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
