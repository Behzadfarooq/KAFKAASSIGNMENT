<li>I just realized that we'd better be <i>very careful</i> about labeling someone's living religion as mere "folklore." That's what the stub as it is now implies.

<li>The way the article is written now, it isn't even clear what is being identified as folklore.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Nothing I could find on Google tells me exactly what makes a person e-fluential. The term isn't well-defined -- everybody has their own definitions of the term -- so I still think anything Wikipedia puts on is someone's original definition. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 04:36, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep in mind you'll have to point to at least one <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Google hits are less than a dime a dozen these days, and don't necessarily mean it isn't OR. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 06:52, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I suggest starting with one of the <a href="http://www.efluentials.com/pages/research/2000study" class="external text" title="http://www.efluentials.com/pages/research/2000study" rel="nofollow">surveys</a> commissioned by <a href="http://www.burson-marsteller.com/pages/home" class="external text" title="http://www.burson-marsteller.com/pages/home" rel="nofollow">Burson Marsteller</a>. However, there seems to be some misunderstanding of the nature of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">NOR</a> (which I have encountered on more than one occasion). <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">NOR</a> refers to the Wiki editor, not to the data that the editor collects. To quote from the policy: <i>"research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. All articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research"; it is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia."</i> To attempt to synthesise a definitive meaning for "E-fluentials" would be specifically barred under <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">NOR</a>. The necessary approach would be to cite the differing definitions of the term, citing sources. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 07:25, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I speedily deleted this before. The person is certainly non-notable as an author (the book isn't even available on amazon.de) and I don't think his notability as a neonazi leader (the articles about his nationalistic clubs Kreuzritter für Deutschland and Deutschherrenklub were deleted from the German wikipedia as linkspam; he also opened a neonazi cafe once) and criminal (apparently he was jailed for injuring an ex-neonazi), which is not talked about in the article at all, is sufficient. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 01:16, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><strike><b>Weak keep</b> as possibly notable.

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't think this is crystal ballism. I think the song just isn't notable. As of now, the only single from the album is "Dani California", so unless this song becomes a single- and then a <i>hit</i> single- it doesn't have the notability to be on WP. Otherwise, every track from every album would have its own page. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 01:41, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

However, as I am not from Detroit, I can't make a judgment in the article's notability. Perhaps the text should go into Southwest Detroit, but I don't know if that's an official neighborhood.

US 12 is a major route and but I can't see any good reason to break out one little section of a US Route by it's in-state name. Besides... the article is only about one tiny section of Michigan Ave... US 12 is called "Michigan Avenue" all through the state (and possibly into Chicago). Still, a redirect would be the best solution here because at least in Michigan, it is always referred to as "Michigan Avenue".--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:02, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Nothing to convince that they are any more notable than any other university sports team, but cricket is rare in Germany, hence possible notability-by-novelty a la Jamaican bobsleighers etc (+ website states appearances on TV etc).

<li><b>Please review your votes</b>. With a heroic effort on my part (as I know absolutely nothing about cricket), I attempted a <b>rewrite</b> to make the article be about cricket in Germany as a whole, although still, obviously, with a bit too much emphasis given to Göttingen. With a history going back to 1850, there must be <i>something</i> interesting to say about cricket in Germany.

<li>You have partially persuaded me, Lakhim! Yes, rarity is not always of itself an indication of notability, but nor is it a barrier to inveitability. See Tyrenius's comment below.

<p>I've been reverting vandalism on this article for months, and every time I do I wonder why. The vandals have singled out this particular article because he's an MP3 blogger and he's a running joke, or something, on a music board. But every time I look at this two-line stub, I think, why do we have an article on Perpetua? He has a reasonably well-known MP3 blog, but other than that he's not particularly notable and the only edits to this article since forever have been either vandalism or reverts of vandalism. So let's just put this article out of its misery. <b>Delete</b>. <b><span style="color: #f33">·<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>·</span></b> 03:07, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The fact that his page here is being targeted by vandals is neither here nor there, as the nominator recognises (all that deleting will do is mean that vandals start creating fake new pages for this person instead).

<li>CMAC recently incorporated as a small non-profit in the Baltimore area. We were able to register www.ChristineMaggiore.com, and will be launching a full website on May 16, 2006, the one year anniversary of her daughter's death from AIDS-related pneumonia. Christine Maggiore is a prominent figure in the AIDS Denialist movement and her daughter's death has been covered in the LA Times and on ABC's "Primetime." CMAC is the first organized effort to counter AIDS denialists' claims that is directly targeted at Maggiore. --Robbieisfun 03:25, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page appears to be about an internet forum, variously called "Renegade Forums" and "Renegade Comic Forum". The page is entirely unreferenced, and has been so since its creation. I have been unable to locate a single work that might serve as an <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">independent, reliable source</a> for this article. A google.com search for "renegade comic forum" was unhelpful, producing only two hits; one to what I presume to be the forum itself, the other to the Wikipedia page under discussion. I do not think it is currently possible to write an encyclopedia article on this subject, and request its deletion. —<i><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;"><b>Encephalon</b></span></a> 03:52, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>I've never known a forum or club to have that many topics... The church that the forum is affiliated with has over 40,000 just in the main denomination, a feat for a church only 60 years old... Membership spans to Netherlands, America, Canada, Australia, South Africa, South Korea, and Scotland. No less notable of an entry than many others in the database. It may be noted that some members have in excess of 2000 posts within a couple years... this is obviously the only life they have... as pathetic as that may be, it may also be 'notable'. In a certain community, this group is having a large impact. -batmanhatguy</p>

<p>Weaselriffic. This is a review of Halo 2, not an article about a controversy. Currently, it's pure original research, and laden with weasel words. Rather than a description of a groundswell of negative criticism, it's a laundry list of complaints, some of which are vague and purely aesthetic (e.g. "Other fans complained that the plot of Halo 2 was less appealing than that of Halo.")</p>
<p>I would suggest that it be merged into <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_2.html" title="Halo 2">Halo 2</a>, but that article is already a trainwreck, and this useless pile of OR and weasel words would do little to improve it.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would agree that the concept is not restricted to Rubik's Cube, but I wonder how it can be expanded. Could you give an example? The search for an optimal algorithm is certainly interesting, but it seems to me that the natural place to treat this is not in <a href="../../../g/o/d/God%27s_algorithm.html" title="God's algorithm">God's algorithm</a>, but in some other page talking about the specific problem being solved. For Rubik's Cube, we have <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimal_solutions_for_Rubik%27s_Cube_f05e.html" title="Optimal solutions for Rubik's Cube">Optimal solutions for Rubik's Cube</a>; for matrix multiplications, this is discussed in <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matrix_multiplication.html" title="Matrix multiplication">matrix multiplication</a>, and if it gets too large for that, it can be discussed in Optimal algorithm for matrix multiplication, et cetera.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have some issues with the rewrite. It changes the definition of "God's algorithm": it adds the requirement that it be practical and it restricts it to games modelled by digraphs. The links served up by Google seem to be ambivalent on the practicality requirement. I think that this shows the difficulties in writing an article about what I believe to be an ill-defined phrase mainly used colloquially, which is why I'm standing by my nominiation notwithstanding the rewrite. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 02:15, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Obviously a lot of work has gone into this list, just look at the history. I really don't know who other than the people working on the list would benefit from its existence. Who cares? So I think I'm inclined to vote for <i>delete</i>, but I'm going to bed now.

<li><b>Keep</b> I consider that an article which has been worked on by a whole number of different editors over this time period (since June 2004) and has reached this advanced stage, has effectively achieved a community consensus, which is a major factor to be taken into account when assessing this Afd nom. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 06:25, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. There are many other pages that have not been deemed to meet the criteria for inclusion, no matter how many editors have worked on them or how venerable they have been; the Draft Busts/Steals articles for various professional sports leagues, for instance. Granted, about half of them will pile onto this AfD and shoot it down, but it's still a mere list, unblemished by any actual content. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 08:11, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I agree with the notion that the article having many editors should be given some degree of weight. However, with a few exceptions, the edits of the last year seem to be mostly drive-by additions. Edit history aside, I just don't see how someone could come across this article and find it useful. In the event that someone has an interest in fictional electronic games, there is no further context for 90% of what's listed here. I'm also a little concerned that it's not possible to have any reliable oversight of this list. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 13:58, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. My full reasoning is at Talk:The Black Year#Black Year? but in sum, we already have articles on <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglesey.html" title="Anglesey">Anglesey</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/u/Druid.html" title="Druid">Druid</a>, and the main source <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annals_%28Tacitus%29_4f30.html" title="Annals (Tacitus)">Annals (Tacitus)</a>; and we have articles on <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Cornwell_4e93.html" title="Bernard Cornwell">Bernard Cornwell</a> and his <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Warlord_Chronicles_5610.html" title="The Warlord Chronicles">The Warlord Chronicles</a></i>, in which novels the narrator refers to "That Black Year" and the author (in an afterword) refers to "the black year of AD60 when..". I think this is an honest confusion of these descriptions in <i>Enemy of God</i> with a real name used historically. However, once you take the name and Merlin's quest for treasures with which to repel Romans out, there's nothing in this article which we don't already cover. I did not turn it into a redirect because, as far as I can tell, this name is not used in history, so the redirect would be a sort of original research in itself. <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelsa_283c.html" title="User:Telsa">Telsa</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/User_talk%7ETelsa_ea14.html" title="User talk:Telsa">(talk)</a> 08:42, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Telsa, including his reason not to redirect to another article. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Black+Year%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Black+Year%22" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> shows lots of "2003 was a black year for &lt;topic&gt;" quotes, but none except this WP article indicate that it's used by historians to refer to 60 CE. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 17:56, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hmm that is Odd. I dont get the same google hits as you do. If I type in Kontinuum Workflow I get 9000 hits. Google or Alexa is a bit hard to measure a size of a company's breadth or significance. Probably a better measure is to see what kinds of site are talking about the subject and if those sites are important or just link farms. I would probably vote to keep it but maybe remove the external links as these can be abused.

<li><b>Cleanup</b>: In Australia it seems to be relevant. There are 3 major search engine sites google.com.au, ninemsn.com.au and yahoo7.com.au which are driven by the google, MSN, and Yahoo search engines. If I type in "Workflow Software" into each of them searching for australian sites then there are the following natural listing results:</li>
</ul>
<p>Google (Position 4: Site about Web and Flo, Position 7: webandflo.com) MSN (Position 4, 9 &amp; 10: Sites about Web and Flo, Position 7: webandflo.com) Yahoo (Position 1: webandflo.com). I do not think the number of sites is as good an indicator of relevancy as opposed to site ranking. Since the engines are much better at detecting over-zealous SEO and they do blacklist sites.

<li><b>Neutral</b>Hi I actually work for web and flo so you make take everything I have to say as fully biased. I personally think it is relavant athought I think my opinion should not carry any weight. However one thing I would like to point out is that Kontinuum Workflow Software Suite as a name is only one month old. Before that it was just called Kontinuum (for about 6 months I think) and before that it was called "Web and Flo". That is why there are so few hits for Kontinuum as a name. I dont really mind if this gets deleted as we have no control over it and it can be used to say very negative things about the product by competitors.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not something made up in school, this is something played in schools. It seems to me that a game of this nature is going to have a hard time asserting notability by the google criteria because the practitioners are &lt;gross assumption&gt; 10 year olds busy playing sport, not writing blogs &lt;/gross assumption&gt;. This article seems worthy of inclusion to me, and seems quite different from beach cricket and French cricket. Perhaps an all-round 'cricket variants' article would suffice, but I discern sufficient points of difference to suggest that the different articles should be retained.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is a genuine article. Poor kids in cities don't have access to proper cricket, and this is the only way they learn - therefore the content of the article is important. Plank cricket is not written about on the internet because deprived 10-year-olds don't 'blog' about it, and probably don't even have the internet. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist - it matters hugely to a lot of people, and plays an important part in the development of cricketing skills. If the general feeling is that a separate article is too much, then it should be merged with <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_cricket.html" title="Street cricket">street cricket</a>, but certainly not deleted, as the information is 100% correct, and it is a well-written piece. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.135.11.121 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.135.11.121_3a92.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.135.11.121">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li>I agree with the above - while I won't modify my keep vote below, perhaps a rename to something like List of fatal incidents stemming from the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan would work.

<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry, my comment was misleading: it doesn't seem to be copy vio. The article apperas to be heavily based on information (but not text) in the <a href="http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mwherold/" class="external text" title="http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mwherold/" rel="nofollow">Marc Herold website</a>, with the exception of the military deaths at the end which should anyway be moved to <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition_Casualties_in_Afghanistan_847c.html" title="Coalition Casualties in Afghanistan">Coalition Casualties in Afghanistan</a>. So it could be tidied up until Herold's website is the sole secondary source (which I guess is why the individual incidents were not originally tagged). However, his website is itself a synthesis of news reports, with footnotes each incident. So tho tedious, if should be poss to slog through and tie each incident (sometimes each part of an incident) to a source. Then leave an overall link to Herold: the news reports are "as the story emerged", while Herold ties things together afterwards. I'm only sounding so confident because I've just had a brief go at exactly this, and have so far found Herold's stuff checks out. But I'm not a position to do the lot, if only because some newspapers may need subscriptions. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackyR_8980.html" title="User:JackyR">JackyR</a> 16:54, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To address the first two comments about the low number of Google hits, searches should not necessarily include the "Ltd" at the end since Ion Global is not known as an "Ltd" company all of the world. It markets itself most of the time just as Ion Global to ensure it covers all international entities. The search with "Ion Global" alone, which is more accurate, produces 16,500 Google hits.

<dd>(According to <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/" class="external text" title="http://babelfish.altavista.com/" rel="nofollow">babelfish</a>:)If the sun becomes the carpet if concerning a layman modern art momentarily by the window of the gallery Steinegger in Ruedlingen looks, it becomes perhaps in the pictures issued there first only circles, lines, strips or squares in strong colors to recognize. In it hidden are however everyday impressions and memories of journeys. The pictures, which from New Yorker artist comes the Joseph Pisani, are issued under the title "The Trials and Misdemeanors OF Life on the Road". The Vernissage took place on Friday. Pisani was born in New York and took after some travel in Switzerland domicile. Its work - abstract expressionistische painting - is to energize the viewer for thinking and to the closer Hinsehen. A picture, in which among other things a broad red strip and a teppichfoermiges object are to be seen, is called "The View from My Bungalow". "I lived a time long in Egypt. The red strip stands for the Red Sea, and the sun has here the form of an eastern carpet ", explains Pisani. Everyone sees something else as proceeds it when painting - does it have a conception of its next work already before painting? "if I to paint begin, mix I first colors, like it me straight please - to know without, what from it" Pisani becomes, says. "short before the picture is finished, comes the brainstorm: Well clearly, those are the colored seas of the Indonesian island Flores!" How can the untrained viewer open the meaning of the forms and colors? "the titles are to help thereby", mean Pisani, "and the longer one a picture regarded, the more recognize one - however everyone sees something else in the pictures."

<dd><b>Comment</b>, it doesn't prevent it from being nominated as there is no hard amount of time that needs to be waited before bringing something to AfD... but it goes against the spirit of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Articles for Deletion</a> section <i>Before nominating an AfD</i>, goes against common courtesy, and contributes to the view that AfD's are <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">biting</a> newcomers.

If the originators answer is that they can't source it (or they ignore the message), then speedy/AfD. I know I'm going off on a tangent here, but AfD is discouraging new editors from participating in Wikipedia when their first encounter with the community is an AfD notice on their page, no explanation, and an AfD reason like "subject not-notable".

<li><b>No-Delete</b>. I am Eckart E.Colsman the author of this contribution. I, Eckart Colsman, found out that the Wikidea Organization thinks of deleting my articles about the "Refractive Relativity Theory" (RRT). These ideas of the RRT I presented in some American Physics Society (APS) meetings - the first one in Fall 1991 at the Bates College in the USA. In my website www.colsman.us.tc/ . I explain the consequences of the idea of replacing the “warping of time” with the variable velocity of light. I got over the years some enthusiastic response to this new approach to the General Relativity Theory. – I plan to write more articles which fit better the Wikipedia discussion/source platform . - I can’t imagine that some one likes to delete my articles from the Wikipedia system, just because there are no abundant sources or links. Please, approach new ideas with an open mind! -How else can we make progress of understanding the physics of the universe! --</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> __David Cohen. This theory presents an lternative to relativistic time warp and replaces it with c warp. The dimension of space-time, ct remains the same as does the Lorentz transform. This is another way of looking at the bending of light in a g field. c would be near zero at the instant of the big bang and time would be allowed to preceed the big bang.</li>

What we do discuss is whether RRT is considered sound physics in the generally accepted literature available. RRT isn't mentioned at all in the generally accepted literature available, so it shouldn't be mentioned in WP either.

<dd><b>Do not delete</b> I am Eckart Colsman the author of the <b>RRT</b> idea. These ideas are not “one person’s idea”. They were discussed in private correspondence and the result are the papers presented in my home page ( www.colsman.us.tc/) . I explain how the time warp is replaced by the c warp, and what consequences are resulting. If there are some non-sequitur situation, I like to know about it and discuss it! -- As a person who never was associated with an academic research institution, I am a layman for the established close knitted physicist community. Maybe some of the Wikipedia community can find a reputable physicist who studies the ideas of the RRT and recommends to be published. I am in a catch 22 situation! But this happened to lot of now well-known physicists like Hubble and even Einstein! - Replacing t with c as a variable is a plausible and logic step and worthwhile to find out where it is leading to. I found astonishing results! But our thinking is so used to the contra-intuitive thinking that we have a hard time making a paradigm shift to get out of this rut of thinking. -- We all should try to understand Einstein’s Relativity Theory instead just admiring him, and try to find a theory of unification between the GRT and Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory, Einstein was looking for. Finding a unified field theory would be the best monument we can build for Einstein –he deserves a big one. Let’s all work together on this big monument! <b>Eckart Colsman</b> Eckardo 19:43, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Wikipedia is an <i>encyclopedia</i>. If you opened up a paper encyclopedia would you think it was proper to find an article about a high school student's unknown musical production? Although Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, and this leads to some differences, it is just as improper to have an article on an unknown, not-notable work as it would be for Britannica. The problem arises when people associate Wikipedia with other online forms of data storage such as blogs and webhosting services. Just because this is an online media does not make it similar to such services--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 17:02, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment and Response</b> Blaze, nobody here is saying, or even implying, that Moral Anarchy is <b>BAD</b>, or that the author is a 'random, unimportant person'. I wish it the best of success, and hope to see it performed on Broadway or off, or appearing at the Sundance film festival. When it does, it will definitely be Notable enough to have an article on Wikipedia. That's why <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rent.html" title="Rent">Rent</a> has an article - it's a notable Tony and Pulitzer award winning play. Even a play just written by a famous author, but not yet published or in production, is not notable enough to have an article here. I suggest that its own website (moralanarchy.com URL is available!), message boards, myspace, etc.,. are a good way to get exposure for Moral Anarchy. But Wikipedia is an encyclopedia for Notable events, movies, famous people, etc. Best of luck to Moral Anarchy. And I wish your friend has a notable career in theater and film. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPriyanath_0bf1.html" title="User:Priyanath">ॐ Priyanath</a> 18:03, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article contributes nothing that is not already in the battery article, or should be. The disambiguation makes no sense, as the phrase for reversing the charges on a phone call is "reversing the charges", not "reverse charging", and there is no chance of an eventual Wikipedia article there, as it is a simple dicdef (as is "reverse charging (battery). This article is nothing.<a href="../../../f/n/a/User%7EFnarf999_8dfc.html" title="User:Fnarf999">Fnarf999</a> 19:27, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am also nominating the related article <a href="../../../r/e/v/Reverse_charging.html" title="Reverse charging">Reverse charging</a> which contains the disambiguation to Reverse charging (phone call) which article does not exist, cannot exist.<a href="../../../f/n/a/User%7EFnarf999_8dfc.html" title="User:Fnarf999">Fnarf999</a> 19:25, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>delete both</b> for reasons stated above. Most of the first article is a list of information on the proper use, recharging and storage of batteries, which belongs in the battery article.

<p>James Donahue's main claim to fame appears to be as the father of Aaron Donahue, whose article was recently deleted despite the - ahem - enthusiastic support of one <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECro..Scream_1835.html" title="User:Cro..Scream">User:Cro..Scream</a>, who is the author of this article. Two other claims to notability are incliuded: as webmaster of a website (which, assuming it's the link in the article, as seems likely with no other link provided) is hosted on Tripod; and publishing some books. Which he has: "over five" books, of which four are listed, all of which are local history books about the Great Lakes. They sound quite colourful, but they don't seem to have set Amazon's sales rank on fire yet. At least two of the publishers appear to be defunct, one of them replaced by at least two other companies of the same name, so I can't see if they are self-published. There's n o reason to believe they are, but neither is there any reason to believe that they have more than a minor local market. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 20:56, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The fact that he supposedly had a long career as a journalist that isn't discussed at all suggests that this is just here to prop up the deleted Aaron Donahue article, and not a real bio of an independently notable person.

<li>According to <a href="http://perdurabo10.tripod.com/id3.html" class="external text" title="http://perdurabo10.tripod.com/id3.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, one of his books is probably self-published, in that he established the publisher that published it. Of course, the page also lists another book he co-wrote that's not in the article (published by the Historical Society of Michigan), so the net effect on his claim is pretty minimal. The page also claims that his newspaper work was for the Port Huron Times-Herald, a Gannett paper with a daily circulation of 27,000+. This would qualify him under the guidelines for published authors, if it can be verified that he did in fact write for them. He doesn't have any articles in their online archive, but it only goes back to 1999, so that's not necessarily illustrative. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a> 14:08, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've never heard of Ed Dames or the Donahues before this controversy, and I'm tired of your accusations of bias, prejudice and censorship. For me the only issue was notability. I would guess most of the "delete" voters above, who are names I recognize, feel the same. Although your sacred cow is being gored here, for most of us this is just one in a long, long string of discussions about notability. There's nothing personal or ideological in it, or there wasn't before you and your sockpuppet pals started disrupting things.

<li>Sorry if this objection isn't formatted correctly. I would say that this article is definitely eligible for inclusion in wikipedia. It would obviously seem obscure to someone unfamiliar with Sublime, but to followers of the band, he is EXTREMELY well known. He was featured on the cover of one major release, inside the liners of all others, and on the cover of a number of bootlegs. Furthermore, he was prominently featured in the lyrics of numerous prominent songs - including the famous singles "What I Got" and "Garden Grove". Considering that there is a place for "Yankees Sucks" articles on wiki - basically on pop culture references pertinent only to a certain demographic - I think we can fit in a Lou Dog entry. I would strongly encourage the Wiki Gods to leave this article intact. If putting in pictures of Lou Dog or references, please let me know.

Original reason in <i>prod</i> was "<i>No assertion of notability, essentially empty article, unable to verify, and uncertain if "Grammer" is typo or not (or why old South African flag is used by an Australian school)</i>". Tag was removed by original editor without explanation, only change was to correct misspelling of word “Grammer” throughout the article. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluit_5f4e.html" title="User:Fluit">Fluit</a> 21:08, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Hi all Wikipedia users, Tony Romano here, Assistant Principal of Crowlington Grammar School. Just letting anyone interested to know that the Crowlington Wikipedia page is an assignment that has been set for out media students and was intended as an ongoing project, thus the reason it is far from completed. I'd also like to point out that 'Grammer' is infact a typo, but that we have been unable to change the title of the page, if anyone could help with that, it would be much appreciated. As for the flag, that was used until we get our own logo up on it. Thanks very much for your help and consideration.</i></dd>

<p>This doesn't convince me to withdraw, but I'll leave it to others to discuss and decide. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluit_5f4e.html" title="User:Fluit">Fluit</a> 21:12, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> / <b>Comment</b>: The page has been moved to Crowlington Grammar School at Mr. Romano's request. As for my vote on the AFD, there are other schools with pages and I think the jury is still out on notability for schools lower than the college level. (BTW, in case anyone else is uncertain as I was, according to the article, they go K-12, so they aren't an elementary school. I had always assumed "grammar school" = "elementary school", but I guess not.) If they are committed to making this page sourced and verifiable, that's fine. As one word of caution to the class, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_for_things_made_up_in_school_one_day_29ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day">Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day</a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 21:20, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Prototechnology is a real word. It's probably not technically a neologism since it was used in this 1979 NASA document - <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/CP-2156/ch4.4.htm" class="external free" title="http://history.nasa.gov/CP-2156/ch4.4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://history.nasa.gov/CP-2156/ch4.4.htm</a> - though it is very rarely used, having only 77 google hits, mostly garbage.</p>
<p>At any rate, the real word "prototechnology" refers to use of tools prior to technology. For example, a caveman banging two rocks together to start a fire would be prototechnology. This article gives some nonsensical definition of prototechnology, claiming that it has something to do with technology used for marketing communications.</p>
<p>So while "prototechnology" is a real word, this article isn't really about that real word. If you look at the article's history, the contributor originally credited two individuals with coining the term in 2006 (a patently false statement) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prototechnology&amp;oldid=52494536" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prototechnology&amp;oldid=52494536" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prototechnology&amp;oldid=52494536</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 21:41, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Google scholar and google books come up with a handful of hits, but no usages that are clearly what the article is claiming the term is about. (I'm not about to go buy the limited books to see how it is used there.) I can't see this article ever rising to be more than a dicdef - and the current content is not the appropriate dicdef. Current version doesn't meet WP:V, probably can't meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> using <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 22:04, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Even if the article was about the correct usage that would probably be a candidate for wiktionary. If the article first defined the word correctly and then the meat of the article described instances of prototechnology, those would likely be original research or summaries of information from multiplle articles containing more depth.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a></li>

<p>This article descibes one blast furnace and not very well.</p>
<p>The correct title would be 'Old Blast Furnace, Coalbrookdale'. Ironbridge is a separate village. The word 'blast is necessary as Coalbrookdale also had 'air furnaces' that were used for remelting iron. There is already a good general article on Coalbrookdale (which I have expanded) dealing with the history of the Coalbrookdale Company. There is a good general article on blast furnaces. There might be a case for a detailed description of the surviving stack, but that is not what appears here at present. The section on the local uses of iron is possibly of local interest, but I doubt that it is sufficient to warrant its appearance in Wikipedia. In summary there is little merit in retaining this article. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterkingiron_03d3.html" title="User:Peterkingiron">Peterkingiron</a> 22:27, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Reply</b> (from deletion-suggester): I agree the site is an extremely important one, but I doubt there is anything in this article that is significant enough to warrant its appearance in either of the other articles.

<p>List of proper nouns containing <i>anything</i> is a poor start. In this case it's a loooong and still incomplete list of names containing an exclamation point. As far as I can tell there is no especial reason for choosing an explamation point over any other punctuation mark. A jumble of names, book titles, TV shows etc., which takes no account of the recent vogue for stuffing a shriek on the end of TV programme names.

<p>Contested PROD. This isn't really notable as cocktails go. Personally, I don't mind including cocktails, even though they're technically recipes, as long as they've shown some kind of lasting popularity. Articles on classic cocktails are a good thing.

<dd>Argument for keep, by <a href="../../../s/l/o/User_talk%7ESlopez1389_92e0.html" title="User talk:Slopez1389">Slopez1389</a>: <i>Seth Lopez is the lead guitarist and vocalist from the band Nethers P.O. How do you know he is not important? You have apparently never seen him in concert. He one of the best musicians in the southern Ohio area. He has set up the indie scene in the Dayton area and has accomplished many things in just a short time. Our country is built on freedom for the people and by the people. For an organization to label someone unimportant is un-American. It is especially horrible for an group that calls itself the "free" encyclopedia. The people have a right to decide whether or not Seth Lopez is important not a group of admin.</i></dd>

I have attempted to contact both User:EmilySavesTheDay and Emily Harvey via MySpace, but neither had responded to my requests to verify Emily Harvey's involvement with this article. If anyone can dispute that Emily Harvey isn't the primary author of Emily Harvey, speak now or forever hold your peace. --<a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwiki_de79.html" title="User:Dwiki">Dwiki</a> 00:11, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is a poorly-written article to be sure, and needs cleanup. The autobiographical aspect of it, if true, is bad form, but not grounds for deletion as far as I'm concerned. If Harvey passes the notability test, the article should be kept but rendered in intelligible English. I'm not sure if she does, though. <b><span style="color: #f33">·<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>·</span></b> 00:30, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Article appears to be autobigraphical, and Google does not support notability. I am skeptical of the idea that the subject's endorsing John Kerry in an op-ed on election day in 2004 "caused a great stir" on campus. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 02:00, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
