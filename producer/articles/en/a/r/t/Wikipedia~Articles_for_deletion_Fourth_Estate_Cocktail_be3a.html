If the cocktail turns out to be so non-notable that I can't find any viable information about it, I may change my vote back to a full delete; I'll let you know within a day or two.

<dd>Comment - In the past I would have asked for an extension through February 28th citing the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cocktails_Cleanup_2899.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cocktails/Cleanup">Cleanup Project</a> under way by our WikiProject on all articles like this. 5 days is a very short amount of time given how much work the Project Participants are involved in, though I think our effectiveness at cleaning up this part of Wikipedia should be very clear by now. We are much faster at processing things now, so I chose to be conservative by estimating only one week just to try to make everyone happy.&#160;:-) Either way, deleting is definitely <i>not</i> the right answer (unless it turns out to be a hoax), because if any part of the article is kept (which is very likely, even if only transwikied to <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending" class="extiw" title="b:Bartending">b:Bartending</a>, we have to keep the edit history for <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">GFDL</a> licensing and attribution requirements. As I stated, <b>the article needs to be converted to a redirect if any portion of the original text is kept</b>, and it is likely that some of the text will be kept. The redirect would point to the new location of the moved text. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillscrlt_a1d7.html" title="User:Willscrlt"><font color="#C71585" face="Tahoma"><b>Willscrlt</b></font></a>&#160;<small>(<font color="#4169E1" face="Tahoma"><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillscrlt_ad5a.html" title="User talk:Willscrlt"><b>T</b>alk</a>Â·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Willscrlt_ad85.html" title="Special:Contributions/Willscrlt"><b>C</b>ntrb</a></font>)</small> 23:20, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added this cocktail to fit in with a new category involving absinthe-based cocktails or cocktails with absinthe in their makeup that I am working on. You may delete it, although it is an unusual recipe that is not commonly found in guides, the main reason I included it. I see no reason why it should be deleted, as it is a feasible recipe that is not life-threatening that would expand the list of cocktails recorded in Wikipedia. I think that the Cocktail project needs more input on these new designs and I can't see why it can't be included.<a href="../../../h/o/t/User%7EHotspur23_6190.html" title="User:Hotspur23">Hotspur23</a> 05:21, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Comment - Part of the problem is that Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">is not</a> a collection of recipes (for cocktails or otherwise). To be included in Wikipedia, the topic of an article needs to have more depth. The <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">notability</a> and importance of the drink must be demonstrated as shown by <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citing</a> several <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. I definitely appreciate what you are trying to do here. If this is part of a series of articles you are developing, we might be able to develop a single article that discusses these cocktails in a broad sense, and explore some specific examples. Then, if and when the article grows large enough, with plenty of good information, start splitting sections of that article into smaller, more fully developed articles. It is certainly something that would be worth discussing at the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Mixed_Drinks_de0c.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mixed Drinks">WikiProject Mixed Drinks</a> (we just changed the name of the project to be more inclusive; sorry for any confusion). --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillscrlt_a1d7.html" title="User:Willscrlt"><font color="#C71585" face="Tahoma"><b>Willscrlt</b></font></a>&#160;<small>(<font color="#4169E1" face="Tahoma"><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillscrlt_ad5a.html" title="User talk:Willscrlt"><b>T</b>alk</a>Â·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Willscrlt_ad85.html" title="Special:Contributions/Willscrlt"><b>C</b>ntrb</a></font>)</small> 06:43, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Then it should be moved to Wiki Project Mixed Drinks and not deleted. It seems silly to delete it when there is a program to do the very thing you want to delete it for in Wikipedia. Plus it can be argued that cocktail recipes are information that can be stored in wikipedia, since they are already on record. They don't have to be famous or noteworthy (though there are recipes that are recorded in it that are); they just have to be useful. This just seems a bit trollish to bounce the article. 24.34.207.250 10:08, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks 24.34.207.250, though I wouldn't classify it as trollish.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> has very valid points for articles in general at Wikipedia. The articles concerning mixed drinks in general do seem to defy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>, because a mixed drink, at its heart, is essentially a recipe. It's much like a chemical compound, in that the parts that make up the whole help to define the substance itself. However, with some (or sometimes a lot of) creative researching, it is possible to create a meaningful, encyclopedic article even when all you have is a recipe with which to start. (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bronx_%28cocktail%29&amp;diff=101704477&amp;oldid=97872919" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bronx_%28cocktail%29&amp;diff=101704477&amp;oldid=97872919" rel="nofollow">Bronx (cocktail)</a> for a perfect example updated yesterday.) It is success stories like the Bronx that illustrate how weak articles can, and should, be improved. This AFD process is an important part of making sure that Wikipedia remains relevant.</li>
<li>All that being said, I did complete my initial research into this particular drink. I was able to locate the recipe in several places, but no real information about its notability or history. Since it does seem to be popular, I changed my vote to transwiki it to the Bartending manual at Wikibooks (with which I am also an editor), and then convert the page under discussion to a redirect. Again, I stress that it is important to <b>not delete</b> the actual page, since even when transwikiing, it is important to keep the edit history for <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">GFDL</a> compliance.</li>
<li>I have also added a section under the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Mixed_Drinks_Work_Area_7188.html#List_of_incubating_articles" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Mixed Drinks/Work Area">Wikipedia:WikiProject Mixed Drinks/Work Area#List of incubating articles</a> section for <a href="../../../h/o/t/User%7EHotspur23_6190.html" title="User:Hotspur23">Hotspur23</a> and anyone else interested, to start developing an article that will serve the needs of Absinthe aficionados, while also meeting Wikipedia's editorial guidelines. I feel the new article is necessary since the topic is largely ignored in the <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absinthe.html" title="Absinthe">Absinthe</a> article, and yet it is a large part of the Absinthe culture. If possible, I would also request that other Absinthe related articles not be deleted at least through the end of February so we can easily refer to them and merge them as necessary into the developing article or Wikibooks. Thanks. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillscrlt_a1d7.html" title="User:Willscrlt"><font color="#C71585" face="Tahoma"><b>Willscrlt</b></font></a>&#160;<small>(<font color="#4169E1" face="Tahoma"><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillscrlt_ad5a.html" title="User talk:Willscrlt"><b>T</b>alk</a>Â·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Willscrlt_ad85.html" title="Special:Contributions/Willscrlt"><b>C</b>ntrb</a></font>)</small> 11:49, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
