<dd>That's amusing, although one has to wonder why it was thought necessary to do it in the first place. Additionally, it's not a matter of two sides, but a contunuum, I think. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 22:45, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree about the continuum thing. Most Republicans don't agree with everything Bush says or does, and never have. Diddo for Democrats and their candidates. Of course, Republicans tend not to talk about this because they agree with him more than John Kerry (although they have been agreeing with Bush less and less lately). Many foreigners need to understand that we have a two-party system, so in elections, we have to compromise a great deal. I like the Democrat's social policies, but dislike their weak-kneed approach to foreign policy. Of course, there are certain policies that are an exception to my general tendencies.
<p>As for vote stealing, technically the Supreme Court fixed the election--not Bush--although the vote was already very close and many people didn't care who won (and thus didn't vote).--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 23:11, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all, let me make it clear that I do not condone SPAMing for "votes". However, the fact that legitimate editors were asked to participate should not negate their "votes". As long as they are legitimate established editors (not anonymous users or obvious sockpuppets), their opinion regarding this matter is no less valid because they were made aware of the AfD. In fact, how better to reach a consensus of editors. A page entitled "Bush Crimes Commission" is only going to attract a certain kind of editor. How else are other editors supposed to be made aware of the dispute except for those, such as myself, that actively monitor the AfD page. Nevertheless, it seems to be contrary to current WP guidelines so I will not participate in nor condone it, but ethically, I see nothing wrong with it. Isn't one of the planks of liberalism 100% voter participation and "getting out the vote" anyway? I find it ironic that you are advocating supressing "votes" simply because they were made aware of the proceedings by one of the participants. BTW, I'm still logged in....why aren't you?--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">WilliamThweatt</a> 00:20, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I find it ironic that I've said nothing political at all aside from giving the names of the two templates being used to recruit voters, yet you feel the need to label me anyway, it's disturbing any time someone recruits 50+ people to delete an article. The reason <i>you</i> seem to be uncomfortable talking to me is because I <b>don't</b> have a user page, or a talk page, or a big colorful page full of tags telling you what my opinion on <i>xyz</i> issue is, you're not sure how you're supposed to respond to me without a userbox to tell you how--<a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.8.html" title="User:205.188.116.8">205.188.116.8</a> 00:27, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I find it interesting that you see this as a numbers game (100% voter participation) This is really a discussion. The only reason we highlight is to get across the gist of what we say after that, thats why plain Delete votes will not be regarded as someone trying to make up their mind about the article. Being made aware of an <i>invitation</i> to vote, which is a fictional concept, is definitely unethical in my view. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorton_devonshire_9599.html" title="User:Morton devonshire">Morton</a> has nothing better to do then to fish for votes on this thing, he even rues the fact that some aren't voting the way he thought they would <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bubba73&amp;diff=48198801&amp;oldid=48167217" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bubba73&amp;diff=48198801&amp;oldid=48167217" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which shows how much of a joke he thinks the process is. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#009000;">e</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User_talk%7EAnsell_90fe.html" title="User talk:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">ll</span></a> 00:28, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please note that I always put "vote" in quotes. I'm well aware that this is not a numbers game and have even pointed out to others that this technically is not a vote. I was, however, drawing an analogy to demonstrate a point which was unfortunately, but not suprisingly, lost on the intended anonymous user.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">WilliamThweatt</a> 00:40, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Actually, is there any "don't like Bush" template (I've seen a few different ones) that is actually an official userbox? I think they're all userfied, and thus only indirectly linked from the image; one would have to click on all the links to see if it is to a pro- or anti-Bush userfied template. The right wing conspiracy one is a userbox that links all the users. However, I've no objection to userboxes if they're not abused; if they are abused, I think the abuse should be dealt with, not the userboxes. To paraphrase a popular slogan of the right, userboxes don't vote stack, people vote stack.</dd>
<dd>I don't think that someone's recommendation should be discounted if their participation is solicited, though I would prefer that the user admit if that happened in their comment, and that the closing admin give some consideration to the fact that it occurred. I think there are both keep and delete recommendations in this discussion that should be disregarded: ones that do not articulate a valid reason for keeping or deletion and those that don't give any reason at all.</dd>
<dd>As for solicitation of participation, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#AfD_etiquette" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion#AfD_etiquette</a> notes acceptable ways of notifying people. I don't like the idea of pro-deletion people notifying only people likely to recommend delete or pro-keep people notifying only people likely to recommend keep. I think it's much more honorable to do notifications likely to reach people who can articulate valid reasons for any action regardless of what position they may take. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 01:25, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
