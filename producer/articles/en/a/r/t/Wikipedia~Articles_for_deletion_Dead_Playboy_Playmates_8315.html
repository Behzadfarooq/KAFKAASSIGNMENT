<dd>It's clearly both WP:RS and WP:V. The detailed information should be in the articles of the playmates. And if you use WP:NOT, you should specify which point precisely in the rather extensive list you think it fails.

<li><b>Comment</b> - only if there is some verifiable reason why being a Playmate makes one more apt to die. Fact is the first Playmates are now in their 60s and 70s; nature is going to take its course eventually anyway; there isn't anything particularly notable about the fact members of a certain group die over time. If this list were of Playmates who were murdered,, that would be a different story, and probably a very short list. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:47, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Lists serve important indexing functions and partially alleviate one of the major bottlenecks in the operation: the search function. A list of dead Playboy playmates answers questions that readers might be interested in: you have a group of young women famous chiefly for being attractive, but some have come to natural or unexpected deaths; who are they? - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:34, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think you may be assuming too much of people's use of wikipedia - do you really think a lot of people will search for this term?

<li>You know, your argument isn't very convincing. (Not least because you're not making one as to why it's indiscriminate. Just claiming it is so doesn't really convince me.). Anyway, I think it's pretty clear that Death itself is notable, and it's a given that it's going to be included in any article about a person, or group of people. Playboy Playmates also have some degree of notability as well. Thus I don't see any reason why one would have to show in particular that any given group that is notable has to show anything about its deaths to include the information. That said, a quick look has shown me at least 2 movies/tv specials on Playmate deaths. I suspect ANS will spawn at least one as well. Thus I'd say there's enough interest in the subject of some Playmate's deaths to give it at least some coverage. I just wouldn't say this article is the right way to go about it. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 07:11, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think I've ever said that their deaths should not be mentioned on Wikipedia. Their deaths should be mentioned in the articles about the individual people. That's obvious. What's not obvious is why there should be a separate article discussing this. There's nothing underneath this article, it's original research to say that there's something important about this intersection between dead people and Playmates. The reason it's indiscriminate is that it's just a list of women in a particular profession who are dead. What on Earth is notable about that? Nothing. Why should it have an article? —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 09:45, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>In any group of reasonable specificity, listing the basic biographical facts of their lives is a given, even if it's just the dates of their birth and death. Adding the cause of death is not an especially large change, and can be found on many pages already. Sometimes it's even a page of its own. See the Presidents page I already mentioned, or this one <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monarchs_of_the_British_Isles_by_cause_of_death_a19d.html" title="List of monarchs of the British Isles by cause of death">List of monarchs of the British Isles by cause of death</a> among others. I'm not saying that is the route I'd go here, but I don't know why you're quibbling about interest, as I said, I found several movies/tv specials about Playmate deaths. Did you miss that part of my reply? I do think mentioning that <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorothy_Stratton_5772.html" title="Dorothy Stratton">Dorothy Stratton</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claudia_Jennings_7d79.html" title="Claudia Jennings">Claudia Jennings</a> and any other Playmates whose death has lead to such interest should be covered. Might even include <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Monroe_4162.html" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> in the list, though she was known for other things so maybe not. Now I'm not saying that this article is the way I'd do it.
