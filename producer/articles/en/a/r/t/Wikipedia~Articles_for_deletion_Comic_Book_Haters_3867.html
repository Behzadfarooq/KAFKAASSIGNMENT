Come on- deleting a legitimate comment about your policies? A little Hitleresque, don't you think?</p>
<p>Anyway, my point is that this entry is just as legitimate as many of the other entries on wikipedia. I figured you, as a self appointed protector of the Internet, would agree.

<dd>Brian- I appreciate the fact that your heart is in the right place, but I think you may be in a bit over your head. You make an exceptional amount of grammatical errors in just about every posting, and as such really shouldn't consider yourself an appropriate editor of others' work. For example, you misued the word 'There' in your above comment. That's ninth grade English stuff, buddy! On your personal wiki-page, you said <b>I am an Deletionist.</b> Read that sentence aloud to yourself, and then tell me if it makes sense as written. You start your entry off with the following statement: <b>I am have a college degree in Computer Network Administration.</b> That one is almost laughable! Read that aloud as well, and see what you think. I stopped reading after that one. If you want someone to take your thoughts seriously, take a little extra time to carefully write them out beforehand. You'll notice a world of change awaits you!</dd>
<dd>I suggest you brush up on your basic writing skills, take a month or so off from Wikipedia, and then come back fully recharged. You'll thank me for it later. Hang in there, pal; it'll get easier as time goes by! Don't think we don't appreciate your efforts! -DJ Sloofus

<li><b>Keep</b>: By all means, keep. The only thing I hate more then police brutality or fat free mayonnaise is unnecessary Wikipedia deletion. It's the book burning of the 21st Century. Though it lacks the huge pile of smoldering books and empty cans of kerosene found at most book burnings, it still involves the act of withholding information from others. Only a lot less smoke and your clothes don't stink so much afterwards. If we are to delete the entry for The Comic Book Haters, what's next? <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>? <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>? No thanks! I find the timing of all this to be more then a little ironic. I have recently gone back to school to earn my GED and I was thinking of writing a term paper on the history of The Comic Book Haters. I wanted to concentrate my paper on the early years. The only problem was where to turn to for my information? Ask Jeeves?

<li>A few things to keep in mind:
<ol>
<li>We're not nuking <i>facts</i>, we're determining <i>whether or not the subject of the article is notable enough for inclusion in an article of its own</i>. Suppose I wrote a book about wikilawyering. I'm not notable enough for an article of its own. My book wouldn't be, probably. But an article about various aspects of wikicommunities might have a factoid that reads "Newbies often use repeated, outlandish proposals, often failing to convince the established members of the community. For example, User:Wwwwolf wrote a book "Wikilawyer for Hire" (2008, O'Ridley &amp; Patrons), where he states (pp. 42-43) that melodramatic polemic is 'the oldest trick ever in Wikipedia AfD debates' and won't win you any friends." See? Facts can exist even when they don't have articles of their own. Ergo, comparing this to book burning is slightly silly at least.</li>
<li>We're not a publisher of original information, it says so in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">policy</a>. We're not a free webhost either, so says the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">policy too</a>. If the history of the website in question is available <i>here</i> but not on the site in question (or some other website that has researched the background of the site), then that's kind of backwards. We're supposed to cite someone who can present us pre-chewed pieces of information, and condense that to something that tells the uninformed people with one glance on what this stuff is about.</li>
<li>A hint: teachers hate it when you only cite encyclopedias. (If they don't, change school ASAP.) You probably want to cite something else. Like the <i>actual website you're writing about</i>. We're not here to do anyone's school work for them, you know.</li>

<li>I realize you have better things to do such as constructing a bonfire of copies of <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i>, so I will try to be short. What you are trying to do is to stifle the flow of information. The very fact that you refer to the act as "<b>nuking</b>" tells me that you equate it to be on par with something overly masculine. That you will in a sense show how powerful you are by deleting a Wikipedia entry. I say don't do it. Instead, try to do something that would truly demonstrate your manliness. Go lift some weights. Attempt to kiss a pretty girl. Bend a piece of metal. Chop down a big tree. Do something - anything - instead of deleting a Wikipedia entry. Also, on a personal note. I have made it a point to never trust anyone that uses the word "ergo" in a sentence. It's up there with never trusting someone that wears plaid pants or someone that listens to jazz. It's a rule that has served me well. RickRottman 19:22, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Rick, none of your arguements are going to sway this AfD. You are making personal attacks and are not being civil at all, while making completly silly statements that have nothing to do with refuting the questions posed against this article. A rule that serves me well is "deal with the serious, then deal with the silly". You wish the article to stay but in no way provide anything to refute the statements that it fails two out of three pillars of the Wikipedia standard for articles: <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I believe you know that this article fails them, will be deleted in the next day or so, and are now just having a bit of fun. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 14:03, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Do we need the humor link again, Brian? I think we went there already. I think the self-appointed wikipedia "guardians" need to loosen their sphincters. Not too loose. Not enough to turtle-head or anything. Just enough to stop being so damn annoying. Are your day jobs so frustrating that you come here to unload? Try a bar. Or maybe a girl. Whatever. But you aren't actually making sensible arguments yourselves. Have you seen the <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_and_the_Girl_44e7.html" title="Keith and the Girl">Keith and the Girl</a> page? Or any of the other podcast articles? So YOU are the judge of whether something is "worthy" enough to put on Wikipedia? That's really a shame. Participatory culture will never become viable as long as there are people like you guys putting up roadblocks. Conrgats on killing the medium.- A Concerned CBH Fan

<li>Okay, now that you've seen <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Cite sources</a>, let's discuss <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Reliable sources</a>. Regrettably, "2 CBH fans on some damn forum or other" would be more than a bit weak as a source - demonstrates lack of depth ("2 CBH fans") and source of questionable worth ("some damn forum or other"). Forum posts <i>specifically</i> aren't reliable primary/secondary sources (unless they demonstrably are from people involved in the subject, for example, official developer comments on official forum of some production). "Somebody put CBH up on some other pod thingy or other" also demonstrates one small problem: If it's a source that anyone can set up, it's weak. Everyone can spam, not just bots. <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Bagge_05fa.html" title="Peter Bagge">Peter Bagge</a> page demonstrates <i>exactly</i> what I was saying above: <i>You</i> don't need to be notable in itself to be considered a source or be worthy of an external link.
