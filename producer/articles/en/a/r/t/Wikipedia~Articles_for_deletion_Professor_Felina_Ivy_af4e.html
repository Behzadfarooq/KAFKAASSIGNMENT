Looking at <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_%28anime%29.html#Other_characters" title="Pokémon (anime)">Pokémon (anime)#Other_characters</a> it appears that this article has been broken out of a section in a larger article in accordance with <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_writing_better_articles_3c0a.html#Articles_covering_subtopics" title="Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles">Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles#Articles_covering_subtopics</a>, and that other, more minor, characters have been kept in the list in the main article.

<li>Interesting. Would this then imply that if there were enough granular detail about any given subject, such that it would make a main topic article too large, it would then become worthy of inclusion on Wikipedia because the subtopic overshadows the parent article? No matter if it is completely unencyclopedic? GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 23:04, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Well-written article on a subject of great interest to a substantial number of people. Another demonstration that the 'Google test' may be great at providing evidence for a <i>keep</i> vote, but it is absolutely useless as substantiation for a <i>delete</i> vote. The reason is simple: Many encyclopedic subjects are not well-represented on the web. And while it's easy to check when Google gives a false positive by providing unrelated hits, there is no easy way of checking these false negatives. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 23:47, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you trying to tell me that the google test is flawed here because Pokemon characters are not well represented on the web? A search for "pokemon" and "character" gets 533 thousand hits. If this was a significant character, surely she'd get more than 38. <b>Delete</b>, or failing that <b>Merge</b>. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 01:10, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: Nope, I'm trying to tell you that <i>this</i> character <i>may</i> not be well represented, but that's <b>not</b> why I claim the Google test has limits, nor do I claim that the Google test is <i>flawed</i>. It's just misapplied. No change of vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 01:20, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think the google test can be misused both ways, depending on the subject. The subject matter is key, and is often overlooked by those who think it's all in the numbers. It's easy for many unencyclopedic things to get a substantial number of google hits, through self promotion, having names in common, as well as various things that exist <i>only</i> on the internet, hence displaying <i>all</i> references to a subject, rather than what is generally thought to be a mere sample from which one can extrapolate. Likewise many subjects are not well represented on the internet, mostly things that predated the internet and have not seen widespread discussion since its advent. Holding, say, minor historic figues of antiquity to the same significant google results as, say, porn stars, is ridiculous. The google test has its limits. Severe ones. And one must keep in mind not only the number of hits, but what the hits actually are. I've come across many pages that had no apparent mention of the subject I was searching for, and this must be taken into account. I will say this, however: something that turns up 0 google hits is very unlikely to be notable enough for an encyclopedia, and, is somewhat unlikely to exist. Of course, they may be exceptions to this too. My point is false positives and false negatives are both common, and anyone who thinks <i>any</i> Pokemon character is underrepresented on the web is delusional. My vote is below. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:58, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>My apologies. I didn't mean for it to be a personal attack. But I do maintain that one subject that is not underrepresented on the web in any form is Pokemon. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 21:07, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)
