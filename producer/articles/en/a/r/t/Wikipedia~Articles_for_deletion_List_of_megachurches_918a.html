<li><b>Comment</b> #1 - in response to <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Yukichigai</a>, if the people can't "find elsewhere", the church would not be "notable" and therefore should not be included in this list. And, if it's a "megachurch", wouldn't part of the definition be that there would be lots of information readily available? And in the same line as <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a>, there is already a category for those that have their own articles. #2 - Again, just doing a quick survey of numbers (the bottom #of this list in the 2000's for attendance/membership (again, it's not delineated) I could easily include 100 Catholic Churches from CA (USA) alone; multiply that by 50 states, and I've immediately added 5000 churches to this list! <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH">SkierRMH</a> 20:51, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yep, to be honest I wasn't aware of <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a> and very possibly development lists were not envisaged by the authors of <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-L_d1af.html" title="WP:MOS-L">WP:MOS-L</a>. Reading <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a> there is a commendably strong emphasis on sourcing - if we are to have red links they must have reliable third-party sources.

I said it some rows above: it would be like the list of world's biggest stadiums (which is undoubtedly useful and has every right to stay in wikipedia, as I think everybody of you will agree) or the list of world's tallest person.

<p>One I added a great deal to this list by searching for third party or verified info, some were easier than others. I live in Louisville, Ky. so obviously I added a great deal to this area. That is part of the issue here consistency. Louisville, Ky. does NOT have the most mega-churches per capita ... I mean we could but I have no way of knowing that. By looking at the list it would seem that we have proportionally more mega-churches than other cities. These are issues. This is a list. Is it as important as the article "megachuches"&#160;? No and in some ways yes. Merging this list with the article would make the article too long. However this is an interesting research tool -- if I'm correct that would be encyclopedic (in essence). What you get by looking at the list here is something that you don't get from the article. You see how diverse this cultural phenomenon is. Look at the diversity of denominations, geography, etc. you SEE more from the list than you do in the article. Admittedly I know there are a lot of "red" links in the text. But there are also a lot of external links (I know because I looked a great deal of them up). These links combined with a list create an interactive research tool that honestly exists nowhere else. You want to read about the mega churches fine here's a list including a link to their websites read for your self, see the similarities and differences. Most of these sites have an "about us" or "what we believe" section or news; any number of things that tell you more about the congregation. These links are not provided on the Hartford site. This is where you find diversity and this is where you have a tool for knowledge and research. YES this article or list needs some clean up, ok a LOT of clean up. I'd argue format first and foremost, along with set criterion and verifiability. The challenge is the list is growing and it's hard to verify them all. I mean some churches don't boast about their attendance you only find it buried in the church newsletter on the website. I think a solution would be a lock on the page. This would prevent someone just posting their church for recognition and in order to be added it has to go through the discuss page and meet a set format. I'd be happy (if I can be given a week or so) to go through and make the list uniform in format and I'll even research out the list as I go. I’m willing to step up and do it if and when something is decided. Format I think would work … Southeast Christian Church - Louisville - Dave Stone [66] [Attendance: 19,100]</p>
<p>Church name linked to internal site if none external – location – congregational leader – extrenal link if an internal article exists – attendance</p>
<p>This gives a source a set criteria (attendance avg weekly) and consistency. List by state or country and by church alphabeticly.</p>
<p>But I seriously think we need to keep this. Deletion gets rid of something that could be useful even if only to a small group, it is a research tool. Sorry for the length here but I kind of feel strongly about this. Thanks. <a href="../../../m/-/b/User%7EM-BMor_141b.html" title="User:M-BMor">M-BMor</a> 08:22, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> a useful development list (<a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a>, third type) and <b>cleanup</b> by eliminating the external links, because Wikipedia is not a directory of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#MIRROR" title="WP:NOT">weblinks</a>. Many/most megachurches are in fact notable by <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> standards - big things get talked and written about. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 20:50, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Unfortunately a category is not an appropriate choice in an instance like this where many of the entries are red links. The external links aren't needed, however; red links would be more appropriate to encourage creation of the articles. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 07:02, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>categorise</b> -- fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "Wikipedia articles are not... Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics" and "Wikipedia articles are not... Mere collections of external links." There's absolutely no WP content here beside the church name. If it's not a redlink, categorise it, since that's what categories are for. Do that and then wipe the page and you won't have lost a single byte of actual information. PS if "the information is not available elsewhere" then it shouldn't be here, since it'll fail <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> by default. <i>--<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">DeLarge</a> 17:33, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</i></li>
