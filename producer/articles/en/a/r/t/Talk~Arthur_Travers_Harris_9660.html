<p>To the person who keeps on inserting bits about Apartheid: the Apartheid regime started in 1948, Harris moved there in 1946. If you think he's a git, surely the carpet bombing of civilians (bad) suffices, over-egging the pudding by adding irrelevant associations with Apartheid (also bad, but not relevant here) does not help your argument. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 13:11, 6 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I removed the phrase about gas bombing. According to the sources I could find, while some gas was used by the British to suppress Iraqi insurgents, it was not air-dropped, as it could not be done effectively. Use of gas was produced through shelling. SpeakerFTD 14:50, 6 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Rewrote the second sentence of the last paragraph to clarify it and to remove to obvious anti-Harris POV. Here's the pre-revision last sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd>However, defenders of Harris claim that he was responding to the German policy of <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_war.html" title="Total war">total war</a>, declared <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> in the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> speech of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Goebbels_d1dd.html" title="Joseph Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a> (being a response to British mass bombardment of German cities started in 1942) and the German use of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_bombing.html" title="Strategic bombing">strategic bombing</a> against <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guernica.html" title="Guernica">Guernica</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a> (being a response of British bombing of Iraqi tribes in 1932), and later in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blitz_2aa3.html" title="The Blitz">the Blitz</a> pre-dated the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies.html" title="Allies">Allied</a> use.</dd>

The sentence about the majority of the British agreeing with some large quote was clearly not neutral. Most British for sure have never heard of that quote. It is not encyclopedia style to use long quotes rather than concise descriptions. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 12:54, 16 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most of the British who went to the cinema during World War II (which was a large part of the population) would have seen it because it was carried as a news item with him sitting at a table reading it as part of a speech. There was a strong feeling in the war that after the blitz that the Germans should get the same treatment. I think it is an appropriate quote because it sums up the thinking of many people in the UK during the war particularly until late 1944 and the end of the V1 and V2 attacks on the UK. I think that the quote is appropriate because it is an interesting read, It is the text equivalent of a picture and is best thought of as a <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sound_bite.html" title="Sound bite">sound bite</a>. It sums up why so few in Britain at the time thought of area bombing by the British as a war crime and having got their retaliation in, did not wish to hang every German who dropped a bomb on a british terrace. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 20:38, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do you have any opinion poll supporting this or is this just your impression and interpretation? As we both know the answer, I insist a more concise and neutral paragraph is needed in case we want to include the subtopic. As for the other edits you made, killing civilians was already defined as a war crime, so it is misleading to specify that "by modern standards" the bombings were war crimes. Furthermore, the information you added about the government having told him to start the bombings is already implicit in the text before and therefore redundant. You may note that the excuse of "I only executed orders, it was not my fault" was exactly what the Nazi war criminals claimed in Nurmenberg, without any success, as it is obvious that a war crime or a crime against humanity cannot be justified with orders, every individual has its own responsibility. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 15:20, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are nit picking. I added the paragraph on <i>Professor Lindemann</i> and the Cabinet, precisely because if Harris committed a war crime he did so implementing an agreed cabinate policy. Under the UK system of Government this means that all the members of the cabinate are as guilty as he was as all cabinate decisions are always unimous and binding on members. And so, it would follow, were all the members of RAF bomber command. Why single him out? I personally do not think that RAF bomber command committed a war crime and as there was never a trial, all one can have on the issue is personal point of view. So any mention of the subject of Harris being a war criminal in the article on Harris is POV.</p>
<p>I can not prove that the majority of British people agreed with Harris's statment, (<i>although pound for a penny they did, and I do not have access to any WWII surveys which indicate that most agreed with bombing German Cities ), so I will rephrase the sentence which introduces the quote to annoy you less. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 17:15, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I appreciate your edits and am not annoyed at all. I furthermore completely agree that we cannot call him a war criminal as there was no trial. It is however important to mention that the intended killing of civilians was a war crime as this is the main point why there is such a debate about the person. And yes I do think that the whole cabinet was guilty of that crime, as are all governments since who engaged and still engage in deliberate bombings of civilians. Unfortunately they usually get away with it. At least nowadays most governments have signed the ICC treaty and it is theoretically possible to trie them at The Hague. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 17:46, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg_Trials_3d43.html" title="Nuremberg Trials">Nuremberg Trials</a> were restricted to Nazi crimes, so it was impossible to try Harris and others there. It can be criticized that acts the Allies had committed, too, like the deliberate mass killing of civilians were not tried. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 22:40, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I prefer the version</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Although international law defined the targeting of civilians as a <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crime.html" title="War crime">war crime</a>, the bombings ordered by Harris and similar acts were never tried, which some see as an event of <i><a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor%27s_justice.html" title="Victor's justice">victor's justice</a></i>. The <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg_Trials_3d43.html" title="Nuremberg Trials">Nuremberg Trials</a> (Predecessor of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Criminal_Court_154c.html" title="International Criminal Court">International Criminal Court</a>) were restricted to crimes of the European Axis by the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Charter_62c9.html" title="London Charter">London Charter</a>.

</dl>
<p>over</p>
<dl>
<dd>"As no Axis personnel were tried at the post-war <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg_Trials_3d43.html" title="Nuremberg Trials">Nuremberg Trials</a> for <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crime.html" title="War crime">war crimes</a> for participating in the decisions on, or execution of, assault by aerial bombardment on defended enemy territory, it is not possible to say that that aerial bombardment on defended enemy territory during World War II was a war crime. However some people think that if Harris had been tried in a court authorised to try such a case, he might have been found guilt of war crimes."</dd>
</dl>
<p>because a comment like "as there was no trial we do not know if it was a crime" is redundant. The reader knows that anyway. If the Nuremberg Trials are mentioned it must be mentioned that they were restricted to crimes of the Axis and thus did not apply fot Harris anyways. "some people think that if Harris had been tried in a court authorised to try such a case, he might have been found guilt of war crimes." is just speculation (and has a typo). What is relevant are facts, like the fact that targeting of civilians was defined as a <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crime.html" title="War crime">war crime</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 16:04, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Athough international law defined the targeting of civilians as a war crime, the bombings ordered by Harris and similar acts were never tried</i></p>
<ol>
<li>Which treaty that the British had signed <b>before 1945</b> said that targeting civilians was a war crime?</li>
<li>What is the evidence that the RAF targeted civilians?</li>
<li>Given the parameters of Hague 25,26,27 which airforce in World War II broke its treaty obligations?</li>

<dl>
<dd>1) No such treaty exists it seems. The fourth geneva convention was signed in 1949. Previous treaties did not cover this situation. Civilians, were probably a legitimate military target at the time. See below however.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>GCIV would not apply even today because it covers civilians <i>in the hands of an enemy</i> not those behind their own lines.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) the fire bombings of Dresden and also Tokyo were specifically designed to channel civilians to areas where they would be killed. My source is an interview with <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_McNamara_73fb.html" title="Robert McNamara">Robert McNamara</a> I saw on television on <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> world. It comes from the film The Fog of War <a href="http://pastemagazine.com/action/article?article_id=487" class="external autonumber" title="http://pastemagazine.com/action/article?article_id=487" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In the article which you have supplied unfortunatly does not say why he thinks that American commands were war criminals. As I have not seen the program you have me at a disadvantage. He was so low down the food chain in WWII that he is saying that any American officer involved with bombers was a war criminal. A lot of them would dispute this, without a court case one can not say that he was correct. Was he working in Asia or Europe. If Asia how does he know what was done at Dresden (or vic versa)? Also I am not sure how the Americans could channel civilians to areas where they would be killed in Dresden (a) as the British caused the firstorm before the Americans bombed (b) the Americans said that they aimed their bombss the railway yards not the town (althought how they could see anyting whith optical sites throught the smoke from the fires is beyond me).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) All air forces of countries which had non agression pacts and started the war (guess who) Probably anybody who bombed a hospital (see below).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand what you mean by "non agression pacts" and the influence they had on the use of air forces apart for planning a war of aggression. Which only applies to countries in WWII which started a war of agression and had signed the <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kellogg-Briand_Pact_04d9.html" title="Kellogg-Briand Pact">Kellogg-Briand Pact</a>. As any military worth its pay has a contingency plan for any situation...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4) it might be much better to say something like "Harris committed acts which should nowadays be seen as war crimes, in their era they were rather standard and nothing worth mentioning compared to, for example what was done to <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw.html" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>". However, I'm not even sure that after <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> and other more recent acts we can claim that <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpet_bombing.html" title="Carpet bombing">carpet bombing</a> is even considered a war crime nowadays.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But in all ages there are things which if done today we would call a war crime. Just look at how seige warfare was conducted until recently. "If you don't surrender and we get it you are all dead. Now do you want to surrender" etc. That is definatly a war crime by todays laws and so nearly all besigers up to the latter part of the 1800s would be a war crime by todays laws (Hague art 23 <i>To declare that no quarter will be given</i>) and GCIII(?);. It does not get us anywhere. If they acted within the law of their day then nothing is gained by saying it would have been a crime today.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Looking through the treaties, it's kind of possible to take a number of sections and apply them to what Harris did.</p>
<p>Hague IV / Art. 23.</p>
<p>"...it is especially forbidden - To employ arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering;</p>
<p>the whole of Art. 27.</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p>Also his attacks would have included the destruction of marked hospitals etc. Do you believe that these don't apply? <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozzerati_67af.html" title="User:Mozzerati">Mozzerati</a> 22:46, 2004 Nov 9 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So we are clear lets use <i>Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague IV); October 18, 1907</i><a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague04.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague04.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The reason I used the specific words that I did "<i>assault by aerial bombardment on defended enemy territory</i>" is because articles 25,26,27 cover it for all countries which used arial bombardment.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>25 <i>The attack or bombardment, by whatever means, of towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings which are undefended is prohibited.</i></li>
<li>26 <i>The officer in command of an attacking force must, before commencing a bombardment, except in cases of assault, do all in his power to warn the authorities.</i></li>
<li>27 <i>In sieges and bombardments all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the sick and wounded are collected, provided they are not being used at the time for military purposes.</i></li>
<li>It was a bombardment of defended towns.</li>
<li>It was an arial <b>assault</b> so no warning need be given.</li>
<li><i>All necessary steps <b>as far as possible</b></i> were taken. We could argue the point whether "all necessary steps as far as possible were taken" but that is exactly what would have been argued in court. As for <i>Article 23</i> the clause you have presented would not fly because the arms and projectiles used explosives and incendiary materials which are acceptable under common usage of war and have been used for centuries. A better clause would be <i>To destroy or seize the enemy's property, unless such destruction or seizure be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war;</i> In the case of the British, it had been decided at Cabinet level, that the destruction was "<i>a necessity of war</i>" and they were not targeting civilians only their property... This would have kept the lawyers busy for years, as it has academics.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Without a court case one can only have an POV on the issue which is why statments like "<i>Athough international law defined the targeting of civilians as a war crime</i>" should not be used because it imples that the law at the time was clear cut, that targeting civilians was a war crime. This may or may not be true, but no one has yet shown me a treaty which says it was. But even if it was the airforces of the war would have argued that they were not targeting civilians but their property. Is reckless endangerment a war crime? I have no idea. Was it a war crime in WWII? I have no idea. Was targeting enemy property by "<i>assault by aerial bombardment on defended enemy territory</i>" a war crime in WWII? I think not, but Get-back-world-respect is sure that it is. Without a court case we will never know who is right. This should be reflected in what is written on the article page. I have tried to find a wording which highlights this, but it is difficult to please people who are SURE that a crime was committed. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 01:59, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As there are documents proving that the bombers were ordered to target civilian housing and strafe those who wanted to help you cannot call it "defended territory". An encyclopedia cannot aim at interpreting the law but has to present the facts. Fact is that there is a dispute over whether the bombing was a war crime or a crime against humanity. Particular articles of the Hague convention are interesting but not discussed prominently enough to mention them in an encyclopedia. I think that as no one publicly argues that Harris should have been placed at Nuremberg next to Nazi criminals it would not even have to be mentioned here. The reason why it is mentioned is only that the Nazis were not tried for the same acts either. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 11:55, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>The British did not give orders to strafe anything during the Dresden raid. (I assume Americans would have been told to strafe enemy military vehicles in attacks like the one which got Rommel, but I don't know that. I would assume that targeting civilian enemy vehicles would come under the same defence as targeting houses. But we are talking about the Harris who was a Brit).</li>
<li>Germany was defended on the ground and against arial attack. How can you possibly say that it was not? The loss of life in Allied bombing crews over Germany particularly east Germany was very high. If Dresden was not defended what shot down the British planes lost on that specific raid? In the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Berlin_%28air%29_86c7.html" title="Battle of Berlin (air)">Battle of Berlin (air)</a> the RAF suffered such a high attrition rate the battle was called off.</li>
</ol>
<p>You wrote "I think that as no one publicly argues that Harris should have been placed at Nuremberg next to Nazi criminals". Well we agree on that then. I am not suggesting that Harris should have been put on trial. What I am stating on the page is that no Germans was put on trial for <i>assault by aerial bombardment on defended enemy territory</i>" so as no one was tried for the alleged crime, we can not say that it was a war crime (or a crime against humanity).</p>
<p>You keep writing "Although international law defined the targeting of civilians as a war crime":</p>
<ul>
<li>Which international law, in force before 1945 defined targeting of civilans as a war crime?</li>
<li>Where is the evidence that the RAF targeted civilians?</li>
<li>Where is the evidence that targeting civilian property was a war crime?</li>

<p>He was also exected for treason, which if it were true (and it clearly was not), then anyone he had killed would have been murderd. I don't think it is not a good example. If you had asked me 6 months ago "was the killing of any enemy civilians behind enemy lines against the laws and customs of war", I would have answered yes I think so. I am not convinced that it is not. But I have not seen a reference to a treaty or an international court case which state that it is.

<dd>The victors never stand trial, regardless of treaties. But law, national or international, is not exclusively made by statute and treaty. The opinion of humanity is more important. Statutes and treaties are made by the powerful and enforced against the weak. All courts are kangaroo courts in as much as they enforce the will of the powerful against the weak. Hitler and Stalin had courts and judges quite willing to render judgement acceptable to their masters. So do all countries.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In my way of thinking, when a person is deliberately killed a murder has been done. It matters not at all to me whether the killing was done by an individual, a group, a state, a nation, a court, an army. The only exceptions can be defense against an immediate threat to oneself or another, or to save one person in a case where otherwise two or more would die.</dd>

<p>I object to the whole statement, because if Harris committed a war crime, then so did his superiors who issued the RAF Bomber Command directives, (If they had thought that Harris was ignoring their directives then they would have replaced him), the other men of Bomber Command who took part in the raids, and all of the British Cabinet who authorised and initaiated area bombing. Unless there is a reliable source which states that Harris ordered an act which is a war crime and was outside the scope of the RAF Bomber Command directives, then the statement is not something which should be included in an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>BTW no national or international court tried any member of the Axis armed forces for particpating in or ordering area bombing, so it is unlikly that it was seen as a war crime at the time. This is not just a case of victors justice because, unrestricted submarine warfare for which Dönitz was found guilty although the same methods were used by the Allies.

<dd>In examining these events [aerial area bombardment] in the light of international humanitarian law, it should be borne in mind that during the Second World War there was no agreement, treaty, convention or any other instrument governing the protection of the civilian population or civilian property, as the Conventions then in force dealt only with the protection of the wounded and the sick on the battlefield and in naval warfare, hospital ships, the laws and customs of war and the protection of prisoners of war.<a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList200/42F64C9A4212EA07C1256B66005C0BF1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList200/42F64C9A4212EA07C1256B66005C0BF1" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>

<p>Alot of the argument on here fails to recognise the context under which area bombing was first adopted as an Allied strategy. RAF surveys in 1941 showed less than one bomb in ten was dropped at night within 10 miles of its target. It was Churchill's executive decision to continue night bombing during the mid-war years as the only way at the time the Allies could hit back directly at Nazi Germany.As the RAF's accuracy could not improve until electronic aids were developed in 1944/45 the only thing they could bomb with any certainty of hitting was cities - and big ones at that. Harris -as Bomber Command head- could only utilise the means at his disposal to comply to Churchill's objective. Despite comments to the contrary Harris was never totally obsessed with area bombing; he only saw it as the most appropriate means to an end- the defeat of the enemy. When feasible precision pin-point attacks were made by day and night (as in the Dams raids, 2 group mosquito operations, etc) As for targeting civilians, thats a whole new theological argument; for when does a weapon of war -like a tank- become a legitimate target? On the front line? in the factory? etc, etc. (Harryurz 20:25, 4 February 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>As Churchill himself wrote, area bombing became a practice used for the sake of terrorizing the civilian population. Terrorizing civilians is one of the many crimes the Nazis had started, and even if you disagree about this, you cannot deny that a notable number of people see it as a war crime or crime against humanity. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 22:02, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed "controversial" does not need to be doubled. Being controversial is however euphemist for an alleged war criminal. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 23:27, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>GBWR You may think "<i>controversial is however euphemist for an alleged war criminal</i>" but it ain't necessarily so: It is possible that his actions were controversial, for the reason given that not all in the Allied high command thought it as effective as going after oil. His acceptance of high rates of RAF casualties in the Battle of Berlin is also controversial. His views were also controversial for moral (not criminal) reasons. For example adultery is not a criminal offence but it is not something that politicians in the English speaking world like to admit to doing. The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/harris_sir_arthur_bomber.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/harris_sir_arthur_bomber.shtml" rel="nofollow">BBC source</a> you gave earlier in this section says this: "<i>But the debate about the morality - and indeed efficacy - of the bombing raids was already under way in the closing stages of the war</i>". It was not his strategy, he implemented the strategy so if you wish to state that bombing was a war crime or a crime against humanity then you need to provide sources, not just private opinions (were it is often used as a moral judgement not a legal one), but references to legal arguments that bombing was a crime during World War II just as this one, published in the International Review of the Red Cross, says that it was not:</p>

<p>This phrase, if it is a quote, it needs to have a reference source relevant to the article context (an initial browse through google turns up the phrase in a nuclear war context), otherwise I think it should go - if its not a relevant quote that can be <i>specifically</i> attributed to Bomber Harris or Frederick Taylor or another relevant commentator, the phrase is non-encyclopedic (its colloquial and emotionally loaded), and may even be offensive. "Devastated", or if one prefers, "repeatedly devastated" should be sufficient to describe the destruction of the cities (unless one subscribes to the hyperinflation of descriptive language).

<dd>The attitudes and decisions of Arthur Harris need to be seen within the context of their time, rather than judged with decades of post-war prosperity hindsight. It is a common fallacy that area bombing was merely one of a range of options that Britain could have pursued against Nazi Germany. A review of possibilities shows that in fact, area bombing was the only action that Britain could take after Dunkirk and the Battle of Britain.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A naval blockade could have only limited effect against a predominantly continental power controlling resources from the Arctic to the Mediterranean. A land invasion was out of the question until sufficient trained, equipped men had been assembled in Britain, total air supremacy achieved and the Red Army had blunted the power of the great German Army. Given available capacity in troopships and freighters, it was always clear invasion could not happen until 1944 – and even that rested on Russia staying in the war and Germany not being able to bomb invasion forces gathering in England. Thus aerial attack was the only British option against Germany before 1944. It provided relief to the Russians, if it could be made effective, and prevented German bombing of Britain. There was no other option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Harris was not blindly devoted to night time area bombing. He did experiment with daylight raids, such as the famous attack on the MAN U-boat engine works in Augsburg on 17th April 1942. Seven of twelve Lancaster bombers were shot down. It was his observation that such raids cost the RAF great casualties for relatively little result against one factory. By comparison, night raids could seriously hamper production at scores of factories across a whole city. Damage to city infrastructure such as gas, water, electricity and public transport prolonged recovery of production. Contrary to popular impression, very high civilian deaths occurred only during a few specific raids. This was due to firestorm (Hamburg 1943, Dresden 1945) and/or congestion by refugees (Berlin, Dresden 1945). True firestorms occurred just twice in the entire bombing campaign. They were freak events; they were not planned. 99% of RAF bombing raids did not cause firestorms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The greater effectiveness of area bombing is illustrated by famous raids that took place in the summer of 1943. On the one hand, the American daylight raids against Schweinfurt ball-bearing plant and the Regensburg Messerschmitt plant. On the other hand, the Gomorrah raids by the RAF against Hamburg. The action by the Americans cost the USAF almost a hundred B17 bombers shot down, had limited effect on production at Regensburg and no lasting impact on ball-bearing availability. At such a rate of loss for trivial damage to the enemy, the Americans were not going to achieve very much. They abandoned deep raids into Germany until the P-51 Mustang was available in numbers in the spring of 1944. Even with fighter escort, the Americans failed to make precision bombing work, due to poor visibility. Their bombers operated as high as a modern jet airliner. Try to imagine bombing a little cluster of buildings from such a height, using an advanced, but still optical bombsight, whilst being assailed by nutters in cannon-firing fighters. The Americans also resorted to daylight area bombing, with tragic consequences for Berlin, as we shall see.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Gomorrah raid on Hamburg by the RAF was devastating – notoriously so, for a reason not anticipated by anybody. It was the first time in history that bombing created such extensive, intense fires that part of the city became a vast, forced-draft furnace. German loss of life was very high, perhaps 45,000 killed (about 2% of the city's population). But 90% of this loss was due to the firestorm. The economic consequences for Germany were also very high, with production across the city falling to near zero and the population fleeing to the countryside. Nazi rule broke down for several days. Hermann Goering was openly jeered by Hamburgers when he toured the rubble. Factory attendances were still far below normal even two months after the raid. In effect, the raid removed the second city of Germany from the war economy, and recovery was prolonged. All this for the loss of about fifty RAF bombers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In short, Harris and his superiors (including Churchill, who ordered the 1945 Dresden raid) resorted to area bombing because it worked, and because they had no other means to attack Germany's war-making potential. What else were they to do? Nothing? When presented with an enemy as virulently criminal as Naziism?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that attacking civilians is criminal. This raises a basic moral dilemma that Harris's detractors have never addressed. The only option available to the Allies was to commit criminal attacks against civilians. Yet not to act against a criminal regime, when they had the means to do so, was out of the question. No one can be happy with what RAF Bomber Command did between 1942 and 1945, but would we be any happier had our leaders done nothing? Or wasted the RAF in a futile devotion to “decent” precision daylight bombing?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let us finish with an American raid on Berlin that is now forgotten. On 3rd Feb 1945 the USAF attacked Berlin in daylight but, anticipating poor visibility, an area bombing pattern was carried out. The city was crowded with refugees. More than 25,000 people died in that raid, yet to this day the USAF is considered to have fought a “clean” war against Germany. Two weeks later, 40,000 to 50,000 died at Dresden. This was the second great firestorm of the war. It occurred in mid winter, hardly conditions for such a ferocious reaction. The RAF attacked scores of other cities with a similar bombing mix, including wooden ones like Luebeck, without causing firestorms. It was a freak tragedy, following a decision made by exhausted minds, and it should be seen as such. Regrettably it was not seen as such. Although Churchill had ordered the raid, a few weeks later he sent his now-famous letter to Harris, in which he distanced himself from the bombing campaign that he had supported all along. This stands as one of the very few question marks against Churchill's integrity. It is plausible that Harris's reputation today would be as intact as that of Curtis LeMay, had Churchill not betrayed him.</dd>
