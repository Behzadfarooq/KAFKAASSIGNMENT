<p>Jym Dyer is a longtime internet personality who has written many articles found on the Internet and even more articles on Usemet.</p>
<p>In Usenet: Most notably, the Organisational moniker: The Naughty Peahen Party Lines.</p>
<p>Found in posts dating back as far as 1990 Jym was found in conversations relating to alt.tv.simpsons and in political forums relating to media.</p>
<p>Remarkably, it was the Naughty Peahen - Signature that provided much of the inspiration in UseNet at that time, and on the internet; with electronic mail to innovate the .signature file used on most Unix Systems posting news articles and emails. In some cases some email signatures were significantly larger than the emails being sent themselves.</p>
<p>But that was not due to Jym Dyer, it was only a byproduct of having a catchy (and innovative) Organisational entry.</p>

<p>Lutjanus griseus</p>
<p>Also known as Grey Snapper, Black Snapper, Mango Snapper, or Cabellerote</p>
<p>Size ranges from 2-6 pounds but many have biologists have now confirmed that a 29.5 pound snapper was speared off of the coast of Louisiana. The Mangrove snapper can be confused with Cubera snapper but they are typically much smaller than Cubera. The mangrove is very similar in appearance to Cubera snapper, and the two can only be distinguished by examining a patch of teeth on the inside roof of the mouth. Their color is greyish red, but it can change color from bright red to coppery red.</p>

The song is on their first album - the self-titled Gorillaz album - and is track number 4, between the two singles Tomorrow Comes Today and Clint Eastwood. New Genious is probably purposely spelt wrong to become an ironic use of the word "genius." It has a subtitle of "Brother," which appears to have been the song's original full name but now only appears in brackets after the song's real title on the album's back cover. The song, written by Damon Albarn, consists of the noise of pick-axes hitting rocks and a song characteristic of the type sung by hard labourers. This may be a reference to prisoners breaking rocks as a punishment, or just other physical labourers such as miners. The song's lyrics are meandering, senseless and yet slightly hypnotic. This is how the lyrics go:</p>

<p>A <b>Frontal Protection System</b> <b>(FPS)</b> is a device fitted to the front end of a vehicle to protect both pedestrians and cyclists who are involved in the unfortunate event of a front end collision with a vehicle.</p>
<p><br />
After public concerns about the safety of Bull-Bars led to governmental pressure on SUV and 4x4 vehicle manufacturers, the Transport Research Laboratory developed a series of tests designed to ensure that minimum safety standards are met on vehicles fitted with them. This test has now become embodied within European Directive 2005/66/EC coming into force in May 2007.</p>
<p><br />
Effectively outlawing traditional metal fabricated Bull Bars; the new legislation has led to the development of more pedestrian friendly products. Various manufacturers have undertaken development using softer, energy absorbing materials.</p>

<p><br />
<b>Design and terminology</b></p>
<p>The terminology of <b>Frontal Protection System</b> has been derived from three terms:</p>
<p>1.<b>Frontal</b>, adj. Of, relating to, directs toward or situated at the front.</p>
<p>2.<b>Protection</b>, n. The action of protecting or the state of being protected, or a thing that protects.</p>
<p>3.<b>System</b>, n. A set of things working together as a mechanism or a network.</p>
<p>An <b>FPS</b> is attached to the front of a vehicle like a bull bar but is made of a technical composite of energy absorbing materials. The composite technology offers an interim solution to vehicle designers in assisting them to meet EC Directive 2003/102/EC Phase 2.</p>
<p>Diagrams emphasising the intrusion into the base vehicle with and without an <b>FPS</b>.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Testing recently carried out by MIRA, one of the UK’s leading testing facilities, has proved that the latest development of a vehicle <b>Frontal Protection System</b> can make many 4 x 4 vehicles safer in the unfortunate event of front end collisions with pedestrians and cyclists. If fitted to current large 4 x 4 vehicles, calculations based on these tests show that an FPS would save lives and a considerable number of serious pedestrian injuries throughout Europe and beyond.</p>

The air ram is a pneumatic device that catapults a stunt performer through the air. To simulate the effects of an explosion the performer steps on a large 'pedal' and using hydraulics and compressed air the 'pedal' is released sending the performer hurtling through the air. The distance and height the performer attains is dependent upon the air pressure set.
<p>There are many different design types but all air rams have a few design elements in common - they use hydraulics, compressed air and a surface area that the performer steps on, that is raised using the compressed air and hydraulics, to catapult the person forward. <a name="Sources_27" id="Sources_27"></a></p>

<p>According to the report's authors, the Archbishop's special commission was established with the following aim:</p>
<p>"To examine the strengths, insights, problems and needs of the Church's life and mission in Urban Priority Areas and, as a result, to reflect on the challenge which God may be making to Church and Nation: and to make recommendations to appropriate bodies."</p>

<p>When the report was published it caused immediate controversy. Some Conservative MPs accused the report of being "<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist.html" title="Marxist">Marxist</a>", though according to the late <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Liverpool_a751.html" title="Bishop of Liverpool">Bishop of Liverpool</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Sheppard_cdbc.html" title="David Sheppard">David Sheppard</a> although the report was loudly “rubbished” by some senior <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative.html" title="Conservative">Conservative</a> politicians, these attacks had the benefit of making "Faith in the City famous”(1)</p>
<p>The report triggered extensive public and media debate regarding Thatcherite ethics, urban decay, the modern role and relevance of the Church, and the perceived growing divide between rich and poor in 80's Britain.</p>
<p>As a result of the reports findings the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> decided to create the Church Urban Fund. which subsequently distributed more than £50 million to faith related initiatives across the country</p>

At the tender age of 1. she began to do things several babies have only dreamed of. she could say the gagaggogi from start to finish. she had even learnt to cry in order to get out of nasty situations. when four she stated schooling in india. There she competed against 72 other children in her class for the attention of her teacher ms. Neha. at the age of 8 she entered several competitions yet failed to win any of them to this she says" lossing agaist a billion poeple (population of mumbai) is not as bad as loosing to 600000(population of nsw). she migrated to australia at the age of eleven and attended parramatta public school. here her favorite teachers included ms. nickle and mrs. freed. she did not like ms. polios mainly because ms. polios favored her freind kritika ramphal over her. some of her best friends in primary included priyanka anna li kimi vagela and kritika ramphal. she dispised milosh and tash who always pissed her off.at the age of 12 shweta went macquarie high school . this is where she studies at the moment. in the future she plans to go to sydney university and study physcology but for now miss. myers yr 9 physcology class will do.</p>
<p>her favourite subjects include english and pdhpe. her favourite teacher is probably miss. judge (who failed to give her the english award dispite all her contribution in class)and miss.cotsis.(best history teacher eva) her best friends include shushmita fariha sharon akshata prerna varanya veeena billie harini andy deviani etc.</p>

<p>VEL SATIS</p>
<p>VIVA LE DIFFERENCE!</p>
<p>VEL SATIS is an expression of Renault's continuing commitment to conceptual innovation and a celebration of being different. An elegant luxury limousine, ‘avant-garde’ in concept, it is a radical departure from the conventional three-box saloon in the 30K+ segment appealing to customers wishing to express their individuality and non-conformance. Based on the notion of well being, VEL SATIS was conceived from the inside out by French designer and Anglophile, Patrick Le Quement. The generously proportioned cabin with its original architecture – 13 cm. extra height and 284 cm. wheelbase - offers a spacious and comfortable interior never before seen in the segment. By overturning the conventional proportions of top-range saloons, it makes life much easier for occupants. It is also stylish, with clean, taut lines in the forward section, and an inwardly raked C-pillar, which adds Anglia 105E style to the rear quarters. It is instantly recognisable by its distinctive appearance and it has the ‘Wow!’ factor the first time you see it. The contrast between the long front bonnet and the extremely short rear overhang creates a dynamic aspect. The sides, flat and high, contribute a solid and protective air. Imposing with a memorable ‘face’ with air intakes positioned on either side of the Renault ‘diamond’, the INITIALE version is also marked by exquisite detail. The result is a strange, but rather fabulous looking creation, unlike anything available on the market today. A restricted sales policy, where VEL SATIS was only made to individual customer order, ensures that it also remains exclusive, especially so in V6 configuration.</p>
<p>VEL SATISFY YOUR DEMANDS</p>
<p>VEL SATIS is first and foremost a lux-mobile, blending elegant materials and progressive technology to great effect. It engages the emotions by offering a unique feeling of refinement and well-being on the move. The cabin interior is tactile and bright, (‘roomier than a Rolls-Royce’s’ – Daily Telegraph), creating an impression of luxury, calm and tranquillity. All seats resemble ‘first-class armchairs’ with their curved shape that mould around the passenger. Together with wooden inlay and drawers they are reminiscent of furniture design. The lighting is intimate. Controls are minimalist and chic - there are no superficial details or useless gadgets, only simple instrumentation. A little analogue clock, ‘jewelled’ in the centre, reminds one of the timepiece to be found in a Maserati, and adds its own luxury touch to a car in which every detail seems to have a cosseting reason as well as a functional one. The total effect is one of bespoke quality, sophistication and refinement , (‘quality co-exists with refreshing originality’ – The Independent). This is a car that stirs the soul!</p>
<p>This feeling of well-being is enhanced by the many technical innovations which, interacting discreetly with the user, are dedicated to comfort, peace of mind, and making driving a pleasure in every respect. There is no futile complexity or tendency to ‘show off’ with over obvious technology. Although sophisticated and complex, the technology remains simple and easy to use.</p>
<p>VEL SATIS uses a Renault Card to unlock the doors and luggage compartment and start the engine. Before each authorisation for engine start, the Renault Card and its reader engage in a dialogue. The steering column is not unlocked until the card has been interrogated, the correct reply received and the engine start authorised. As an additional security feature, the identification code contained within the card's transponder is a rolling code. Once inside, you just slide the card into a reader in the centre console and press the ‘start’ button. Each of the cards delivered with the car can memorise each driver’s settings for the electric seats, mirrors, climate control and entertainment systems. The Renault Card also stores VIN and registration number details as well as maintenance information such as fluid levels, mileage and distance to the car’s next service.</p>
<p>BEST SEATS IN THE HOUSE</p>
<p>The large doors of VEL SATIS are designed so the car can be entered in a ‘dignified’ manner. Getting in and out is easy thanks to a new square-edged design. Access is improved by the higher than normal seats - the passenger sits onto the seats rather than having to drop down into them. This also results in an easier exit from the car, with the passenger stepping out without having to struggle. The cabin, 13cm taller than the class average, creates better headroom and allows the use of generous glazed surfaces, providing more comfort thanks to a brighter interior and outstanding all round visibility.</p>
<p>The front seats of VEL SATIS are one of the car’s major innovations. Combining ‘first-class’ comfort with maximum passive safety, they bring together two concepts - a seat-mounted safety belt and a double-hinged backrest. With the backrest split into two parts across the middle the front occupants can alter the angle of the backrest whilst still having their shoulders supported. This feature improves both comfort and safety thanks to better support of the upper part of the torso. The driver's seat is also equipped with the ability to vary the height of the front section of the cushion to provide optimum support for the thighs.</p>
<p>The shape of the seat makes the cushion wider, akin to the comfort of an armchair. Altogether, five adjustments – reach, parallel height, cushion adjustment and inclination of lower and upper parts of the backrest – allow the seat to adapt precisely to any body shape and size. All these settings, except the cushion adjustment, are memorised by the Renault Card. The three-point safety belts are integrated in the driver and passenger seats for extra occupant comfort – the belt always remaining close to the shoulder. In addition, thanks to electrically-controlled locking of the belt, the pre-tensioning loads are reduced. The seat-mounted belt together with electric control improves overall comfort by reducing the pressure of the belt across the chest.</p>
<p>Finished in pale perforated Connelly hide, the seats are (‘more comfortable than a Bentley’s’ – Daily Telegraph).</p>
<p>MAKING A VIRTUE OF SIMPLICITY</p>
<p>VEL SATIS is one of the first production models to take advantage of an automatic parking brake. In addition to all the conventional functions of a manual parking brake, this feature allows automatic locking when the engine is switched off. Controlled by a computer, the degree of effort it is necessary to apply to hold the car on a given slope is entirely automatic. When starting from rest, the parking brake is automatically released as soon as the amount of torque needed for forward movement is achieved by the driven wheels.</p>
<p>The automatic parking brake also has a fail-safe device: in the event of a failure of the main braking circuit, it allows braking to take place with the protection of a simplified ABS function which avoids any locking of the rear wheels. Should the need arise, in particular when stopping on a slope without switching off the engine, the handbrake can be applied with a control on the dashboard. The elimination of the handbrake lever in the cabin frees space between the front seats for the installation of a large storage bin in the centre console. In addition there is a deep glovebox, wide bins in all four doors, and four drawers under the seats – sliding at the front, pivoting at the rear – which provide VEL SATIS with the best stowage space in its class.</p>
<p>For driving, the philosophy of VEL SATIS is to make a virtue of simplicity and to do away with many routine operations, such as switching on the headlamps or windscreen wipers. All these operations, often seen as constraints when driving, have been automated. A light sensor ensures that dipped headlamps are switched on whenever the light level is low, and also provides a ‘follow me home’ function which switches the headlamps off two minutes after locking of the doors.</p>
<p>A rain sensor switches on the windscreen wipers and adjusts their speed according to the amount of water on the screen. In addition, for a clearer wipe, the blades operate in opposing directions, wiping from the centre of the screen outwards. The wiped area is increased from 85% with parallel operation, to 95% of the screen.</p>
<p>Furthermore, flexible blades improve the effectiveness of the wipe, especially at high speeds, thanks to lower air resistance. Finally, an electronically-controlled, pendular-mounted motor controls the acceleration and slowing down of the wipers at the beginning and end of each stroke, as well as the change in direction to improve operating comfort. This feature allows the wiper speed to be infinitely variable and controlled according to the amount of water on the screen whenever the rain sensor is activated.</p>
<p>VEL SATIS is also equipped with a parking proximity sensor, which allows unseen obstacles behind the car to be detected. Whenever reverse gear is engaged, four ultrasonic sensors built into the rear bumper measure the available free space. A series of increasingly rapid beeps warns the driver when approaching an obstacle. When the available manoeuvring distance is less than 20cm, the sound signal becomes continuous. Furthermore, variable-assistance power steering comes as standard facilitating driving and manoeuvrability and detecting vehicle speed for optimum usage.</p>
<p>Electrochromatic outside and inside mirrors darken progressively at night to prevent the driver from being dazzled by the headlamps of cars behind. The door mirrors can be electrically folded simply by rotating the adjustment button to avoid any damage when the car is parked. A bi-focal lens ensures that a passing car is visible in the driver’s peripheral vision before its image disappears from the mirror. This is the only car I have ever driven without a ‘blind’ spot and it contributes greatly to a safe feeling on the move.</p>
<p>A tyre pressure monitoring system is also an essential aspect of safety. It detects both punctures and slow pressure loss, which accounts for 90% of incidents. The system provides the driver with information on the pressures, and the location of any problem, by means of a display situated on the instrument panel.</p>
<p>An especially convenient touch for owners is the integral fuel filler flap, which does away with any risk of leakage or of smells associated with handling the filler cap. Simplified as far as possible, the only operation now necessary is to open the flap and insert the filler nozzle into the orifice.</p>
<p>The occupants can control their own climate thanks to controls both in the front and the rear of the car. Although simple to use, this air conditioning system incorporates a high technical content allowing the detailed analysis of thermal comfort. A series of sensors anticipates the needs of each of the vehicle's occupants. A solar input sensor adjusts the temperature according to the solar radiation entering the cabin. A toxicity sensor automatically switches to air recycling mode before external polluting elements can penetrate the cabin. Finally, a humidity sensor anticipates the formation of mist inside the windows, and according to the humidity of the ambient air, deploys different ventilation strategies. Also, if necessary, the system activates the electric heating of windscreen and rear window.</p>
<p>In addition, the adoption of an automatically controlled variable-displacement compressor has the advantage of avoiding engine jerkiness. This enables fuel consumption to be reduced when the air conditioning is switched on, since it takes from the engine only as much power as is strictly needed for the thermal needs of the cabin.</p>
<p>At the same time, considerable work has gone into reducing ambient noise. Passengers travelling in VEL SATIS for the first time find it strikingly quiet. Despite its height there's little wind noise. It makes a major contribution to the ambience of the cabin, and to stress-free driving comfort and pleasure. External noise levels recorded by the vehicle are also at a remarkably low level - 71dBA. Thanks to these reductions VEL SATIS won the 2001 ‘Golden Decibel’ award presented in Paris.</p>
<p>V6 OF THE BEST</p>
<p>The most powerful engine in the VEL SATIS, the 3.5-litre 24-valve V6 petrol engine is a result of the Renault/Nissan partnership. It’s the same 3.5-litre V6 you get in a Nissan 350Z – a good engine with plenty of oomph. Far from seeking pure performance, it is de-rated to provide smoothness and flexibility, with deep-lunged power, and the transition to the VEL SATIS is very successful.</p>
<p>Voted ‘America’s Best V6’ three years in a row, the engine combines power (245bhp at 6,000rpm) for high speed with torque at low speed (330Nm at 3,600rpm, with 85% of this figure available from 1,200rpm) for smooth operation. This results in a top speed of 147mph and a 0-62mph time of 8.3 seconds, while both fuel consumption and emission figures are kept low for the engine size at 24.6mpg in the combined cycle and 275g/km of CO2. The flat torque curve and overdrive top gear means that only 2200rpm are required at 70mph, the same as for the 3.0-litre diesel unit, resulting in relaxed motorway cruising. At motorway speeds VEL SATIS is able to return 34.8mpg - impressively economical for its size.</p>
<p>The five-speed Proactive automatic transmission contributes directly to driving pleasure with its ability to downshift during hard braking or to avoid downshifting if the accelerator is suddenly released. Unlike most other automatic transmissions it does not simply change up at the crucial moment leaving the car to coast around a corner with no engine braking. Its computer continuously analyses driving style, road profile and engine operation so as to determine the ideal gear selection at any moment. The pleasure of using it has been further increased by the option of flick-shift sequential control, allowing the driver to manually select whichever gear he or she chooses.</p>
<p>Engineers designing the VEL SATIS found that the large interior and high centre of gravity posed problems of stability and handling. They resolved the problem by redesigning the MacPherson front suspension, strengthening 80% of its components, and developing a new multi-link rear suspension. The resultant driving sensation is more MPV than luxury saloon. Compliant but under-damped at slow cruising speeds in town, it is prone to disturbance by potholes and high-frequency undulations. As the speed increases, however, so does the car's composure - directional stability, levels of grip and road holding are jaw-dropping and the car is a blast to drive. The 245/45 Continentals compromise ride quality scouring the surface like radar and transmitting every bump to the cabin noisily, but the corollary is confident cornering and the possibility of considerable driving fun on the twisty stuff. In manual mode, full advantage can be taken of the whopping V6 torque in mid-range enabling the VEL SATIS to keep up with the best. As the power surges smoothly from minimal inputs from the right foot and the car hangs on through the tightest bends the driving sensation is exhilarating. VEL SATIS can be whatever you want it to be – a sporty car or sedate luxury cruiser.</p>
<p>SAFETY – THE ‘NEW VOLVO’</p>
<p>Given Renault’s domination of the Euro NCAP safety tests, it will come as no surprise to learn that VEL SATIS is now the safest car you can buy in the executive-car segment. It is equipped with the latest generation of equipment - numerous functions enable the driver to anticipate and prevent danger. RAID – remote anti-intrusion device – locks the doors automatically when the vehicle is in motion to prevent unauthorised entry.</p>
<p>The wide tyres on 18in. wheels, enormous disk brakes all round, and the latest generation ABS, electronic brake force distribution and emergency brake assist combine you give you control in any situation in which the imperative is to pull up safely in the shortest possible distance. With the Emergency Brake Assist system, the stopping distance is dramatically reduced, the car virtually ‘stopping on a sixpence’. If drastic avoiding action threatens loss of grip, the electronic stability programme keeps you on course while, at the same time, traction control increases the grip of the driving wheels. This includes a system for starting from rest and accelerating in low-grip conditions.</p>
<p>Where passive safety is concerned, VEL SATIS is equipped with Renault's latest generation System for Restraint and Protection (SRP). It comprises two front adaptive airbags (the passenger airbag can be deactivated) with an internal unit which cools the gas before venting, a double pre-tensioner for the driver (a single pre-tensioner for the passenger) and load limiters in the form of calibrated torsion bars in the belt reels. The frontal airbags inflate in two stages to increase the protection they give in the most severe accidents. A sensor is also incorporated in the system to determine the size of the driver to modify the aggressiveness of the airbag for smaller drivers. The car’s twin seat belt pre-tensioners greatly reduce the risk of leg injury for the driver by restricting his forward movement during an impact. The front safety belt reels are also fitted with an electrical control, which operates even if the battery has become disconnected during impact – locking occurs whenever the current is cut off – and the system is completed by close-contact head restraints. Together with the car’s strong body and a steering column that moves little, they provide a safe environment for the driver. Those at each side at the rear are provided with a torsion bar type load limiter and a pyrotechnic pre- tensioner.</p>
<p>The three rear headrests may be slid down when not in use, for improved visibility. For side impacts, VEL SATIS is equipped with curtain airbags, and controlled-deflation side chest airbags housed in the backs of the front seats and in the rear pillars. Padding built into the door panels provides extra protection of the thorax for both front and rear occupants. The rear side seats are equipped with Isofix attachments, which allow child seats to be installed in a much stronger and safer way.</p>
<p>Peace of mind for the user is also a key consideration. One aspect of this peace of mind is the protection of the car against break-ins. All the locking mechanisms, as well as being deadlocked, are protected by shields, and control is exercised via cables which make any attempt at ‘hooking’ more difficult. In the event of a direct attack by force, the steering column lock and the engine management computer are protected by covers. In addition, the steering column lock, equipped with a coded electric control, is installed on the lower part of the steering column. Because of its design, the pin always engages with a socket to lock the column, whatever the position of the steering wheel. Finally, a de-clutching system makes it impossible to break off the pin by a violent blow to the steering wheel. In addition, the aluminium doors and the composite rear hatch are equipped with reinforcements able to resist attack for long enough to discourage any attempt to enter by force.</p>
<p>VEL TIMED</p>
<p>The VEL SATIS looks like one of those styling studies you see at motor shows that never actually make it into production. This one has, albeit not quite in the form in which we first saw it. Nevertheless, it makes quite a statement and certainly turns heads. Comments of `look at that!’ or more likely `what is that?’ may often be heard. Some find the appearance of the tall cabin ungainly, but t makes a striking, rather beautiful and refreshing style statement, particularly in a delightful pale blue-grey metallic paint option – never less than distinctive and modern. Impressive but not intimidating, VEL SATIS makes its mark with poise. From the striking radiator grill with its well-proportioned logo to the wrap-around rear window and bulging bustle-like boot lid the profile is highly individual, dynamic, taut and clean. It appeals to both the head and the heart and amongst its peers in the £30K+ sector it wins the style vote by a country mile.</p>
<p>With numerous storage cubby-holes, Renault has also created the ultimate example of automotive practicality. Spacious and welcoming, VEL SATIS strengthens the feeling of well-being that reigns in its cabin, with a highly personal atmosphere – old fashioned, charming and dignified – almost retro, or at least post-modern. The blend of mellow woods, high-grade plastics and soft leather is very appealing and passengers revel in the complete absence of noise and acre’s of space. It’s a special place to spend time and sumptuous in a way that makes you want to be driven rather than drive. In its own way, VEL SATIS is just as evocative a piece of design work as the Audi TT or the Rover 75. For those who like to look different, in this era of ever increasing automotive conformity, VEL SATIS hits the spot. This is a very complete car, one that can fulfil whatever role its owner wants it to – motorway cruiser or sports car.</p>
<p>Cross-over vehicles are created to make their owners look different. The fatal flaw is that their very success means nobody looks different. But Renault have found a niche within a niche – only French ministers travel in the VEL SATIS - so looking different is guaranteed.</p>
<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>Japanese mechanicals. With a Conran look. It’s the next big thing.</p>

<p>The Cottier Theatre Glasgow is situated in the Former Dowanhill Parish Church in Hyndland Street Partick. The building was constructed in 1865 to a design by the then 26 year old William Lieper and opened for worship on the 11th November 1866. The interior decoration and stained glass were designed by Daniel Cottier (installed 1867) after whom the Theatre and adjacent bar and restaurant are named. The building is owned and operated by the Four Acres Charitable Trust a not for profit organisation based in the West End. The building is Grade A listed and recently received a £1.89million Heritage Lottery award to complete a £3million funding package to repair and restore the building the decorative scheme and stained glass. It is estimated that these works will take three years to complete therefore finishing in 2008/9. Whilst the Theatre will be closed during this period the bar and restuarant remain open generating vital funds for the building and its up keep.=== Sources === The History of Dowanhill Church 1823-1923 by Rev.

<p>213.30.164.94 11:34, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Who is Fouad Abou Nader?</p>
<p>I am born in 1956 ( on June 27 ) in Baalbeck. I began my studies in a school in Beirut. Then, i joined Jamhour, from where I was gracefully returned into "terminale". So, I made my applied sciences in the college Mont-La-Salle. Then I joined the AUB. I spent there one year, during which I took part more in brawls and politics than medicine. Then the war started. So, I registered in the FFM ( USJ ). I obtained there my diploma of medicine in 1982.</p>
<p>And your past as resistant?</p>
<p>I adhered to the Kataeb Party at the beginning of the years 1970. I especially worked within the framework of the militia of the party, and on the level of the organization of the students. -In 1974, he participated in his first fight against the Palestinians in Dekwaneh.- In the Kataeb regular forces, I was member of the "Bejin" ( BG for Boutros – Pierre – Gemayel, troop led by Bachir Gemayel ) from which resulted the majority from the executives of the Lebanese Forces. From this troop, we were integrated into the military Council Kataeb. In 1980, the LF were really founded. Then we worked within this framework. I became chief of the operations - or what is called the third office – in the LF. In 1982, I became chief of staff and in 1984, commander-in-chief of the LF.</p>
<p>Is your promotion within the LF related to your relationship with the Gemayel family?</p>
<p>It is certain that many people see the things thus. Those who do not know me affirm only if I were not the grandson of Pierre Gemayel, I would not be there, today. Since you raise this question, I will tell you a small history: before the war, I passed four to five years in the regular Forces kataeb. I was treated there like any other militiaman and even my closer friends were unaware of than I was the grandson of sheikh Pierre Gemayel. It is only during war the two year old, when I was wounded for the first time and that sheikh Pierre came to visit me to the hospital, that they learned my family tie with him. Not so much because of the visit in itself - sheikh Pierre returned visited regularly to all the casualties - but rather of a particular emotion in my mother ( Claude Gemayel ) ... So I am very proud of being able to say that I created something by myself and that I climbed one by one levels, small combatant with the chief, discreetly and thanks to my capacities. However, I am very proud to belong to this family, that of sheikh Pierre, who learned to me much from things, in particular a certain ethics in the life.</p>
<p>Bachir Gemayel (1982 ): "if the LF should give a medal of honnor to one of his fighter, it would be Fouad Abou Nader". Fady Frem ( 1984 ): "Bachir wanted Fouad took the LF after me, now it is done". CIA report ( 1984 ): “Fouad Abou Nader is certainly the biggest military expert in the Middle East”. Charles Malek ( 1986 ): “Do you know why all they hate Dr Fouad Abou Nader, it is because people loves him”.</p>
<p>Fouad Abou Nader draw the LF red cross, not against the muslims but only to say that the christians are in Lebanon to stay and the DELTA logo, because of the three resistance battles in the begginning of the war.</p>
<p>Fouad Abou Nader founded the Saddem special force. He protected the lebanese muslims by hiding them in the free areas at the time of the israeli bombardment of West Beirut.</p>
<p>Fouad Abou Nader stayed President ( ra2is ) of the Command Council and Commander in chief ( ka2d el a3la ) of the Lebanese Forces and also, prominent member of the Kataeb political office until the end of the war despite the intifadas of 1985 and 1986 and the assassination attempt against him in 1986.</p>
<p>He refused the Tripartite accord in 1985 and the Taef accord in 1989 and the Fraternity accord with Syria in 1991.</p>
<p>To have rejected the Taef accord and joinned the people rally in Baabda in 1990, he was put out from the political office of the Kataeb Party.</p>
<p>He supported Aoun’s war of liberation but refused to participate to the Aoun/Geagea's conflict in 1989/90 ( he searched to reconcile the both camps ).</p>
<p>Fouad Abou Nader defended Lebanon in 1990 with the lebanese army against Syria assault. The last resistance’s battle against Syria in 1990, was led by Abou Rabbih's men after he received the order from Fouad Abou Nader. His companion, Elias el Zayek was killed in 1990 and after, Dany Chamoun with who, he formed the new Lebanese Front.</p>
<p>He lived in Lebanon under occupation, dividing the daily of the Lebanese people. In 1994, when Samir Geagea was jailed ( juged coupable for the assassination of Elias el Zayek ), he refused to open the file about the assassination attempt against him.</p>
<p>His wife, Sandra, was wounded at the time of the attack which killed Rafic Hariri. He participed to the lebanese revolution in 2005 against Syria and even, stayed and slept with the youngs in the Beirut’s downtown. He made reappear from its ashes the council of command of the Lebanese forces under the name of “Former Lebanese Forces” also known under the name of “Bachir Gemayel’s companions” or even the “Authentic Lebanese Forces”. He should have joined the new kataeb higher political council after his companions joined the kataeb political office ( as opposants of Amine Gemayel, “supreme president” and Karim Pakradouni, “president” of the Kataeb Party ) but the higher political council was not founded and Fouad Abou Nader didn’t enter in the Kataeb Party. The current of Fouad Abou Nader was known under the name of “social democratic” ( in french, démocrate social ).</p>
<p>For now, he is founding a new party with the former members of the LF including: <i>(list of names removed for courtesy reasons --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 12:04, 27 November 2006 (UTC))</i></p>

<p>Geographic information science (GISci) is a new discipline emerged from various geographic information technologies including digital mapping, geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, and global positioning systems. It cuts across the conventional disciplinary boundaries of informatics and various geosciences, and has become, according to a recent article in Nature magazine, one of the three important emerging and evolving fields along with biotechnology and nanotechnology. Because of interdisciplinary and dynamically evolving nature of the new discipline, there is a high demand for collaboration among the individual research groups in Nordic and adjacent countries. The NordGISci network, funded by NordForsk (Nordic Research Board), is intended to promote advanced research (in both GIS as a technology and GISci as an emerging discipline) and research training for young researchers in the region through various organized activities.</p>

He lurks in the lullaby forest, where the trees lure wanderers intohis territory, where the Skullpelt looks just like a person the wanderer knows or loves, thanks to the lullaby trees.

<p>Dick Morrissey, British jazz musician and composer Instruments: tenor sax, soprano sax and flute Full name: Richard Edwin Morrissey Born: 9th May 1939 Died: 8th November 2000</p>
<p>Dick Morrissey came to the fore of a new generation of sax players inspired by Tubby Hayes, Britain’s pre-eminent sax player. He recorded his first solo album at the age of 21, It’s Morrissey, Man! (1961, Fontana), which featured Stan Jones on piano, Colin Barnes on drums, and Malcolm Cecil on bass. He went on to form the Dick Morrissey Quartet, with the legendary Phil Seamen on drums, Harry South on piano and Phil Bates on bass, recording two classic British Jazz LPs, Storm Warning! (1965, Mercury); Here and Now and Sounding Good (1966) (with Bill Eyden on drums). The band, which also featured Jackie Dougan on drums, played regular London gigs to packed houses.</p>
<p>He also played in Ted Heath’s Big Band, the who’s who of the British jazz scene for many years, as well as Johnny Dankworth and his Orchestra and the Harry South Big Band. Many US musicians touring Britain at the time, notably Brother Jack McDuff, Jimmy Witherspoon, J.J. Jackson, Mike Carr and Sonny Stitt recorded live with him.</p>
<p>In 1969, Dick Morrissey, by then twice winner of the prestigious Melody Maker Poll (as best British sax player), as well as many other British Jazz awards throughout his career, teamed up with another Melody Maker award-winner, guitarist Terry Smith, with whom he had worked in J.J. Jackson’s Band, to form Britain’s seminal jazz-rock group, IF.</p>
<p>Encouraged by the success of the then recently-formed US bands Blood, Sweat and Tears, and Chicago, both of which featured heavy brass sections, the time was ripe for a British answer, less influenced by the American big band sound of trumpets and trombones. Although the original band featured a different line up IF’s first five records were with J.W. Hodkinson on lead vocals, John Mealing on keyboards, Jim Richardson on electric bass, Dennis Eliott on drums, Dave Quincy on alto and tenor saxes, Terry Smith on guitars, and Dick Morrissey on tenor and soprano saxes and flute.</p>
<p>Essentially a live band, and true to its jazz influences, IF was the only jazz-rock group, both then and now, to feature solos by all the band members, not just by the lead instruments. They recorded five albums under the above line up plus another two albums featuring Geoff Whitehorn on guitar and vocals, Gabriel Magno on keyboards and Walt Monaghan on bass and vocals, Cliff Davies on drums and Dick Morrissey. (for full line up details, see Wikipedia under IF),</p>
<p>When IF disbanded in 1975, Dick Morrissey went off to the United States to tour and record with the Average White Band, and was introduced to Glasgow-born guitarist Jim Mullen and together they formed Morrissey-Mullen (M&amp;M), recording their first album, UP (1976) in New York. Morrissey-Mullen rapidly became Britain’s most highly acclaimed jazz-fusion band, recording seven albums over the 16 years they were together, as well as collaborating on each other’s solo albums. Although the line up for live gigs often featured two British jazz greats Martin Drew on drums and John Burch on piano, as well as John Critchinson (piano), none of them appeared on the M&amp;M recordings.</p>
<p>In between regular M&amp;M gigs, Dick Morrissey would also meet up with old friends Ian “Stu” Stewart, Charlie Watts, Alexis Korner, Jack Bruce, Colin Hodgkinson, etc., to play boogie-woogie/jazz/rock with the back-to-the-roots fun band Rocket 88 that Stu put together with Bob Hall.</p>
<p>He also collaborated with Charly Antolini, Mike Carr, Brian Auger, Pete York, Paul McCartney, Gary Numan, Phil Carmen, Peter Gabriel, Jon Anderson, Jon &amp; Vangelis (as well as playing the famous haunting sax solo on the Love Theme track of Ridley Scott’s 19XX film Blade Runner) on more than one recording and tours.</p>
<p>Dick Morrissey died on November 8, 2000 after many years fighting various forms of cancer.</p>
<p>In the obituary published in The Times, British music critic Chris Welch wrote that Dick Morrissey was a “Fiery musician who straddled the worlds of jazz and rock, but with a style built firmly on bebop and widely regarded as the most brilliant British saxophonist to emerge in the wake of Tubby Hayes. His advocacy of jazz-rock fusion successfully brought jazz to a rock audience and rock to a jazz audience.”</p>

<p>IF was a seminal jazz-rock band formed in 1969 as Britain’s answer to the pioneering US bands Blood, Sweat and Tears and Chicago. The main difference was that IF did not have a trumpet or trombone player and featured two saxes instead. Essentially a live band, true to its jazz influences IF was probably the only jazz-rock group, both then and now, to feature solos by all the band members, not just by the lead instruments. They toured extensively in Europe and the States during the Seventies, performing at all the major venues and festivals (Newport, Reading, Fillmores East &amp; West, Whiskey A-Go-Go, etc.) and shared billings with, among others, Miles Davis, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon and Leon Russell as well as many of the classic rock bands of the day, such as Cream, Traffic, Yes, Black Sabbath, Grand Funk Railroad, Ten Year’s After, Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show, and Lynyrd Skynyrd.</p>
<p>The band was formed by <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Morrissey_469d.html" title="Dick Morrissey">Dick Morrissey</a> and Terry Smith, two award-winning British jazz musicians who had played together in J.J. Jackson’s Greatest Little Soul Band in the Land, and IF’s original line up included Dave Quincy on alto and tenor saxes, with Spike Wells on drums, Lionel Grigson on keyboards and Daryl Runswick on bass, although these last three musicians did not record with IF.</p>
<p>The definitive seven-piece line-up was J.W. Hodkinson on lead vocals, John Mealing on keyboards, Jim Richardson on electric bass, Dennis Eliott on drums, with Dave Quincy on alto and tenor saxes, Terry Smith on guitars, and Dick Morrissey on tenor and soprano saxes and flute.</p>
<p>IF became one of the most highly-acclaimed groups of the Seventies to never quite make the big time. Signed on by Chris Blackwell, an enthusiastic early fan, to Island Records in the UK and by Capitol Records in the US, their first album, IF (1970), entered the charts in both the States (Billboard) and the UK, as well as winning a design award for its cover, and was followed that same year by IF 2, also on Island and Capitol.</p>
<p>The albums IF 3 (1971) and IF 4 “Waterfall” (1972) were accompanied by heavy touring schedules in the States and Europe, especially in Britain and Germany, where the band appeared on TV (BBC’s Top of the Pops/Old Grey Whistle Test in the UK and xxx in Germany). Finally, in the summer of 1972, the band had to come off the road in the middle of a US tour when Dick Morrissey was admitted to hospital for major surgery. As a result of the break-up, the band members went off to work on other projects.</p>
<p>A new line-up had Dave Greenslade replacing Mealing on keyboards, and Dave Wintour replacing Richardson on bass, although they only played live gigs and never recorded with the band.</p>
<p>A fifth album, Double Diamond (1973), with only Dick Morrissey left from the original line up, featured Fi Trench (piano), Pete Arnesen (keyboards), Steve Rosenthal (guitar/lead vocals), Kurt Palomacki (bass) and Cliff Davies (drums).</p>
<p>The last two IF albums, Not Just Another Bunch of Pretty Faces (1974) and Tea Break Over, Back On Our ‘eads (1975), were decidedly more rock oriented and featured Geoff Whitehorn on guitar and vocals, Gabriel Magno on keyboards and Walt Monaghan on bass and vocals, as well as Cliff Davies and Dick Morrissey.</p>

<p><b>LORENZO MENDEZ EL DEBUT DE LA NUEVA VOZ DE LA MUSCIA RANCHERA Estrenando su nueva producción A Mi México Querido Woodland Hills, CA- 23 de Mayo del 2006. Lorenzo Méndez es el ganador del concurso Gigantes Del Mañana (2005) transmitido a nivel nacional por la cadena Univision, nos presenta ahora su debut discográfico titulado A Mi México Querido el cual ya esta disponible en Estados Unidos. De talento innato este joven compositor y artista de la música mexicana empieza hoy día a dar los primeros pasos bajo el sello Fonovisa Records, quién lo encaminará al próximo nivel de su carrera profesional. Tradicional y contemporáneo a la vez, su debut discográfico titulado A Mi México Querido fue grabado en la Ciudad de México a finales del 2005 en el estudio de Joel Solís (ex integrante de Los Bukis); con la participación como productor y arreglista de Manuel Cazares quien es reconocido por su trabajo con artistas de la talla de: Juan Gabriel, Los Temerarios, Pepe Aguilar, Pablo Montero y Ana Gabriel por mencionar algunos. Con un repertorio de 10 temas perfectamente balanceados incluyendo: baladas, boleros, norteñas, huapangos y sones y con la colaboración de importantes compositores tales como: Kike Santander, Rafael Armenta y Manuel Monterosas son los que integran esta primera producción A Mi México Queridoen la increíble voz de Lorenzo Méndez. Para Lorenzo Méndez quizás uno de los momentos más felices que recuerda de todo el proceso de la realización de su álbum, fue el poder haber compartido valiosos momentos con Joel Solís y Manuel Cazares y de contar con su apoyo y con la guía de ambos. Temas incluidos en dicha producción son: A Mi México Querido, Es Esa Mujer, Plegaria Guadalupana, El Pasadiscos, Eternamente, Llama Por Favor, Valió La Pena, Dame, Lobo Y Cordero y Deja. El primer sencillo que se lanza al mercado fue Dame de la autoría de Gilberto Gless, este tema tuvo significado especial para Lorenzo, ya que considera ser afortunado al contar con compositores tan importantes en su producción. Otra canción especial para el es Plegaria Guadalupana de la autoría de su tío Fidel Ronquillo quien con cariño le obsequió este tema para su importante debut discográfico. También Valió La Pena un tema romántico que habla del amor y lo difícil que es cuando el amor acaba y claro todo mundo ha pasado por una situación así, sin importar la edad. Recientemente Lorenzo Méndez ha compartido escenario con importantes estrellas de la música Latina tales como: Los Tigres, Marco Antonio Solís, Olga Tañon, Kumbia Kings, Lupillo Rivera, en Estados Unidos... Con una importante producción en mano A Mi México Querido Lorenzo Méndez se sigue forjando metas, su tenacidad es pieza clave de su personalidad y sus metas inmediatas son compartir su música con toda la gente y a largo plazo desea convertirse en un artista multifacético intérprete, compositor y actor. Pero por ahoraLorenzo Méndez desea dedicar su álbum A Mi México Querido a toda su generación, a esos jóvenes que como él, siguen soñando por alcanzar sus metas, cualquiera que éstas sean.</b></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-27_5c7a.html" title="Edit section: Pat Fauntleroy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pat Fauntleroy</span></h2>
<p>In late 2005 a mutual friend introduced Pat Fauntleroy to Caitlin Bartley. Flirting ensued, sparks flew, kisses were had, and a relationship began. After many many weeks of "being together" the couple finally made it official and began dating. Left in the sexual dust was Caitlin's X boyfriend Steven Stecher. Steven however, did not know this yet; he was more clueless than a Klan Member at a Dr. Dre show. You see, Steven believed he was still number one in Caitlin's heart, despite many many reassurances from Caitlin that indeed, he was not number one, nor two or three. But young Steven persisted and held onto his disillusionment much like a crack addict assures himself that they aren’t addicted. And so the story moves on, Pat and Caitlin spending more and more time together until spring finally came where the love blooms as much as the flowers. Pat and Caitlin said see you soon, and left school to their separate homes with many dates in mind in which they could resume their relationship. These dates came and went and Pat and Caitlin were more in love than ever. Now as a side note, Pat, though not the most intimidating person in the world, loved Caitlin so much, he would defend her honor at any cost. I tell you this for reasons to come. Caitlin, on her way back to her hometown stopped off at Pat's house to say hey, and snuggle a bit. They did, it was grand and Caitlin was off to see all her friends she had not seen in a while. Little did she know that later that night she would run into Stupid Steven. She arrived at a party that night with hopes of drinking sprits and talking of old times past. But Steven the turd had other plans. "GET OUT CAITLIN", he shouted, GET OUT! "This isn't even your house", she replied calmly. "I KNOW! I SUCK AND I'M IMMATURE AND CAN'T DEAL WITH REALITY!", he would of said if he wasn't sucha douche.</p>
<p>Anyways, hurtful things were said to Caitlin and she turned to the person she trusted the most. Pat</p>
<p>Well, when Pat heard of this he was enraged. The hulk within him arose, and he demanded Steven be put on the phone. Words were exchanged and Steven quickly had to come to the harsh reality that Pat is the man, and he is not. Angry and frustrated Steven began taking shots and Caitlin and Pat. Not only were this personal insults, stupid, but he did them on Facebook. Yes you heard me, he trashed them on facebook. Like a little 13 year old girl spreading a rumor around her Jr. Highschool, Steven used Facebook as his medium of choice. Did he call Pat and take it up with him? No, did he call Caitlin and talk to her? No. So in short kids, Steven came out looking like a bigger jerk off than we all thought he was before this all began. And even more importantly, Caitlin and Pat are still madly in love and Steven is very very very very very alone.</p>
<p>The lesson: Don't ever mess with two of my best friends. Because I get bored and work and things like this happen.</p>

<p>The concept itself is not new. <a href="../../../d/a/r/DARPA_4dfc.html" title="DARPA">DARPA</a> (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) of the United States pioneered research into the field. Primarily, their interest was mainly to reduce the use of heavy rechargeable batteries that power necessary yet power-hungry communication devices carried by <a href="../../../s/o/l/Soldiers.html" title="Soldiers">soldiers</a> into battlefields. Most of the research was spent in development of "heel-strike" [generators], which were powered through the pumping motion of a footstep, which would be embedded within a heel of an army boot. So far, they were successful in achieving upwards of 3 - 6 watts of power output.</p>

<p>Teenage sensation Wayne Rooney burst onto the national stage in October 2002 following a 10 minute cameo appearence against Premiership Champions Arsenal. The 16 year-old, still an amateur, came on as a substitute for Tomasz Radzinski in the 81st minute with the match deadlocked at 1-1 and within minutes he had beaten England number one David Seaman with a wicked, dipping, swerving drive from 25 yards. The celebrations that ensued communicated the relief and joy of the Blues supporters as they recognised a 24-carat superhero and a devoted Evertonian to boot.</p>
<p>In the Blues' following match, against Leeds United at Elland Road, Wayne was on target again scoring the games only goal - this time with a meandering run from the half-way line capped by a cool finish from just inside the penalty area - and again the travelling Evertonians went ballistic as if their prayers for a star of the future had finally been answered. Wayne then went on to be pivotal to Everton's revival during the 2002-03 season.</p>
<p>Its hard to believe that just 6 months previously, Wayne had been in Everton's youth team playing an important role in their run to the 2002 FA Youth Cup Final scoring 8 goals in 8 games, and by the start of the 2002-03 season, rumours of his talent flooded the Everton grapevine. Yet he was still unknown when he scored an amazing wonder goal in an FA Youth Cup-tie at Tottenham that had Glenn Hoddle and David Pleast turning to Everton officials and asking, 'Who is this kid?'.</p>
<p>From his debut in August 2002 against Tottenham at Goodison, during which he set up the opening goal for Mark Pembridge, Rooney dominated Evertonian thoughts and, following his immediate conversion into 'Roonaldo' in the wake of his single-handed demolition of Arsenal and Leeds, he became a symbol of hope for the entire nation and there were soon calls for his inclusion in the full England team. Wayne was subsequently voted BBC young Sports Personality of the Year 2002.</p>
<p>Almost inevitably, Rooney became England's youngest-ever player, aged 17 years and 111 days, when he made his international debut against Australia on 12th February 2003 - his first touch being a delightful exchange of passes with Newcastle United's Jermaine Jenas. This was followed by an appearance as a substitute against Liechtenstein in a 2-0 England win. Yet controversy preceeded the national side's Euro qualifier against Turkey, with many claiming Wayne was too inexperienced to face a team that finished fourth in the 2002 World Cup. However Eriksson's brave decision to play the youngster ahead of Liverpool's Emile Heskey was fully justified with a glorious 'man of the match' display that raised England's game to new heights.</p>
<p>Rooney, at 17 years, 160 days England's youngest full debutant soon confirmed his talent with those present sensed they were witnessing the birth of a phenomenon. After a quiet start he took the game by the scruff of the neck, making two trademark runs that sparked a great England performance and contributed much to England's eventual 2-0 triumph - his dream debut was completed with a nomination as man of the match.</p>
<p>Wayne then went on to make two more successfull appearences for England against Serbia &amp; Montenegro and Slovakia before he scored the winner against Macedonia to re-write the record books and become England's youngest ever goalscorer. The following England game was Liechtenstein and once against Wayne proved his ability and scored.</p>
<p>After this it was clear than Wayne had no established himself as a first team England international and after several more fine perfomances in a England number 9 shirt it was obvious he would be a starting striker in all of England's Euro 2004 matches.</p>
<p>To put Rooney's talent into perspective, pundits and footballing legends have already likened Wayne's slaloming dribbling style to greats like Roberto Baggio, Paul Gascoigne and Pele while old pros insist that his awareness for a lad his age, is exceptional. The main feat for Evertonians must be that he avoids wearing himself out at too young an age. Yet, pehaps Everton chairman Bill Kenwright put it best when he called on everyone - from club to country - to 'cherish' the lad's talent.</p>
<p>You know what the best thing is...? hes a Evertonian!...</p>

<p>Additional Information Report: Future of Video Game Development By Cory Woods and Martha Prange</p>
<p> Future of Video Game Development</p>
<pre>
                   -Brain Wave Technology
                   -Expanding to the Internet  
</pre>
<p>The Future of Video Gaming: Entertainment is increasingly expanding as an industry. People are constantly looking for different ways to escape from the everyday. Video game technology is receiving more funding now then ever and is making enormous breakthroughs. The video gaming industry has come a long way since A.S Douglas created the first documented computer game, Noughts and Crosses, in 1952. Video games have even made its way into the legislation by prohibiting video game vendors from selling or renting cretin games to minors. By looking at the major milestones in video game development it is no wonder that people are excited about the future of the gaming world. There have been many transitions since the first reported video game inventions and the famous interactive computer game Tennis for Two (the first game invented by an American). In 1971 there was a huge transition with the creation of the first coin arcade- system game and by 1977 the first multi-game home console was released. Since then we have seen amazing advances in the video game world. We were blown away with the amazing graphics introduced in Nintendo 64 and even more amazed with the even better graphics in the newest gaming systems. Technology is allowing the video gaming industry to expand and evolve at a rapid pace. What will be the next big thing in the video gaming industry? The future of video gaming is uncertain to most, but the creative minds of sci-fi directors and writers are providing an in depth looks to where the industry might be heading in the future.</p>
<p>Brain Wave Technology: Recently, a headset has been created that controls a video game through brain waves. The headset is referred to as Mind Balance, and it is a wireless gaming headset tested at MIT Media Lab Europe in Dublin. Research began for this headset as a way for people with limited body movement (i.e. paraplegics) to become more mobile in an online sense, and encourage them to use internet sources to facilitate there needs and communication.</p>
<p>The new device is being generally referred to as the Cerebus and researchers are working on making it smaller, more aesthetically pleasing, and more user-friendly. The idea has been played around with in sci-fi books and films for years, such as the Matrix. The concept has also been expanded to include controlling all computer usage through brain wave helmets; “plugging your brain in” to a system so to speak. This system is called Cyber Kinetics and Braingate. However, Mind Balance was especially revolutionary due to the fact that there helmet did not involve wires plugging in the headset to the gaming console.</p>
<p>Mind Balance uses EGG, which stands for electroencephalography, and it is constructed around reading cerebral data nodes. EGG is used by Bluetooth technology and is interpreted into the Mind Balance head set design. They use six different nodes over the certain areas of the brain that control the processing of light, vision and hallucination, which are closer to the back of the head. What Bluetooth does is it changes the brainwave frequencies to create different responses to things in the visual cortex of our brains. A representative from Bluetooth explains that, "We are able to pick up electrical activity on the scalp and take the brain activity into a C# signal-processing engine which analyses those signal in real-time and makes a decision which of the two boxes the player is looking at." Developments have been made by leading technological organization Microsoft as well. They created what is now known as the C# language, which helps game developers create, manage, and access brain wave technology.</p>
<p>In a couple of years, this new technology might be a common occurrence in homes. This is the first time that brain-computer interface environment technology has been successfully used. This could be the answer to prayers of many victims of diseases such as ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), where your body is shutting down but your brain is in good working health leaving the victims with a sense of being trapped inside there own bodies. Ed Lalor, from the MIT Media Lab Europe in Dublin that first tried the Mind Balance, said, “So as soon as we have a good idea for a nice communications interface to be used with our new brain device, we will have a communications tool for somebody who would otherwise not be able to communicate at all."</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Expanding to the Internet: Game investor conferences suggest that the gaming industry is in need of a fundamental change. What will be the gaming industry’s next billion dollar idea? A number of sectors that are commonly seen as “the next big thing” in games include mobile and casual gaming, massively multiplayer titles, immersive worlds, dedicated game devices and games for girls. We might certainly see the growth of all of these sectors in the near future but are any of these things going to be responsible for creating a huge shift in the gaming world? Experts have stated that they don’t think any of these things are the real next billion-dollar opportunity. Some experts strongly believe that the real next billion dollar opportunity is the Internet.</p>
<p>There is much more potential for Internet gaming with the ever-increasing rate of broadband penetration. Broadband is a high telecommunications pipeline capable of providing high-speed devices, such as video games. Experts believe that “nobody to this day has leveraged the power of the Internet in the context of making the next great video game platform” (Gilman Louie, head partner of venture-capital firm Alsop Louie). It has been stated that current video game businesses are not only ready for the next transition cycle but for a fundamental shift.</p>
<p>The future of the gaming industry needs to look for new and innovation ways to generate revenue. Some believe that the video gaming industry needs to start thinking in terms of their large audiences and those audiences interaction with each other. The Internet is a vast network of computers that connects millions of people all over the world, and has the ability to connect the large audiences of gamers.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-27_5c7a.html" title="Edit section: Labeling discs with permanent ink">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Labeling discs with permanent ink</span></h2>
<p><b>The easiest way to label a CD-R is to whip out that permanent marker and write directly on the disc. It's also a great way to assure that the disc won't be readable later on.</b></p>
<p>The damage won't happen today, or even next month, but at some point the ink will leach into the reflective layer of the disc and it'll be the end of your data.</p>
<p>Now, we're not saying you can't label your discs. But you do have to be careful of the kind of writing instrument you use to do so. In order to understand why certain markers and pens can harm your CD-Rs and DVDs, we first need a basic lesson on the physical properties that make up the disc:</p>
<p>CD-Rs and DVDs are made mostly of polycarbonate substrate, or plastic. The plastic is there to carry the data layer - the shiny metal you can see when you look at the bottom of a disc. The data appear as marks or pits that either absorb light from the laser beam or transmit the light back to the laser/photosensor by way of the shiny metal reflective layer.</p>
<p>Most people know that it is very important to keep the bottom of your discs clean and scratch free. Scratches, fingerprints, and other debris can stop the laser from reading the data.</p>
<p>However, most people don't realize that the tops of discs are just as prone to damage as the bottom - if not more so! Although you can physically see the shiny data layer from the bottom of a CD-R, it is actually applied to the TOP side of the disc, just under the label. On some CD-Rs, the data layer is under nothing but a thin layer of lacquer. Damage to the top of the disc can destroy the data all together.</p>
<p>There are a few side notes that we cannot ignore here: The first being that CD-Rs and DVDs are constructed differently. The data layer in a DVD is more protected than that of a CD-R. However, this does not make it immune to damage.</p>
<p>Second, it should go without saying (but we'll say it anyway) that you should never write on or label a double sided DVD - since both sides are read by the laser.</p>
<p>Last, some CD-Rs have additional protective layers on the top of the disc, for example those with a "white printable surface." These CD-Rs, while more expensive, are far less susceptible to damage.</p>
<p>So what harm will come from writing on discs? Obviously, ballpoint or hard tipped pens can scratch the surface of the disc where the data reside, possibly rendering it unplayable. Anything that puts high point-pressure on the surface can damage the delicate layers beneath. Although this might not happen every time, it would be worth not taking the risk.</p>
<p>But what about those soft tipped permanent markers that everyone uses? Can those cause harm, too? Possibly. The tip won't harm your disc, but the ink might.</p>
<p>There is growing concern that components of ink from markers previously thought of as "safe," such as many commonly used permanent markers, will eventually penetrate and be absorbed by the inner layers of your disc, damaging the surface where the data is stored and rendering the disc unplayable.</p>
<p>Use of permanent markers</p>
<p>Various postings are surfacing across the internet from professionals and hobbyists alike, reporting that over time permanent ink has made their properly stored discs unusable. There is no apparent reason for the corruption other than the ink used to label the disc.</p>
<p>So what should you do? Consider the purpose of the disc. If all you're doing is making a music disc for your car, it really doesn't matter. You'll have a new favorite band before the ink has time to ruin it. However, if you are archiving precious family memories or other highly important data, don't write on top of that disc!</p>
<p>Instead, label the disc where no data is recorded. The inner hub area, though small, is a perfect location for labeling.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you didn't use the entire capacity of the disc during recording, you can write in the area that wasn't burned. Discs are written from the inside out. The area that was recorded is darker. The lighter area wasn't recorded and has no data, so it's safe for labeling. But, be careful that you don't cross over the line and into the data (see illustration). Note: Don't do this with rewritable discs.</p>
<p>Write in the area that was not burned</p>
<p>If you really want to be safe, use a specially formulated disc marker. It contains ink specifically made for labeling the tops of CD-Rs and DVDs.</p>
<p>What do I do if I have already labeled my discs with a permanent marker? Transfer the data to a new ink-free disc as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Don't even think about trying to remove the ink. Permanent ink and the soft porous resin of a disc are quite happy together, and don't want to be separated. Attempting to remove the ink will most certainly ruin the disc.</p>
<p>According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a properly cared for disc which is stored under recommended storage conditions can have a very long life expectancy. NSIT's research has concluded that CD-R, DVD-R, and DVD+R discs should have a life expectancy of 100 to 200 years or more. CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and DVD-RAM discs should have a life expectancy of 25 years or more. Less testing has been done for CD-ROM and DVD-ROM discs, however lifetime expectations vary from 20 to 100 years for these discs.</p>
<p>One thing is certain - proper care of any disc will extend its life.</p>

<p>The Feuling W3 is a patented 180 hp, three-cylinder air-cooled engine and may be the shape of things to come for those who fancy power cruisers. The W3 is an engine with 50 percent more displacement than Harley's Twin Cam 88 with the 95-cubic-inch factory upgrade kit installed. Taking inspiration from radial aircraft engines, a central, master connecting rod with two slave rods, one on each side of the central rod, direct the three 4.0-inch pistons through the cylinders. Cory Ness built his chopper using a Feuling W3 engine on a "Biker Build Off" episode. The design has already been tested in a 185-cubic-inch (3032cc) form and a 245-cubic-inch (4015cc!)drag racer was planned. Jim Feuling passed away in December 2002. The company was for sale july 2004 and still listed the W3 among its products.</p>
<p>Type: air-cooled, 3 cylinder 45 degree x 45 degree Displacement, bore x stroke: 142 cu. in. (2327 cc), 4.0 in. x 3.75 in. (101.6 mm x 98.4 mm)</p>

<p>Description about Institute/University The Bangalore University was founded on July 10, 1964 as a federal univ with jurisdiction extended to the greater Bangalore city. Initially, the university was built around two premier centers of learning, The Central College and The University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering. With the promulgation of the Karnataka State Universities Ordinance 1975, which aimed at bringing uniform law for all the Universities in the State, the univ lost its federal character and became an affiliating university. <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Http://www.bub.ac.in/buLogo.jpg">Image:Http://www.bub.ac.in/buLogo.jpg</a> Shekar2001 19:32, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tiro Island is a mystical island thought to be somewhere in the northern Pacific Ocean. The inhabitants of the island are believed to be descendants of the crew of the ‘Sally-Ann’ which sailed from the port of Padstow, North Cornwall in the late 17th Century. It is believed that they speak a dialect of Conish that has been corrupted with the native tongues of the Clouseo, who they meet on there journey, creating a new language Jibberish.</p>

<p>Xiku is a chimpanzee who was born in 1980. He currently lives in a zoo in Xian, China. While working as a circus performer, he became addicted to cigarettes. At one point he was up to a pack a day (zoo attendants would throw him cigarettes to smoke) but with the help of his zookeepers, he's been able to cut down to just four cigarettes a day.</p>
<p>Much like with humans, Xiku is known to become irritable when he can't smoke, and will jolt windows and doors. Zookeepers have been providing him with sunflower seeds and sometimes beer to help him shake off the addiction.</p>

<p>The Kyln is an intergalactic prison powered by the Crunch at the edge of the expanding universe. It also serves as a power source for many planets and civilizations. It also serves as a galactic tourist attraction, with certain races making a religious pilgrimage to the Kyln due to it’s proximity to the edge of the universe. Classification: Pan-Galactic power source and maximum security prison</p>
<p>Creator: Unknown, even Galactus claims to be ignorant of it’s creator (Annihilation Silver Surfer #3 of 4). A pan-galactic consortium of common interest parties apparently harnessed its power and converted it into the maximum security prison that it once was.</p>
<p>Inmates: Ch'ak, Cleric, The Fallen One, Gladiator, Maker (Kosmos), Moloka Dar, Mynx, Skreet, Star-Lord (Quill), Tenebrous, Aegis, and hundreds of other galactic miscreants goons goblins and villains Known Guards: Cole, Kika, Swad</p>
<p>First Appearance: Thanos#7 (May, 2004)</p>
<p>In place of guards, the Klyn keeps track of its inmates by injecting small nano-sentinels directly into the prisoners' bloodstreams. If the prisoners get out of line, the nano-techs can paralyze or even kill the inmates.</p>
<p>History: (Annihilation: Prolouge/Thanos#7 (fb)) - The Kyln were several truly gargantuan power-generating units on the very edge of the universe, drawing and harnessing power from the expanding universe itself. Nobody knows their origins, but they were found centuries ago and converted into both prisons and power generators. They were managed by a "Pan-Galactic consortium of common interest parties." The Kyln served as maximum security, death sentence exclusive prisons for the most dangerous criminals in the galaxy. The mortality rate for the inmates was 99.999% and the life expectancy was three years tops. The Kyln were also religious pilgrimage sites for a certain unnamed religion due to their proximity to the edge of the expanding universe. It was managed by the pan galactic consortium and volunteers from several peace keeping societies. They were also manned by clerics who perform maintenance out of religious duty. They were secretive about the origin and the truth about what was below the surface of the Kyln. Omega Core also worked there and served to deliver criminals and support the clerics there.</p>
<p>(Thanos#8 (fb)) - The nanotech security system was detailed.</p>
<p>(Thanos#11 (fb)/12 (fb)) - Star-Lord managed to capture a creature known as the Fallen One, but in doing so, caused collateral damage of 350,000 casualties. Both Star-Lord and The Fallen One were sent to the Kyln. The Fallen one was contained in a "creche", a cocoon like structure powered directly by the expanding universe to insure that it would not escape.</p>
<p>(Thanos#8(fb)/9 (fb)) - At some point, Ch'ak, Moloka Dar, Mynx, an unnamed Badoon, and Skreet came to be inmates at the Kyln.</p>
<p>(Thanos#10 (fb)) - The Shi'ar Imperial Guard captured the Beyonder in female mortal form, dubbed, "the Maker." They placed her in a creche at the Kyln. Gladiator went undercover as an inmate of the Kyln as well in order to be close to the Maker.</p>
<p>(Thanos#8 (fb)) - The Maker awoke from her catatonia and shut down the nano-sentinels in the blood of the prisoners. The prisoners took over the Kyln, with some throwing themselves behind the Maker, and some refusing to follow the Maker.</p>
<p>(Thanos#7) - Thanos went to the Kyln to contemplate on his new and unknown role in life while gazing at the edge of the universe. There, he was met by Lady Death, who tried to convince Thanos to love her again.</p>
<p>(Thanos#8) - Thanos met a rival faction that opposed the Maker and they explained the situation to him. They explained how the Maker woke up, put the power in the hands of the inmates, who then formed rival factions to oppose each other. Thanos agreed to fight against the Maker and went to see the Maker.</p>
<p>(Thanos#9) - While Thanos's newfound allies questioned the wisdom of having anything to do with Thanos, Thanos himself ran into the followers of the Maker. The Maker showed up and became upset by things that Thanos said and caused a massive explosion, destroying a good portion of the Kyln as well as shutting down power to much of it, while simultaneously shrinking several of her followers to fit in her palm.</p>
<p>(Thanos#10) - While Gladiator explained to Star-Lord how he and the Maker came to be at the Kyln, Thanos, who had survived the Maker's attack, went looking for her. The creature Skreet and Thanos found the Maker and jointly attacked her. Thanos defeated the Maker but did not kill her. Thanos fought the Maker once again and shut down the Maker's mind. The Omega Core reactivated the nano-techs in the prisoners' blood soon thereafter and restored order.</p>
<p>(Thanos#11) - Thanos went to the Creches and saw that the Fallen One had escaped during the period of time when the power went out due to the Maker's attack.</p>
<p>(Drax the Destroyer#1) - A prison transport ship en route to the Kyln underwent a systems failiure and crashed on Earth, carrying Paibok, Lunatik, Drax the Destroyer, and the Blood Brothers.</p>
<p>(Drax the Destroyer#4) - Rather than face the justice of Drax the Destroyer, Paibok activated an emergency beacon that alerted the intergalactic police to his whereabouts. Another prison ship then came to pick him up, and he was presumably transported to the Kyln as originally intended.</p>
<p>(Annihalation Prolouge) - An immense, unbelievably quick, and incredibly powerful army of star ships led by Annihilus emerged from beyond the edge of the universe and promptly destroyed the Kyln, blasting and destroying its multiple components and presumably killing everybody in it.</p>
<p>(Annihalation Silver Surfer 3 of 4) Two powerful beings are seen floating in space amid the rubble of the Kyln, they are identified as Tenebrous an Aegis. They speak to each other unaware the eons have passed since their containment within the Kyln. Through their conversation it becomes apparent that they are mortal enemies of Galactus, as Tenebrous tells Aegis to "Save her wrath for the Devorer of Worlds." We also see the Fallen One searching the rubble for the Beyonder (The maker in female form). Just as he discovers her lifeless body he is captured by Tenebrous' enormas hand. Tenebrous tells Aegis that it (the Fallen One) reeks of him (Galactus). When Tenebrous tells the Fallen One he serves Galactus, the Fallen One replies that he serves Thanos of Titan. Tenebrous replies that he knows of no Thanos of Titan. Aegis reiterates that the Fallen One is of the One called Galactus, the Fallen One replies that he hasen't served Galactus in centuries. Tenebrous then asks how long it has been since the creation event. Wherein The Fallen One replies countless mellennia. Then you see tendrails from tenebrous' hand wrap around the Fallen One as he tells the Fallen One "We will know all know, Fallen One, Then you will serve Tenebrous and Aegis..." At the end of the issue we see Galactus speaking with the Silver Surfer. Galactus asks the Surfer if he knows of the Kyln. Galactus then tells the Surfer that the Kyln at it's heart imprisoned beings of unimaginable power...those that defied Cosmic Consonance. He then explains that he imprisioned Tenebrous and Aegis within the Kyln because nothing less the the power of the crunch would contain them. After the Surfer and Galactus reconcile, Galactus remakes the Surfer granting hom even more power than before.</p>

<p>The Cray T90 was the last of a line of vector-processing supercomputers manufactured by Cray Research, Inc. The first machines were shipped in 1995, and featured a 450MHz clock cycle and four-wide vector pipes, for a peak speed of 1.8Gflops per processor; the high clock speed arises from the CPUs' being built using [ECL logic]. Configurations were available with between 4 and 32 processors, and with either IEEE or traditional-Cray floating point arithmetic; the processors shared an SRAM main memory of up to eight gigabytes, with a bandwidth of three 64-bit words per cycle per CPU (giving a 32-CPU Stream bandwidth of 360 gigabytes per second). The clock signal is distributed via a fibre-optic harness to the processors.</p>
<p>It is widely considered as being slightly ahead of the state of the art at the time it was shipped; the systems were never particularly reliable. At launch, a 32-processor T932 cost $39 million.</p>
<p>Cray T90 systems were installed, amongst other places, at at least three US government sites, at [NAVOCEANO] in St Louis USA, at [NTT] and [NIED] in Japan, at the [Ford Motor Company] and at [General Motors], at [NOAA]'s [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory], at the [Forschungscentrum Juelich] in Germany, and at the [Commisariat à l'Energie Atomique] in France.</p>
<p>The system chassis weighs ten tons and contains four tons of [fluorinert] coolant; it is approximately the shape and size of a very large chest freezer, and panelled in black and gold plastic.</p>
<p>Its successor, some years after the last T90s shipped, was the [Cray X1].</p>

<p>87.210.64.51 22:47, 26 June 2006 (UTC) super5onic is one of the new Dutch rock band.</p>
<p>super5onic has been established in 2004 by Michael Hamaker and Matthijs Ypenburg. And since there is no such thing as a rock band without a drummer, the guys looked after the person who would complete the image. Pascal van Baren shared the same passion for music and was added to the band. In order to complete the sound of the band, super5onic searched for a second guitar player. After a long search they found Bart van Kampen who’s been added recently to the band. From now on nothing will hold back this band from reaching their goals.</p>
<p>By choosing for a four member band, without lap dancers, block flutes and disturbing sound effects, the music proves to be timeless and pure. In a short time the competences of this band drew the attention of pop stages and record companies in the Netherlands and Mexico. In the early years the band was playing on stages as, Museumplein, Panama, beach club Bloemendaal, and several other great stages. Because of their endless passion for good rock music, super5onic proved to be a unique experience for the audience.</p>
<p>super5onic has been influenced by bands like: Oasis, Coldplay, Muse, Manic Street Preachers, and several other great bands. This combination of influences results in a one of a kind sound. One of the unique strengths of this band is their self written repertoire. All of their songs are catchy and fresh. In 2006 the band will dive into the studio to record several songs and turn them into real hit records: Out of the blue, Song 9, Come What May. Super5onic has already performed at several dutch stages like the panama, the museumplein and more.</p>
<p>super5onic contains al the ingredients to become one of the new Dutch rock sensations and we recommend following this band closely. You can check their website to follow their gig schedules: www.super5onic.com</p>
