<p>Take a look at this Australasian Furry community <a href="http://www.furry.org.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.furry.org.au/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Have a look at the plethora of different Furry art/comic/fiction sites they host. One of these, is the webcomic Fuzzy Things, seen <a href="http://www.furry.org.au/fz/" class="external text" title="http://www.furry.org.au/fz/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The entire furry.org.au domain returns an Alexa ranking of 300,000, maybe it's a notable furry community that's a different discussion, but is a one site out of the scores that are hosted there particularly notable? I don't think so, I don't think it is any more notable than any of the other sites hosted on that Furry community, and they aren't. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:03, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A webcomic, which can be found <a href="http://unseenllc.com/" class="external text" title="http://unseenllc.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a> at Unseen Studios LLC. It's Alexa rank comes back at over <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=unseenllc.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=unseenllc.com/" rel="nofollow">1.5 million</a> and neither their <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/fragilegravity/" class="external text" title="http://community.livejournal.com/fragilegravity/" rel="nofollow">Livejournal</a> nor <a href="http://forum.unseenllc.com/" class="external text" title="http://forum.unseenllc.com/" rel="nofollow">forums</a> are particularly active. The article claims that a book has been published, and gives an ISBN number which I can't seem to trace. However, there is a link to their book on the website, which you can only buy direct, and looks self published. This doesn't seem to be notable. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:03, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not particularly active is an understatement—the forum has <i>11</i> registered members. In addition to the nominator's concerns, there's no assertion of importance in article, the webcomic returns only 207 unique google hits, the comic's main webpage is commercial (see the "store" link) which is not damning all by itself, but still not a good sign and the book is not listed on amazon. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 00:19, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am the editor of said book and host of said website. Not enough attention is paid to the hundreds of thousands of women around the globe who consider themselves mothers but who are childless due to miscarriage and stillbirth. The book is in review with notables in the field of pregnancy loss through PLIDA, A Place to Remember, The Centering Corporation and has been endorsed by leaders in the field of pregnancy loss and pregnancy after loss. I don't consider the topic of being a childless mother SPAM, and I would venture any mother who held her stillborn child in her arms wouldn't either. - Amy L. Abbey, editor
<dl>
<dd>That's a red herring and you know it - appealing to people's sense of pity has nothing to do with the notability of an article. If you feel it is notable, write an article, don't just copy and paste a section of the book. Tokakeke 01:56, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The article doesn't even say what "Childless Mother" is. I think it's just the name of the essay that the entire article consists of. According to Amazon, Amy L. Abbey has one book to her credit, a book called "Journeys: Stories of Pregnancy After Loss." It's published by WovenWord Press, which, based on its website, seems to be Abbey's own press.

<dd>This is not an article from the book Journeys: Stories of Pregnancy After Loss. This article has not been printed elsewhere. I am not the owner or an employee of WovenWord Press. This book is NOT self-published. This article was drafted to enlighten individuals about the existence of childless mothers. Childless mothers exist. Are any of you childless mothers or fathers? Have you experienced this? It is a completely non-validating experience. Our stories have nothing to do with pity. Why don't you read it and decide for yourself? Childless Mother, the phrase, I defined in Wikitionary. My intent was not to SPAM, it was to raise awareness. Everyone starts somewhere, perhaps I picked the wrong place although I thought this was part of Wikipedia's mission. Amy L. Abbey</dd>

<dd>So revising this into an article more of an encyclopaedic format would be acceptable, is that what the consensus is? Are there any women here commenting on this?

<dd>In terms of article style, that is closer (vs just quoting), but one has to cite a reliable external source. As an editor, that source can not include ones own work. So if subject is covered by a notable book or newspaper article, then the topic gains notability and there are sources to cite as giving the views that are then sumarised in the encyclopaedia. As well as the situation needing to be described elsewhere, so does the specific term 'childless mother' (vs 'bereaved parents' which I agree is not quite what you are referring to). Slightly off-topic, but indicating the need to cite a source for usage, are there not 'Childless Fathers' too, so unless the term is specifically defined and in common use would 'Childless parents' be an alternative heading&#160;? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 15:14, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How does a book get to be notable by Wiki definition? Childless mothers and childless fathers have different experiences. As a mother, I can only write from a woman's perspective. Childless mother, the phrase comes up sporadically on Internet-searches, and is very recently being used. Elovesme99</p>
<dl>
<dd>That may be so, but you're inferring the <i>term</i> is notable, not the book. If the term is your main intent to write about, explain&#160;:it on Wiktionary. It should not even be on Wikipedia unless the term has some notability that isn't just it simply being a</dd>
<dd>term. As for the book, there are specific guidelines on when a book merits its own article. "Nonetheless there is no dictum against&#160;:any book that is reasonably spread or otherwise well-known or remarkable. Ask yourself if several libraries or bookshops, or a&#160;:no-subscription website have a copy of the book, so that other wikipedians can easily consult the book, or at least have access to&#160;:on-line or press-published reviews of the book."

<p>Hey. I made the tactics page. My reason was because I normally use Wiki for a whole lot of stuff, and that it would be good to really have some stuff all in one bunch, not to go to some other place to get this tactics and other. Anyway a lot of those gaming sites need a subscription. Who's gonna pay $10 or more just to see a little guide or some info on the units? Anyway, I'm still rather new to Wiki, and I value your opinion. Let's discuss some more. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7ERelentlessRouge_10ff.html" title="User:RelentlessRouge">RelentlessRouge</a> 01:41, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I appreciate your good-faith editing, and it's exactly what we need here. Unfortunately, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and while it'd be nice to have a general area of information, Wikipedia isn't everything. That's why we have Wookieepedia, Wiktionary, etc. GameFAQs is free, and has plenty of guides. IGN is mostly free, unless you want to see a video guide or something.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Not sure if I'm allowed to vote (will check later), as I'm a member of the IGA. I'm not the author, though, although I think one of the edits may have been mine (June '05). In response to some of the above comments: the IGA doesn't try "to make sports popular", it promotes <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gaming.html" title="Gaming">gaming</a> (all of the types listed on that disambiguation page with the exception of gambling).

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I think the subject may merit an article. For example, modern page printers need to be able to hold at least one page's worth of data in memory, which means they must come equipped with RAM, unlike, say, an older daisy wheel or inkjet printer where the paper is fed through by "teeth" (although many of these models, of course, do have memory). How did the older, huge, floor-standing page printers work? Frankly, I don't know. I don't really want to write it, but I think there's an article here. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 02:09, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Clairification</b>, because there seems to be some confusion here. There seems to be a difference between a "page printer" in the teletype context and a "page printer" in the computer printer context. I was assuming this article was about teletype printers because when I looked at it, it refered to the Morton &amp; Krum teletype patent and had references to teletype articles. Teletype printers of course were the ancestors of computer printers. So my assumption was that the article would be about the interesting if somewhat obscure topic of teletype page printers. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 03:55, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This article is completely disjointed. It originally was an article about laser and inkjet printers which wait for an entire page to be rendered before printing.

<li>Note that there were no cited references when the article was nominated and that they have all been added during the course of this debate. The comments made by people who "never even bothered to read the content of the cited references" were probably made before there were such references. Major additions have been made to the article.</li>
<li>P.S.

According to that document, your argument is baseless. <i>(Then again, such users contribute little or nothing in the way of original content to the project, but are always at the ready to condemn/destroy other people's work...)</i> <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolajimi_dee8.html" title="User:Folajimi">Folajimi</a> 15:59, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>With your addition of teletype material, the article now states that computer page printers were invented circa 1900, and patented in 1924. Considering that electronic computers weren't even in existance at the time makes the whole article is now very confusing. The teletype information belongs in <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teleprinter.html" title="Teleprinter">Teleprinter</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBige1977_d3fc.html" title="User:Bige1977">Bige1977</a> 18:17, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You make a valid point regarding the "computer printer" terminology. Considering that the printer in question was intended for use with telegraph equipment, the term should be de-linked, and the 'computer' prefix should be dropped.</li>

<dd>As for the teletype information, notice that they are included under <b>"References"</b> — this means that the information used in the article was drawn from those sources.

<dd>To argue my case, I simply saw a page for another author and did a listing for me. I didn't know all of your rules and within like 10 minutes Joe nominated me for banishment (sp?). I didn't intend to break your rules or do anything wrong, had never even heard of your site before. I thought it was cool and wanted to be part of it. Seems like a lot of fuss over something that really wasn't/isn't problematic. Not like I am trying to hurt people, I help women lose weight, empower their lives and get healthy. As for my rude comment to Joe, sorry, I am human. But jeez, within minutes he voted to have me banned, yes, to me it seemed a bit tattletale like and I knee jerked back to him. I deleted it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJuliaHavey_3e00.html" title="User:JuliaHavey">JuliaHavey</a> (<a href="../../../j/u/l/User_talk%7EJuliaHavey_19ab.html" title="User talk:JuliaHavey">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JuliaHavey_985c.html" title="Special:Contributions/JuliaHavey">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Delete</b> This still looks like an advertisement. The book cover image seems far too promotional and, therefore, inappropriate. The sentence "She is currently a motivator at a diet-loss website, eDiets.com" should be deleted, as it misleadingly implies that the author is a consultant to the website when in fact they are the sole operator. The link to the author's commercial webpage also seems too promotional and should be deleted. This author made a rather inauspicious debut on Wikepedia by attempting to create a self-aggrandizing Wikipedia page (presumably for commercial purposes), adding commercial links to the Obesity page, deleting substantial amounts of content from the Juice Plus page, and by making a personal attack on one of the editors. Also, it is salient that the author’s entry was self-submitted, which runs counter to editorial policy 15:10, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I didn't put the book cover there and totally do not mind if you take it off, that book is 3 years old! I am a consultant at eDiets.com, I don't even own stock in the publicly traded company much less the sole operator! That is not an accurate statement on which to base a delete decision. NOT correct.

So, if Japanese feudal lords are not notable enough for you, where do you draw the line? What about obscure Pharoah's advisors? What about the nobility or royalty of the Baltic states?

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't think this passes WP:BIO, and it <i>definitely</i> doesn't pass WP:V. Even if the person in question was Japanese and died centuries ago, <b>not a single Google hit</b> shows reason for deletion: either the info on the Wiki article is wrong, or it is a hoax, or he was non-notable. But in any case, it's still unverifiable, and that's grounds enough for deletion. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 03:27, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> That's not neccesarily true. Ficticious people may be, and often are, just as notable, and perhaps more notable, than most individuals. It's about the importance to society, culture, and other important aspects of humanity that people and objects are judged on their nobility. For instance, Santa Claus is a ficticious person but he is still more notable than most people. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 17:53, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Once again, Google cannot be used here to illustrate, establish, etc nobility or lack thereof. You are talking about an individual who lived too long ago and in a different society. That does not mean that the individual is not notable to that society or culture. More than likely, notability on this individual will probably have to come from written textual references which is why my delete vote stands until that may be given. English Google is more likely to bring back nothing but contemporary pop-culture references or specific holdings at American/Brit museums and archives. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 13:39, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b> - This article has no references/sources, is very <a href="../../../e/d/i/Editorial.html" title="Editorial">editorially</a> conceived, and has scant encyclopedic value. That's my vote. Downwards 01:36, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> unencyclopedic generic phrase. Every context of human culture and activity has their heroes and stars, and comparing someone new to those exalted figures as "the next X" is an incredibly commonplace and mundane statement in English. There is no indication that it is a significant and distinct phrase.

<li><b>Delete</b>, though not speedily. I should say that I do imagine a possible NPOV incarnation of the page, one in which the term is described and in which the list of players to whom it has been ascribed is fully sourced (as, for example, List of celebrities with links to the U.S. Democratic Party or <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_speculated_to_have_been_autistic.html" title="People speculated to have been autistic">People speculated to have been autistic</a>), where then the list functions not to reveal our subjective preferences but to aggregate the expressed subjective preferences of those whom we'd deem notable (e.g., <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Wilbon_fe91.html" title="Michael Wilbon">Michael Wilbon</a>). For me, though, such an article would nevertheless be unencyclopedic, consistent with Postdlf's excellent elucidation above. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:30, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Overpronation is a common problem that leads to injuries among many runners--a worthy topic. Currently "Pronation" redirects to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatomical_terms_of_motion.html" title="Anatomical terms of motion">Anatomical terms of motion</a>. There is also an article on <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_injuries.html" title="Sports injuries">Sports injuries</a>. Neither of these does a good job of covering overpronation/underpronation in running. Given the lack of content here, I suggest we <b>delete</b> and <b>transwiwki</b> the definition until we can find a better place for this to go. -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 21:23, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>merge/redirect</b> into any article which is even remotely on topic and collect all "pronation/overpronation" pieceds there. The topic has potential for expansion.

<p>Originally, I popped a proposed deletion notice on this article because it didn't even attempt to assert how this middle school is at all notable compared to any other middle school. I ran a google search on the school and didn't find anything particularly impressive about it besides the fact that it's a school. Thinking that I may have just been crazy in remembering that schools usually need to be particularly notable to make it into Wikipedia, and wondering if it was proper that my proposed deletion was shot down, I ran a search of past deletions and found that such articles usually end up having to go to AFD for a decision to be made. So, here we are, with this school article nominated for deletion on the grounds that it's barely a stub and not of encyclopedic notoriety. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 05:09, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I agree with merging the article into <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snohomish_School_District_d866.html" title="Snohomish School District">Snohomish School District</a>. How many schools in the US do you think are named "Valley View Middle School"? Dozens at least, I would guess, as it's a rather generic name. Obviously this naming convention cannot be kept if we are to allow any grade school to have its own Wikipedia article. As it stands, the article contains nothing to suggest that this school is any different from any other one. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERishodi_bcca.html" title="User:Rishodi">Rishodi</a> 07:48, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>The USC Chapter of Zeta Sigma Phi is the first chpater of the soon to be expanded organization. The sorority does have a national board. IMO you people should get a life or at least do some research. This sorority is very prominent on USC's campus, has been featured on MTV's "Sorority Life" and is in the process of expanding to other schools in the Southern California area. What is "a threshold for an organization or club?" An organization or club does not have to be a national organization to be a club. It is not a non entity at USC. It is the trademarked organization holding the name Zeta Sigma Phi. Again I question as to why the other non trademarked Zeta group's page was not deleted. I also question why two grown men care? Are you paying something to keep this page around on the interent? NO!

The only thing that matters is the relevance of Zeta Sigma Phi today. If it becomes a national sorority at some point in the future, then it would be wholly appropriate to add the national organization (though not individual chapters) at that time. As far as I'm concerned, a sorority (or fraternity... or any club for that matter) that is simply a local organization at one college does not have the appropriate level of relevance to merit an article on wikipedia unless there are some extinuating circumstances. You should also try making logical arguments as to the relevance of this organization.

<p>to Isotope23- I don't believe in changing peoples minds. You will believe in what you will want to believe. Very few people can be convinced otherwise. The fact that you don't have anything better to do outside this website is a sidenote. Zeta Sigma Phi is a national sorority, but It has only one chapter. The possibiliy of keeping the organization local to USC has been discussed, however the national board has never been dismantled. The national board deals with things outside the scope of the happenings of the group and is its own seperate entity. Again I urge you to do some research. You're whole argument is that Zeta is not a national sorority but it is which shows you are ignorant to the argument and therefore should not be commenting on it. You are refering to the lack of national presense as far as numbers of organizations across the country. What in you're esteemed opinion, constitutes the number of organizations a group must have before it deserves its bit of cyberspace? 15, 20? This is a usless argument. to Stacylynnaustin- Copyright you're Letters. If you're organizations letters were copyrighted, there wouldn't be another Zeta Sigma Phi. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tamarastern (<a href="../../../t/a/m/User_talk%7ETamarastern_8c9d.html" title="User talk:Tamarastern">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tamarastern_f727.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tamarastern">contribs</a>) 06:03, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>Something more than 1 chapter with 15-20 members. based on the criteria you want applied to your soriority pretty much any club on any college campus with over 10 members deserves a wikipedia article as long as they call themselves "national" and I simply disagree. Generally speaking, local chapters of national organizations get deleted. Saying that somehow a "national sorority" with one chapter is different than the local chapter of a national sorority is semantics. You can call yourself a "national sorority", but until you have an actual presence to back that up, you are "national" in name only. Feel free to disagree with me, but if you "don't believe in changing peoples minds" then it is sort of pointless to do so. On a side note, Stacylynnaustin's group did try to trademark their letters. I found that out when I did a little research before I opined deletion.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:35, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Zeta Sigma Phi is a national sorority. It has a national board with Almni and non alumni members completly seperate from the college group. I'm not just calling it a national sorority, it has an actual National board, something i'm guessing you're "research" didn't turn up. I don't see why National groups with limited individual chapters don't deserve a wikipedia page. You aren't paying for the service, so I don't see why you would be against it personally. . its not attacking anyone and its only non notable to you because you are a non sorority member in detroit. Further Stacylynnaustin's group didn't try hard enough to trademark the letters. They weren't trademarked for the almost 10 years before the USC group came into existance, leading our founders to believe they were a local non expanding chapter. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tamarastern (<a href="../../../t/a/m/User_talk%7ETamarastern_8c9d.html" title="User talk:Tamarastern">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tamarastern_f727.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tamarastern">contribs</a>) 22:42, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>Tell you what- I've confered with some of my sisters and we have decided wikipedia is not a reliable enough source to argue over.

<li>Tamarastern/128.125.67.141, Wikipedia would be pretty reliable if people would actually follow the rules of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citing sources</a> and writing from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. Some articles have achieved this, so it's not entirely impossible for Wikipedia to be a reliable encyclopedic (i.e., secondary/tertiary) source. Also, you should bear in mind that it's generally <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">not recommended</a> that you write about yourself, or a group you are involved in, unless you can write from said neural point of view. And just because people who are not involved with a group can edit an article does not necessarily mean it will become inaccurate, or untrue - more often the problem is people inserting their own speculations and biases into the articles. Please note that you cannot delete this article as you are not the only author, and the article has a number of other edits.

<p>Inherently POV: who says they are "significant"? Unsourced. Looks like Original research.

<dd><b>Point of information</b> I note that the article was only recently Moved from List of famous archaeological discoveries - which says a lot. This is really a type of "celebrity"-spotting article, of no encycloaedic value. It has been hanging around the Wikipedia ether since January 2003, and yet it has gained no actual substance or weight since then, only unsourced additions to the list. I spotted this because its related category is up for deletion at CFD:

<li>I would like to see the entry for Pure:FM kept in Wikipedia but edited to bring it in-line with the Wikipedia rules; it would be a shame to lose this web presence, but I can understand the reasons behind deletion. Best regards - Alex H (<a href="http://www.upsu.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.upsu.net/" rel="nofollow">UPSU.net webteam</a>).
<ul>
<li>If you're concerned about keeping the page then what I would suggest is finding out if there are either any notable alumni or an FCC license. If it's a part 15 campus station, it almost certainly isn't going to be notable enough for Wikipedia -- the exception would be something like <a href="../../../w/t/b/WTBU_06ce.html" title="WTBU">WTBU</a> at Boston University, which was Howard Stern's first radio gig. On the other hand, the general consensus has been to keep licensed stations even if they're in relatively small markets, so if you have a callsign you stand a much better chance. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 17:56, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thankyou for that information Haikupoet. As I'm relatively new to this (but would consider it to be a shame if Pure:FM lost their entry at Wikipedia if it was at all avoidable), are there any other ways we could go about securing it's place? As an aside, I'm not sure if it has been mentioned yet, but the station is a not-for-profit entity - the only site advert (at the time of writing at least) only makes a small contribution towards the station's overall maintenance costs - and as such stands to gain little or nothing in terms of revenue.

Freedman" is subject to debate. Basically the "Benjamin H. Freedman" story is printed and reprinted by the usual anti-Zionist crowd: Jew Watch, National Vanguard, and a bunch of other groups watching out for the Illuminati boogyman. His story is basically used as "proof" of the one thing these groups desperately want to believe: that Jesus of Nazareth was not of Jewish origin. None of these sources comes even close to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and all basically just reprint the text of his attributed book... no verifiable biographical information. But just for the sake of argument lets pretend someone can prove Mr. Freedman did exist. He still doesn't meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> as an author.

<dd><i>At last! I just got an e-mail from my buddy John Couse (aka "Doom Guard") who tells me that Wikipedia's "Lance Mazmanian" Page has been nominated for deletion. John's apparently adamant that the page remain, being a big fan of Dave Hargrave, and Arduin, and all. Myself, I'm happy to see the page burn. As a few of you well know, I've never liked that Wikipedia entry. It was started a long time ago by some well-meaning chap, but was so preposterous upon origination that it was frankly embarrassing (like some other similar bullshit that's occurred elsewhere (IMDb) by the hands of individuals with benevolent if completely unwelcome intent). Since the page appeared, I've had a couple of friends go in and tweak it to bare bones on occasion, because I was originally told the entry would not survive a deletion request. But even in a minimal format, the Wikipedia "Mazmanian" write-up is still premature and silly. Why? Well, while I'm indeed sitting in a pocket-universe of people who are definitely kicking-ass and taking names, I myself am in more of a "ramping-up" mode...like 20-million other boys and girls. So, while I appreciate the interview requests and other such fabulous stuff, it's all rubbish right now...until such time that it isn't. Besides, the people who read this so-called "blog" and visit my website number in four-digits a week... This is more than enough communication for the time being, and better yet, it's information that originates with and from the source. So please, Wikipedia, by all means delete the bastard! But do come and talk to me in a year or so...L.</i>

<p>The Alexa ranking doesn't tell the whole story. The VLRC is a unique metasearch engine in that it only indexes information pages recommended by teachers, librarians and library and educational consortia world-wide. As such, it represents the collective wisdom of the educational/library community. The purpose of this one-of=a-kind search engine is to help serve as a guide to students for valid information for school research projects. You may deem it "unremarkable", I see it as a needed resource. - Dr. Michael Bell <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.178.163.196 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.178.163.196_f434.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.178.163.196">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> Sure, there have been a lot of video games to take place (fully or partially) in London, so if this were to survive, it could be easily expanded.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unencyclopedic list, cruft, sets a bad precedent for other UE lists as Kicking222 said. It could certainly be expanded, but for what purpose?

<ul>
<li>Presumably, books set in NYC (or any other specific city/location) have some plot elements that make the setting relevent to the book (otherwise, the specific city would likely not be named in many cases). If someone has a good faith argument against this premise, they're free to prod or afd that article (as opposed to your <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>-violating nomination). I'm not a gaming expert, but at least from what I've seen, the city it's set in is more of a backdrop than an integral part of whatever level of story exists in the game. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 10:29, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Just because the realistic depiction was used as a marketing point does not mean that it's ultimately anything more than a very well-done backdrop. I haven't played the game, so I don't know if the setting has any practical relevance to any plot the game may have, but its use in marketing does not refute the claim that it's ultimately a backdrop. Only evidence of relevance to/corrolation with plot would refute that claim. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 23:04, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, this boy is named Joel, and the entire scene is a dig on the Batman movies directed by Joel Schumacher." In other words, it's not an LGBT themed show, and it';s not an LGBT themed series (only a single episode). And it's unsourced. This is an unsourced, unverifiable, arbitrary list of arbitrary entertainment media meeting an arbitrary selection criterion interpeted arbitrarily in an apparent effort to present a particular <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">point of view</a>.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> No Google News hits about these companies, they do not appear to satisfy <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. But, most articles in categories Internet service providers, Internet hosting and Web hosting will fail to satisfy WP:WEB for the same reason. I'm concerned it would be unfair to leave some while deleting others. If these categories are cleaned out leaving only companies that satisfy WP:WEB or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> I would change my vote to delete all of the above. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 15:55, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep <a href="../../../d/r/e/DreamHost_9e13.html" title="DreamHost">DreamHost</a>, Delete others</b>: I realize that I'm splitting hairs here.

Also, I'm recognizing efforts by <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> and others to provide some NPOV.

<li>You are right about Dreamhosts size, they seem to be the largest on this list. The number I found was 253,859 domains. However, this is only 0.38% of the market and places them as 28th in the world (see <a href="http://www.webhosting.info/webhosts/tophosts/global/?pi=2&amp;ob=RANK&amp;oo=ASC" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.webhosting.info/webhosts/tophosts/global/?pi=2&amp;ob=RANK&amp;oo=ASC" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>).

<li><b>Strong keep</b> I only know about DreamHost, who seem to have lots of exposure and lots of contented customers. Having a Wikipedia page to act as a collector of unbiased information about hosting companies is a useful thing for Wikipedia to do. What in fact is the problem with every hosting company in the world having a page at Wikipedia? Why is a hosting company inferior to an obscure, defunct car company or a specific type of old steam locomotive as regards being a candidate for deletion? (Personally I think Wikipedia could have a glorious role ahead of it as the world's default "<a href="http://www.lorp.org/blog/?p=17" class="external text" title="http://www.lorp.org/blog/?p=17" rel="nofollow">vocabulary of translatable identifiers</a>", quite apart from any content that Wikipedia publishes about those identifiers.) <a href="../../../h/o/t/User%7EHotlorp_2811.html" title="User:Hotlorp">Hotlorp</a> 15:04, 24 April 2006 (UTC).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Bravenet.

Bravenet qualifies, as it has been around since 1997, and its software and services underpin many if not most web rings, counters, forums, and guestbooks in the English-speaking web. <b>Furthermore</b>, unlike most webhosts, Bravenet appears in Google News <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=bravenet" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?q=bravenet" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>, as part of the Duke lacrosse players investigation as well as a portal article on creating a website. Not to mention the 14,000,000+ Google results. The lack of mention of something on Google does not indicate lack of notability, nor does a modest presence on Google... but an <b>overwhelming</b> presence on Google is a sign that it's notable. If anything, the article needs to be expanded to reflect Bravenet's importance to the web. By the way, in the future, please split your AfDs.

<li>Remark. I have removed the offending sentence quoted by nominator from the article. I have also posted a comment on the article's talk page, rather than here, because (I felt) it was more about the content of the article than contributing to the discussion here. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 20:39, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>remark. It looks like I have inapropriately placed this articele on Wikipedia. I could argue that the distinction between a directory and an encyclopedia is not significant online, but I certainly would accept that I'm wrong on this if that was the opinion of experienced editors and contributors. Because of this I will make no objection to it being deleted. However, i would ask that this be left for a short while as I have sent the URL to a significant number of people so that they could add to the entry. In the meantime I would appreciate any suggestions where I might find an open collaborative editing location that might suit a directory. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianmmulligan_bc1a.html" title="User:Brianmmulligan">Brian</a> 23:19, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Both articles were created by the same user (User:Afraidtorejoice), who was the sole editor on both pages (except for my Afd-tagging). As the edit histories are minimal, it doesn't matter which article is deleted, and as one of them is named properly, that should be the one we keep. If this article is kept, "Fifth Untitled Album" would in the future link to a Dashboard Confessional album, which makes no sense. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarryCane_57e2.html" title="User:HarryCane">HarryCane</a> 14:58, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that the other article isn't verified as being named properly. Thus, technically speaking, the other article is a hoax, this one is the verified deal.

<li><b>Delete</b> this singular example of hagiography.

Not that it's a problem, except in as much as the lack of references makes it necessary to rely on the reputation of the editors, but pretty much the only contribs from accounts with user pages are the addition of tags.

<li><b>Keep</b> There are lots of biographies on Wikipedia, that some people may consider "low value." This seems to be particularly true of the slew of American editors who have been editing/recommending the page for deletion lately. It is particularly troublesome that some of the criticism is grounded in an attitude of 'this isn't interesting to non-American readers.' That seems to be contrary to the Wikipedia spirit. If Wikipedia is a community, then it should respect that not all content will be equally interesting to all readers (including our friends to the South), however, that does not necessarily make it worthy of deletion. If you check Keith's web site, he has been published in nearly every daily newspaper in Canada (<a href="http://www3.telus.net/keithmarlowe/media.html" class="external free" title="http://www3.telus.net/keithmarlowe/media.html" rel="nofollow">http://www3.telus.net/keithmarlowe/media.html</a>).

<dd>User:208.181.120.222--How exactly do you know that it was Keith Marlowe who wrote the article in the first place? (disregard the history when making your case, because I could create an account with the name Keith Marlowe). Blogger82 (if it is indeed you): The article doesn't actually say how Marlowe's term changed anything with the Conservative movement in Canada. In fact, the conservatives voted away his youth wing after they merged. <a href="../../../m/1/s/User%7EM1ss1ontomars2k4_d48d.html" title="User:M1ss1ontomars2k4">M1ss1ontomars2k4</a> 00:35, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Does a person have to "change" something about a movement in order to have a Wikipedia page? I'm not sure Patrick Brown or Tasha Kherridan or any youth president really "changes" a movement per se. They are involved, and do what they can to defend the party's interests, the youth members' interests, and the conservative movement's interests. Marlowe was a vocal supporter of the merger from early on, and was a significant reason why the youth wing supported the merger in greater numbers than the party as a whole.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Keith Marlowe has been published in the largest newspapers in the country (The Globe and Mail, the National Post, the Calgary Herald, the Halifax Chronicle Herald, the Vancouver Province, the Ottawa Citizen, the Calgary Sun, the Whitehorse Star, etc.) including several of the major university campus papers. Marlowe was the president of the PC Youth Federation, which is roughly comparable to the College Republicans or the College Democrats. If you have a problem with Keith, a young conservative leader in Canada, having a Wikipedia page, then I expect that you will all have a problem with other young conservatives, such as Paul Gourley or Eric Hoplin (both national presidents of the College Republicans) having Wikipedia pages as well.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I think to delete this page is to ignore a critical part of history with regards to the merger of the Canadian Conservative movement in Canada. For someone that is looking into information concerning the final days of the Progressive Conservative party this page would be a suitable resource in conjunction with other pages. As I added some information that I considered to be quite relevant to this page, I suppose I bear some resposability for some of the information on it. However this can all be resolved through the use of edits and not through outright deletion. That would be considered an extreme measure. 137.207.120.102 is quite correct in pointing out that there remain many cases of other youth Presidents (from other parties and from other countries) on wikipedia. I doubt very much that as much internal-party change occured while those young men were in power that occured under Marlowe's. To remain fair, wikipedia would have to delete their webpages as well.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Seems to be a vanity piece and not really relevant to modern canadian politics or recent political history. It also has nothing to do with any political mergers, as Keith Marlowe is not noted in any Conservative Party documents as playing a key role. Also it should be note that Blogger82 contributed to the content earlier (most of the vanity content), and the IP address 137.207.120.102 is from U of Windsor. Why does all of the supporters for this page come from this school? It is true that other "youth" leaders have wiki pages, but no where come close to the overblown content that is in this article.

<p>President of the youth wing for one of Canadas lesser powerful political parties. According to wikipedia, for a political individual to have a page they must have held office in some level of government. Marlowe fails to meet that. Also this has been up now for five days. And should be deleted soon.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I put alot of efforts into making lists to add to wikipedia. I do not like the direction wikipedia is going, towards the traditional definition of an encyclopedia, rather then something more open minded. Wikipedia should be a reposatory of information for research.<br />
Many people would be curious to see how someone became famous. Prehaps a change in the title of the article and removing some people would please you. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECooltobekind_c5cc.html" title="User:Cooltobekind">Cooltobekind</a> 16:25, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Can you think of a way to make membership in the list more definitive? I could contest how "famous" half the people on that list are. Katherine Harris was a Secretary of State who refused to do a recount, how unusual is that? Does it really matter that Fabio is on the cover of romance novels instead of fashion magazines? Kato Kaelin was a witness...and that unusual how? --<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffW_9f12.html" title="User:JeffW">JeffW</a> 18:40, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Add Rosa Parks as another questionable entry. Hundreds (thousands?) of blacks chose to be arrested during that era for sitting in a whites-only section, using a whites-only pool, eating at a whites-only lunch counter, etc. Hers was just one of many similar protests. Unless you can define "unusual" the article is pointless. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 01:01, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I originally put the article up for prod with the following comment "I can find no mention of a Demon or an Angel called Fool in 'The New Testament of the King James Bible'. I've also performed extensive searches on the Internet and on my angel/demon listings without luck. Unless someone can cite it I think the page should be deleted, I have already informed the author". The author seemed quite certain that a reference existed despite this, which tends to make me believe it may exists in some obscure text. I agreed it was worth keeping at least for a period of time to see if anyone expands it. It has only been up a few months so is relatively new, though I guess it would be easy enough for someone to recreate later if it was removed being only a stub. -- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimirel_0763.html" title="User:Shimirel">Shimirel</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimirel_847c.html" title="User talk:Shimirel">Talk</a>)</sup> 23:07, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Unlawful enemy combatant is a term which is peculiar to USA activities at <a href="../../../g/i/t/Gitmo.html" title="Gitmo">Gitmo</a>. But <a href="../../../u/n/l/Unlawful_combatant.html" title="Unlawful combatant">unlawful combatant</a> is a whole big argument about the legalities of prisoners etc, from an international law view. Plus there is already a drive on to merge <a href="../../../u/n/l/Unlawful_combatant.html" title="Unlawful combatant">unlawful combatant</a> with <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.

Maybe such a distinction exists and maybe it doesn't, but even if it does, I feel it's too legalistic and technical a distinction to enforce in a page title to the uninitiated like myself.

<li>If that does happen then I agree that keeping may be in order. My concern here was that this article only has one editor and only presents a single point of view, a classic POV fork. The terms unlawful combatant and unlawful enemy combatant are used interchangeably and none of the references made actually attempts to make a distinction. It certainly is not a vernacular term, the administration has attempted to construct a legal interpretation of it, but the administration uses the terms interchangeably. They are claiming color of the Geneva protocols. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 22:11, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree the park sign was a part of the hoax and the park is not called Smeetfrog Park. I'm not especially keen on keeping the article, like I said it is very poorly written and in fact most all of the info appear to be BS. I nearly prodded it when I first came upon it, but then settled for tagging it as unsourced. When the user came back with a rather dubious source, I looked into a little more and found the Dream Theater productions, with quite a few related publicity links in area newspapers, the Access magazine article, and the beer, which are about the fictitious frog rather than the park. So, I'll shed no tears if this is deleted in its entirety. But it does seem enough of a curiousity that it might warrant at least a mention in the Ypsilanti article. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 04:10, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I always hate it when people argue and argue and argue in their AfDs, but I don't feel as if I've been clear, so I'll try again--forgive me for pushing. <b>One</b> of those links is about the park, a photograph of a homemade sign by one of the people (who I like a lot--this isn't a vendetta, it's an argument about whether information in Wikipedia whould be true) pushing the hoax. All the other links are about the nonexistent frog--this is an article about a nonexistent park. And a non-notable one as well: try this google search: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=smeetfrog.park" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=smeetfrog.park" rel="nofollow">smeetfrog.park</a>--it turns up <b>one hit</b> (a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlewhack.html" title="Googlewhack">googlewhack</a>!).

Maybe that will help clarify the issue. My interpretation is that for this article to be kept, it should pass the notability criterion and then be rewritten to be clearly about the hoax, not the nonexistent bridge. If AfD thinks it's notable, so be it (though I disagree, obviously), then it's rewriting time; I can live with that. <b><span style="color: #f33">·<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>·</span></b> 14:06, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree, this article should go. It is nonsense. If there is to be a separate article about the hoax though, it should be at Smeet frog, as the park sign was only one incident in the hoax. But personally, I don't think it has reached a point where it really needs it's own article yet. I think a brief mention of it in the Ypsi article would suffice. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 14:30, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I hate to seem nitpicky, but unless Wikipedia is planning to remove the articles on a bunch of other unknown/who cares? relatives of famous people who have not done anything "significant" in their lives, then I don't see any need to delete the Jack Berman article.</p>
<p>Otherwise, more information about Jack Berman should be included -- such as the fact he was Dianne Feinstein's first husband (they were divorced) and the father of San Francisco Superior Court Judge Katherine Feinstein, born Katherine Berman (she adopted the name Feinstein - after her father's murder, I think - so that people would make the connexion between her and her mother, and be more likely to vote for her.</p>
<p>In short, the problem is not necessarily that Jack Berman was a "nobody," but there's so little information about him in the article that it isn't possible to tell whether he was or was not a "somebody." For all we know, he may have been involved in arguing an important court case.</p>
<p>Or, he may just be a worthless nobody as one of the writers below suggests -- like *all* the rest of us, ultimately.</p>
<p>22 April 2006 23h50 PDT</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, I don't appreciate anybody being called a worthless nobody. You were the first user to use those offensive words. They were not used in any of the commentary below. You need to do some better research before posting on Wikipedia. My father was never married to Dianne Feinstein, and never had a daughter. I am his only child. I understand that this is an easy mistake to make, but there are many people running around with the same full names of other people. i.e. There is a Zack Berman who lives in San Francisco whom I went to school with. What I (and many others in the community) consider notable about my father is not the cases he argued, but his generosity with his time. Because of this, he had an <a href="http://calbar.ca.gov/state/calbar/calbar_generic.jsp?cid=11398&amp;id=7084" class="external text" title="http://calbar.ca.gov/state/calbar/calbar_generic.jsp?cid=11398&amp;id=7084" rel="nofollow">award</a> named after him. Lastly, I believe your logic is faulty and you were wrong in your opening sentence. There are thousands of users, such as the ones who wrote commentary below, of Wikipedia who spend enormously generous amounts of time removing articles about less notable people (outside of special interest groups and small communities). My father was a mentor to many lawyers and was known throughout the community as a <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensch.html" title="Mensch">mensch</a>, but outside our community, is only known because of his death. This is why I support the deletion of this article, because I have created the stub <a href="../../../1/0/1/101_California_Street_Shootings_9c8e.html" title="101 California Street Shootings">101 California Street Shootings</a>.

<li>Wikipedia is not a memorial. Like all encyclopedias, it is a documentation of great people and great happenings. My father was a great man. If you request that I further develop that thought I will. In the article proposed for deletion, I mentioned the many accomplishments that he had achieved, and did my best at not going on and on about what a wonderful person he was. The 101 California Street Shootings was a historical event remembered by many San Franciscans who didn't know the people involved. It made big news. I can and will cite newspaper articles on that one. If notability of that event is put into question, than I will go into further detail. As noticed by <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a>, I am the son of the deceased. Because it may have made my article appear to be a memorial, I have removed the line in which I mention his survivors. I will be happy to expand on any of the points if necessary. I have documentation including police reports and countless newspaper articles that I can email to you if you think you can do a better job on the article. I am in the eigth grade and am not a professional writer. As for the award named after him, this is no small deal. If you have not clicked on the link below, I recommend it. That is the primary award of achievment that has been awarded annually by the State Bar of California. <a href="../../../c/o/c/User%7ECocopuffberman_ef2d.html" title="User:Cocopuffberman">Cocopuffberman</a> 02:06, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> (and support for <b>move</b>) Daniel Case, supra, has made the suggestion that I was going to make, viz., that Berman is likely non-notable himself (or even as a shooting victim) but that the shootings are likely notable in view, inter al., of the sundry pieces of legislation one can verifiably tie to the shootings, so I'd definitely support a <b>move</b> to <a href="../../../1/0/1/101_California_Street_shootings_d603.html" title="101 California Street shootings">101 California Street shootings</a>, with the proviso that much of the Berman information won't be relevant there (I did rewrite the article a moment ago in order that it would conform to MoS, etc., in case it should be kept). I do appreciate that the article's creator is new to Wikipedia, but I do think his imputation of bad faith on Daniel Case's talk page was was inappropriate; I certainly don't infer any malign motive from this nomination. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:24, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>One of the speediest <b>keep</b>s you're likely to see around here. These lists of islands are perfectly standard Wikipedia articles, and are very useful for providing redlinks to not-yet-created articles (which is why a category won't do). And can you really see the value of the main article on a country containing huge lists of islands, lakes, rivers, towns, mountains, etc etc etc in that country? The main article would become so clogged with lists as to be worthless. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 04:32, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Recreated after being deleted under PROD, so essentially an <i>ex post facto</i> contested PROD. I don't deny the truthfulness of some of the things asserted in this article. I live in Berlin and hear people <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code-switching.html" title="Code-switching">code-switching</a> between German and Turkish all the time. However, I can find <i>no</i> evidence that this phenomenon is known as Aleturkish or Aletürkisch. I can find no evidence that any of the books listed under "sources" actually exist. I would fully support a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> article <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citing</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reputable sources</a> (that I can actually find on the Internet or in the library) on the topic of German/Turkish code-switching, but this article isn't that. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 22:29, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It makes too much sense to be a hoax, except that it <i>must</i> be a hoax. I searched long and hard, and in spite of my diligence, like nominator could not find a shred of evidence that any of the listed sources or even their authors exist. "Özyargılı" should be "Önyargılı" ("prejudiced") and presumably be part of the title; its appearance after a semicolon as a kind of afterthought (what does it refer to?) is strange. <i>Bulut Yayınları</i> is an existing publisher. I could not find the book using the search function on their web site, although that does not mean much because I could not find some books that I know for certain they published either. But these did turn up in Google search. "Deutschen Verlag" is somewhat suspicious; it should be "Deutscher Verlag", and as far as I know that name was only in use during the Nazi period. Or is it "Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften"? I don't know what happened to this VEB after the unification. Or "Deutsche Verlag-Anstalt"? For a book in a major language that is even a second edition, and as recent as this, and for a relatively sexy topic, it is really really strange nothing on it can be found on the Web. The search term "McCornigal" has 0 hits. "McConigal" has some, but "George McConigal" again zilch. Ugh. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 23:47, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Worst. Fad. Ever. I spend plenty of time in the Newgrounds BBS and I can confirm that "Cornelius mania" can be described as trivial at best, propagated mainly by preteens with little in the way of photoshop skills or humor. Cornelius is a stain upon the Newgrounds community and the internet in general. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.161.38.146 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.161.38.146_4a4c.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.161.38.146">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>As creator of the article I was hoping to expand this fad but realise I couldn't and so very glad that the "bedn fad" that's been going on for at least dreadful two years on the Newgrounds forums hasn't progressed elsewhere and has become mandatory for every single photoshop thread on the Newgrounds BBS. I'm fairly neutral with whatever decision is made whether to keep or delete this article. I tend to wonder how fads such as the "o rly" fad became an internet phenomenon when itself became quite tedious.

<li>Because the article isn't actually about the meme. It's a load of bollocks.

<li>The creator of the article here again, I see this article is progressing as there are people contributing to the origins of Cornellius (although it's spelt differently in different forums. It proves from the addition to the article that people would like this to stay up.

<dd>No, I am aware of who Christine Young is, thank you. However, just because there are thumbnails of her everywhere doesn't make her notable. The only thing it means is that porn webmasters and linkfarm maintainers view Young as a viable commodity; it doesn't make it so, however. As far as I can tell, she has been in a handful of movies and does not seem to have garnered any awards of any kind. has she been the subject of a particularly newsworthy article by a credible source.
