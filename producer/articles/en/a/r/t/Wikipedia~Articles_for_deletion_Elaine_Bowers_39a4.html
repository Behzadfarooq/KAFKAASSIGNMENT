<p>Character in a non-notable self-published book by a non-notable author. My vote would be <b>Delete</b>. If she keeps up the writing, I suspect we may see her here in the future though. <a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDipics_9566.html" title="User:Dipics">Dipics</a> 19:57, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia:Notability says, "not all notable subjects are famous or important." And according to Jimbo, the person who made Wikipedia, says that encyclopedic content "is information which is verifiable and which can be easily presented in an NPOV fashion". He also says this about Qubit Field Theory, which is something of little importance, "I'd say that not more than a few thousand people in the world have heard of it, and not more than a few dozen understand it. (I certainly don't.) It is not famous and it is arguably not important, but I think that no one would serious question that it is valid material for an encyclopedia. What is it that makes this encyclopedic? It is that it is information which is verifiable and which can be easily presented in an NPOV fashion." This means that even if it isn't famous or important, it doesn't matter - it just has to be verifiable with a no point of view -- <a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikallover_048c.html" title="User:Tikallover">Tikallover</a> 15:10, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Tikallover.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The quote from Jimbo above is the opinion of one wikipedian, not even a proposed guideline. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> has a link to some guidelines for notability for books at <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a>. It gives a good list of 10 notability criteria. This book doesn't come close to meeting any of them. I have no data on sales but would honestly be suprised if the sales for this book have reached three figures. Just because something is verifiable and can be presented in a NPOV fashion does NOT mean it is encyclopedic. For example, I have a dandelion in my yard. This can be verified, it can also be presented in an NPOV fashion. But encyclopedic? Of course not. Notability is the key. The dandelion is not. And, nor is the book per <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a>.<a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDipics_9566.html" title="User:Dipics">Dipics</a> 04:54, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> What if we merge all three of the articles into one article titled "Books written by Stephanie Apruzese"? The guide to deletion says "<i>Books are notable if well-known, and should be listed under the author if not</i>". --<a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikallover_048c.html" title="User:Tikallover">Tikallover</a> 15:14, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The author is not notable either. The standard for notability for an author per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work</li>
</ul>
<p>The author in question currently has one book that is self published and one other (the one in this article) that is not published at all. I have no sales figures but would be suprised if the one book that has been published has sold more than 20 copies to people outside the family/friends of the author. Writing a non-notable book does not make an author notable. In this case, neither the author NOR the book(s) in question are notable. I strongly suspect that the author of the books is the person who wrote the wikipedia articles also. Wikipedia is not for self promotion. Once this, or any other book by this author (or even all the books added together) meets ANY of the criteria for notability under <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> I will happily vote to include them here. Until that happens, and it's not even close, then I will continue to wish Stephanie well but will also continue to vote as noted above. <a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDipics_9566.html" title="User:Dipics">Dipics</a> 16:12, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Very Strong Delete</b> Let's cut to the chase here. The author of these articles, <a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikallover_048c.html" title="User:Tikallover">Tikallover</a> is also the author of the books in question and is, in fact Stephanie Apruzese. This can be found from the authors page at <a href="http://tikallover.deviantart.com/journal/" class="external free" title="http://tikallover.deviantart.com/journal/" rel="nofollow">http://tikallover.deviantart.com/journal/</a> . This article and the others about this authors books, published or not should be deleted not only as painfully obviously non-notable but also as flat out gross vanity. I'll cut and paste this to the other pages in question since we can't merge the deletions per <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1's</a> wonderful suggestion. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaner1_0920.html" title="User:Beaner1">Beaner1</a> 20:14, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I wish I could say something here. Thank you all. You've succeeded in making me feel like absoulute crap, which is exactly what everyone else in my real life does. I'm so depressed I could just die, have been that way since I was three, and now I feel much much worse! Thanks a whole lot! *bows and curtsies as she exits*. --<a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikallover_048c.html" title="User:Tikallover">Tikallover</a> 20:51, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Though you may have won this time, you all haven't seen the last of me! Oh no! Someday I'll become a great writer, just you wait and see! And when that happens, just try and delete the articles, just try! I've had alot of experiance with writing already, and someday, someday... JUST YOU WAIT! *insert evil laughter* --<a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikallover_048c.html" title="User:Tikallover">Tikallover</a> 21:02, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
