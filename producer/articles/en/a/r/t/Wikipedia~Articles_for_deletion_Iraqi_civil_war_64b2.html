<li><b>Delete</b>. This page was created by Reddi yesterday to conform with his POV idea of civil war. It is not appropriate for many reasons: 1. no civil war has happened and no sources are provided that state that civil war has happened, 2. Reddi provides no sources at all except mentioning of a worry about a civil war, 3. the page <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraqi_insurgency.html" title="Iraqi insurgency">Iraqi insurgency</a> fully covers the post-Invasion and worry over any <i>potential</i> civil war (along with many other worries), 4. this page was intended to promote Reddi's POV on these issues, 5. if starting a new page to promote a POV because the POV edits are not reasonable for the main page is the way to go, pages are going to proliferate. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 19:14, August 4, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: The Iraqi insurgency was more aimed @ the occupation and the immediate period afterward. As the transition to the new government is complete and reconstruction is given to the new government, the insurgency will be will be a older topic. The brewing civil war is a different topic (internal factions of the state against one another; NOT Iraqis against an occupying force). This isn't my POV, there are others citing this as an outcome for the condition of Iraq. If you think that there are no sources at all except mentioning of a worry about a civil war? There is this: Jaber, Hala, "<b>Allawi: this is the start of civil war</b>". The Sunday Times - World, July 10, 2005. See <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraqi_civil_war.html#External_articles" title="Iraqi civil war">Iraqi_civil_war#External_articles</a> for others. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">JDR</a> 19:17, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Response - sources have mentioned the worry of civil war and intent of the insurgents to create civil war from the beginning. These are no different. The difference is that the term "insurgency" makes less sense as the transition to Iraqi democratically elected government occurs, the U.S. states is intends to withdraw (without a timetable), and the Iraqis take on more security functions. Thus the term "civil war" may be used more because the other term makes less sense, but there is no real difference in activity or people involved, except as the possiblity of the occupation ending becomes realized. All this is appropriate for discussion on the main article, not a new subject. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 19:33, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sources have mentioned specific acts in the civil war. Read the Allawi reference for example. 30+ dead in one of the ethnic tit-for-tat battles is more than a worry, it's happening.

<dd>JDR or Reddi is ok. There is something new. The insurgent article was about the fight against the occupation (and the occupations associate institutions). A civil war is about the factions of the population against each other (not an outside force). It's more than a shift in terminology. The difference is in activity and people involved in those activities. The sunni groups are killing shia groups (and vice-versa). The people involved in a civil war will also include the kurds (they are not part of the insurgency). The Kurds are not mentioned in detail in the insurgent article. They are fighting the Sunni guerrila attacking them, not sure if the shia have attack them. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">JDR</a> 19:52, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I withdraw my comments as to this being a POV article or your intent to insert a POV.

<li>I am trying to be NPOV. We may though agree to disagree. The conflict has changed. The killings between various groups was not there from the beginning (I was an early editor of the insurgent article; this violence within the population was not there, to the extent that it is now, early on). It represents a terminology change, yes, but to address the different on-the-ground facts and circumstances ("iraqi vs. coalition" [then] contrasted to "iraqi vs iraqi" [now]). <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">JDR</a> 20:48, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <s>- Respectfully disagree with Kappa, apples-to-oranges comparison. =) The article on <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_III_4587.html" title="World War III">World War III</a> primarily discusses the nuclear armageddon that was believed to be a possibility in the latter half of the 20th century, but never happened. It is not a "crystal ball" situation, it's a review of history. And, it's rather critical history - <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_III_4587.html" title="World War III">World War III</a> was believed to be a possibility for over forty years and drastically shaped domestic and foreign policies for three major superpowers (The US, China and Russia). It also dramatically affected the lives of everyone around the entire planet and literally changed the course of history. Who over 40 in the US *doesn't* remember "duck and cover" drills when they were a kid in school? Or growing up knowing that the whole world could suddenly end in a flash of fire and there wasn't anything you could do to stop it? Other people from other nations have similar stories. And then, in the end... It never happened. Poof. Done, the Soviet Union went away. By comparison, the potential of an Iraqi Civil War is a prediction of a possible future event, not a recap of a historical belief. Even if it happened, it would not be as far-reaching because it would not cause the world to instantly come to an end. It is crystal-ballery at it's finest - yes, it's believed to be a possibility by a lot of important politicians. But only a possibility. =) <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 00:03, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</s> Recent article changes make it worth keeping, in my opinion, I have changed my vote. <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 21:15, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <s>- I agree that it's a difference of scale. Read my reply again - this is part of why I disagreed with you. WW3, had it happened, would have meant the instantaneous end of all life on planet earth.

<li>This isn't a possible conflict. The sectarian violence is occuring. Is it civil war? Many commentators say yes (with more affirming this position in the last few months; Allawi is but one that has stated that there is a civil war going on).

In <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> Jimbo says that <i>"...An article that makes no new low-level claims, but nonetheless synthesizes work in a non-standard way, is effectively original research that I think we ought not to publish. This comes up most often in history, where there is a tendency by some Wikipedians to produce novel narratives and historical interpretations with citation to primary sources to back up their interpretation of events."</i> As to the crystal-ball question, well, I do not think the phrase you cite applies here. That phrase is intended to allow for the discussion of things that <i>will</i> (with reasonable certainty) happen but have not yet. That is not the case here. I will grant that it may not be POV in the usual sense of the Wikipedian phrase, but I meant it more in the sense I just described: that <i>you</i> reckon this can be called a civil war.

<li><b>Comment</b> <s>I respectfully disagree. =) In the case of the movie, the source for the prediction was the movie maker himself - thus, we knew it was going to be done because he said he was going to do it (or, at least, it can be reasonably assumed he will do it). Under this basis, we should delete this article on the prediction of an Iraqi Civil War until the government of Iraq comes out and says "We intend to hold a civil war." Currently, what the government is saying is (paraphrasing) "We intend to make every effort to prevent any civil war from ever happening." =) If Michael Moore had said "I intend to never make Faranheight 9/11½," then there would not have been an article. =) (Note: Please do not mis-construe this comment as support for <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antichrist.html" title="Antichrist">Michael Moore</a> or any of his <a href="../../../f/e/c/Feces.html" title="Feces">movies</a>, thank you!) <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 20:34, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</s> Recent article changes make it worth keeping, in my opinion, I have changed my vote. <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 21:15, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I still do not agree. The interpretations of the events described is still original. It is an interpretation, and that is the key of the problem. We are not interested in publishing what someone thinks, until what they think has passed into fact. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 21:41, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree it's an interpretation - I've felt that all along. However, the author acknowledges this both in the article and in his citations, and the citations do cite people *other* than the author who are making this interpretation. Mainstream sources, including Allawi and major news outlets. I feel with the addition of an "Opposing Views" section, the encyclopedic nature of this article is properly carried forth. I've added a citation to the "Opposing Views" section that helps support the contrary view. Give the article a read again, you may find it's now a much better article than it was before. =) <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 21:47, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>It asserts its opinion as fact to be opposed rather than as a discussion of what's happening in Iraq. The introductions says <i>"The ongoing Iraqi insurgency during the Iraqi reconstruction serve as a sign for the existance of the sectarian civil war in the country."</i> That is pure assertion — it takes a series of events and concludes that, in the author's opinion, it is civil war. It goes on to talk about <i>"the existence of the civil war"</i>. This is not so much a consideration of <i>whether</i> there is civil war as an argument of the case that there <i>is</i>. We already have a non-interpreted <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraqi_insurgency.html" title="Iraqi insurgency">Iraqi insurgency</a> (which is at least a term used everywhere), <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-invasion_Iraq%2C_2003-2005_4f4c.html" title="Post-invasion Iraq, 2003-2005">Post-invasion Iraq, 2003-2005</a> and a couple others. This article recounts the newsworthy content from those articles and puts a spin on it. And now I've persuded myself that, apart from being OR it is also POV — it barely mentions the other POV. The content from this article should, at best, be added to one of the others that must surely have sections discussing the political impact of the insurgency without needing to unilaterally conclude that it is civil war. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 22:34, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>Nice work, but still not there and I don't think you can get there, without it truly developing into civil war. Anything with "civil war" in its title must define the civil war. There are no workers verses the elite, north verses south, slaveholders versus industrialists, communists verses the dictator, etc. Many have stated that there are no sides here. It currently is the most extreme form of anarchy, but I do not see "civil war." Yes, they all oppose the foreign occupiers, but they seem to oppose everything, which means simple anarchy. You still have multiple sides (ethnic conflict, religious conflict, social conflict, Bathaist political conflict, geographic conflict) with no objectives at all, or at least no objective other than fighting as an objective. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but I would <i>really</i> rather have it at Ethnic conflict in Iraq. That name covers religion-based ethnicity, as the India counterpart shows. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 04:06, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete or Merge</b> This idea has gained little ground at the moment, much of the information is just a reiteration of data that is contained in other articles.

<li><b>Conditional Keep (this modifies my original request -- I nominated for vfd -- but it is conditional</b>. The editors have done a lot of work and I do not think the article has POV. But it can not state that a civil war <i>has</i> happened, it must discuss the <i>potential</i> for civil war. No real source is provided that discusses that civil war has begun, only the worry that civil war could begin. So <b>my condition: the article describe the potential for civil war and its potential effects without implying that civil war has begun</b>. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 15:37, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete or Merge</b> The content is useful, but it shouldn't be under <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraqi_civil_war.html" title="Iraqi civil war">Iraqi civil war</a> right now, as whether current conflicts qualify as such is pretty nebulous at this time.

<li><b>Delete or Merge</b> with <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraqi_insurgency.html" title="Iraqi insurgency">Iraqi insurgency</a>. Some of the content looks useful, but I see absolutely no reason to have it on a separate page.
