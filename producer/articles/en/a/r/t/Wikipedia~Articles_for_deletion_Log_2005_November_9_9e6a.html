<li><b>Comment</b>: that the local newspaper of the city only mentions this station <i>five</i> times is a sign of non-notability. The article of the Manila times mentions this station only at the end of the article, in passing. The sentence is particularly interesting:
<div style="padding: 20px;">If you don‚Äôt believe religion is big business you don‚Äôt know how many millions of pesos evangelists and other ‚Äúreligious‚Äù leaders are spending to widen their communication network <a href="http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2004/jun/03/yehey/opinion/20040603opi2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2004/jun/03/yehey/opinion/20040603opi2.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</div>

<li>Hmmmm... Looking into this more, it looks like this is one head of a hydra, but a notable hydra. If we had an article on Apollo C.

<ul>
<li><b>Move to cleanup</b>. I agree that it is POV and contains some copyvio, but that can be fixed. Animutation is a somewhat popular Internet phenomenon, and a very well-known style of Flash animation. --<a href="../../../a/u/r/User%7EAurochs_96ed.html" title="User:Aurochs">Aurochs</a></li>
<li><b>Cleanup</b> Please research before nominating for deletion. Google lists over 12,000 references for this animation subgenre. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 17:48, 9 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I <i>did</i> research. I noted the 12,000+ references for "animutation". I then tried the same search with "Cicierega" as one of the keywords, and only got 487 hits. The problem isn't that there exists such a subgenre, the problem is that this particular article is so POV ridden and worthless that I think it needs to be scrapped and started over from scratch by someone who isn't trying to push an individual or an agenda. --Locke Cole 18:01, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I just have to point out right here that "hyakugojyuuichi", Cicierega's second (and the first that became really famous) animutation, gives 11,500 google hits, and that's an otherwise (nearly?) unheard of word. Cicierega's name isn't as famous as his creations, mostly because he uses various aliases and because it's just not relevant information to the flashes, but he's created or been key in creating numerous internet phenomena, most noteably the genre of Animutation and Potter Puppet Pals (34,300 GHits when in quotes). It doesn't make sense to argue that the popularity of his name is the only acceptable evidence of his popularity.--Anonymous (sorry) <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.187.202.112 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.187.202.112.html" title="User talk:70.187.202.112">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.187.202.112_c3a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.187.202.112">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>To be fair, "Slashdot Effect" (in quotes as a phrase) on Google gets almost 92,000 hits. Animutation only gets 13,000. If you just run the words "Slashdot Effect" (without quotes, as keywords) you get 1,750,000 hits. It also wouldn't surprise me to learn that some of those "animutation" hits are talking about something else since the pairing of those words isn't exactly a hard one to come up with.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but clean up. Animutation is pretty notable, and it is a generally recognized term.

<p>Wow you people need to get a life. Get over it. If you're going to delete it, just do it and move along.

There really needs to be a CSD along the lines of "Is a blog, blog author, blog-related neologism, or has ever uttered the word 'blog' in a sentence which did not also contain the words 'vain', 'rambling' or 'worthless'". --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 18:51, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Even though this was added by an AtomicPark.com employee, HorsePunchKid has a point: this is probably the best wiki article about a company by an employee of a company I've ever seen. I'm a bit conflicted on this one because while I certainly don't want to encourage companies to start doing write-ups about themselves on wikipedia (because 90% of them will be marketingspeak drivel that ends up in AfD), if they do, this is how they should be doing it. As for notability, they fall well below Newegg, but they seem to be a moderately popular software retailer... notable enough that I would definitely vote keep had this article been added by a third party. As it stands I'm leaning weak keep assuming good faith.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:10, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Well of course my vote is to keep it, I'm the guy who wrote it. Yes, I am an AtomicPark.com employee but I think I did a good job making the article as neutral as possible. I could have just as easily registered as an unbiased 3rd party and hidden the fact that I work for the company, but I'm an honest and straightforward guy. And why is it that a company needs to be as big as Amazon to be considered notable? If there are any problems with this article, why is it simply not just edited? --Atomicpark

<li>Your first question is a leading question that takes a falsehood, an erroneous description of our <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> criteria, as its premise and is thus unanswerable.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. Nice and neutral, but I'm questionable on the notability (many google hits, but mostly to ad-related items) and still feels a little too much like vanity and linkspam.

<li>"One" doesn't equal multiple, but there is other news coverage as well. There's an <i><a href="../../../c/n/e/CNET_5df9.html" title="CNET">CNET</a></i> article that I've found and am thinking of adding.
<p>As for the news article: A major point of the exclusions in the WP:CORP criteria is to exclude the humdrum "Acme Corp will be opening late for Christmas again this year" style of article and simple self-publicity. (See <a href="http://www.pr.com/press-release/3323" class="external text" title="http://www.pr.com/press-release/3323" rel="nofollow">this</a> for the sort of self-sourced press release which doesn't count.)

<p>Two definitions in the same article, but are questionable. The first one lists references the term balle being used as a slang in a game. The second refers to Business Alliance For Local Living, which may have some merit, if that article was created or moved under Business Alliance For Local Living with perhaps a bit less POV. Balle is the name of a rune scriber in Sweden during the 11th century, however I did not believe it correct to disambigiousize this page to reference the two current entries.

<li>Although the article has been modified to address the subject more from the point of view of what scenarios science fiction writers envision, no effort has been made to cite sources demonstrating that the article is not original research, the concern that I expressed above. We have articles on themes encountered in fiction. See <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_Warehouse_a55d.html" title="Government Warehouse">Government Warehouse</a>, for example. Note that they <i>cite sources</i> demonstrating that the idea is not a novel one unique to its creator or to Wikipedia.
<p>Also, as <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> points out, <i>if</i> the intent is to cover what science fiction writers consider to be the possible consequences of first contact, this is territory that is already covered properly (citing the opinions of specific science fiction authors) in <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_contact_%28science_fiction%29.html" title="First contact (science fiction)">first contact (science fiction)</a>, and (since there's nothing to merge) this is now at most a redirect. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:15, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is effectively a religion to some folks and deserves the same careful NPOV as articles on other theological concepts. Yes, it needs sources, but from the looks of it those should be available. I just heard a Harvard professor on NPR discussing her extensive interviews with "contactees", whom she carefully and NPOVely described as deluded. That shows to me that the field has been properly studied and that "pro and con" material is available. If this article doesn't improve in a few days then I'd be happy to delete it but I think there is room for growth. Wikipedia has the opportunity for being a rare NPOV source on the alien abduction faith. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 12:50, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>How can something as horrific as a alien abduction be a religion, See Malevolent alien Abduction Research's website about the <i>real</i> alien agenda. Thats like forming a religion around a cruel rapist. Because a deceptive agenda is indicated, I say this is a STRONG KEEP.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 08:22, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah, here we are; the MAAR's website is the "cranksite" I had in mind. How can you verify the "real" "alien agenda"? Your opinions ("horrific") and conclusions ("deceptive agenda" leading somehow to "strong keep") are not valid criteria of what is or isn't encyclopedic. If we see verifiable evidence that many people are following a religion based on alien abduction, then we'll keep an NPOV article documenting that.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Some of the keep and merge votes above are on the basis that (as rewritten) the article covers something which has at least some validity as a subject. I don't dispute that, but I would draw people's attention to the following articles:</li>

<li>KEEP. What is everyone's freaking deal with Lemon Demon? You want to delete virtually all existence on Wikipedia of one of the weirdest (yet finest) musical projects to come out of the 21st century?

<li><b>Comment</b>: I touched this page during new page patrol. If you look at the initial entry, it mentions a magazine called <i>Al Liamm</i>. If you look in Google results for "Dan ar Wern" you get <a href="http://alliamm.com/klask1.php?dib=2&amp;dib2=717" class="external text" title="http://alliamm.com/klask1.php?dib=2&amp;dib2=717" rel="nofollow">this page</a> which shows he's published, but I think the magazine is in Breton, so I wasn't able really to determine his notability, and I was inclined to give a little more leeway to Breton-language poets as simply being one might just be notable enough. However, I agree that it might be a vanity entry -- an anonymous user from the same IP block added the article to <a href="../../../../fr/d/a/n/Dan_Ar_Wern_f63d.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Dan_Ar_Wern">fr:Dan Ar Wern</a> and a user named <a href="../../../../de/d/a/n/Benutzer%7EDAN_AR_WERN_36fa.html" class="extiw" title="de:Benutzer:DAN_AR_WERN">DAN AR WERN</a> added <a href="../../../../de/d/a/n/Dan_Ar_Wern_f63d.html" class="extiw" title="de:Dan_Ar_Wern">de:Dan Ar Wern</a>. <b>No vote.</b> --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-weight: bold; color: #33C;">howcheng</span></a> <small>[ <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">t</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howcheng_7e82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howcheng">c</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.howcheng.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.howcheng.com/" rel="nofollow">w</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><i><b><span style="color:#0C0">e</span></b></i></a> ]</small> 19:15, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Good effort, but I'm sorry to say that I'm still unpersuaded. Even for things people aren't ashamed of at adulthood, there's a pretty clear difference between fictional universes (of which there are an infinite number) and the single real one. (Unless you're arguing for epistemological relativism, in which case no notability criteria are possible.) Keeping our science here while letting the Star Trek fans track Star Trek science elsewhere seems pretty reasonable to me. Similarly, some fiction is notable for its cultural effects in banal reality, so a short article on Sherlock Holmes here could happily link to the exhaustive (and to most, exhausting) pseudo-biography that fans and academics yearn to compile. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 06:23, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It's not about like vs. don't like. I'd say that a good half of the books I read are science fiction, I have a collection of several thousand SF books.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Agreed... here is a good example of what could be done with the DOA characters: <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Stark_cda7.html" title="House Stark">House Stark</a>. I don't know if you are in any way familiar with the work of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_R._R._Martin_adce.html" title="George R. R. Martin">George R. R. Martin</a>, but his books have hundreds of characters. Rather than create a separate article for each character though, the information is collected by family. To me this is a preferable way to collect the information, rather than cluttering things up with 100 separate articles about each character. This isn't a question of "liking" or "not liking" something. If I saw articles about every single character in The Song of Ice and Fire, I would vote to merge and delete, even though it is my favorite fantasy series ever written.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:11, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I disagree with deleting this article. Ernie Wetzler's accomplishments are quite notable. Not only was he awarded the HOPE Scholarchip (which is quite impressive on its own merits), but he also went on to become the youngest VP in the history of FIU Law School. Where does one draw the line on what is notable and what does not meet that threshold? It all seems quite arbitrary. Lopman 02:28, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

Based on this fact, I'd have to question whether his push to have this article deleted is based upon jealousy for having not been Vice President or personal malice towards the subject matter as opposed to any objective consideration of the merits of its notability.

<li>"Film Out" IS legit. Film out is a real term and a real process. In filmmaking, film out is the actual term used to describe the process of turning a video program into a film print. Also, it is broader than merely the film recording stage of the process. Sadly, it is spelled different ways -- with or without a hyphen, or as one word. It seems the hyphenated version may be the most common. The film out process is significally different depending on the regional standard of the video original in question, NTSC, PAL or SECAM; thus separate discussions are warrented for each type. Moreover, it would be worth finding out if the term is mainly used in NTSC regions -- it is a good bet that a different term is used in Europe, where one must cope with the speed version frame match choice of PAL when doing film out.<small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoontaurus_5462.html" title="User:Moontaurus">Moontaurus</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoontaurus_c1e6.html" title="User talk:Moontaurus">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Moontaurus_68bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Moontaurus">contribs</a>) 21:50, 9 November 2005 (UTC).</small></li>

<li>Hi there. "Film out" is process understood in the world of video and filmmaking, beyond just the industry. Useful "research" for instance: one can check in with one of the many "film out" companies linked in the article. One can also check in with independent filmmakers on IMDB and elsewhere on the internet -- especially documentary filmmakers. Thousands of filmmakers each year film out their projects. One can also find many articles on the subject, such as in American Cinemagrapher and many other popular as well as trade journals. I am sure that as this article matures that there will be added related discussion to the many known documentaris -- such as Dog Town and Z Boys, Farenheit 911, many many others -- that have been filmed out.

<p>COMMENT: How did so many people come across this article?</p>
<p>REPLY: Recently we puertoricans have come across this news, as more and more people realize that a known band is being deleted from this page more puertoricans will stand up</p>
<dl>
<dd>(A more rationale reply) Something I enjoy about Wikipedia is the idea of consensus. It's not like a vote <i>per se</i>. If I see on AfD that more than three people voted to delete and no one has voted to keep - I don't need to poke my nose in. Only when there is a disagreement will I look at the article and then weigh in on the debate. Here we have what appears to be a debate - but in reality it's deletes and sockpuppets. More people will enter the fray if they believe the voting is being skewed by puppets. Ifnord 23:27, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"KEEP" I know all members of this band personally. They are rising stars and have the contacts to be big. There album do to come out in the next months will be extremly succesful down here in P.R. I know this because they are extremly passionate about there music. They are also racking up the gigs at battle of the bands they also play at most school or student organized activities and everybody loves them.</p>

<p>KEEP- they show a good sense of music and talent. They should be given the recognition they deserve. It is not easy to have a band like that at that age, I think that you should keep the article to it serves as an example to other musicians that wish to be in a band. This serves as an example to young kids and adults to never give up your dreams, just stick with them and you will acomplishe in life what yu want.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't even think it's good OR. The author fits the number of vetoes (he doesn't say whether he means cumulative number, or number in a given year) to an unmotivated empirical curve that predicts the number will eventually go negative, and in which he uses the term "log" without specifying whether it's natural log or base-10 log.

<li><b>On deletion</b>. <small>Sorry if this post comes too late (I didn't know the authors could discuss their own possibilities.)</small> Firstly some concern about the funny speech from <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a>~~ <i>1_Cummulative vs relative data?</i> Can it be so hard to decide, even if the text insists with contumacy that vetoed proposals per year, among a total of n=206 instances, occur at a given percentage? <i>2_Logarithm base?</i> When reading 'log', and not 'ln', the base is usually decimal in nature, as can be seen <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logarithm.html" title="Logarithm">here</a>, this reference being evidently NPOV (otherwise it couldn't be <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logarithm.html" title="Logarithm">there</a>.) <i>3_Unmotivated regression curve?</i> Don't forget it has been obtained after deep meditation, which involves stochastical methods in order to find out the best function fitting to data pool. <i>4_Very unclear political message?</i> I wonder, when things result as dark as you say, if it actually does exist. Lastly something about encyclopoedic nuances ~~ (.../...)
<ul>
<li>OK, way off topic, but no, you didn't read the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logarithm.html" title="Logarithm">Logarithm</a> article carefully enough. There are (at least) two competing conventions, and the author didn't say which was being used. As for "deep meditation", I don't reject that out of hand as a source of knowledge, but it's hard to source it in an article. Also, maybe the author needs to see his guru and get his mantra adjusted, if the one he's got has him predicting negative vetoes sooner or later. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 23:01, 10 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Pavorous neutrality is hitting again, isn't it?~~ May I suggest either of the following ways to solve the negative vetoes' dilemma? Negative veto = positive vote; or negative veto = <i><a href="../../../s/i/n/Singularity.html" title="Singularity">singularity</a></i>. Even the best, more reputated <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitational_singularity.html" title="Gravitational singularity">mathematical models</a> have some pathological behavior when applied to certain domains.

<li><b>On deletion (.../...)</b>. In this particular article there are verifiable, massive data emphasizing certain policies that could be historically relevant. Why to waste such <i>encyclopoedic</i> knowledge by deleting the entire node? I thing to have understood that everybody here can edit whichever it's the article they decide. Obviously you had my permission to do it with mine. But you are reluctant because of your restrained policy, or something whose goal I'm not able of reaching. Thus, the point now is: should it be feasible to modify the node as aseptically as possible? I mean, a few words and a link to <a href="../../../e/2/_/E2.html" title="E2">E2</a>?.

<p><b>Delete</b>.It is dictionary definition for a made up word. There is no reason to keep it. It has "no encyclopedic value" as it is nonnotable as an extremely little used word at best and original research/factually untrue at worst. I would transwiki it to Wiktionary but given that it's a neologism, that would be silly. The definition has been changed significantly by the creator of the page since its creation, showing that it is either completely contrived, or is so new as to have no stable definition and hence be a nonnotable current event not worthy of our time. This falls under the informally proposed speedy deletion category of Complete Bollocks, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Poffenberger_b8ac.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Poffenberger">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Poffenberger</a>. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a> 16:01, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>No notability of this person is given. She has a PhD, yes, but...there needs to be more than that to merit an article, in my opinion.

While I'm certain that the individual in question merits a mention on someone else's page (his father's page, for example, who seems marginally noteworthy in his own right), this entry reads simply like a geneology entry, and provides no reason why Jerome Napoleon Charles Bonaparte is, himself, worthy of a full, seperate Wikipedia entry. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction">Extreme Unction</a> 15:18, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This list is absolute nonsense and should be deleted.. The list is absolutely not credible or reliable... the definition that the writer tries to explain is vague and totally subjective. There is already an article ranking EU cities by official "city" populations that has credible sources unlike this. Instead of this being one list from one definitive official government source listing the largest cities in Europe according to a uniform standard, this is just some one person's √∫nofficial collection of information from various "sources". This is simply not an official list from a credible source. The author of the article also labels the article an "attempt" to rank EU cities by size - his attempt. I don't think the Wiki is the place for such attempts let official government offices do that. The defintion used here to define an urban area is an invention of who ever wrote this article and is not applied uniformly throughout the article. The ranking is mostly confusing misinformation - there are some things here that simply make no sense- why does the Paris urban area encompass basically all of the Ile de France region, a huge region including urban, surburban, and even rural areas, while London here only includes the areas inside the so-called Green Belt when the city's surbuban sprawl is far larger. And those are just two examples of the many anamolies here. I don't get it - the method used for this list is nonsense and is not in line with any EU statistics or in many cases the official sources from the individual cities. It is articles like this that makes so many people distrust the information on wikipedia. 84.153.37.123 12:19, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I said the article should be deleted and not rewritten, I only suggested rewriting as one possible alternative in case nobody saw a reason for deletion. The article is flawed - the title says list largest urban areas in the EU, there is already an article listing the largest cities in the EU according to official population. The ranking is not credible or official as i said and that makes the article unneccesary in my opinion. Maybe I was not totally clear but i do think the article should be deleted. --Jimini 14:09, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I can not see how this article can be fundamentally improved- the whole problem is the author's notion of an urban area- it is pretty much a one-man invetion and the ranking is not trustworthy at all... I don't see what mediation will change for this and after all there is already a Wiki article that lists the EU cities ranked by <b>official city</b> population.. --Jimini 21:11, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>How would you improve it unless you delete the ranking, which is the reasoning behing the article - I do not see any way to improve it..without a real list (ranking) by some official source, which I guess the EU has not made so as not to offend anyone probably.--Jimini 21:17, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The angry user who proposed the list for deletion doesn't seem to know much about statistics. It's not even worth arguing. Everybody just check the World Urbanization Prospects report pulished by the United Nations in 2003 (<a href="http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wup2003/2003WUPHighlights.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wup2003/2003WUPHighlights.pdf" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>), look at Table A.12, and you'll see that the UN figures are strikingly similar to those in the table proposed for deletion. So if the list is "absolute nonsense" and "absolutely not credible", then call the United Nations statisticians to let them know that their data are absolute nonsense and that you know better. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 03:54, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well it is your list so of course you are going to say keep it..and actually you make a good point if the UN stats are so similar, why not just use those official stats instead of your little collection. And I am not angry I just think your list is not credible.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Permanently incomplete could be said about any history article. If its gotten messy, clean it or add a cleanup tag.

<li><b>Keep</b> The information is useful and encyclopedic. Perhaps the format can be worked on some, the the list could be more tightly defined (such as Law phrases, every day speech phrases, reference phrases, philosophy phrases, etc.).

<li><b>Comment</b>: I disagree that this is a bad-faith nomination, but have no objection to the article. However, it should be limited to Latin phrases that are still in use and its name should be changed to something like "Common Latin phrases" or "List of common Latin phrases". -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 20:44, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I don't think this is necessarily a bad faith nomination... but this is possibly the first useful list I've ever seen on Wikipedia. It's notable in the respect that many of these phrases are used today, particularly as legal jargon.

<li><b>Keep</b> Agreeing with above, this isn't really a definition, more encyclopedic. Beside which, it is well written, so it it were to be removed from here it should be put into the dictionary, but it won't fit well there (as it's a list).</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> "Permanently incomplete" is actually a nice definition of true knowledge (or else one might consider deleting Wikipedia&#160;;-)). But I do agree with the point that the article could do with some restructuring, plus a few general explanatory remarks on the history of Latin phrases in English, with links to the appropriate articles. <a href="../../../t/2E/a/User%7ET.a.k._7c6e.html" title="User:T.a.k.">T.a.k.</a> 23:20, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's useful information. I just looked up per se because I know someone who uses the term with annoying frequency.

<li><b>Keep</b> For a rapidly advancing technology, such as Ajax, lists such as these provide valuable references. Occasional "pruning" eventually may be needed of really "old" entries.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is one of the best articles on wikipedia, even if it is just a collection of links. AJAX is in its infancy, and only some websites implement it as yet. I would not have known about many <i>AJAXed</i> websites, were it not for this article. I view this article as a growing list, and a prime example of the benefits of collaborative writing. This article would need to be deleted/modified when the list of AJAX websites is huge, but now is not the time. <i>(unsigned comment by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.93.219.169_c15e.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.93.219.169">User:65.93.219.169</a> - first edit on WP)</i></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> For anyone interested in learning more about AJAX this list of early adopters allows one to research the breadth and types of web applications which can be built, and the maturity of those applications. <i>(unsigned comment by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_162.33.148.242_ba68.html" title="Special:Contributions/162.33.148.242">User:162.33.148.242</a> - first edit in 5 months; four edits total, two on this page)</i></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Until (if) the technology becomes truly ubiquitous, it is useful to give instances of the technology's use. Paring the list to only a few and including those into the article would take away from this purpose as someone wanting to educate themselves on a technology not yet in broad use would probably want to see it used in a variety of circumstances to observe what uses are closest to his/her specific interest &#160; I found the list useful for that reason. The advertising danger seems relatively small given that a site would have to specifically fit in a relatively small population of sites that use AJAX. Since the use of the technology isn't ubiquitous, this isn't "turning the Wikipedia into a web directory." <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Faanes_5d45.html" title="User:Adam Faanes">Adam Faanes</a> 10:20, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> NIV themselves claim: <i>Scripture taken from the HOLY BIBLE, NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION¬Æ. Copyright ¬© 1973, 1978, 1984 International Bible Society. Used by permission of Zondervan. All rights reserved.</i> That suggests that the christian's bible is indeed ¬©. It seems unlikely (and certainly seems to go against what the christians' god has to say on the matter) but there we go. Perhaps this is to do with money rather than real ¬©? Whilst this is hardly the place to discuss it, I seem to recall something about the christians' messiah being a bit of a lefty when it came to capitalists in the temple. ‚û® <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">‚ùù</a><b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">REDVERS</font></a></b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Redvers_11cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Redvers">‚ùû</a> 21:09, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>No consensus.</b> While I seriously doubt the validity of this article, and question some of the votes, there's still no consensus after the most liberal vote-ignoring. When only taking into account users with 10+ edits from Nov. 1 to Nov. 8 or 100+ edits total, and throwing out users who provided no reason for deletion and who had virtually quit editing before this AfD, I nevertheless get 8 delete votes, and 5 keep votes. I can't make a call to delete. Feel free to nominate again when the sockpuppets go away, and see what happens. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> <a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">(talk)</a> 00:02, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Like I said, it's up for debate, I'm not saying he did or didn't.

<dd>Irregardless, he's as relevant to society as say <a href="../../../m/a/d/Maddox.html" title="Maddox">Maddox</a>. (And gets more <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Ghits</a>) Should we delete his Wikipedia article? I agree that this sort of goes off on insignificant notes, such as his musical but that's the folly, in my opinion, of having to expand Wikipedia articles. The Internet is a very splintered, esoteric, and irreverent place, and part of the problem is Wikipedia's lack of guidelines for creating articles related to Internet culture. (Really, vanity articles are subjective. What's to stop someone for making a Wikipedia article about a really popular LJ article) As it is, I always think the solution is to improve an article rather than delete it. In this case, improving it might involve actually making it shorter, but I'm going on a tangents. The point is, the majority of Internet culture doesn't represent the interests of 99.999 percent of the population of the world, but unfortunately most Wikipedia editors seem to represent the .1 percent, so there's a sub-concious bias. Unfortunately, that's the problem with most encyclopedias or any attempt at an objective account of the world. (Most people probably don't care about many encyclopedia subjects) For now, I say it's easier and more constructive to improve an article, rather than delete it. 68.235.180.139 21:15, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I created this article under the premise that a biographical Salon article (for creating an entire genre) and continuous, popular work in the Flash movie scene makes notability. I stand by that. I can't say anything about his music, though, because everybody and his dog wants an article for their rock band, and those have strict guidelines. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a>) 20:36, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, that's my problem with the article for the most part. It seems his only claim to fame is animutation, and yet the article goes off on his musical diversions (which are definitely not notable on their own).

<li>That would best be discussed after (and if) the Animutation article survives deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have never registered for an account on Wikipedia... I have made a few contributions over the past couple years from various IPs, but since having no account destroys credibility I won't vote. Just reading through the comments I feel that the side for deletion is slanting search results to their benefit... for example, a more fair search comparison would be <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22neil+cicierega%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22neil+cicierega%22" rel="nofollow">"neil cicierega"</a> vs. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22George+Ouzounian%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22George+Ouzounian%22" rel="nofollow">"george ouzounian"</a> rather than a "Neil Cicierega vs. "The best page in the universe" comparison, since both have used various nicknames on the internet. On the other hand, this article is certainly at the very edge of allowable for vanity reasons. For the animutation article though, it is somewhat hard for me to imagine why a deletion vote was started on it, it is certainly notable enough to have an article, especially comparing against some of the other articles here on Wikipedia. I kind of like the idea of merging articles, and leaving a redirect to Animutation on the Neil Cicierega page. --<a href="../../../1/2/8/User%7E128.187.0.165.html" title="User:128.187.0.165">128.187.0.165 (This is a massively shared IP, please don't flame me for other people trolling off it)</a> 21:26, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, the comparison was lame, that's why I used Alexa to compare "the best page in the universe" against his "potter puppet pals" page. The latter doesn't even meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, while the former does. One of my other replies (in this AfD) has details on the results. --Locke Cole 22:38, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>And besides, the onus shouldn't be on me to prove he's not notable, the onus should be on others to prove he <b>is</b> notable. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and all that. --Locke Cole 22:45, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was trying to prove notability by stating that he receives a comparable number of entries on google to maddox on a comparable google search. On a side note, are Alexa ratings really good indicators of anything? Doesn't it only rank people who go through sites with Alexa's search engine? In any case, I agree with Ssbohio below in that if this were a purely vanity article it would be split one way or the other more definitely, for example <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clockcrew.html" title="Clockcrew">Clockcrew</a>. Continuing Tgies complaint about the term "Soft Sockpuppet" above, it does seem to me to be a term that was invented for this article to discredit some people in this article; only 3 results in the wikipedia namespace show up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?ns4=1&amp;search=Soft+Sockpuppet&amp;fulltext=Search" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?ns4=1&amp;search=Soft+Sockpuppet&amp;fulltext=Search" rel="nofollow">see this</a> and none of them seem to have the exact text "Soft Sockpuppet" in them (though I don't know why this page isn't included in the results... --<a href="../../../1/2/8/User%7E128.187.0.165.html" title="User:128.187.0.165">128.187.0.165</a> 03:08, 14 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>IMO it wasn't really a comparable search though-- few people know Maddox by his real name (FWIW, Google searches on Neil's various nicknames turn up similarly low results; see my other reply(ies)). Alexa is relevant per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. As for Ssbohio, he isn't taking into account the effect sockpuppets have had on this vote. I didn't create the "Soft Sockpuppet" section, an admin did, however, if I were to guess, I'd imagine it's just a pairing of a modifier to an existing word. Much like pairing "soft" with "fabric" or "rough" with "fabric". I believe it is meant to indicate someone who could likely be a sockpuppet (or falls just outside the definition of sockpuppet). If you want the real explanation, I suggest you ask the admin on his talk page. --Locke Cole 03:27, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I was unaware of his name until I read the Wikipedia article, whch led me to the Salon.com writeup, before I came back and read the deletion discussion. On the minus side, I (subjectively) hadn't heard of him until now, and there are many better known people working in the fields of music and animation; On the plus side, now that Wikipedia has exposed me to him, I recognize him as a contributor to the evolution &amp; advancement of Internet animation. Also, there are plenty of people included in WP who seem even more obscure, though in different fields. My deciding factor was reading the comments here &amp; seeing that there is apparently an active, heartfelt difference of opinion. I feel that, were this a case of vanity, there would be a decisive, clear break in the voting, not the relative balance I'm perceiving here. I'd recommend deleting the sub-articles about his music &amp; merging them into his main article.<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 21:30, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Unless Neil whipped up the whole article himself, I would hardly call it a "vanity article" no matter what wikipedia's definition of one is. Neil may look at himself in the mirror and call himself a sexy, sexy beast but that is neither here nor there. You seem to be putting up a huge fight for deleting this, Mr. Cole. What did Neil ever do to you to make you hate him so much? He's a noteable internet celebrity.

<li>Neil has made a name for himself out of virtually nothing. He has potential, TALENT, and intelligence. Over the past six years, he's created an internet phonomenon and a fairly successful band. After two years of making animutations, he broadened his horizons to music, and written many entertaining songs on four albums. And still there are songs that are not on these albums that are just as clever. He's also not afraid to do things that other people didn't think of, or were afraid of doing because they thought they would be viewed in a negative way, like dying his hair blue and green, or protesting about a petty internet thief. Keep this article, and at the very least put a picture of the dude here. You owe him that much. Now, quit protesting about deleting decent people's articles and instead move to deleting Charlotte Church's article, her being nothing but a talentless slut. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.128.182.106 (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.128.182.106_c8e2.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.128.182.106">contribs</a>) 14:47 and 14:50, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</small>

<li>Clearly he hasn't made a very big name for himself if his sites rank so low on Alexa and his name turns up so few hits on Google. I also doubt the "internet phenomenon" and "successful band" bits. Oh, and about "do[ing] things that other people didn't think of", I knew a girl in 1994 who dyed her hair blue and green. Unless he dyed his hair blue and green at the age of 8 (since he was born in 1986), I really doubt nobody thought of it before him. The "successful band" bit could be resolved if you could show (with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> how it meets the requirements of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. --Locke Cole 02:33, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article was originally nothing more than ranting about the ORGs community. I cleaned all that out, and all you have left is this little stub. While I think it's important to define "ORGs" (it does get a bit of use on the internet), I don't think there is enough history here to warrant an article, or even a stub. I say <b>delete</b> and maybe (if necessary) move the definition to Wiktionary. <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoofy_4247.html" title="User:Foofy">Foofy</a> 16:08, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>To clarify my actions, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Online_Reality_Games&amp;oldid=27522829" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Online_Reality_Games&amp;oldid=27522829" rel="nofollow">original article</a> was actually much longer before I rewrote it as a simple stub. I removed content that was unverifiable, POV, and repetitive. After some searching I was unable to find enough history to make the article more than a stub. My intentions weren't to erase content before nomination. Rather I cleaned the article to a stub, after which I decided as a simple definition it was probably something to delete or move. Sorry for the confusion. <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoofy_4247.html" title="User:Foofy">Foofy</a> 04:37, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

By removing 95% of content you made it necessary to evaluate this through the article history.

<li>Understood, but it was tagged for cleaning which I did before deciding it was probably delete-worthy. The original article was mainly unverifiably history ("ORG has gone through a series of tumultuous events, such as the first closing of an index, numerous hackings, revolutions, and a series of other events that have gone undocumented."), and POV ("At the current rate, ORGS is in a depression like trance!"). I cut all that out as well as the long list of shows and made the definition/stub that is there now. Not many Google results came up for authoritive ORGs sites so I just used the two links that were already in the article. <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoofy_4247.html" title="User:Foofy">Foofy</a> 18:40, 9 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not many Google results? I found nearly 4000 results for the exact phrase "online reality game." POV text doesn't merit summary deletion. What is your expertise in related subjects? <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 19:00, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>But most of those <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Online+Reality+Games%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Online+Reality+Games%22" rel="nofollow">top results</a> are links to broken pages or usage in a different context. I deleted the text because it was <i>unverifiable</i> as well as POV. There is no way to confirm that the current state of the ORGs community is in a "depression like stance" or that "VE holds the true resting spot for intense reality gaming." Please see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Online_Reality_Games&amp;oldid=27522829" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Online_Reality_Games&amp;oldid=27522829" rel="nofollow">original article</a>, if there is more to salvage then I am sorry, but I made sure not to "destroy" or delete content that was verifiable. <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoofy_4247.html" title="User:Foofy">Foofy</a> 19:27, 9 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I almost voted for deletion before I sniffed out an older version on my own. There's no need to repeat the article's NPOV problem. With over 20 years of role-playing game experience I can evaluate imperfect content. I can't evaluate absence of content. My objection is that you reduced a reasonably sized article to about ten words before nominating it for deletion.

<li>This argument is a distraction from fixing the problem. If there is content that can be salvaged to make this more than a simple definition, please add it. I was unable to find any, and there isn't any history to gather, so I rewrote it as a simple stub.

<li><b>Keep and expand</b> Online Reality Games are nothing like video game MMORPG's and shouldn't be included with them. They are for fans of game-show type reality television series such as Survivor, Big Brother, and the Mole. Such fans normally would never be able to play these games offline, so they meet through message boards and instant messenging programs. These games take 16-20 strangers from throughout the globe and challenge them with puzzles as they get to know each other and play the game which usually lasts for 2-3 months. I think this is a valid article as these games have been played for over five years and have been very successful. I myself have personally hosted at least 200 people in these games, I'd imagine that the number of people who have played such a game is easily 3,000+. I was thinking of starting this article, and if it stays I would definitely contribute and expand it appropriately. These games are very much like <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy_football.html" title="Fantasy football">fantasy football</a> and fantasy sports games and are popular among reality television fans (especially high school and college ones), and with Survivor being watched by ~15 million people weekly it is not an obscure topic. With regard to the "most links are broken pages," this is most likely because the games last for 2-3 months and then a winner is declared, the game ended, and the website abandonded. For an example see <a href="http://p101.ezboard.com/bsurvivor4wonderland" class="external text" title="http://p101.ezboard.com/bsurvivor4wonderland" rel="nofollow">here</a> or <a href="http://p097.ezboard.com/bbigbrother450137" class="external text" title="http://p097.ezboard.com/bbigbrother450137" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirSam972_f052.html" title="User:SirSam972">SirSam972</a> 07:27, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>At first, I thought this was a simple db-bio; the entry has a lot of POV, and reads more like a CV. The author then supplied this to the talk page:</p>
<p><i>Individual directly referrenced here: Disc jockey - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey</a> Individual founder of this program: Computerized Performance System Disc Jockey - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerized_Performance_System_Disc_Jockey" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerized_Performance_System_Disc_Jockey" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerized_Performance_System_Disc_Jockey</a></i> <i>This individual has been featured in all DJ related publications and has written for EQ magazine.

<p>so now it's not an obvious candidate for deletion, but still debatable.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Since the event with which he is associated in the two linked articles took place for the first tmie this year, that does not in itself denote notability.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Agreed article needs cleaned up. If you review the overall program it was established in Atlanta 2000 ‚Äì In 2005 it held a major Summit in Tampa, Florida (3rd annual - 1st stand alone - not first ever) which deserves consideration historically and reflects longevity. This afternoon I tested the esteem issue and phoned the American Disc Jockey Association, National Association of Mobile Entertainers, Canadian Disc Jockey Association and both the Canadian and United States Online Disc Jockey Association ‚Äì Professor Jam is not a member of these groups - yet all 3rd party referenced him as an industry pioneer in computer DJing with utmost respect ‚Äì The referenced event is a result of dedicated industry development with years of foundation building. ‚Äì As the worlds 1st professional endorsed computer DJ (mid-late 1990‚Äôs shared endorsement with Niles Rogers) you will find direct and in-direct participation with development of - PCDJ (industry mixing tool) Numark (hardware controller for software mixing) Peavey (hardware controller for software mixing) Denon (products in development) and other industry revolutionary tools‚Äì Once you clear away the smoke and mirrors you find an industry pioneer in computer DJing. - Good press kit agreed - but most entertainers have the same. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.144.102.176 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.144.102.176.html" title="User talk:24.144.102.176">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.144.102.176_637a.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.144.102.176">contribs</a>) 17:04, 9 November 2005.</small>

<li>Why not sign your passionate defense? Why not link to websites that support your claims? I found little information other than local gigs. What I did find was rather distasteful.

<p>I did a search on the Summit, Computer DJ Summit and Professor Jam (I personally attended the gathering in Kentucky in 2005 and the Summit this October in Tampa Florida but you seek online reference)‚Ä¶ Was the true beginning of the now established CPSDJ Summit in 2001? Was and is Professor Jam relevant to the history of computer DJing? Here is a searched response from an industry networking forum: <a href="http://www.djchat.com/boards/showthread.php?t=15178" class="external free" title="http://www.djchat.com/boards/showthread.php?t=15178" rel="nofollow">http://www.djchat.com/boards/showthread.php?t=15178</a> It seems the discussion began in 08-16-2001, 11:28 PM for a 2001 event hosted by Professor Jam. Here is another link with reference to a 2002 event held in conjunction with the Mid-America DJ Convention. The Summit was hosted by Professor Jam <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/com3362/w02/archive/0114.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/com3362/w02/archive/0114.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/com3362/w02/archive/0114.html</a> At the original site I found a supportive archive conversation that includes the show promoter in the discussion started by Professor Jam dated 03-01-2002, 09:47 PM <a href="http://www.djchat.com/boards/showthread.php?t=22828" class="external free" title="http://www.djchat.com/boards/showthread.php?t=22828" rel="nofollow">http://www.djchat.com/boards/showthread.php?t=22828</a> This industry site: <a href="http://www.computerdjsoftware.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.computerdjsoftware.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.computerdjsoftware.com/</a> reference Professor Jam and says: ‚ÄúWe're glad to see some long time professionals taking the lead in this area, and Professor Jam (whom most have heard his name), has had a big hand in moving this along.‚Äù -----By many of your posts you have never heard of him or question his credentials. Did I already ask how many of you are active in the Computer DJ industry and know who is who? <a href="http://forums.djcafe.com/odja.pl/noframes/read/393" class="external free" title="http://forums.djcafe.com/odja.pl/noframes/read/393" rel="nofollow">http://forums.djcafe.com/odja.pl/noframes/read/393</a> I phoned Professor Jams office at (727) 817-1671 and was told he in Orlando at the LDI convention then will be in Atlanta GA for the IAAPA convention till the 18th. Others have contacted them on the conversation here and elsewhere and as soon as I have a response I‚Äôll post it here for review. Is Professor Jam one of the pioneers of computer DJing? Instead of taking the opinion of Goggle searchers like me - learn more about our industry and it's history - We're young but making a major impact and I sure would like to see it have more positive exposure without being looked upon as Napster illegal music downloader‚Äôs ‚Äì JMHO "How do you self sign these posts"</p>

<div>The page here requires some research, not just reformatting the page.

<li><s>Send to cleanup:</s> It isn't a case of wikification that's needed, but a copyvio check and then NPOV. It reads like it was written by a Young Person, and the graphic very much looks like an attempted replication of the group's pages. Actually, I'm changing my mind. The group is fairly small, with fairly small press. Usually an effective organizing and protesting group will generate quite a few mentions in the mainstream press. I wish them luck and wish them well, but they don't seem to be discussed enough by others nor to have had a sufficient effect on the world to be encyclopedic. <b>Delete.</b> <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 09:38, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Undecided</b> it seems right to have such an article, but as pointed out these are all external links. Wikisource?

<li>Wikisource would want the actual text. A collection of external hyperlinks is of no use to Wikisource. This is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">list</a>, albeit a mis-named one. It should be at List of standing rules of the United States Senate if it remains an unadorned list. (As <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCoffee_bcb6.html" title="User:TheCoffee">TheCoffee</a> alludes, there is more than one <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senate.html" title="Senate">senate</a> in the world. See the <a href="http://www.senate.uiuc.edu/standrul.html" class="external text" title="http://www.senate.uiuc.edu/standrul.html" rel="nofollow">Standing Rules of the Senate</a>, for example.) There are third-party sources that can be cited on the subject of the U.S. Senate rules, including (for example) an article in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hill_b971.html" title="The Hill">The Hill</a></i> on rule XXII, and it would be possible to write a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standing_Rules_of_the_United_States_Senate_5aae.html" title="Standing Rules of the United States Senate">Standing Rules of the United States Senate</a> article that discusses some of the rules individually. However, the only thing holding such an article together would be that the rules form a corpus, and we already cover the ground that such an article would cover in our articles on <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filibuster.html" title="Filibuster">filibuster</a>, <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impeachment_in_the_United_States_9eeb.html" title="Impeachment in the United States">Impeachment in the United States</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloture.html" title="Cloture">cloture</a>, and so forth (and, indeed, in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a> article itself). Refactoring this as a stand-alone list, with each rule linked to the relevant articles, seems to be the best option. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:38, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> this article. There is also another solution: since the article <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a> is already quite long, one could split off the section Procedures, leaving only a summary in place. This article could then be merged with the new Procedures of the United States Senate.

<li><b>Keep</b>, <b>rename</b>, and improve, the operation of the United States Senate is a very noteworthy subject. Should be expanded, perhaps by tackling each rule one by one, restating it in simple terms, and for the higher-numbered rules which only occasionally come into play, discussing notable historical examples/invocations of that rule. As Uncle G notes, it should be renamed to include "United States." <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 19:41, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and expand as suggested above and also add cross-links to <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filibuster.html" title="Filibuster">filibuster</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closed_session_of_the_United_States_Congress_8b43.html" title="Closed session of the United States Congress">Closed session of the United States Congress</a>. Note that <b>"Standing Rules of the Senate"</b> is a proper name which is why the "R" is capitalized, and also why it would be improper to insert "United States" or "List of..." or anything else into the title. If the article title collides with the name of a distinctly different "Standing Rules of the Senate" we can disambiguate at that time (but would still want to preserve the proper name). On a side note, instead of creating a Procedures of the United States Senate article, I'd rather see an article "<a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditions_of_the_United_States_Senate_6a55.html" title="Traditions of the United States Senate">Traditions of the United States Senate</a>". Much more interesting I would think... <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechnopilgrim_d7d3.html" title="User:Technopilgrim">technopilgrim</a> 00:48, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've added a crosslink on Filibuster and one was already added for <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closed_session.html" title="Closed session">closed session</a>. That was the easy part. I didn't do anything on the history of the Senate rules, although I did come across a helpful link: <a href="http://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_index_subjects/Rules_and_Procedure_vrd.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_index_subjects/Rules_and_Procedure_vrd.htm" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>.

Both merit a full article in their own right and Procedures of the United States Senate would be very worthwhile to add. I've started a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditions_of_the_United_States_Senate_6a55.html" title="Traditions of the United States Senate">Traditions of the United States Senate</a> page, which was very fun.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have made a preliminar attempt at realizing my own proposal. What is clear to me is that a page on the rules themselves can be quite confusing because, as the article mentions: "The procedure of the United States Senate depends not only on the Standing Rules of the Senate, but also on a variety of customs and traditions." In other words, the rules should always be put in the context of their actual usage.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I agree with the nom.

<li>No problem. In cases like these it's best to create a subpage on your user page and edit from their, i.e. for me it would be "User:dsol/The Center (community)." Then when it's reasonable progressed so as not to be delete-worthy, you can copy it over. Because you said you'll work on it, I'm changing my vote from speedy delete to just delete.

<p>I've thought about this nomination long and hard, but I've now come to the conclusion that this article should be deleted. While I believe that an article about a topic like this might be desirable, I don't think that this article is what Wikipedia needs. First of all, this article is almost irreparably POV. It is one long rant against what the creator sees as "the Left". That is a second problem with the article. The creator has thrown a large number of very diverse groups on one pile. Anti-war christians, social-democrats, christian-socialists, communists, stalinists, nationalist socialists, marxists, leninists, zapatistas and just about every group I haven't mentioned are all treated as one collective entity, which imo is the wrong approach.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that that is no ground for deletion, but only for clean-up. What can be seen as a ground for deleting this article (although there are no strict guidelines on what constitutes a ground for deletion), is the fact that this article is largely primary/original research, propaganda/advocacy, a personal essay and an opinion on current affairs (from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>). I believe Wikipedia is not the place for such articles. It remains to be seen whether anything in this article can be cleaned up to conform to Wikipedia standards. But supposing that it is possible, should that be under this title? "The Left" is, as I have said, a collection of some related, some barely related and some unrelated groups and individuals under a header that has often been misused for political purposes (particularly under McCarthyism, when political opponents were often denounced as being "left"). Another term I find troublesome is "opposition." While it is often appropriately used in this article, I think it would be better to replace it with something a bit more neutral, such as "notion" or "view." What I think is needed here, is spreading the issue over several articles, like "Marxist notion of war" or "Marxism and war", "Stalinist notion of war" or "Stalinism and war" and "Leninist notion of war" or "Leninism and war", etc. While I don't think it is necessary to create such articles for every single branch of "the Left", I do think the most important branches of socialism should be separated, as they are separate ideologies. In short: Wikipedia might need an article about this issue, but not with this content under this title. I think it's best to start all over again, instead of having to wait for someone who finds a way to npov this article. The content as it is belongs on a personal website or a blog, but not in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>praatpaal</sup></a> 17:13, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Neutral</b>. While I suspect this article may be irredemably POV, it looks odd to have simultaneous neutrality, cleanup, and deletion tags. Mediation might be more appropriate. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 17:41, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but give it a really good scrubbing. "Left" and "War" are very broad labels, but they are popular labels. Currently the article is pretty dubious, but I think it has potential. What various strands of the political left have thought about various wars can be described in an NPOV way. The current and historical associations between various left-ish political groups and various pacifistic causes make it a real topic. If the article is still filled with POV garbage in six months, I'd be much more amenable to deletion, but two weeks seems hasty. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 19:34, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Undecided</b> too. It's got me beat: part of me thinks there is the basis a good article in there (although "the left and war" would be better, as many European Communists went to fight in the Spanish civil war, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a> being a prominent example. On the other hand, it's far too bogged down in the 9/11 issue (and that is massively too POV). In fifty years time 9/11 will be viewed rather more dispassionately than it is now. Single air raids in World War II killed more people than 9/11 - and more than the "War on Terror" (and just how <i>do</i> you declare war on an adjective?). Really the answer is probably to redirect that section to a "main article" section being a discussion of the anti Gulf war movement - which, in the UK at lest, is absolutely <b>not</b> confined to the political left. And incidentally the American political "left" is not actually terribly "left-wing" anyway. Nor are "liberal" and "left-wing" synonymous. So the bulk of the article is a nightmare, but the start is a good concept. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 19:42, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's a rant. The author has drawn a connection through history like it's a conspiracy or something. I don't think lumping all the various things believed by ppl through history by this nebulously defined "left" can be verified. I think the conception itself is too much an opinion. Is the "Left" of 1800 the same "Left" of 1900? of 2000? Might be useful with some serious rethinking. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 20:53, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The author is using a definition of "Left" that keys in very strongly to the American Conservative zeitgeist as exemplified by William F. Buckley, Rush Limbaugh, and the like. As such, the foundational perspective of the article defies redemption. Any "cleaning up" of this article would involve starting afresh and crafting a wholesale re-write. And since the thing will need to be completely re-written from start to finish in order to make it a presentable Wikipedia article, there's no reason to keep the current one skulking about in the meantime. ‚Üí <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Œûxtreme</i></b></font> Unction</a> {<a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction"><font size="0">yak yak yak</font></a> ≈Ç <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Extreme_Unction_b4bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Extreme Unction"><font size="0">blah blah blah</font></a>} 21:19, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. OK, Extreme Unction is right. It starts out with an assertion that "historically, the Left has been oppposed to most wars", and that does, as stated, define the tone of the article. Haivng gone back and thought about it, this statement is completely indefensible. Not only did the left not <i>exist</i> during the period of most wars, there have been notable occasions where the left has joined in, others where the right has poosed and so on. In fact, as stated, it depends on a definition of "left" which includes anyone to the left of Atilla the Hun. Yes, there is the germ of a good idea in there, but as stated, there is practically nothing of this article which would survive the transition process, and in the mean time this is substantially worse than nothing. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 22:18, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> because this obviously very debatable.

<li>Heh. Excellent point. But personally I feel that article could be valuable as well, especially were it called, per Just zis Guy, "The Right and War". There's a great deal of interesting material in Wikipedia, and I think there's room for cross-cutting articles that serve to draw people in to the complexity of history. Of course, this article still does suck as is, so perhaps I just have too much faith in the garbage-to-gold powers of the Wiki. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 01:26, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hey, you gotta have faith... in Wiki at least. But I think the wording of the title just leads to problems. Comparing someone to Stalin really isn't much better than comparing someone to Hitler... in my opinion at least. So these blanket "the Left thinks this" and "The Right thinks that" statements just lead to problems. Maybe it's a personal thing but I'll tend to vote towards avoiding lumping articles like that. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 05:13, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's not really an article on any one subject -the "Left" is too vague and opposition to war in general is too broad a topic.

<li><b>Keep</b>. There are a number of reasons I do not think this article should be deleted.</li>
<li>Firstly, everyone seems to be ignoring the fact that this article was created in orrder to make the article on <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing_politics.html" title="Left-wing politics">Left-wing politics</a> more NPOV by making a seperate place for all the information on anti-war stuff that was swamping it.</li>
<li>Secondly, all of the commentators so far seem to be ignoring the first section which is on the first world war and has far less NPOV problems, is well referanced and is not orrginal reasuarch.</li>
<li>Thirdly, the idea that this article is just the singular rant of a right-wing POV pusher is nonsence the article as can be seen by examination of the articles roots. In the beggining the <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing_politics.html" title="Left-wing politics">Left-wing politics</a> article got swamped by a load of right-wing stuff blaming the left for creating an pro-terrorist anti-semitic anti-war movement. Though even at this point there was a lot of counter editing and the article cam a little bit more towards the ballanced side. This stuff then got pushed into its own article (<a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-September_11_anti-war_movement_ecc0.html" title="Post-September 11 anti-war movement">Post-September 11 anti-war movement</a> which is still, despite some editing from people with differnt views, packed with POV and which I was planning to notinate for deletion wonce any information it could possible neutraly claim to cover had been found a better home) and a summery got left on the Left-wing politics page, this summery was still full of POV so I, and others, cleaned it up. After this I felt it shouldn't be linked to the POV page so I delinked it, but it was still to big so I moved it to its own page.</li>
<li>Fourthly, I also think that those argueing for deletion are focusing on the most poor stuff, i.e. the stuff on america. This is fair enough since most of the stuff is but if you look at the stuff on other places (notably the U.K) it is far more neutral.</li>
<li>Lastly, I think this article and the summerised section in the left-wing polics are important becasue many left-wing movements have sort to grow and radicalise large sections of the population through anti-war movments the same can not be said of the right, it has not built mass participation pro-war movments and has never sort to sustain and invigertate right wing activists from such a movement.<br /></li>

<li>The un-sort-out-able NPOV problems stem from the article's inescapably American definition of "The Left".

There is an association in the minds of some (many?) people who are pro the war in Iraq and the war on <s>people who dislike the United States</s> terror that the opposition is one big left-wing conspiricy, or that all the opposition is left wing. An NPOV article about this is worthy of inclusion imho, but what we currently have is not that. In the UK at least, opposition to the current war came from all shades in the political spectrum; and I don't know enough about other wars to say conclusively, but I would imagine this was also the case. I seem to recall hearing that there was a significant amount of anti-war sentiment amoung the right wing upper classes in Britain before the second world war. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 13:23, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree that critics tell the lie that anti-war=left-wing conspiricy. However this article does not say that it just states the undeniable fact that the left has been key to the organisation and iniciation of anti-war movments and that anti-war movments have been key to reinvigoration of the left. A case in point is that the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stop_the_War_Coalition_2b62.html" title="Stop the War Coalition">Stop the War Coalition</a>, which organised most of the UK protests, was iniciated by the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Workers_Party_fac1.html" title="Socialist Workers Party">Socialist Workers Party</a> and lefties around the party, also though it involved left-wing labour party members and many mambers of the public of differnt political stands, no right wing politicion would have joined (nor would have been welcomed). Also the new left-wing party <a href="../../../r/e/s/RESPECT_The_Unity_Coalition_505f.html" title="RESPECT The Unity Coalition">Respect</a> and its election of an MP were only possible because of the radicalisation caused by the anti-war mood. Maby the article could be clearer in saying that the left is made up of lots of differnt strands and that anti-war movemnt extends far beyond the left, nevertheless it is surely worung to deniey that opposition to war has not been a key factor in many left wing movements.--<a href="../../../j/k/_/User%7EJK_the_unwise_23f9.html" title="User:JK the unwise">JK the unwise</a> 13:37, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No, it <i>asserts</i> that the left has been critical to these movements, but it ignores situations where the left has been enthusiatic (e.g. Spanish Civil War) and it is so disporportionately weighted to the current Gulf War as to swamp whatever valid points might be made re other wars. The article is a lengthy attempt to push the "anti-war = pink commie subversive" line which is prevalent among right-wing US commentators; and to echo a comment made in the piece on the left in politics, the left-wingers who opposed the small number of wars between the growth of the modern political left-wing and the end of the Cold War would count the majority of those "left-wing" anti-war activists as being <i>right</i> wing, because the centre in modern US politics is to the right of the right in many other countries, and far to the right of what is historically considered the centre. The two sides in the US are essentially right and further right, for the pruposes of comparison with previous supposed left-wing anti-war movements. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 13:55, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The article can be rescued, sources can be found, and sections altered to clarify who opposes war from the left, when they do so, why they do so and what consequences this has. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarofdreams_f9b2.html" title="User talk:Warofdreams">talk</a></i> 17:22, 10 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem is that there are intrinsic problems with this article. As Swegner said, articles on opposition to specific wars in specific political conditions would be valid, but articles that lump all of the "Left" from all countries over all time are hopeless. The topic deserves an article, but that would have to be with a completely different focus under a completely different title. That would simply be a completely new article. And doing what Ed has proposed, trying to NPOV the article is basically impossible, because the article is incorrect in its essence. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>praatpaal</sup></a> 17:35, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't yet see why that would be an inherent problem. The notion of descibing political groups in left/right terms, while a little simpleminded for my tastes, is common. So, unfortunately, is war. The article need not mention all leftist groups and all wars; mentioning major leftist groups and major wars would be sufficient: it need not be exhaustive to be encyclopedic. I agree the title is wrong, though, and favor Guy's suggestion of "The Left and War". --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 18:04, 10 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem there is that "mentioning major leftist groups and major wars" would lead to a colossal, record-breaking article. I mean, every case has its own specific nuances and shades of grey. Doing justice to those nuances and shades of grey would lead to an unmaintainable monster, while cutting the article to a workable size would do injustice to those nuances and shades of grey. There is a way out of this mess, but I'm not sure how viable and popular that is. We could have one article, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Left_and_war_f907.html" title="The Left and war">The Left and war</a> (or any other plausible title), with summaries of the views of leftist groups and individuals to specific wars. The full nuances, details and sources could be moved to daughter/main articles, such as The Left and World War 1, The Left and the Spanish Civil War, The Left and World War 2, The Left and the Cold War, The Left and the Iraq War, etc. What seems clear from this afd, is that the current content of the article is unanimously disapproved. How do you (plural) feel about blanking the article to remove the current content from direct view and starting over again with a stub, that we cautiously expand case by case? <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>praatpaal</sup></a> 23:31, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, absolutely. The problem is not with political balance, as UncleEd says, that can be fixed; it's with the concept itself, and the balance between the massive section on the current war (which is opposed by left and right alike in many places) and the much smaller section on all other wars in history. It's a soapbox. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 17:39, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> the very premise is flawed. The most atrocious wars have been led by the communists.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, possibly rename as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Left_and_War_e188.html" title="The Left and War">The Left and War</a>, and handle times/places where the Left has been pro-war in the same article. And certainly more NPOV would be welcome. Much of the content that people are objecting to has the following history: <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathKnight_e2bc.html" title="User:MathKnight">User:MathKnight</a> wrote what I view as some very partisan anti-left material about a year back in <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing_politics.html" title="Left-wing politics">Left-wing politics</a>, basically claiming that there was an alliance between the left and Islamists, and that the contemporary (especially post-September 11) left is anti-semitic. I couldn't disagree more, but worked very hard to (1) broaden the perspective and (2) find decent citation for those parts of his case that could be substantiated. I was doing my damnedest not to be partisan, and to deepen the writing rather than debate it. I may have done all too well at not inserting my POV if everyone reads this as still slanted so far in his direction. It was later factored out of that article. If you want to see the history on how this all came to be, look at the "history" of <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing_politics.html" title="Left-wing politics">Left-wing politics</a> and its talk page, roughly July 10 ‚Äì September 15, 2004. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 21:00, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, rename and restrict</b> Make this an article on the left concept of internationalism (the working class from different countries shouldn't fight each other)--(i.e., <i>Left Internationalism and Opposition to War</i>-- and restrict it to the period when this was a major trend in left movements (i.e., when the Soviet Union and China weren't heavy military powers). Possibly also write an article on <i>New Left and War</i>, but this article is no help for that.</li>
<li><b>Further Comment</b>: Revolution has taken the step of deleting the stuff relating to the Iraq and Afganistain wars. While I'm not sure thi was the best thing to do it does highlight the fact that no one has at yet given any specific POV problems with the WWI WWII and Vitnam sections.

<li><b>Keep</b> - What's all the fuss? The article is a ligitimate start and is developing. ther than calling for removal I suggest editors work on other, perhaps contrasting articles. VfD for this article seems inappropriate.

<li>As the nominator, I feel the need to respond to this allegation. If you would be so kind as to look into the page's history, you would see why I nominated the article for deletion. You will find an OR POV rant against a generalized group, whose views have been distorted to fit MathKnight's views. The article has been edited and improved since my nominating it. That doesn't change my view though, that the starting point of this article is wrong, that the concepts are wrong, that the title is wrong, and that we need a completely new article, under a new title. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>praatpaal</sup></a> 09:22, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This article is inherently POV and OR. General topic might be already, but something would have to be done about overgeneralizing "the Left". <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 15:59, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b> topic/title is inherantly POV and I can't see an essay on this topic not being OR. Overgeneralizing about "the left" "opposition" to "war" is not going make a decent article. "Left" is limited to political labels as used in a single country, and "War" to wars of interest to that country. One could write a paragraph about right wing isolationism (opposition to war) led to Standard Oil refueling U-boats at sea, and contrast that with the WWII paragraph which would show just how myopic this topic is to focus in one corner of two dimensions of over-simplification. This isn't scholarly, it's silly. Loose it. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 06:17, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy deleted</b> as spam. If you see an article with an external link (the image, in this case) and virtually no text, you can tag it for speedy.

<li><b>Delete</b> Though the album is listed at cdnow.com with a few press blurbs, it seems to be out-of-print.

I wasn't about to nominate it for AfD myself because I was an "involved party" and I thought it'd make its way here in the natural course of events.
