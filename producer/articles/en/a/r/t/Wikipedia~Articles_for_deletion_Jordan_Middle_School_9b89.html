<li>Wahoofive, as may be seen from his <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wahoofive_6859.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wahoofive">contributions</a>, made his first edit well over six weeks ago, and his first edit to a vfd about two and a half weeks ago.

<li>Apparently the most notable thing about this school is that 'The library offers a "Homework Center", every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday from 3:15 to 4:30pm,' as you keep trying to insert. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 00:51, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No less notable than if 'The library offeres a "Homework Center", every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday from 3:15 to 4:30<b>am</b>.' It's a regularly scheduled library program, no different from poetry readings, or ESL tutoring. The school is notable, the school library is notable, the school library's programs are notable. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 03:05, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These facts you are adding do not bolster any case for notability. Take the word of somebody who had to study the Dewey Decimal System in graduate school, I assure you that it is entirely non-notable that this school's library employs it. It's like saying they have books and walls and ceilings. It's no hyperbole to say that 95% of public schools use Dewey. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 00:58, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My opinion is that all schools are notable, therefore their school libraries are also notable. The librarians, special collection's, physical plant, and classification scheme are also notable. Any regular programs the library runs are also notable. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki_is_not_paper.html" title="Wiki is not paper">Wiki_is_not_paper</a>. What bothers me is that people are reducing the amount of information in the article. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 03:05, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Pointing out the obvious is not information, it is clutter. Whatever your opinion on the notabilty of schools, the fact that a library has "homework time" or uses Dewey is not informative. It would be a surprise if these things were not there. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 05:38, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The key question is if the information is relavent, not if it's obvious. It's good to know that fish are aquatic creatures; an article that did not mention that fish live in water would be deficient. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 18:39, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That information—that a North American middle school library makes use of the Dewey system—would be quite appropriate for an article on middle schools. It's redundant in the article on each and every school, and just bloats these articles unnecessarily. A middle school that <i>didn't</i> use the Dewey system for a substantial library collection might be worth mentioning. To use your example, the <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fish.html" title="Fish">fish</a> article does indeed describe them as "water-dwelling vertebrate"s. The article on <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trout.html" title="Trout">trout</a>, on the other hand, says that "trout are usually found in cool, clear streams and lakes". The article <i>doesn't</i> explicitly state that trout are <i>always</i> found in water since expect the reader to know this based on his general knowledge of fish. Our <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lungfish.html" title="Lungfish">lungfish</a> article makes explicit note that these creatures can breathe air, because it is <i>unusual</i> and contrary to expectation. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">Talk</a> 02:35, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

I am afraid, <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a>, that the fact that "the libraries collections are sorted using the <a href="../../../d/e/w/Dewey_Decimal_System_f757.html" title="Dewey Decimal System">Dewey Decimal System</a>" does not do much to distinguish it from other school libraries; it would, on the other hand, be very interesting if it used <b>any other</b> classification system. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:44, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> and just look at the time being spent on this process. Non-notable schools can always be recommended for speedy deletion with the "db|non-notable" formula.

<ul>
<li>But, given that many VfD voters are inclusionist about all schools (rather than all universities or all secondary schools), someone will always object, with a good chance someone will be upset that you tried to speedy it. Until non-consensus changes among the WP community, it's safest to <s>waste</s> spend the time getting the usual mix of "all schools are notable" and "all middle schools are non-notable unless (they make the national news / somebody kills a record number of people / haven't seen a notable one yet)" reasons. Also, I think many more people usually see VfD than CSD. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 02:05, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Although I believe that not all schools are automatically encyclopedic, and although I believe that "notability" plays a legitimate role in deletion discussions, it is simply <i>not</i> a criterion for <i>speedy</i> deletion under current policy. I have no idea where that template came from but it should not be used. The criteria for speedy deletion are quite clear and quite restrictive—and a recent proposal to allow speedy deletions on the basis of non-notability appears to have overwhelming opposition. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:08, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actully as per an ArbCom proceding GRider is banned from editing VfD's for a year.

<li>I don't have an opinion as to the ruling, nor a complaint that it shouldn't apply to anything else. I <b>despise</b> that a non-disruptive vote was removed for <i>any</i> reason, and the voter recieved a one week block for it. It gives me a twinge in my stomach. The ruling does not say that his edits may be freely reverted, just that there is a consequence if he edits. --<a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 05:13, 2005 Apr 12 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The ruling is in place as punishment for past abuses of the deletion process. The Arbitrators made it explicitly clear what the punishment was and made him explicitly aware of it, and he deliberately violated it knowing full well what the consequences would be. Any edits he makes to any deletion-related page, regardless of what the edit is, can be reverted on sight (this is confirmed by the Request for Clarification at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html#Requests_for_clarification" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration#Requests for clarification</a> by anyone and any administrator can (and imho should) block him for up-to a week. As you have had dealings with both GRider and the ArbCom, I presume you were aware of the case. Everyone has the right to comment on the talk: /proposed decision page if you feel it too harsh/too lenient/whatever. See also the discussion at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 08:40, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I actually never have been involved. I think it was probably a mistake on the part of the ArbCom to not consider voting as part of the ruling. GRider seems to have made trouble in posting frivolous nominations, but not for disruptive voting. I think it is practically barbaric to remove a vote and then block for the maximum. --<a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 15:59, 2005 Apr 12 (UTC)</li>
<li>Everyone had the right to argue about the case: it's closed now. IMHO it's stupid to block somone to genuinely and with good faith contributes to wikipedia, and is filled with wiki-spirit. As I see it, his sanction ought to be reduced. Censorship from VfD is all that is needed, and even that is excessive. The blocking is purely punitive, and IMHO serves no correctional purpose in a voluntary project. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 18:39, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>GRider is welcome to ask the ArbCom for relief from a particular aspect of their decision. I note that just last week ArbCom lifted some of the sanctions they had previously imposed on another user, based on a polite request and the markedly improved behaviour of the user in question. (See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_RK_2_7df4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/RK 2">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/RK_2</a>). I would also note that GRider's decision to violate the ArbCom's ruling while the "ink was still wet"—the day after the ruling, and less than two hours after he blanked the ArbCom notice on his talk page—doesn't seem to show good judgement. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">Talk</a> 16:15, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I personally wish that GRider would not try to demonstrate the unjust nature of the decision by having it fall upon his head. His choice though. But, that leaves other people like myself to defend GRider against an angry and organized bunch of deletionists for the sake of a greater good. A great encyclopedia is not built by obscurantism and deletionism. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 18:39, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right,a great encyclopedia is not built on obscuratism and deletionism; it is built on high quality articles on distinctive topics. If wikipedia is inundated with thousands of school stubs that are barely distinguishable from each other, then that poor level of quality hurts the reputation of the project and causes observers to think us sloppy and frivolous. I have no problem with schools being identified on the pages for cities even if they are not notable enough for there own articles. I also have pretty low standards of notability (though not as low as some). If you could show that the school has an innovative curriculum or a long and distinguished history or was part of an important local news event or just about anything that makes it stand out, then I will vote keep (the Dewey Decimal system does not help), but on nearly every school article up for deletion, not one person tries to find this information (including myself, but I do not care passionately about keeping every school article). If anyone actually went to that effort, I bet a lot of interesting facts would be found and a lot more schools would be kept with overwhelming support without all the divisive argument. Wikipedia is not paper, but those people who use that as an excuse to eliminate all quality control are not helping the project. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 19:49, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>
