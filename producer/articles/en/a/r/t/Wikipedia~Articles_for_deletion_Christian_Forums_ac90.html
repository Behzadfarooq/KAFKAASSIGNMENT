<p>Forum article with no sources. Some quick Googling doesn't find any either. Requested sources over 2 weeks ago, but no responses. Almost entirely <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 15:52, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I do believe that Christian Forums constitutes a notable topic. It has over 150,000 members and is generally recognized as the largest Christianity-related internet forum in existence (or at the very least, I've yet to see another Christianity-related forum that had as many members or that contested that claim). I also frequently see links to it on other Christian websites. However, I agree that it has serious problems with original research and verifiability (and probably NPOV as well). —<a href="../../../c/s/w/User%7ECswrye_d0de.html" title="User:Cswrye">Cswrye</a> 16:14, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Sheesh, find somethng better to do with your time. This page DOES NOT satisfy deletion criteria. It IS a notable subject, since it is the largest site of its kind on the net. "Over two weeks ago". Are you kidding??? That is a drop in the bucket! Some of us have busy lives. Give it, and people, time, months even, for cryin' out loud.

<li>Rather than criticizing me and making vague claims, it would be more productive to find sources. This article has been around for 1.5 years anyway, its not like sourcing is a new thing. Btw, if you care to read the link to my talk page you posted, the discussion is not about me, but about another editor's deletion request on MFD, which I did not participate in. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 03:50, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

With this page, given your arbitray and flimsy criterion of "two weeks ago" and "quick googling" with probably so vague a term as "Christian Forums", and your already shown to be wrong assertion that it does not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, one has to wonder.</dd>

<dd>I only found the article a few days ago.

<dd>It is far more benificial to the health of Wikipedia to remove unsourced articles if they can't be fixed within the 5 day period. If you have sources, you should feel free to post them here if you are too busy - I'm sure somebody would be happy to write them into the article for you. If you can't post them now, then there should be no prejudice against re-creating a properly sourced article later when you do have the time. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 05:09, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Excuse me</b>, but <u>from where are you pulling out this <b>5 days</b> stuff</u>? The only reference I find to it is that AfD discussions should go on for 5 days. That time period is irrelevant to how much time a page with problems should be allowed to get fixed before AfDing it.</p>
<p>BTW, consider this from<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider adding a <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_c546.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages">tag</a> such as {{<a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_Cleanup_ae6e.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_Disputes_539f.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/Disputes">disputed</a>}} instead; this may be preferable if the article has some useful content.</li>
<li>Consider making the page a useful <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">redirect</a> or proposing it be <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerge_ec58.html" title="Wikipedia:Merge">merged</a> rather than deleted. Neither of these actions requires an AfD.</li>
<li>Click <b>"what links here"</b> in the article's sidebar, to see how the page is used and referenced within Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Read the article's <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_a6d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Talk page">talk page</a>, which may provide reasons why the article should or should not be deleted.</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with the frequently cited guidelines <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>.</li>
<li>Before nominating a recently created article, please consider that many good articles started their Wikilife in pretty bad shape. Unless it is obviously <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletions_bb1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletions">a hopeless case</a>, consider sharing your reservations with the article creator, mentioning your concerns on the article's discussion page, and/or adding a <a href="../../../c/l/e/Category%7ECleanup_templates_a43d.html" title="Category:Cleanup templates">"cleanup" template</a>, instead of bringing the article to AfD.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sorry, but I just did not see a good faith effort by <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> to first do any of these less drastic things. It was one comment in the talk page probably nearly no one saw in its two week life, a {{references}} tag for a whopping EIGHT DAYS (!)...and then BAM, time to AfD!</p>
<p>Hmmmmm.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="../../../w/i/c/User_talk%7EWickethewok_1867.html#Lost_Marine" title="User talk:Wickethewok">User_talk:Wickethewok#Lost_Marine</a>. In fact, <a href="../../../w/i/c/User_talk%7EWickethewok_1867.html" title="User talk:Wickethewok">User_talk:Wickethewok</a> is just filled with complaints about the highly questionable AfD actions of Wickethewok.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm the co-founder, Ryan Swift. What information do you need? How can anything in the history be verified at this point? Well, nothing is published, and many of the historical posts related to the history of Christian Forums is blocked because I'm blocked as a user, and any post I was in is subsequently blocked from public viewing (it's a long story)...so, I have private emails from 2002 between Erwin and myself that I have archived, proving much of the information that is "unsourced." Anyone is welcome to view them or have me email them. Unfortunately, being the co-founder with Erwin, I'm not sure my input now would still qualify to meet wikipedia standards because... heh, my stuff IS original research! So who wants it? Anyone want to care to interview me and publish on a website so that a third party source can be shared on the page? Kingdomgospel.com did exist at one time verifying some of the claims made in the history section. CF is notable, and I would ask any admin reviewing this AfD to consider to KEEP this speedily, and end debate on a ridiculous AfD. If someone wants sources, they can ask me. They can interview me. They can interview Erwin - the current leader of CF. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 05:33, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
