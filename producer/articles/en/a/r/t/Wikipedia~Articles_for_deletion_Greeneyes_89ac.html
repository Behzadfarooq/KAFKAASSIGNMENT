<dd>I'm against. This webcomic has been running for years and breaks like this are quite normal on long-running webcomics. On the other hand, I find it impressive that just after creating the article and going to commit the second bunch of lines (just one or two minutes passed), I found I already had an edit conflict and it was an AFD request. I find that very unpleasant, it becomes hard to start an article like this.<a href="../../../r/v/a/User%7ERvalles_a16b.html" title="User:Rvalles">Rvalles</a> 03:27, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That's plain wrong.

<dd>To make it even funnier, just after seconds of merging that second commit and the VFD, somebody put it for speedy deletion.

<dd>Well, no. See, that's the point, we don't want you to waste your work if the comic is deemed non-notable and the article is deleted. On the other hand, if you create an article on the <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.org" rel="nofollow">Comixpedia Wiki</a> it's almost certainly not going to be deleted there. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 03:52, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>What if the next commit was going to discuss the fact that it was published in the Narobi Times, circulation 7 million, and was translated in 14 African languages? If the original author is still posting it, they obviously believe it's notable, and should at least have the chance to assert that notability.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 04:15, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Then that should <i>also</i> come up in the AfD discussion, as well as be citable. The point of a Google search is an attempt to find some kind of source that points to the notability of the comic.

<li>Bravely, I say <b>delete</b>: It's lavishly illustrated, but I do not see any indication that it is widespread, published, or discussed in <i>other media.</i> Wikipedia is not a web guide nor a web comics guide. If it's very popular within its own world, that's a fine thing, but that would be said also of certain web forums, fan fiction, and micronations.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The fact it has served as an inspiration at least one notable web comic (Tsunami Channel) is certainly evidence supporting a claim of "setting a trend" (see <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>). Though finding other references to it by other authors would be helpful.

<li>Comment: Having read "Wiki is Not" closer, I say this successfully passes the test for inclusion on all grounds. The article is NOT: defining jargon, publishing original material, propaganda (in need of NPOV, maybe, but not promotion, certainly), a repository of links, personal home page, indiscriminate list of info (as per the examples given there), or crystal ball. Therefore, by the official Wiki standards, this article merits inclusion. QED. ^_^ <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 05:32, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And one more comment to really nail the coffin of this AfD: Wiki is not a bureaucracy. Fiercely applying Alexa violates the spirit of the law (and its letter, as I just showed). So, I argue that the spirit of Wiki's rules (as well as the proto-spirit of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>) supports this articles presence. And now I'm going to be insufferable with future web comic AfDs. I just know it. ^_^ <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 05:35, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The edit history of that policy page is simply a function of the tumultuous nature of working by concensus (note that it was not added back by me, but by someone else who agreed).

Trying to discredit my views with irrelevant edit histories has no place here. It's hard to "silence a dissenting opinion" when you have yet to voice any opinion on the topic, let alone a dissenting one. As for the merits of the arbitration, I won't comment here since it's not relevant and I don't want to assist in your derailing of the AfD discussion beyond personal defense. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 07:32, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The purpose of the various notability guidelines is to remove material that is unencyclopedic—that is, material that does not (and cannot) constitute a proper article in an encyclopedia. A good article being written, as has been done here, on a subject that may be considered "non-notable" suggests that the spirit, if not the letter, of the guidelines has been satisfied. —<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 19:29, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Note that I said "good article" rather than "well-written article". I think the bar for inclusion is more easily passed by an article about an artistic work (even a little-known or unimportant one) than by an article about a mass-manufactured household item; but yes, if you were able to write such an article, I see no reason why it could not be included. It would be harder than it seems, I suspect, simply because there's very little to say about the average doorknob that is both verifiable and meaningful; but there likely are particular doorknobs (with enough history or distinguishing features) for which legitimate articles could be written—the doorknobs in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Academy_of_Sciences_baad.html" title="National Academy of Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a> building, for instance <a href="http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ABOUT_building_doors" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ABOUT_building_doors" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. —<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 03:46, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>See, this is where I totally disagree. In my time at wikipedia, I have nominated some "good" informative articles on absolutely non notable subjects, and will continue to do so. I'm surprised at the amount of support this one has obtained and the amount of attention it seems to have garnered though, but I do not think that the bar of inclusion should be lowered or raised depending on the perceived quality of an article. I would vote to keep a substub on something notable as I did for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantic_Dream&amp;oldid=21066217" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantic_Dream&amp;oldid=21066217" rel="nofollow">Quantic Dream</a> article, yet would vote to delete an article aproaching featured quality on someone's house. I don't care how much it's worth, who built it, who it's former residents were and how bad the kitchen fire of 2003 was. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 15:08, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think article quality and "notability" tend to intersect rather neatly (as I noted, perhaps less clearly than I could, above). In other words, if we are able to write a near-featured-quality article (with all of the details of referencing and so forth that the status entails) about a house, it serves as an indication that the house <i>is</i> notable; conversely, a truly non-notable house will make for a lack of references (as well as a lack of verifiable content for the article). So the quality of an article, while not the only factor, is certainly an indication of the subject's potential. —<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 16:00, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think it's worth noting that there's a lot of good information that can be written on any given work of fiction (See: <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> amongst others). Doesn't make the fiction any better or more notable. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 20:06, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hahnchen: your example would fall under the "indiscriminate information" part of "Wiki is Not." There is a large difference between a web comic that has influenced three other notable comics and someone's house. As I showed above, "Wiki is Not" clearly seems to indicate that this article is fine for inclusion. Please pick a better example to avoid the paper tiger fallacy. Also, I think a reason this has drawn attention is the fact the community thinks this article is notable. Also, there's been a much closer eye brought to the status of web comic articles on Wiki over the past few weeks in large part due to all the deletions that have happened. In essence, your own past actions (and those of others) have motivated other editors to react and respond to help make Wiki better by blocking what they think of as bad AfDs. An interesting example of a social feedback loop in action. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 02:49, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Please note that you are the only user who has made this declaration. It's easy to project our own motivations onto others, in particular when they agree to a course of action. I'd urge you to speak as much as possible for your <i>own</i> motivations. If other editors make explicit reference to blocking "bad AfDs" then you may reasonable mentions it.

<li>Actually I think I agree with Xuanwu on this. I've seen a similar reaction in response to Neutrality's campaign to delete school articles in <s>April</s> May--as a result of that reaction, it's now all but impossible for anyone to delete an article about a school provided the school actually exists and is not a pre-school. The unfortunately deletion listing of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Checkerboard_Nightmare_aedb.html" title="Checkerboard Nightmare">Checkerboard Nightmare</a> had ramifications beyond Wikipedia, and ultimately led to internal side-effects that , through the arbitration case, drew this campaign of webcomic deletions to my attention. So on a wiki, it's true that every action has an opposite reaction. History has shown that the reaction is seldom equal; deletion campaigns, where they are seen to pick the wrong target, tend to backfire because the reaction has a somewhat greater effect. Engaging in what looks like attempts to marginalise dissent, and to bully those who disagree with you, well it makes things worse. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 05:19, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Aaron, I warn you that your wording above is on the absolute edge of good faith. I'll leave my words to stand, for the current situation readily illustrates the unwisdom of deletion campaigns and the last thing this debate needs is more nitpicking.</li>
<li>And again I remind you that nobody ever needs to provide a rationale to <i>keep</i> an article. Unless a consensus can be raised to <i>delete</i> it, it will not be deleted. The article should be kept in my opinion because it's a perfectly lovely article about a rather pretty webcomic that influenced two others. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:37, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The AfD for Checkboard Nightmare was unfortunate, because it pissed a lot of people off. It was seen to pick the wrong target by many webcomics fans.

<li>Webcomics are already taking the flavour of schools, theres been a webcomic afd watch page for quite a while now. If wikipedia is going to say, "yes, let's allow articles for all webcomics", then we better start removing the wiki is not a web directory because it obviously would be. No, the comparison to the house is not fallacious, no matter what you claim. It's just that you see the house on the wrong side of indiscriminate information, whereas I see them both to be on the wrong side. So a webcomic is notable if it influences another webcomic. Right, OK, what about the webcomics which influenced this one? And then? - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 10:41, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Aaron: I think the recent efforts to "clean up" web comics on Wiki can be deemed a "deletion campaign," since deletion was the primary tool used for this clean up. Also, ym statement about a reaction to it was not judging the worthiness of the attempted clean up (it had both good and bad points about it); I am saying that people are reacting to how they preceive it. And, like it or not, many seem to view it as "bad," because articles that appear well written wound up deleted alongside those that were obvious poor entries (like some "My web comic is teh awesome~!!!111!!one!"). I'll point to this AfD as anecdotal evidence: I think a few months ago this article would have been deleted with little ceremony. Now enough people have become aware of past deletions that you're starting to see some actual debate on the topic. In some ways it's good because now the concensus is more representative of what the people want, in other ways it can be negative since it will mean having to present much stronger arguments for deletion than simply "Fails Alexa, not notable, delete" (which was the general gist of many previous AfDs). So now the people who want to see something deleted have to work harder to make it so. Not entirely bad.</li>
<li>Hahnchen: No, the house is still flawed because it is a poor example that lacks similarity to the issue at hand (again, a paper tiger you've constructed because it's easier to tackle than the matter at hand). A web comic is like a science article or a literary work. And their electronic format means they can affect thousands across the globe. When a scientific article is published, part of what makes it important is not just the results it finds, but how much it is cited (you can look online to see how this is measured). An article is important not just because of its content or how many read it, but by who cites it. If an obscure study is cited in an article that itself becomes famous, then the article cited itself is notable for the role it played in shaping that person's research. Similarly, when an artist paints, they usually study the works of others. If they become famous, then those who inspired them likewise become famous for the role they played in shaping the work. Another example, when Wen Wang became the first Emperor of the Zhou Dynasty in China, his father, Wu Wang, also became notable because of his role in setting the foundation for his son (I may be switching the roles of Wen and Wu, but you get the idea). What we have here is a webcomic that has served as a literary and artistic inspiration for at least three notable webcomics and possibly more. Therefore, it is notable in the same vein as the examples I just cited. And because the article itself passes the check of "Wiki is Not," there is no grounds for deletion. A house does not have this property of becoming notable through citation; so, again, your example is logically unsound. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 22:13, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Why? It's a decent article on a notable webcomic. It should be in the article space. Wikipedia is supposed, unless I'm very much mistaken here, to be about presenting information of value in an encyclopedic way. I'm not quite sure how thie article fails on that count so miserably that it should not exist in the article space. Are we that pressed for room in the article space that we need this to go?

<li><b>Keep</b> Notability and verifiability established to my satisfaction via evidence given by others, and the article is encyclopedic. Notability also based on the following factors:
<ul>
<li>Guest writers for some chapters are noteworthy in their own right.</li>
<li>Simultaneous story threads as an approach is of artistic signficance.</li>
<li>Use of elements for chapter headings is of artistic significance.</li>
<li>Anonymity of writer and illustrator is of artistic significance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>(Current dormancy is not evidence of non-notability. Poor Richard's Almanac is probably on hiatus too, ever since Ben Franklin died) That the article is already well written is useful but not in itself evidence of notability. It however, IS reason for the closing admin, should the decision be Delete, to hold off long enough to allow transferrence of content to a venue where notability standards are not as high, such as Comixpedia. Note: the fact that an article would be welcomed on Comixpedia is not in itself something that supports a keep, but should not be used as support for delete either. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> 18:48, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I know that people here aren't probably going to delete it nor is this going to change peoples views. But this is just to counterpoint some of Lar's claims. I can't see any of those being "artisically significant". If that were so, then every webcomic ever in existance would probable be notable enough for Lar. Simultaneous story threads? Writer anonymity? How is this of artistic significance, it's the internet, lots of things are posted anonymously or through stupid pseduonyms such as Anne Nonymous, and a webcomic to have multiple story threads is just any webcomic which isn't of "gag a day" style. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 00:24, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have to agree with Hahnchen on this: anonymity and and interweaving story telling is not notable, because Greeneyes was not the first to use either. The "Guest writers are themselves noteworthy" is a valid argument, though you'd have to be more specific. Say which guest writers were notable and why. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 02:22, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Some replies, all from Lar:
<ul>
<li>I am not sure that I agree that "people here aren't probably going to delete it nor is this going to change peoples views" as my nose counting shows this a close run thing, it depends on how the admin evaluates the consensus here. Further this discussion may well change the views or influence the views of those yet to express themselves. I know I read what is written before I add my thoughts. So it's good that you are making yourself heard even if I think you're incorrect. (and I tweaked a bit of formatting above, please feel free to untweak it if you did not like what I did)</li>
<li>The deletion nomination and several other delete comments refer to the webcomic being on hiatus, or having finished its run. That, in and of itself is not evidence of non-notability. Nor is something currently being published evidence of notability. THAT is the point I was trying to make with the Poor Richard reference, that things that happened in the past can still be notable in an encyclopedia (since wikipedia is not an almanac... THAT must be why my subconscious dredged up the Poor Richard example!). So I think, just as with CxN, just as with so many other AfD nominations I've seen lately (yes, I've been lurking about a bit, you've got my attention now, and you may hear from me again) that using "it just ended" or "it's on hiatus" is a bogus reason for deletion. Argue that it wasn't significant when it was active or that it hasn't had an effect since, but not *merely* that it's in the past. Encyclopedias cover the past as well as the present. If something was significant in the past, that it is over is irrelevant.</li>
<li>Simultaneous story threads... Yes, I am aware that many story comics have different threads, sorry for not being clearer. I refer to the fact that several of the "elements" (story chapters) were being worked on at the same time but kept separate, near as I could tell. THAT's the significance I see there, not just interweaved threads in the same story. That's a lot less common in webcomics than just having threads.</li>
<li>Guest writers are themeselves noteworthy... see <a href="http://greeneyes.metalbat.com/bio.html" class="external text" title="http://greeneyes.metalbat.com/bio.html" rel="nofollow">bio</a>. I found them noteworthy. You may not. If you ask me why and I cite their work or the fact that they have different styles, or come from different places, or chose pseudonyms that are interesting, or cite their articles here in support of their noteworthyness, we're in a regress.</li>
<li>As pointed out elsewhere, the problem of noteworthiness (er, is it I or Y?) and how to establish it is hard. Webcomics are somewhat loosely linked to highly verifiable sources, it takes a few links from source to source to get to the NYT or Brittania. But Wikipedia is not paper. I am inclusionist. While I would not include every single webcomic that ever had 2 strips published, I would include this one. In fact, I would include most of the ones that have been coming up on AfDs lately. I think the efforts to purge Wikipedia of most webcomics are misguided. Wikipedia is not paper. I am inclusionist.</li>
<li>I'll reiterate, I am satisfied with the notability and verifiability that others above me provided as well. You may not agree, which is fine. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> 03:43, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Absolutely no disadvantages to having this information. The current version of the article is pretty good, and establishes notability and verifiability. Because of that, I assume that this nomination was based on a substantially different earlier version. It's good to see that the wiki process can improve articles this way, but please remember that AfD is not cleanup.
