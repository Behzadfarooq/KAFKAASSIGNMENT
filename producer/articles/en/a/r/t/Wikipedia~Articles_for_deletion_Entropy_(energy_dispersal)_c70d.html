<dd>Change to <b>Keep</b> and re-write with references citing the article and books this concept is used in (I see it is already going in that direction). I did some research and this energy dispersal theory was conceived by Oxford physical chemist <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Atkins_8a4f.html" title="Peter Atkins">Peter Atkins</a> sometime before 1984. His 1984 very popular book the Second Law is entirely devoted to the non-mathematical interpretation of entropy in terms of “energy dispersion.” I saw this book referenced at least five times in other books before I actually bought this book. The book is written assuming the reader has no scientific background; thus the theory is based on verbal conjectures. He conceives of a intelligent being called “Boltzmann’s Demon” who relentlessly runs around re-organizing and dispersing energy and then goes on to show how Boltzmann’s “W” from his probability equation relates to energy dispersion, which transmits via atomic vibrations and collisions and other verbal arguments. Atkins restates the second law as: “energy tends to disperse”. He states: “each atom carries kinetic energy, and the spreading of the atoms spreads the energy…the Boltzmann equation therefore captures the aspect of dispersal: the dispersal of the entities that are carrying the energy.” This is all I can add for the moment. My internet service will be down for two weeks due to phone-line rewiring issues. I’ll put a good presentation of Atkins’ theory into the article when I’m back. To summarize, I suggest we keep this article; although the concept is not mainstream and although it is only a verbal approximation, skipping over any mathematical details, I think it needs to be kept so that the novice or new student to the subject knows who started this idea. --<a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESadi_Carnot_1e85.html" title="User:Sadi Carnot">Sadi Carnot</a> 16:05, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I sympathise with the desire to find intuitive ways to explain entropy, which is a thorny concept if I've ever encountered one. However, I can't see any use for this particular viewpoint except <i>perhaps</i> a couple sentences in another article: "One can roughly imagine a system's entropy as a measure of the degree to which its energy is 'spread out' or not available for useful work," etc. Unless I see evidence that this viewpoint has been adopted as the <i>primary</i> definition of entropy in a <i>significant number</i> of textbooks by <i>different authors</i> then I say we spread this article out itself. Wikipedia is not the place to hash out the merits of different vague analogies; let the people who are paid to do that try for that dubious prize. <a href="../../../a/n/v/User%7EAnville_a648.html" title="User:Anville">Anville</a> 17:32, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as patent nonsense and claptrap. Although entropy may seem confusing to young students, it has a very crisp and unambiguous definition.

Entropy has a deep and broad and established theory, and trying to argue that its somehow "wrong" is declaring intellectual kinship to "Einstein was wrong about relativity". <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 04:18, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Special or General? The point is <i>not</i> that the theory of 2LOT, or of entropy, is wrong, but that it has been <u>taught</u> incorrectly (the same has been true of both theories of relativity). Entropy is taught as equaling (an increase in) chaos and disorder -- and <i>that</i> definition is patent nonsense.</li>
<li>As an aside, relativity never became what Eistein had hoped -- the great theory of everything. Within a generation, relativity was in a battle with quantum theories, with Einstein strongly opposing these theories for quite some time. Today they live side-by-side in relative (no pun) peace, although string and M-theory cast some additional doubts. (Oh, BTW, less than 120 years ago the mantra would have been, "that's like someone saying Newton was wrong about his three laws". Well, in a sense he was -- relativity better explains the same phenomena -- and yet his formulae are still used today because they are close enough for general purposes.) <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 17:16, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- the viewpoint is worthy of note, and not OR (in the WP sense). It has been presented in journal articles, taken up as a general gloss by some chemistry textbooks, and is widespread on the web. ("Entropy can be roughly understood as disorder; or as dispersal of energy"). <i>Both</i> of these rough understandings are worth a short discussion of their usefulness, applicability and limits, and/or a discussion of how a more sophisticated understanding of entropy may require words to be specifically defined in perhaps rather non-intuitive ways. However, the place for that discussion is in the main article on entropy, and it should be possible to summarise it well in a few lines. Devoting a whole article to it here is inappropriate overkill; equally inappropriate would be to try to ghettoise all discussion of it to here. The existence of this article is both unnecessary, and unhelpful. The discussion should return to the main article. <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheald_bb56.html" title="User:Jheald">Jheald</a> 04:53, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

As an introductory teaching method presented as being fully compatible with standard textbook stuff it has achieved notability both on the web and in a significant number of chemistry textbooks. I agree with Jheald that there should be a brief discussion of the usefulness and applicability of this method in the main entropy article, pointing to any critical analysis and limitations of this approach as well as noting what usefulness it may have for those who find thermodynamic entropy easier to understand when directly related to energy and temperature. This page has been cobbled together by "Sadi Carnot" as part of a vitriolic campaign to hide these ideas.

<p><b>Comment</b></p>
<p>This AfD debate has been rushed through on the basis of a new article cobbled together by "Sadi Carnot", an opponent of the ideas presented. He included extracts from the <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entropy.html" title="Entropy">entropy</a> article including a wildy innaccurate statement presented as though it represented the "dispersal" view which had actually been introduced to the entropy article at 03:13, 6 October 2006 by 172.129.75.141.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Entropy&amp;diff=79778159&amp;oldid=79654989" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Entropy&amp;diff=79778159&amp;oldid=79654989" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Entropy&amp;diff=79778750&amp;oldid=79778159" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Entropy&amp;diff=79778750&amp;oldid=79778159" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> He also included an unsourced biographical claim about Lambert conceiving "of a new view" which contradicts the presentation made by Lambert on his website, so I have commented it out. I've revised the intro to give a more neutral description in line with the cited sources: this is just a start on the revision work needed to make this an accurate well sourced article.

<p><b>Undecided</b> - First of all, I am not a Wikipedia lawyer. The only thing that interests me is the validity of the theory. As it is presented in the web pages and the peer-reviewed journal articles, "energy dispersal" is never precisely, quantitatively defined and so its relationship to entropy change is never precisely described, at least for the entropy of mixing case, which presents the deepest problem for the theory. If energy dispersal could be defined satisfactorily, the question of whether it would give the theory a more solid grounding or less, I don't know right now. If I had to bet, I would say it would not (forgive me Frank Lambert).</p>
<p>As to the question of whether to keep the article or delete it, this is a lawyers question. In my mind, if the theory has gained as much currency as some have suggested, it would be worth keeping. If not, it should be deleted. If 70 percent of the people doubt the theory of evolution, that is enough to warrant a Wikipedia article discussing their doubts, whether those doubts are well founded or not. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPAR_bf60.html" title="User:PAR">PAR</a> 04:29, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> for lack of notability - I've spent years studying entropy and never run into this vague notion of "entropy as energy dispersal". There are reasons why. One is that entropy is a fundamental notion that does not presuppose any concept of energy for its definition; the concept of "energy" or "Hamiltonian" applies to classical or quantum systems with time translation invariance", while "entropy" applies to <b>all</b> classical and quantum systems. So, no complete definition of entropy can refer to energy. Another is that no way of quantifying "energy dispersal" is given (at least not here), and entropy is above all a quantitative concept! In short, the explanation of entropy doesn't really explain the concept, so few people use it. I see only references to a few poorly known texts. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Baez_eb76.html" title="User:John Baez">John Baez</a> 04:35, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The long-standing gloss of explaining entropy as a measure of "disorder" has been used so often by proponents of ID to confuse or mislead (eg:life shows so much order, there must have been a designer, otherwise it would conflict with the second law), that it is understandable if heartfelt opponents of ID are attracted to discussions of entropy that promote a focus on the "dispersal of energy" instead. Because life (and evolution) certainly disperses energy - so it's much more obvious that if ID people try to run this argument they don't have a leg to stand on. That I think is why ID opponents are so strong about wanting to see dispersion of energy as <i>the</i> way to roughly understand entropy (and it does seem much more tangible, too). But for all the reasons discussed in Talk:Entropy:Archive4 and elsewhere, IMO the "dispersal of energy" talk is a shortcut too far. Instead, IMO the thing to stress is that the (spatial) dispersal of energy by living things far outweighs the apparent increase in their internal order as they grow. Both contribute to the accounting for the second law. "Disorder" (or "disorderedness"), if used as a gloss for entropy, has a very specific meaning, namely "the total number of microstates compatible with the macroscopic description", the microstates reflecting not only the internal orderedness, but also a single state of the external arrangement of energy too. So to anti-ID crusaders I say: you don't actually require a definition of entropy as "dispersal of energy" to knock this particular ID-sponsored confusion down. <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheald_bb56.html" title="User:Jheald">Jheald</a> 23:21, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm going to be blunt, deal with it. Strawman? Red Herring? Whatever it is, it's bullshit. If you think my life revolves around the fucking crap IDists spew and that I want to find some way to explain entropy in a way that does not fit in with their delusions, then you yourself are deluded. The two discussions have nothing to do with each other (other than the strawmen erected by IDists, and apparently feared by others. Perhaps you lack the sufficient intellect to see that, but it is the case nonetheless. And quite frankly, even if the elementary teaching of entropy deals with energy dispersal, and even if this "plays" into the hands of the IDists, so fucking what? Their arguments are still wrong. One cannot simply decide that because a definition might inconveniently be used by someone else to further their inane gibberish is <i>not</i> a reason to exclude the defiition.

<dd>Jim, if you care to <i>read</i> my comment, you'll see you appear to have the point I was making exactly back-to-front. It is entropy as <i>disorder</i> that IDists are misinterpreting. But that is no reason to blind yourself to shortcomings of descriptions of entropy exclusively as energy dispersal. <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheald_bb56.html" title="User:Jheald">Jheald</a> 16:37, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's a fair point that the need for a clear and accessible explanation arises when, for example, at <a href="../../../e/v/o/Talk%7EEvolution_Archive_016_6cbd.html#Kinds" title="Talk:Evolution/Archive 016">Talk:Evolution/Archive 016#Kinds</a>, 22:04, 14 May 2006, <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangil_7eeb.html" title="User:Sangil">User:Sangil</a> drew on his degree in Bioinformatics to advise us that <i>"It is true the 2nd law deals mainly with energy. However, many other types of systems have used the 2nd law as a "guiding principle", since many natural phenomena appear to behave in a similiar way (i.e. that with time the disorder in a system increases). It is in this broader sense, and note in the strict energetical sense, that I refer to it."</i> In trying to improve the Evolution article to deal with such reasoning I revisited the entropy and 2nd Law articles and found that they no longer provided a useful explanation. (see <a href="../../../e/v/o/Talk%7EEvolution_Archive_016_6cbd.html#Self-organization_and_entropy" title="Talk:Evolution/Archive 016">Self-organization and entropy</a> for my proposed explanation) It's certainly important that articles should be fully correct at an advanced level, but the evidence is that "energy dispersal" is a recent but well established way of introducing the topic to beginners, something which Wikipedia also needs to achieve. To the extent that the approach has limitations, these should be made clear....<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 14:41, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment:</b> Some further remarks on entropy versus energy dispersal:</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the concept of entropy is useful even in systems where energy is completely irrelevant. The concept of entropy does not logically depend on concept of energy. So, one can't explain entropy very well using "energy dispersal".</p>
<p>Conversely, one can't understand the tendency of systems towards "energy dispersal" unless one understands something called <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helmholtz_free_energy.html" title="Helmholtz free energy">free energy</a>. This quantity is related to entropy, but it's not the same: it's the energy minus the temperature times the entropy.</p>
<p>If you want to know why water is a crystal (low entropy) at low temperatures, but a gas (high entropy) at high temperatures, you need to realize that the water is not maximizing its entropy. It's minimizing its free energy. So, free energy is very important in chemistry.</p>
<p>And, to see why energy tends to disperse, you need to see that this process is how a system moves towards a lower free energy.</p>
<p>So, energy dispersal might be a good way to explain <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helmholtz_free_energy.html" title="Helmholtz free energy">free energy</a>, but not entropy. If some textbooks are using it to explain entropy, and this therefore merits a Wikipedia article, then I pray that the article say why this is a poor explanation, and point the reader to a better one. I can also suggest a lot of other articles on lousy explanations I've seen in textbooks. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Baez_eb76.html" title="User:John Baez">John Baez</a> 15:12, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Comment: If you can improve the article, and have verifiable sources which say "this is claptrap" or whatever, please do add them. We have an article on Intelligent design, which is... well, I'd say crap science but it isn't even science at all, so um.. We have an article on Kent Hovind. Notable, and definately nonsense. I'm not saying Entropy (energy dispersal) is nonsense, I'm simply saying that "This is wrong" ≠ "This should be deleted" as a one-to-one relation. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 19:27, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- it might be a good idea to think this all the way through: <i>If you want to know why water is a crystal (low entropy) at low temperatures, but a gas (high entropy) at high temperatures, you need to realize that the water is not maximizing its entropy. It's minimizing its free energy.</i> If at its freezing point water has low entropy, and at boiling it has high entropy, and if the issue is the difference between minimization and maximization of potential energy, then it would seem to follow that at minimum little energy is being dispersed, and at maximum much energy is being dispersed. (Of course there's a chicken and egg argument in here, I just happen to think you have them reversed, especially as external energy is required to move from min to max). In any case, this method of teaching entropy is quiter sound, a good bit moreso than an argument that an <i>attempt to measure</i> distance more accurately than at the Plank length would <i>cause</i> a black hole. &#160;;) <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 23:29, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> What is the difference between this and James Kay's published ideas on dissipative systems? Wouldn't this idea of dispersal be the similar?

<li><b>Keep</b> this page is a description of a pedagogical approach that has been popularized to teach the concept of entropy. Whether is is right or wrong does not matter, it exists, it is not OR and students clearly find it useful since it is popping up in textbooks. If this is not <i>part of the sum of human knowledge</i> that wikipedia is trying to collate then I seriously think this encyclopedia is getting off track. i do agree that with John Baez that the weaknesses of this idea should be presented and be used as a springboard to more sophisticated ideas of entropy. In fact, to me, this seems like a primary reason for keeping the article. Deleting this page will not make the concept go away in the real world. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 19:07, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The claim that it comes from Entropy#Ice melting example presumably relates to a "main article" link there added by "Sadi Carnot" when he set this up as a POV fork to denigrate the approach. I've removed that link and have considerably revised this article: your suggestion of moving an improved article to another title has merit, though "pedagogical approaches" seems rather clumsy. Evidently a number of eminent authors providing textbooks for those beginning to learn about entropy don't feel that it's claptrap, though the talk here is evidence that those educated in other systems can find it hard to accept. ...<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 14:55, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> This viewpoint on entropy is better served as perhaps a line in another article but certainly not deserving of an article of its very own.
