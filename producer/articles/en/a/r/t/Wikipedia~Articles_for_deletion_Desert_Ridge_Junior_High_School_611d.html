<p>Non-noteworthy junior high school. Only sources are the school itself and a directory; I'm unable to find anything with Google News or Lexis-Nexis.

<dd>Also, I am going to try and improve it a little. While it is simply a middle school, it hurts nothing to have information about the subject. So there should be no reason to delete unless the school is written with such POV that there is no hope of fixing, or as stated above, consensus has been reached.

<ul>
<li>Is there potential for expansion? Based on what? There isn't a single news or scholarly article about the school that I could find, and nobody else has yet been able to present one. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable independent sources</a> are required to expand this article beyond a directory entry, and I contend that they do not exist.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Why the desire to remove schools, is Wiki running out of electrons? There's plenty of space and this is valid information and certainly notable to some. Just because it's not notable to ME doesn't seem sufficient to delete. Drew30319 17:56, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Google provides nothing. Literally <i>every</i> keep vote above has been "keep because all schools are notable" or "keep because there's no notability guideline currently established" or "keep because if we delete this, we'll have to delete all schools". The only thing stated above that even <i>matters</i> is "keep because the info is verifiable", but that doesn't really make sense, as we delete verifiable info all the time, and info about a non-notable middle school should be no different. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 19:33, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are right, so far there has not been 1 valid reason to keep the article. Nothing has been provided to show why this school is notable, and unless something is provided before this vote is closes then this article should be deleted (or merged like Sjakkalle suggested). <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 18:50, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Umm. No. <b>Every</b> keep vote hasn't been for the reasons that you've listed. I stated that because it isn't notable to <i>me</i> doesn't mean that it's not notable. <b>And</b> I questioned if we're running out of electrons. Why the rush to remove information that is undoubtedly notable to some? The article isn't harming anybody or anything so let it be. Rather than looking for articles to delete spend ten minutes and add more information to it (as I did). And then take a deep breath and feel good about the value you've added to Wiki.
