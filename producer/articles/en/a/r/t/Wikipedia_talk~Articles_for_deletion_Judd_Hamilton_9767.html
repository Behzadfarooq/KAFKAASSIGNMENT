	    <p>Hello, I am the Judd Hamilton in question. I was glad to finally access the deletion discussion as regards the information that had previously been available about myself. Although I began last year by being favorably impressed with the 'apparent' open policy of sharing 'honest' information that Wikipedia proclaims, I find the entire process and rules and regulations of Wikipedia (of which of course there must be reasonable rules and regulations) now difficult to comprehend. Honest, open! Perhaps, but that is now not what I'm witnessing. Yes the informtion that was deleted is biographical. Is that a crime under Wikipedia's obviously severely coveted rules and regulations? Yes after originally viewing information on Wikipedia regarding another entry to which I am 'directly' associated and responsible to protect the integrity of, Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Reynolds, I decided to become a user so as to not be hidden or removed from your process. The original H, JF &amp; R information was flawed, especially as regards my late brother Dan. Therefore I felt compelled to 'put the record straight' and make sure that any information about H, JF &amp; R and/or myself was 'true'. One of your erstwhile review experts states that I am claiming to have been the principle in the first million-selling single in Japanese history. Complete rubbish and actually somewhat insulting! It is not myself who was a principle in the first million-selling record but instead my late brother Dan Hamilton who wrote 'Diamond Head', an instrumental record recorded by our friends The Ventures. And indeed it was the first million-selling single in Japanese history. How audacious of some anonymous critic to insert such a false accusation against me, as nowhere did the information I've faithfully reported state this 'so-called' inaccuracy! As far whether I am a person of notability, ceratinly that is in the eye of the beholder and not myself, and others must make that call. I have however done exactly what the bio I edited and posted states, including have a Top 100 No. 3 best selling single with my group The T-Bones in 1966, as well as appearing in and producing the films and television projects that are listed in the now 'deleted' Judd Hamilton file. Another of the 3 or 4 opinions for deletions (a very small consenus I might add) asserted that the information was somehow self-serving. Is the truth self-serving? What I'm now witmnessing is that Wikipedia is governed by what appears for all intensive purposes a small, relatively anonymous clique of Internet elitist who do not recognise that when a integral, honest person's information is accepted and posted and then relatively arbitrarily deleted, it serves to then discredit that person. That reality is something I would suggest your organization should take very seriously within your deletion policy's. If Wikipedia is truly seeking to present a straightforward, honest, open and credible public Internet forum I would also suggest that you not make it so extremely difficult to understand and inter-relate with, because generally speaking and in my opinion it truly is an obstacle course of perpetually confusing rules and regulations. We are not all computer/Internet whiz kids, but those of us who now must depend on your honest monitoring are fellow humans with sensitivities and reputations that do not need to be questioned by a few volunteer, albeit even well-intended, critics who may in some cases not always know what they are arbitrarily opining about. Perhaps the way I presented the 'accurate' bio info is not in adherence with some of your rules and regulations. If so just let me know and I'm sure rather than now deleting and therefore discrediting me, together we can correct any 'honest' miscalculations of acceptable inclusion. If you would like to consult directly with me about this matter you can reach me a juddhamilton@yahoo.com Sincerely, Judd Hamilton 71.231.205.232 02:25, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
