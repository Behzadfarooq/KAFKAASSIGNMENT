<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. The reasons to keep were 'anyone in the fandom knows about it', 'I don't see an AFD on foo', and 'referred to in it's domain'. Only one decent argument to keep (from <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">User:GreenReaper</a>), and far better ones to delete from the nom, Kotepho, Andrew, Reyk and so on.

<ul>
<li>Only if you accept any fandom at all as being significant. The furry fandom has enough support to hold multiple annual conventions with attendance in the thousands in North America alone, and is noteworthy enough to be ridiculed in national press a couple of times per year. Surely that merits inclusion of at least the top half-dozen touchstones of the fandom? Yerf, VCL, FurryMUCK, and Anthrocon would be the top four (in no particular order). If we can have articles on every village in the US, and every last pokemon character, how exactly can you justify setting the bar this high for a fandom? What I'm asking for is a _consistent_ bar, and I believe the Yerf article is well above anywhere you could reasonably place such a threshold based on the contents of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 05:10, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, no-one is stopping you from mentioning the website on <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">furry fandom</a>. This is about whether it has enough notability/relevance in the rest of the world outside of furries to justify its own article. It does not. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 07:28, 9 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You keep _stating_ this, but you haven't yet stated _why_ you consider it acceptable to have a varying standard for notability. Go and AfD all of the minor Pokemon articles referenced by the essay you dislike, and all but the more notable of the 30,000 US cities added by Rambot, if you're sincere about removing cruft from Wikipedia. Failing that, explain why furry fancruft should be removed while the other material in this example shouldn't. I have no problem with _standards_; I have a problem with _double_-standards. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 16:23, 9 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Asking me to AFD every bit of cruft before I get around to your personal favourite is just a little unreasonable, don't you think? Have you watched AFD recently -- did you see the mass Trekcruft nominations a couple of days ago? There's still a lot more of that to go. You aren't making an argument <i>for</i> Yerf... you are arguing that because there is lots of cruft in Wikipedia, we should have more. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 16:49, 9 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am asking you to go about your anti-cruft campaign in order of inverse notability. Go after the items with hundreds, instead of hundreds of thousands, of Google hits first. My <i>argument</i> is that given that all of this cruft that is far less notable than Yerf is currently being _kept_, a) Yerf satisfies whatever de-facto threshold for notability is being used on Wikipedia at present, and b) people seem to be using this de-facto threshold, as otherwise the cruft wouldn't be present at all. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 20:38, 9 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>1. Yerf does not satisfy the WP:WEB criteria. 2. Notability is about more than just being known to a few fans of the genre. 3. Keeping cruft in Wikipedia is easy, deleting it is hard work since block voting is commonplace. People vote keep regardless of guidelines, policies or arguments -- and this includes you. There's a much larger argument here about how Wikipedia is collecting unencylopedic rubbish because people can't get it in to their heads that Wikipedia isn't their personal diary, or a directory of fan crud, and that the AFD is so horribly broken that any crappy article can be block voted indefinitely by half a dozen fans (even though it is technically not supposed to be a vote). 4. Your argument boils down to this: there's already worse crap in Wikipedia, so why get rid of this. This is unjustifiable given the way Wikipedia works. We are dealing with Yerf now. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 22:18, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Would creating a new page, something like Furry art sites, and using that to combine the current Yerf, FA, and VCL articles, be an acceptable compromise? <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 18:05, 9 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, This isn't the place to be striking bargains about other articles. This is a discussion of the notability of Yerf. However, I can't say how other editors would react. All I can say is that if you create an article for Furry art sites, I will put it up for deletion. You don't need it, and they are not notable outside of the furry sub-culture. If you want to discuss Yerf, do it on <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">Furry fandom</a>. It does not justify its own article. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 18:20, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In practice what'll probably happen is that I'll do a minor rewrite of <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">furry fandom</a> to list the most notable art sites, conventions, people, and so forth (top handful that most people in the fandom know about), and a few years down the road when enough mentions in the press exist to stave off an AfD, expand the sections out into articles. It just annoys me, greatly, that a) this article is being deleted vastly out-of-order if we're sorting by notability, and b) <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">User:Motor</a> seems to be dismissing all offshoot articles relating to furry fandom as non-notable out of hand. To give an analogy, this would be like doing the same to the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Goth.html" title="Goth">goth</a> subculture 10-15 years ago (which is the main reason I'm not worried about this dismissal affecting the long-term outlook for inclusion). --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 20:38, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm somewhat hesitant to weigh in on some furry AFDs, but not this one. Yerf is a decade-old website whose significance as the premiere all-ages anthropomorphic art site is hard to underestimate. It has been temporarily less busy (<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=max&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;url=http://yerf.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=max&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;url=http://yerf.com/" rel="nofollow">alexa ranking details</a>) because for a time the site was down, and it is still ramping back up to full operational status, but that does not diminish its historical impact. If the WP:WEB guidelines do not cover it, then I believe they are in error. It may be that this article does not sufficiently establish the site's notability. If so, I suggest inclusion of some of the information available at <a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Yerf" class="extiw" title="wikifur:Yerf">WikiFur's version</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 17:47, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
