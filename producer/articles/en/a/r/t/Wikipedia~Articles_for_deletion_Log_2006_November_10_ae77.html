For whatever it's worth, yes, I'm an user of the MUCK, yet when I pull on my Wikipedia Admin hat, I have no problem if the article is deleted if that's what the community thinks; it's just that there's definitely something funny in Wikipedia's policies what comes to situations like this.

<li>Guys, I sympathise. Really. The fact is, we have to have good sources, and there <i>are</i> none for this, as far as I can tell. WikiFur can cover it in all its glory because they don't have verifiability and neutrality policies to worry about, but we do - the largest <i>furry</i> MU* is also not that much of a claim; the furry community is not that big to start with and the subset that plays MU* games is (as noted above) in the hundreds or low thousands at most. Every day we delete web forums and online games with mroe users than this, for the very same reason: no substantive coverage in secondary sources independent of the subject. Directory listings, fan forums and nothing else. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 09:48, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>First of all, I agree on principle; I just disagree slightly with your assessment of the numbers.<br />
One thing to consider: Above, I'm speaking of <i>concurrent users at a specific time</i>, not <i>total</i> number of user accounts, so these numbers are not exactly comparable. <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaia_Online_5051.html" title="Gaia Online">Gaia Online</a>'s front page they have 13,541 users online. Suddenly looks pretty small. Also says there's 5,026,922 users <i>total</i>. Not so small any more. There's no numbers on the total user count in Tapestries, which is pretty nasty.<br />
Secondly, as I tried to hint above, <i>Tapestries is a very large MU* compared to all other MU*s</i>, not <i>just</i> compared to other furry MU*s.<br />
<i>Basically</i>, we're sitting on top of the exact thought experiments that the policies use (or used, last I checked): Sure, we have a <i>big</i> MU* here, everyone knows it's a big and important MU* that has had tons of impact, but <i>we can't prove it's big and important through sources,</i> so apparently it's not fit to be included in Wikipedia. (And bees can't fly, either, if you believe the sources.) Using thought experiments is kind of flimsy, so I propose we change these policies to use this as a living example of what we <i>can't do.</i> We need a good example of "criteria for inclusion is verifiability, not truth". We need an <i>example</i> of <i>truth</i> that we can't include, enshrined forever in our policies. If we're to delete this, <i>let's make an example out if it.</i> It's entirely reasonable in my opinion.<br />
And again, sorry for going off like this.

<li><b>Neutral</b> Oh, man, I dunno about this one. Part of me wants to just say <i>"Strong Keep, Duh, of course it's notable!"</i> and leave it at that. If only things were that simple. On one hand, this is extremely notable within the online furry community, both widely-known and widely-played. On the other hand we have the fundamental problem of reliable sources: even with the many gaming magazines out there, few of them ever bother to cover the comings-and-goings of the MUCK world, and if they did they'd still probably stay away from the adult-oriented Tapestries. Finally, there's the issue of precedent-setting: articles about MU*s tend to attract more articles about MU*s, which the creators then vigorously defend because if there's even one MU* article on all of Wikipedia then they have a constitutional right to theirs too. To sum it all up, I'm torn. I'd love it if somebody showed up with some realiable sources os we could keep this, but if not, well, there's always WikiFur. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 03:32, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The largest, and among the oldest, mucks dedicated to its particular fandom. It's also one of the oldest and most populous adult-oriented mucks. It's apparently been featured in a <i>Wired News</i> article, a 1999 public radio international feature called <i>Beyond Computers</i>, a San Francisco Bay Guardian article from 1998. It was a link of the day at <a href="http://www.igda.org/sex/archives/2005/10/link_of_the_day_55.html" class="external text" title="http://www.igda.org/sex/archives/2005/10/link_of_the_day_55.html" rel="nofollow">Sex &amp; Games</a>, published by the International Game Developers' Association -- and that's just from five minutes of searching.

<li><b>Comment</b> I haven't finished researching this school yet (getting close to bedtime) but one student did place first in a low level state gymnastic competition- I have added a note about that to the article. The only other mentions of the school that aren't directory entries or something similar seem to be <a href="http://knoxville.yourhub.com/POWELL/Stories/Spirit/Military/Story~89356.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://knoxville.yourhub.com/POWELL/Stories/Spirit/Military/Story~89356.aspx" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> which might have some relevant data, it notes a "military theme" for last graduation and has a few other minor details which might be able to be incorporated into the article. This <a href="http://knoxville.yourhub.com/POWELL/Stories/Education/School-News/Story~128390.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://knoxville.yourhub.com/POWELL/Stories/Education/School-News/Story~128390.aspx" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> discusses their accelerated reading program and may also have a few details if anyone really wants to sort it out. The only other interesting one is <a href="http://www.whitestonechurch.org/studentmin.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitestonechurch.org/studentmin.asp" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> where the mention is incidental (and unreliable in any event- they can't even spell - "Bible studies") but sounds like it might be a first amendment case waiting to happen (except given the location this sort of thing might be taken for granted and without more details it is hard to see precisely what they are doing. The description is consistent with completely legal behavior- I may just be a cynical evil liberal). Presumably if they get an interesting case about that then the school would become notable but that obviously hasn't happened yet. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 06:34, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s>*<b>Weak but almost normal delete</b></s> Ok, mainly per some of the above comments and my own comments earlier. Despite researching I could find nothing notable about the school. The only reason why this is weak delete is that I don't know enough about gymnastics to tell whether the mentioned gymnastic result could be arguably notable or not. From my limited knowledge my impression is no, but I'm not completely sure- the most reasonable test for that - presence of non-trivial coverage, indicates a lack of notability in the gymnastic success. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 06:41, 10 November 2006 (UTC) Changing to full <b>delete</b> per evidence/comments from Fram below. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:59, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's bad enough that we tend to keep every single high school, please don't make a precedent of keeping every single elementary school as well. This is non-notable and so what if it was demolished and rebuilt? Two different elementary schools in my hometown, both of which are just as non-notable, have had the same thing happen to them and I'd assume it's not very uncommon across the US, let alone across the world (especially in developing countries). I must point out, as I have a tendency to do, what kind of precedent keeping this would set. First of all we'd have to take every elementary school, not only in the US but worldwide, that fits is as notable as this school, meaning most elementary schools would be able to get articles. This is not something Wikipedia needs, it amounts (as does keeping high schools, but that's an entirely different topic of discussion) essentially to a detailed directory and Wikipedia is NOT supposed to function as a directory.

<li><b>Delete</b> Searching for reliable sources is a bit difficult using google because there are multiple such schools (including it seems two by this name in California). If kept, this should be moved and "Ponderosa Elementary School" turned into a disambig page. That said, the only press coverage I can find is the article already mentioned at the bottom of the page which simply mentions the school in the context of an incident that occured on a school bus (from a different school). Thus, we have trouble getting any significant verifiable information. This is even before we get to questions of notability. Not surprisingly, the school has no real claims of notability, with no notable alumns, no notable awards, no athletes or teams that have performed at a notable level or anything else that might pass for notability. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:58, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

    In July 2002, Javed Sheikh's Yeh Dil Aap Ka Huwa [1] (Urdu for This Heart is Yours) starring Moammar Rana and Ayesha Sana, was released and
    had grossed over Rs. 200 million (US $3.4 million) across Pakistan. However, the short period of successes in the industry could not keep the 
    cinemas afloat and the same industry that at one time produced more than a 100 films annually a decade ago now reduced to a merely 32 in the 
    year 2003 with only one partial success called Larki Panjaban (A Punjabi Girl).

<p>I am new to Wikipedia and a fan of the said comic strip. Personally, I joined in hopes of adding articles for the category of animated films, but daunted by the idea I decided to start with a simpler concept and, just recently viewing the Funny Bunnies website, considered it to be a good start. I did find 88 hits when searching Google, but the relevancy of them is debatable. Having no connection to the author of this strip other than an exchange of a few emails the past week, I have no problems with this Wikipedia article being deleted. Whether or not it will be is up to administration. Thank you for your time.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> – I was intrigued by the assertion this article met <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Google says “bunny bunnies” without being limited to comics, gets only 35,000 general hits, of which only 767 are distinct. An examination of the 767 hits, which is pretty tiny in the WWW scheme of things, shows a lot of mention for an unrelated book of the same name. Alexa shows the webcomic’s site is not in their top 100,000 ranks, even allowing for the fact it doesn’t take a lot of visits to move up. However, neither Google nor Alexa are final arbiters of notability per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> says the comic needs to have been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works; the content/website needs to have won some well-known and independent award; and, the content is distributed by a site which is both well known and independent of the creators. Of these three conditions, the third is clearly met by the Ottawa Herald. The comic however fails to show being the subject of <i>any</i> non-trivial published works, nor does the website or comic boast any well-known, independent awards. “funny bunnies”+”cyrus oliver” gets only three hits, two being the author’s website and the third being a Xanga page. I parenthetically note the article also fails the general <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 10:30, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>del</b> some neopaganic speculations.

Of course, there is some mythology about Sun and Moon, but this article is hoppeless. While it is a rather harmless text, in view of the current drive for article quality it has to go. I could have suggested to move it under some resonable title, kinda Slavic Moon deities, but it sits he in unverified state for like 3 years now. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 01:46, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article's legitimate reference was a broken link to the Guinness Book of World Records. I went to find the link manually through their page and through Google, with no luck.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The link to The Straight Dope article suggests that only 2/3rds of the chicken's head was cut off, but the pictures seem to show total decapitation. Is that an inconsistentcy or is my knowledge of poultry biology lacking? --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_1142.html" title="User:BradBeattie">Brad Beattie</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBradBeattie_69e6.html" title="User talk:BradBeattie">(talk)</a></small></sup> 02:20, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The pictures are right, but you are thinking of the neck/head region as a human has as opposed to how a chicken has. The actual decapitation was across the very back of the head, leaving (very likely) the parts of the brain needed for more automatic processes. Imagine you are decapitated but with the blade falling down through the back of your head behind the ears.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 03:50, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notable (if extremely odd) cultural phenomenon. The Straight Dope article shows that Mike has been covered in Life magazine as well as a Garrison Keillor book. I do however support a merge of the Lloyd Olsen article into Mike's article though. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 02:51, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ah, cool. So the question I have then is whether this is a hoax or not. If it is, I understand that it'll still be notable considering what you discovered there. If not, then I stand astounded. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_1142.html" title="User:BradBeattie">Brad Beattie</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBradBeattie_69e6.html" title="User talk:BradBeattie">(talk)</a></small></sup> 02:59, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think the Straight Dope column puts to rest any possibility that it was a hoax: as Cecil writes, "<i>This sort of thing evidently occurs fairly often. When Dear Abby ran a column on it a while back she got clippings and eyewitness reports about headless-but-living chickens from all over the country."</i> So not only isn't it fake, it's not even unique or all that uncommon. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 03:09, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>...and besides that, Olsen charged 25 cents to see Mike and supposedly made $4500 a month for 18 months, quite a pretty penny in those days. By rough estimate, and counting paying customers only, that means at least 325,000 saw Mike up close and in person. There's a whole lot of eyewitnesses to Mike's realness out there. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 03:14, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> There's enough reliable evidence that a festival in Mike's honour exists, whether the story is true or not.

In particular, his story has appeared in <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_magazine.html" title="Life magazine">Life magazine</a> (22 October 1945), and he's had a book written about him (Teri Thomas, <i>The Official Mike the Headless Chicken Book - A 1940s Tale of Two Men and a Chicken</i>), so I don't think <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is in any trouble here.

<p>There has not been enough written about this subject to make it verifiable, and I don't belive it is notable enough for inclusion anyway. The economy of a game does not deserve its own article.

<p>Appears to be a vanity page. On the creator's <a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMstsage_5a76.html" title="User:Mstsage">user page</a>, he claims to wrestle under the name of "Rane". The article says Rane Helms' official web page is www.mstsage.com, and that his myspace page is myspace.com/mstsage. So clearly the user who created the page is Rane Helms. Other than myspace pages, Google turned up no verifiable information on this person. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalkiped_f3a0.html" title="User:Walkiped">Walkiped</a> 03:03, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Article on a local church that reads like a directory/advertisement (violating the policy on what <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a>) and that contains no assertion of encyclopedic notability. Claims to have been around for 75 years.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Would've happily speedy tagged it, but what would it fit under? It's not really nonsensical (the text is coherent, even if silly), and there's no "no assertion of notability" category for neologisms. <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> specifically states that even obvious hoaxes aren't speedy candidates just due to the hoax factor. It also seems to provide enough context not to fit under {{db-blank}}, even if barely. As many of these as there are, I think "neologism that doesn't assert notability" <i>should</i> be a speedy criterion, but as of now it's not. If you know of one that does fit though, let me know, I see a lot of this stuff on NP patrol-usually the prod just gets left, but in this case it didn't. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 09:55, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It doesn't fit the criteria exactly, but it is partly nonsensical, un-notable, and has virtually no context. <i>In my opinion</i>, that should make it worthy of a speedy deletion. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinach_Dip_4b8e.html" title="User:Spinach Dip">Spinach Dip</a> 10:21, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Honestly, as I am reading the several links given about why this article should be deleted, how it is -not- notiable. Yes, there are several articles about furry and whatnot.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> I'm amazed at that the assertion that this is non-notable. <i>This is not a website</i>.

<li>I've always heard it wasn't good that basically it had no gameplay aspect at all. Then I looked and saw it had no media references.

<dd>Gameplay is provided by scripts that execute on objects within the world. I guess the people who you heard that from never went to go and play in one of those areas, or just didn't like them. Like <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Life_f75c.html" title="Second Life">Second Life</a>, it is not exactly a game so much as an online interaction space. People do tend to roleplay there, there's a system called <i>Furre!</i> based on the Pocket Universe RPG rules, and the popular webcomic <a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Dan_and_Mab%27s_Furry_Adventures" class="extiw" title="wikifur:Dan_and_Mab's_Furry_Adventures">Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures</a> is based on it.

<li><b>Second the comment</b> At any given time there are probably thousands of articles on Wikipedia that could reasonably be reviewed for deletion and it does look highly suspect when several of them from a related subject area get nominated at about the same time, at least when the articles in question have existed for many months (in some cases over a year) and were developed and maintained independently of one another. <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalimu59_7f54.html" title="User:Mwalimu59">Mwalimu59</a> 14:57, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I'm seeing plenty of reliable sources. Richard A. Bartle's book "<i>Designing Virtual Worlds</i>" (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0131018167</a>) cites it as being among the first graphical worlds to allow player-created construction. Jeannie Novak's "<i>Game Development Essentials: An Introduction</i>" (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1401862713</a>) shows its community-building features. It even gets a current Google News hit, although that doesn't look promising. I know it's had some magazine coverage as well, being one of the first large graphical free MMORPGs.

It seems to me that the people who are citing WP:WEB might not know that Furcadia exists as a standalone client, not on the web. Notability? 60,000+ active players, being one of the early pioneers of the MMOSG genre, lasting 9+ years with no interruption and continuing to grow (no small feat for a video game), and even being a finalist for an award (albiet a minor one) combine to make it seem pretty notable, don't you think? As for verifiability, 3 or 4 good sources and a 3+ more okay sources is quite a bit better than most video game articles. <strike>If you think this article isn't well sourced, take a look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Massively_multiplayer_online_games" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Massively_multiplayer_online_games" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I changed the percentage (was 22%, is now 39%), per the cited reference. The 22% figure is the winning margin of Murtha's, not Irey's percentage of the vote.

<dd>The bar down my street has several reliable secondary sources about it because it sold to a minor and got its liquor license revoked, by your standards it deserves an article. Hell, my father owns a liquor store and its been in the newspapers and such on several occassions as well, so it apparently deserves an article as well. Fortunately, verifiability is not the only requirement for something or someone getting an article, it also needs to be notable which this person is not. <b>Delete.</b> --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 00:01, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> No indication of any notability once her concession speech was over. I expect we'll be seeing a lot of these now that the US elections are over, and any candidate whose only notability was the campaign should be removed.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, at least for now. You guys are seriously suggesting that a House of Representatives candidate who got a non-trivial number of votes, and lost the election that happened only <i>three</i> days ago should be deleted?

<li><b>Comment</b> I think I want to vote delete but will abstain for now. Her notability is primarily derived from her opponent rather than anything she did. All references to her relate to <i>the race</i> rather than <i>the candidate</i>. So she in and of herself is not notable as a candidate. I do not know if someone can establish any notable action as a county commissioner (which is a reasonably powerful job in PA since counties are governed by a tribunal ith minimal checks and balances). If so I could consider supporting a keep since the totality of her political career would push her over the top in my opinion. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 19:22, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- she's been a county commissioner (an elected position) for 10 years, and was the youngest person and only woman ever to be elected so in that county; and for other reasons as stated above: look at the totality of her career, not just a single failed Congressional race.

<li><b>Comment</b> Does Wiktionary have a way of keeping a list like this together, or of having the words in a category? A related list of items, or a list of words used differently in two dialects, is in no way a dictionary definition. I have never found useful info in Wiktionary because of the terseness and vagueness of the definitions. Putting each of these terms in a dictionary unlinked would defeat the purpose and make it impossible to find what terms differ between US and British usage. I suppose each term's definition could be mentioned in the related term's entry, but that would still lose the overall list. There is info in a list or category which is lost when the items are separated and scattered. Sometimes the whole is more than the sum of the parts. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:43, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

It's a useful list, and while <i>some</i> of the entries might be dialectic, most are commonly known enough that probably 95% would be instantly understood by anyone in the UK, and quite possibly used, too. Never having been to Wiktionary, I don't know if that wikimedia project can cater for a list like this, but at the end of the day, what harm is it doing being here? Not sure I understand the OR accusations either - is knowing and recording the meanings of words OR? I'm pretty sure most, if not all, of the words listed would be found in OED or Chambers. Would some sources/refs sort the OR objections? If you're really looking for lists of jargon to delete, go check out the internet slang list! Finally, as previously noted, the word "phocodontia" isn't in the list because it should go in the list "words that no-one uses at all, ever". <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarre_cd00.html" title="User:Carre">Carre</a> 20:14, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I personally believe that any technological advancement, including cosmetic ones, deserves an article. This is one in particular that got my attention because, like most men, I am interested in any product that can prevent hairloss. Not encyclopedic? Well how about this: as soon as I find the chemical makeup complete with diagrams and notation on Regenium-xy, I will add them to the article. Will that satisfy your encyclopedic-uncertainty? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECallamRodya_7ec9.html" title="User:CallamRodya">CallamRodya</a> 07:27, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If wikipedia were to become a new battleground for brand placement, i would be against that. But this is not an example of that.

<li>I partially agree. Not <i>every</i> shampoo brand should have an article.

<p>It's a software update for the <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a>. There's little more to say about it at this point. It is not confirmed by particularly <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and even then I'm not sure if it should be included as a separate article. Software updates and patches don't typically get their own articles, and this one being sold with the console seems to make it a better idea to simply include it in the Wii page. Not to mention saving user's clicks. Recommend <b>Redirection</b> to <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a>, as some people may still look it up by name.

<li><b>Comment</b> Deleting because of lack of Ghits is problematic because most of Strabo is not available online. It's also possible that whoever translated the parts that are online may have transliterated Zyx and Zygii differently, since Strabo wrote in Greek. I think it would be preferable if somebody who actually reads Greek could go over the primary source (Strabo) and see if there really is a Zyx and Zygii. If they were a race of people, they are inherently notable whether there are Ghits on them or not and whether they currently exist. I <b>abstain</b> only because the source is not online and Strabo is the only primary source (if he indeed mentions them). --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 09:28, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Addition: I don't know if this is OR. If it is, it's a hoax. IF not, it's sourced (Strabo). Just because a source is a few thousand years old doesn't necessarily mean it's not reliable. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 09:33, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> There's a difference between using an article as a reference and using it as a source of text. I copied it here because it was specifically requested by someone (not even a regular member of WikiFur - they just popped up one day) and because as far as I could see, everything in there could be confirmed as accurate from the website itself. I also got separate permission to use the image on Wikipedia, though technically as a logo I do not think it was not required. The article has had a good deal of editing from our administrators who are knowledgeable in the works it covers, and was even checked by a member of the awards committee. I'm not sure exactly how much more oversight it could have been given from any site. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 15:45, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Using it as a source of text just means you're using it as a reference for the entire article. External wikis are not reliable for either article sources or for entire articles. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobocracy_2cef.html" title="User:Robocracy">Robocracy</a> 20:10, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, the reference for the entire article is the awards website. That's why it's there under "References". Whether this is sufficient for Wikipedia is the question. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 20:22, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's a primary source. It's still a valid source for raw information, but not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> for more speculative information, such as the statement about it being the equivalent of the <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Awards_eeec.html" title="Hugo Awards">Hugo Awards</a>. It would be sufficient to keep a pared-down version of the article, if the award could be shown to have some noteworthiness. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> would be the guidelines I'd look at first -- neither of them is perfect for this, but they give an idea. If any of the books that have received the award (or reviews of those books) make mention of the award, as they often do with the Hugo and other major literary awards, then I think that would be sufficient to keep and cleanup the article. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 21:41, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Unfortunately I don't have copies of most of the works to see (still assembling my anthropomorphic library). There is one that I know I have that probably mentions it, but it is written by the chairman of the committee. Apparently <a href="http://www.sfsite.com/columns/news0404.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sfsite.com/columns/news0404.htm" rel="nofollow">SFSite news</a> covered its nomination list (and they mention the Hugos in a similar fashion further down to the left). It appears to have been noted (briefly) as an event on <a href="http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:BOMRgxDZ2REJ:https://www.scifi.com/events/day.php3%3Fdate%3D7/9/2005%26type%3D0%26print%3D1+winner+%22Ursa+Major+Award%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=43&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external text" title="http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:BOMRgxDZ2REJ:https://www.scifi.com/events/day.php3%3Fdate%3D7/9/2005%26type%3D0%26print%3D1+winner+%22Ursa+Major+Award%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=43&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">scifi.com</a>. The wording in the article is somewhat ambiguous - it is not certainly not "equivalent" in general popularity to the Hugo awards, because furry fandom is smaller than sci-fi fandom and the award is far younger, but it <i>is</i> equivalent in style. Like the Hugo, both nominees and winners are chosen by the fans.

<li>Transwikification can be performed between <i>any</i> two wikis, Wikimedia Foundation or otherwise, as long as their copyright licences are mutually compatible. However, there are, deliberately, no maintained <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArticles_to_be_moved_1b67.html" title="Category:Articles to be moved">transwiki queues</a> for any wikis other than Wikimedia Foundation wikis and a few GFDL gaming wikis. There is no formal system of third party volunteers who will transwiki to other wikis, although editors such as me and a few others will sometimes handle specific articles upon request. So if one wants an article transwikified to WikiFur, one must do all of the necessary work <i>onesself</i>, and one should be aware that by expressing that opinion at AFD one is implicitly volunteering to do all of that work onesself. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:26, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> That said this article needs improvement. But I don't think being an award for a minor niche is reason enough to delete the article, that's a reason to <i>have</i> the article. Few (in the United States anyway) needs to come to come to wikipedia to find out what the Emmy awards are (the history and trivia perhaps, but not the basic knowledge of what they are). By the same token few are going to know what the Ursa Major awards are if they hear about them. And they might well hear about them, the Fred Patton book mentioned in the article has been reprinted and is currently available in mainstream bookstores (Now titled Furry!

<p>Not entirely certain what this article is meant to be about; it's either supposed to be the biography of a non-noteworthy furniture designer or the non-noteworthy company he founded. Currently, it's a little of both, but it doesn't say much of worth about either. Not a speedy candidate, as it does assert noteworthiness; however, no reliable outside sources are provided, and my search finds nothing particularly compelling.

<p><b>Delete</b> per the above. Denmark has a ton of furniture companies but I wouldn't consider many of them notable (I might be biased on this one, I work in a furniture store). <i>Tvilum-Scanbirk</i> might be notable since their products are found in countless Danish officies, but I can't really think of other good examples. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Valentinian_3b01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Valentinian">(contribs)</a></sup> 08:37, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Highly notable. How many furniture companies do you know that have been making the same product, virtually unchanged, for over forty years? Then consider that this company doesn't make anything but the 606 Universal Shelving System. Dieter Rams's designs are world famous, and this is one of the most widely used of his designs. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 08:52, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That would be a good reason not to delete <a href="../../../d/i/e/Dieter_Rams_357c.html" title="Dieter Rams">Dieter Rams</a>, or perhaps even <a href="../../../6/0/6/606_Universal_Shelving_System_9edc.html" title="606 Universal Shelving System">606 Universal Shelving System</a> (though I personally have my doubts about the latter), but neither or those is being considered. The ability of the designer has nothing to do with the noteworthiness of the manufacturing company or its founder, and that/those is/are what are being considered. Similarly, we have an article for <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Lloyd_Wright_96e4.html" title="Frank Lloyd Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>, but not for the guys who actually constructed the buildings. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 09:03, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you just trying to be right rather than improve Wikipedia, by suggesting that a product might have an article while the company that makes it and only it should not? That makes no sense whatsoever to me. You classify smaller things in the larger whole, not the other way around. Further, I ask again; how many other companies do you know that base their entire existence on making one single product line, virtually unchanged for over forty years? (Note this time I've even made it easier by broadening the question to not just furniture companies.) <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 09:28, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you? As I said, I don't particularly buy the idea of the shelves having their own article -- I just think that your defense speaks more to them than to their manufacturer. To clarify, I am not convinced that the company or its product is noteworthy by association with a designer. As for single product lines, I don't see how producing <i>fewer</i> products makes a company <i>more</i> noteworthy. That's an interesting footnote. Is this company <i>renowned</i> for their shelving above and beyond its competitors' level of renown? Did this company or its sole product have some sort of greater historical impact? Maybe so, but I didn't find any evidence to that effect. It seems like an average company to me. If you can show it passes <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, though, by all means...

<li><b>Comment</b> Article has been almost completely rewritten in an admirable manner. I still feel it should be at <a href="../../../6/0/6/606_Shelving_System_0176.html" title="606 Shelving System">606 Shelving System</a>, with the redirect pointed there and with some minor reformatting, because I believe the product is more noteworthy than the company.

<li><b>Delete</b> There really don't need to be trivia articles. Wikipedia policy heavily discourages the use of trivia even within articles, let alone articles consisting entirely of trivia. Trivia is useful, according to policy, only within new articles where it provides information that should later be put into prose in the main body of the article with the end goal that the trivia section will be removed entirely once the article is well-developed. Furthermore, are we going to have trivia pages for on Indian Presidents? Phillipino presidents? Etc. I've a BA in Political Science and am working on a MA in a political field so I strongly encourage keeping articles that are political, but this crosses the line. We can merge the important tidbits into their appropriate articles, whether the article on the US presidency in general or the individual president's articles themselves, but this is just a random, and arbitrary, collection of information. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 00:14, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This information is reasonably useful in that it would be included in the main article of the given president it is related to, and this is merely a presentation of what would be spread across some 40 articles into one succint page. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:37, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Bits of trivia related to multiple presidents should be merged into the article on the US Presidency in general, otherwise information regarding one particular president should be on that President's article. Information deemed to be 'trivial' doesn't need to be arbitrarily chosen from these articles and given their own article because someone seems to find these particular bits of information 'more interesting' or the like. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 02:57, 11 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Combining that article and this one might enlarge the article too much, as it is currently at 31 Kilobytes. I assume that was why this one was spun off. And ultimately, all information on Wikipedia is arbitrarily chosen by what Editors want. What's important or not is not clearly defined, but rather developed through a rough general consensus. Me, I don't see anything in this article I wouldn't have in the base article on the given president. This is a mere collation of that, in a different direction. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:34, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I simply believe that this article is superfluous and some of it isn't necessarily encyclopedic. And given Wikipedia's policy regarding trivia, I don't believe an article dedicated solely to trivia should exist (there is, in fact, a Wikiproject whose express goal is to remove trivia) --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 04:23, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While I suppose this article is redundant to the existing articles which should cover the information, but it presents them in a condensed format that is more readily accesible to the average user. So I can't agree it is entirely superfluous. And Wikipedia doesn't have a policy on trivia, it's at most a guideline, and at worst, a bad idea. Personally, I'd prefer a renaming of this article, but I'm at a loss for a better word. While there are some cases where trivial is so very minimal it's not important, there are times when it is not. And given that such luminaries as Isaac Asimov have published collected books of Trivia(and I saw several of the facts in this article in them), I'm not inclined to dismiss the idea of presenting various minor facts as important to Wikipedia, or unencyclopedic, because the information itself is still valid. I suppose I could support creating a WikiTrivia spin-off if it ever came up, but until that happens, I can't endorse deletion of otherwise valuable material. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:07, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I strongly stand by keeping it up, and was hoping too keep this kind of as a memoire. Thank You. Bigjerk 3:41, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

One review in even a moderately popular internet publication does not establish notability, to my mind. On top of that, a band member above said: <i>"I am in the band. . . We were just trying to share our music. . . I strongly stand by keeping it up, and was hoping too keep this kind of as a memoire."</i> The problem is that WP, unlike Myspace or Youtube, is not a place to share music or to build a memoir.

<p>Tagged as a speedy candidate for A7 (no assertion of notability), but being the grandfather of Jacquline Kennedy Onassis is arguably an <i>assertion</i> of notability. My interpretation of A7 is stricter than this, it was mostly meant to target vanity articles on friends, relatives or oneself, and this article seems to be neither. With that said, I think that the notability of a relative two steps away from the first lady is dubious since Wikipedia is not a genealogy database.

<li>Basically, the same arguments would probably apply. In both cases the chief assertion of notability is being a grandparent to a US First Lady.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The article is misleadingly written and is going to be a stub forever though. I have taken a look and see that indeed scores of similar articles have been created, none of them offering much and none of them written in an encylopedic style. The intro wording in each suggests that the article is about a book or something (read it and you will see). They all need to be cleaned-up dramatically or deleted. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 15:30, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree I can see where you got the idea it was a book from the first line, however it's also written correctly as if it was a book it would say (and if all Wikipedia articles were written correctly the world would be a happy place, but alas). The first sentence could probably be reworded to avoid that confusion, but it does recount useful information about a very notable period of Northern Ireland's history. Saying all these articles need deleted, I'm not sure I'm with your reasoning as to why they do? They're factually correct, definitely notable and the articles are presented in a useful form rather than being spread all over Wikipedia in different types of articles. Also what is wrong with stubs? There seems to be some kind of mistaken belief on Wikipedia that stubs should not exist. There is nothing wrong with short articles, not everything has to be an essay. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 16:10, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. So let me make myself clearer: this article doesn't impart information that is not provided elsewhere on Wikipedia already, and it never will.

<li><b>Keep</b>: For god's sake not again - this is the third time I have had to defend these articles, because people don't bother to do any research. See <a href="../../../n/o/r/Wikipedia_talk%7ENorthern_Irish_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_db4d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Northern Irish Wikipedians' notice board">Wikipedia talk:Northern Irish Wikipedians' notice board</a> (Violence articles and death statistics in towns) and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Troubles_in_Moneymore_7ed7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Troubles in Moneymore">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Troubles in Moneymore</a>. All arguments have been fully rehearsed previously and the arguments in the last link are very pertinent. These are stub articles - help to develop them, not kill them off. The comment on the Stronge article and Tynan shows the deficiency in real thinking - there are plenty of other Tynan incidents to add - but reasearch needs to be finalised and added in due course. Give us a chance to develop these articles. <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdfern_e088.html" title="User:Ardfern">Ardfern</a> 16:28, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> No need to be so strident in your reponse. There are good reasons why you are being called to defend this article. And I didn't know they'd been nominated before - there is nothing on the talk page saying they have. Perhaps if they were cleaned-up and written in an encylopedic style it might help? Take the opening gambit: "The Troubles in Tynan recounts incidents during, and the effects of, The Troubles in Tynan, County Armagh, Northern Ireland." Does the article on <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> begin "World War II recountsa conflict, and the causes and effects of that conflict, fought between 1939-1945"?</dd>
<dd>However clean-up isn't really what is needed - these articles shouldn't have been started in the first place. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a memorial</a>. These articles are going to remain stubs and you should have thought before starting them all. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 16:37, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Not sure you even understand the word strident, if you think thats what my response was. If you can improve the articles then do it, if they need cleaned up then, make a suggestion? Don't just make destructive criticism, without offering something positive. Your "memorial" comments are deeply offensive to people like me who lived through the Troubles and perhaps its you who needs to do some serious thinking before you comment further. These articles (when completed) will be the story of a 30 year war in each town in Northern Ireland. They will be notable, valuable and encyclopedic in due course, but only when given a chance. They will not remain stubs and a lot of thought and research went into starting them. To suggest there was no thinking behind starting off 97 articles is nothing more than another insult. I'm not the one not thinking. <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdfern_e088.html" title="User:Ardfern">Ardfern</a> 23:46, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was quoting a wikipedia guideline - which I believe was set up in response to a lot of pages created in response to the 9-11 attacks in the US. The same logic applies here. No need to take offence - but Wikipedia is not the place to set up a directory of any and all incidents of sectarian violence which occurred in N. Ireland. Its an encyclopedia - not just a random collection of information. You have adopted a combative approach to this from the beginning and you seem to see this as a personal attack. For the record, it isn't. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 23:57, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Further comment</b> Combative moi - imagine that. You have researched and written a large number of related articles as part of a major work on the Troubles (not a random collection of information!!) and someone (who knows nothing of the subject or the work, or even tries to find out) proposes to delete the work. Why would you be combative? Are you for real? <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdfern_e088.html" title="User:Ardfern">Ardfern</a> 23:33, 14 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Do not flatter yourself. What you have created is only major in the sense that it consists of lots of articles, written in a bizarre style, low on content, and inappropriate (in their current form) for an encyclopedia. If you want to set up a directory of incidents that occurred during the Troubles, set up a website and do so there - but only notable people, things and events should have articles on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 23:43, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I can see the value of these articles as part of a series, but <i>please</i> rewrite the intro paragraphs.

<li><b>Keep</b> A significant part of Northern Irish history, and a very useful series. Apart from introductions, which can be easily changed, the articles are well written and concise. Size shouldn't be an issue. «&#160;<b><a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeithgreer_6e9e.html" title="User talk:Keithgreer">Keith</a></b>&#160;» 16:47, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The strategy of short specific articles is uncommon, but is also used for much less notable topics such as railway stations and census districts. As with those, it helps the main placename articles like <a href="../../../t/y/n/Tynan.html" title="Tynan">Tynan</a> have a more uniform worldwide style. Perhaps a bot request could be made to drop onto each article talk page a template that links to the rationale behind the series&#160;? --<a href="../../../h/r/o/User%7EHro%C3%B0ulf_e9d7.html" title="User:Hroðulf">Hroðulf</a> (or Hrothulf) (<a href="../../../h/r/o/User_talk%7EHro%C3%B0ulf_0e3a.html" title="User talk:Hroðulf">Talk</a>) 16:56, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps the contributors to this series could suspend substantive additions for a while in order to arrive at a good common format, with series boxes, templates, etc to emphasise that the articles are all in a series. When this work is done, it is less likely they will be annoyed by further RFDs. <a href="../../../j/n/e/User%7EJnestorius_2da6.html" title="User:Jnestorius">jnestorius</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/n/e/User_talk%7EJnestorius_28b8.html" title="User talk:Jnestorius">talk</a>)</sup> 18:46, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't think there is such a thing as suspending substantive additions on a wiki.

<li><b>Delete</b> This article is racist nonsense. It purports to claim that the Spanish inhabitants of Gibraltar were 'Original' and 'Gibraltarian' neither is true; This myth supports the irredentist Spanish claim. The history of Gibraltar is one of successive occupations, the Spanish one being in the middle. The Spanish inhabitants had a choice of remaining or leaving, and freely chose to escape future conflict. The term 'Gibraltarian' did not exist at the time so cannot be applied to them.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The <i>history</i> of this is all adequately covered in the main article on <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, which already makes perfectly clear both the number of Spanish inhabitants who decided not to remain under British occupation and the circumstances of the war which led to Gibraltar being ceded in perpetuity to Britain. What that leaves for this article is merely a group of present-day Spaniards who claim descent from those four thousand, and have formed a little club for themselves.

<p>The debate is closed. Your article is to be deleted. You added this "subsection" to the AfD entry for your article, and you are trying to represent this as a vote, which it is not. AfD is a discussion about the article, not a vote, whether the article should be retained, and if so what need to be done. You have renamed the article but it is still a POV fork and doesn't contain any noteworthy information that isn't already in the Gibraltar article. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 03:58, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Question</b> Point taken about the news coverage, but is an ordinary backbench councillor really a "major local political figure"? I'm inclined to think not, because nothing in the linked articles suggests that he is an executive member, former mayor or anything. Rightly or wrongly, most local councillors seem to be rather obscure and minor figures.

<dd>Further to the question, what kind of local councillor? I'm a Communuity Councilor for my locality - as are 9 other people. We all serve elected unpaid positions as members of the community council which is seperate and under the local council, which is what is commonly referred to as 'local government'. People like me are pretty much nobody, people on the local council generally are non-notable as well unless they find their way into some kind of scandal. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 03:51, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The subject of the article is a failed congressional candiadte in the 2006 elections.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I do not know much about thrash metal, but I think that the page shows the range and diversity of the genre. It acually sparked my interest into reading more about the Seward Peninsula Region and to read about thrash metal more. Due to global warming, the towns in the Seward Peninsula are being eroded away by the changes in the ocean and storms. By maintaining this page, a form of expression by the local people about this danger can be kept. If they came up with a better name than Seward Peninsula Thrash Metal and maybe posted some site links, that could help it out. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristgg_7115.html" title="User:Christgg">Christgg</a> 02:43, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>There are already two pages listing most of the WITCH characters (excluding individual character pages), and they are tagged to be merged together in the future. Non-notable characters should go on one or other of those pages pending their merger, or are not important enough to be mentioned anywhere, let alone on their own page</p>
<p>A third page containing WITCH has already been edited to remove WITCH characters, Wikipedia simply doesn't need a fourth page containin WITCH character.</p>

<dd>Again, I have been arguing this since you first posted the article for speedy deletion. I am the one that removed the speedy tag, as it said to do so if we planned on contesting it. We posted a hang on tag as well. I removed the importance tag, because the importance of the article has been asserted. And yes, the author did say that it didn't meet the criteria in the beginning, but he hadn't seen what we had added to the article before posting that. We have continually stated the fact that the comic was recognized by Blizzard on the talk page for the article, but again, you have ignored it. And as for the hosting example: Wikipedia specifically states that sites like GoDaddy.com and Angelfire.com, etc. do not count as independant hosts. bungie.org however, is a completely independant site owned by an individual person, making it completely different. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishNinjaSpark_a6fe.html" title="User:IrishNinjaSpark">IrishNinjaSpark</a> 20:21, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It doesn't meet the criteria of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> at all. Not even close. You cannot have Shea host his site with a company and then turn around and claim they are independent of each other. That is like saying that every freely hosted site on Geocities is "distributed" by geocities and since geocities is owned by Yahoo that <i>must</i> mean that Yahoo distributes that content. Not quite.</dd>

<dd>The Blizzard link is entirely irrelevant. It was a one paragraph link. It wasn't a well known award, nor was it in any level distribution. It was also, arguably, not independent of the creator as that "feature" comes from people emailing in their favorite links. How do I know the creator himself didn't send in that link? Blizzard didn't recognize the webcomic. Blizzard put up a link which was emailed to them for a fan section. Very different.</dd>

<dd>As for the assertion of importance, saying <i>The importance of this article is to provide a deeper insight and more information on the characters featured in this comic, the background of the comic itself, and the way this comic is seen by its fans.</i> isn't illustrating any level of importance. That is quite simply using Wikipedia as a fan site. This isn't a notable webcomic. It has a forum with a grand total of 35 members...not exactly proof of an overwhelming fan base.

<li><s><b>Do Not Delete.</b></s> What is it exactly that this community has against hosting an informational article about an up-and-coming webcomic? It seems like for no reason, you all have ganged up on a small group of people trying to publish some information and have abused the powers of being able to edit this encyclopedia. Perhaps I'm being naive, but the WP:WEB explanation says that an article is notable if it meets any <b>one</b> of the criteria; I would direct you especially to the third characteristic: <b>The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.</b> In what way does the hosting of the site by the very well-known <b>halo.bungie.org</b> not meet this criteria? And you can't say that it has to meet the others as well. The WP:WEB page specifically states that only one of the criteria must be meant. So I say to you, WikiKGB, in what way is w00tness lacking? <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainKirk91_2b36.html" title="User:CaptainKirk91">CaptainKirk91</a> 23:52, 11 November 2006</li>

<dd>First, please don't vote more than once. Second, as your exact words illustrate, this is an <i>up-and-coming webcomic</i> which means at this juncture it isn't notable and it isn't encyclopedic. It isn't personal and it has nothing whatsoever to do with the content of the webcomic. It simply doesn't meet the criteria for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 05:06, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll try to explain.

Criteria 3 would only apply if it were actually being linked to on a daily basis by halo.bungie.org, which it is not. In fact, hardly anyone links to this particular webcomic <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Of2&amp;hl=ga&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=link%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fw00tness.bungie.org&amp;btnG=Cuardaigh" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Of2&amp;hl=ga&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=link%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fw00tness.bungie.org&amp;btnG=Cuardaigh" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>.

<li>I don't recall the content here before the previous deletion, but from the look of what's been compiled on the article page I'd have to weigh on in the side of "keep"; Dalton is one of the main porn-muscle celebs; if he only had two "feature films" (now three, although on www.hisx.com or wherever the new image is from there are six listed for sale; and there are three I know of that aren't listed there) that doesn't seem enough of a disqualification, given his extremely high profile in muscle-porn print media and his celebrity status on the party circuit; there's guys who still have articles who are nowhere near as high profile.

<li><b>Comment</b> The NYTimes thing is from 14 years ago (and covers many, many bands who, like Ms. Rhatigan, go nowhere), and the website you refer to (and thanks for actually taking the time to look) refers to her as "unknown." Did she chart anywhere? Influence anyone? Win any awards? It seems to me like we're entering a phase where people are notable if anyone has ever mentioned them in any newspaper, magazine, or blog, or they get over a thousand hits on Google (never mind that they're mostly WP mirrors) or if they're "clearly notable," like elementary schools. Sigh. I kinda thought this would happen, but it's still depressing. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke"><font color="green">IronDuke</font></a> 01:01, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not saying she's clearly notable, I'm usually in defense of deletion of schools and malls. Your suggestions are vague and can be expanded on anything.

<p>Was originally kept following an AfD back in February, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_West_Seattle_Christian_School_d08e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/West Seattle Christian School">here</a>, but has not improved since. Following the closure of the previous AfD, the following comment was added to the article's Talk page: <i>Cleanup arising from AFD seems in order</i>. However, looking at the history, the last time that this article was edited was when the AfD notice was removed back in February--no one has touched it since. This article is two sentences long and asserts no particular importance. Previous AfD discussion seemed to hinge on arguments along the lines of the school having been mentioned in the local paper (as are many non-notable things) and being the recipient of federal funds (as are many non-notable things). <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> (which is <b>not</b> a guideline) suggests that school articles must conform to our <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiablity policy</a>, viz: <i>The school has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the school itself.</i> This article does not appear to present such evidence, and the lack of edits since February strongly suggests that it never will. <a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuerto_De_La_Cruz_9cfd.html" title="User:Puerto De La Cruz">Puerto De La Cruz</a> 18:34, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I didn't nominate a zillion, I nominated eleven. I got the idea when someone put a bunch of non-notable webcomics up earlier this week. This is no different. There are literally hundreds of poorly-written, unsourced articles on non-notable schools that survived VfDs last year because our standards were more relaxed at the time, many of which haven't had a single edit since then (as with this one, although the AfD wasn't quite as long ago as the others). I am simply attempting to do some cleanup. <a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuerto_De_La_Cruz_9cfd.html" title="User:Puerto De La Cruz">Puerto De La Cruz</a> 00:17, 11 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Eleven in a day is incredibly excessive and disruptive. They've been around for a while; waiting another day or eleven won't hurt. I would be interested in cleaning up this article, except it's too hard to clean up thirteen articles all nominated for AfD on the same day. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 14:52, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If you are as concerned with this threadbare article (and other school articles in equally dismal condition) as you appear to be, perhaps you could help to make it a better article by adding what you know. IMHO, an article this brief and this generic (unless it is =universally= held to be a notable subject) simply holds us up as amateurs. Either it should be expanded, which I have no interest in doing (I have long held that only truly notable schools should be included in Wikipedia) or it should be deleted.

<p>Was originally kept following a VfD back in May 2005, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Fairmeadow_School_f142.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Fairmeadow School">here</a>, but has not improved since. Article does not assert any particular notablity or importance beyond the unsourced claim that the campus is home to the "nationally recognized" Jackson Hearing Center. "Jackson Hearing Center" only returns 146 Google hits, in spite of the fact that there are a number of entities with this name (besides the one in California referenced in this article, there are also Jackson Hearing Centers in Tennessee and Mississippi). If the hearing center is notable (which I doubt), it should have its own article rather than being in this one. Getting back to the subject at hand, this article hasn't been edited since May, and is very badly written (not a reason for deletion; just pointing out that nobody has been working on the article). <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> (which is <b>not</b> a guideline) suggests that school articles must conform to our <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiablity policy</a>, viz: <i>The school has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the school itself.</i> This article does not appear to present such evidence, and the lack of recent edits strongly suggests that it never will. <a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuerto_De_La_Cruz_9cfd.html" title="User:Puerto De La Cruz">Puerto De La Cruz</a> 18:50, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Nominator seems to be a single purpose account created to undo a whole string of failed AfDs. Nominator falsely claims that <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> requires multiple non-trivial published works, when in fact, this is one of several criteria to support retention. As such, this vote is based on 1) Nomination was created in likely bad faith by a Single Purpose Account, 2) Nomination attempts to undo the precedent under which this article was Kept, and is part of a string of nearly a dozen such second and third cracks at undoing failed efforts at deletion (and as recreation of previously deleted articles is often used as a sign of bad faith and failure to observe precedent), all the more egregious in this case, in which the original AfD failed by a significant consensus of 11 keeps to five deletes (if I counted correctly) 3) Nominator falsely claims that article fails <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> standard when criterion mention is merely one of several such criteria justifying retention, and in fact the school has been covered and article provides relevant references, and 4) receipt of the California Business for Education Excellence Foundation award and coverage of the school and the Jackson Hearing Center meets criterion 1 of media coverage as well as criterion 5 set by <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, which specifies that <b>Significant awards or commendations have been bestowed upon the school or its staff.</b>, and as such, the article meets the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criteria. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 14:35, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I see three sources provided. One is the school's own site, which isn't third-party. The Hertfordshire site appears to be a directory listing.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm sorry, Visviva, but I didn't realize that arguing for what I believe in- in a rational manner, and without hurting anyone- was absurd.

I'd much rather believe in something than believe in nothing, and the only thing that would be absurd would be <i>caring</i> whether you agreed with my belief or not. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 04:52, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>A little touchy, aren't we? I don't understand how anything I said could possibly be regarded as a personal attack, least of all against someone who did not even join the discussion until after my comment was posted. But I also don't understand why we would be expected to be anything but annoyed at being called back here <i>for the third time</i> to debate this trivial issue. As far as I can tell, no new arguments have been raised; there is, therefore, no reason to dig up a horse that has already been killed and buried twice. When there is so much constructive work that needs to be done, and so much destructive content that actually <i>needs</i> to be deleted, why must we continue to waste our collective energies on this silliness?

<li><b>Keep</b> - I really get fed up with AfDs that don't have any facts put to them. A bit of research wouldn't go astray here, rather than "not notable" assertions without any reason whatsoever which seem to be the norm on AfDs nowadays. Despite WP:SCHOOLS not being policy, it is persuasive, and we should take note of the criteria there. A search on some newspaper databases brings up a note in the Sydney Morning Herald in March 2006 about the school celebrating its 50th anniversary on June 16 2006. A look at WP:SCHOOLS shows that schools over 50 years old, for which this is now applicable, have been declared as verifiable. Precedent for public primary schools has kept schools that are over 50 years old. Another mention from 1999 (21 July 1999, "Schools told: stop saving for a rainy day" indicates that the school was in serious financial trouble under the Carr Government's education policy which left the school at one stage with only $5000 in its bank accounts. I'm happy to look for more articles if you want, but I think there's more to this article than most people think, but no one can be bothered taking a look. Even if the article is not verifiable still, there is worth in merging the environment stuff and financial problems in the late 1990s to <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jannali%2C_New_South_Wales_f5a9.html" title="Jannali, New South Wales">Jannali, New South Wales</a> as per <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Nominator seems to be a single purpose account created to undo a whole string of failed AfDs. Nominator falsely claims that <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> requires multiple non-trivial published works, when in fact, this is one of several criteria to support retention. As such, this vote is based on 1) Nomination was created in likely bad faith by a Single Purpose Account, 2) Nomination attempts to undo the precedent under which this article was Kept, and is part of a string of nearly a dozen such second and third cracks at undoing failed efforts at deletion (and as recreation of previously deleted articles is often used as a sign of bad faith and failure to observe precedent), all the more egregious in this case, in which the original AfD failed by a consensus of 14 keeps to a mere three deletes 3) Nominator falsely claims that article fails <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> standard when criterion mention is merely one of several such criteria justifying retention, and 4) this school was founded in 1956, meeting the fifty-year criterion set by <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, which specifies that article must meet at least one of the guidelines specifications, and as such, the article meets the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criteria. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 13:32, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's one user's proposal that has been going for only six days. How can that be relevant in any way at all?

Since the criteria are inclusive he would need to go through each one and just say "nope not that one" which is time consuming and unproductive.

<li>The article meets all standards of WP:SCHOOLS4, a new guideline that is only slightly less valid than <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>. As neither has been presented to Wikipedia users for review, let alone reached any form of consensus, neither are valid for any purpose in an AfD. The original <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is still the only standard that has undergone any level of scrutiny, and must remain as the only meaningful guideline until an alternative has undergone a corresponding review and attempt at reaching consensus. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 03:52, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Furthermore, as I said above, it isn't at all clear to me that anyone should be following any of the proposed school guidelines. <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> has about as much backing as the original defunct proposal had when it was tossed out (and multiple editors have tried to mark it as clearly rejected). Furthermore, the new <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> proposal has been "presented" - it is in Wikipedia space and editors over at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> and at the village pump were invited over to take a look. So far, far less criticism has been lodged at that proposal. We can at least say it isn't clearly rejected unlike the previous. Trying to make <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINTs</a> rather than engage in serious discussion is unhelpful. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:14, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Based on votes on actual AfDs, WP:SCHOOLS4 seems to have as much potential support as <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>, if not more. It's an exclusivist argument that's often heard and does not stand. Basically, <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> is an equal violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> largely created by those who opposed the original <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> and now want to create a deletionist-oriented guideline under which a small fraction of 1% of all schools would qualify. It's nice to wrap up an approach in a guideline, but all [WP:SCHOOLS3]] does right now is glom together a series of unmeetable criteria with lots of verbiage so it sounds like something meaningful. <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> still offers the only proposed guideline that has endured any level of scrutiny and has been used repeatedly as justification to Keep AND to delete AND as part of multiple nominations over the past several days. If even those seeking to hide behind sockpuppets to delete articles are referencing <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> as a policy, then we have something that is reaching de facto consensus. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 04:29, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That's your reason? That, because the nominator was a vandal, the article is still valid? The issues raised by those requesting deletion do not matter at all? WP:SK points to an article being speedily kept if the nominator is a vandal and <i>nobody disagrees with keeping the article</i>, which certainly isn't the case here.

<li>No, it was my way of saying that I hate sock puppets, that the entire nomination is a violation of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia:Sock puppetry</a> - specifically the "Voting and other shows of support" and "Avoiding scrutiny from other editors" sections - and that those who participate are implicitly condoning sock puppetry. I will not participate in a debate that is inherently corrupted at the outset by the nominator's need to hide behind a sock shield, with the ensuing automatic suspicion of double "voting", because to accept that corruption is a far more grievous affront than the destiny of any particular article. I will not lend tacit support by engaging with a vandal who has repeatedly demonstrated bad faith. Let those who want to argue inclusion/exclusion show their faces.

<li>My personal belief is that all nominations by sock puppets/vandals are de facto invalid and should be immediately closed by any admin aware of the situation. Any articles deleted as a result of those types of nominations are out of process and should be restored. What happens after that is a completely different issue.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I suggest High Schools are notable in the way that villages are. They contain much the same number of people. We do not delete articles on villages. Also biographies want to state which High School the subject went to and readers want to find out about the school. The best way to ensure this is not to delete articles on High Schools but to improve them. This argument does not apply to Primary Schools. These are rarely mentioned in biographical articles and they have less influence on people. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 23:47, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not quite. I've certainly seen articles on villages (or any other settlements) deleted when the only information is that "Dingsdorf is a village in the German state of Oberuntergammergau". All an article like that proves is that the place exists, which isn't enough for notability. Yes, if the village has more sources on it than that, it should probably get kept. To apply this analogy to this school, I don't see much more than the bare bones of existence in the sources. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 00:20, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - My understanding is that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> does not require multiple sourcing; it only seems to require one reliable source. Thus, the OFSTED reports seem to establish verifiability. On the other hand, notability requires coverage in multiple non-trivial sources or something similar. Winning awards is usually sufficient for notablity, so I think the awards the school has won are sufficient to establish notability. -<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">ave</a>)</i> 05:16, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

As such, this vote is based on 1) Nomination was created in likely bad faith by a Single Purpose Account, 2) Nomination attempts to undo the precedent under which this article was Kept, and is part of a string of nearly a dozen such second and third cracks at undoing failed efforts at deletion (and as recreation of previously deleted articles is often used as a sign of bad faith and failure to observe precedent), 3) Nominator falsely claims that article fails <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> standard when criterion mention is merely one of several such criteria justifying retention, 4) this is is a high school and we have near perfect precedent for retention of existing high schools with any non-trivial content, a standard this article meets and exceeds, and 5) the school's receipt of the School Improvement award indicated for three consecutive years is evidence that the article meets the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criteria. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 13:24, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Was originally kept following a VfD back in June 2005, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Alfred_Elementary_School_d527.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Alfred Elementary School">here</a>, but has not improved since. As a matter of fact, the article has not been edited since October 2005, suggesting that it is an unexpandable stub, which is itself grounds for deletion. The presentation of contact info seems somewhat spamtastic, but this is almost irrelevant, as this entity does not seem notable enough to merit an article per any existing guideline or policy. <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> (which is <b>not</b> a guideline) suggests that school articles must conform to our <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiablity policy</a>, viz: <i>The school has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the school itself.</i> This article does not appear to present such evidence. Further, quoting from <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_Arguments_66b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments">Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments</a>, <i>Granting inclusion to non-noteworthy schools is like handing students a passing grade just for showing up to class.

<li><b>Comment</b> Interesting, but the DCYSC is simply a list of what students participated in it (so some students from Moody were in, this is not a claim of notability), the other pieces are an uncritical puff-piece about girl scout cookies and a minor note on another website about the earlier school burning down.

<dd>I stand corrected, that changes the matter slightly but not by much- winning a local science competition hardly qualifies as something notable nor would it allow us to expand the artice beyond another sentence still leaving this as a tiny stub. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 00:39, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is a middle school, how notable does it have to be? A small town does not need to be notable as a person, and by the same logic not every topic needs excessive notability. Notability does not mean the article has room for improvement. Also, it is not a local science competition, it is a national competition. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 00:44, 12 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that's precisely the issue- middle schools need to be notable just like everything else. If that makes most middle schools not notable, oh well. As to the town matter, I have stated on many occasions that as far as I am concerned it would make sense to have very towns merged or deleted (I think there are a few small arguments against this that differentiate towns from schools but the overall notion is sound). Also, maybe I'm misreading things here, but the candidates were only semi-finalists. As I understand it(correct me if I'm wrong) that means they placed at the local level. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 00:53, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am gathering from this that you think all subjects need to be held to equal notability standard? I know that by policy that bio's are held to a higher standard. Do you think countries and musical bands should have the same standards?</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> There is nothing intrinsically wrong with someone using a sock to nominate an article for AfD, and if the nom's claims are weak they should be evaluated under that basis. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:28, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> -- hmm, tempted to say a <b>brutal delete</b>, however, from my reckoning they pass <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> for the two albums on Abacus. Although, as you say, there is way too much self-promo in it and it depends whether anyone (fans out there?) would be willing to work on it (and maintain). I'm not so sure. At the moment, consider me a <b>soft n' gentle keep</b>. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">hot</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bubba_hotep_258d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bubba hotep">ep</a> 20:56, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

That hardly ever happens.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm going out on a limb here. I am a big fan of hardcore/metal as my user page will attest. Just so I can't be accused of bias - if I work on this page (and I mean <i>wikify</i>) and that of the other band mentioned in it (First Blood) - I don't mean to the standard of my articles on Ensign and Killing Time... but, if I work on it, would you consider withdrawing the AfD for now? I have found out it is only one album on Abacus, but they are more notable than most of the backstreet bands I speedy ten times a day? Thoughts? <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">hot</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bubba_hotep_258d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bubba hotep">ep</a> 21:59, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>-are there any listings in reliable sources about them, even maybe some sort of "underground scene" magazine or the like?

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Obviously, this page needs some work, but with 17,500 MySpace friends and two albums on Abacus, this band ain't chump change. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChubbles1212_4175.html" title="User:Chubbles1212">Chubbles1212</a> 02:05, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Notability is established in the article, they have an album release on Abacus Recordings, there are many reviews out there on metal sites and magazines. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 08:54, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I think the work myself and Chubbles have done to it at least brings it to Wiki standard. The reason I stuck my neck out on this one (I had neither heard them, nor heard <i>of</i> them before this) is that there is stack loads of verifiability from sources which are acceptable to a certain degree in this genre because they don't exactly get coverage in mainstream internet press. I hope this is enough to keep the article. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">hot</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bubba_hotep_258d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bubba hotep">ep</a> 08:13, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: I was the one who started this page, and I never put any promotion for the band. Also, how are the links "self-created"? The links include the band's website and their label's site. Old tour information is hard to come by, but I believe some is listed on their website <a href="http://www.embracetheendoftheworld.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.embracetheendoftheworld.com" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Metro_53ec.html" title="User:The Metro">The Metro</a></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> It looks like this is a label that specializes in pressing limited- and special-edition 7-inches and EPs. The Supersuckers album is probably not a major release. I couldn't find mention of it on allmusic or on their website; I flagged them with a citation needed in the entry. (Update: it's a split 7" with the Burden Brothers; it's mentioned on the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burden_Brothers_8756.html" title="Burden Brothers">Burden Brothers</a>'s wiki entry. I then removed the cit needed.) In other news, I found out that the link to Unicorn should actually link to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Unicorns_c163.html" title="The Unicorns">The Unicorns</a>, another notable band who released a split 7-inch on the label. (Update: I again speak too soon...the Unicorns 7" was apparently pressed but never released...but it's mentioned on the Wiki entry for The Unicorns.) <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChubbles1212_4175.html" title="User:Chubbles1212">Chubbles1212</a> 17:14, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This is an international yoga organization significant in the world of Supramental Yoga which is represented on Wikipedia (Sri Aurobindo, the Mother). Some Comparison Pages: Auroconf, Ridhwan School, 3HO. These pages seem in no way more significant than Aeon Group. I have edited it some. Suggestions on making it more acceptable without removal would be appreciated - saberlotus.</p>

<p>There are plenty of Organizations, Schools Centers, Ashrams and such that are included on Wikipedia. Aeon Center for Cosmology is of no less significance than any of those. A good comparison pages is Ridhwan School (the School of an author, A.H. Almaas) ... Aeon Center is the school of author Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet. Why is including it here it considered spam? If things need to be changed to make it more suitable, fine, request that, but the Center exists and is a significant school of cosmology.</p>

<p>Contested prod: reason was <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for genealogy, which was remedied by adding the geographical feature (the hill near Aalborg). However, among the 261 distinct Google hits for Poldberg<a href="http://www.google.be/search?q=poldberg&amp;hl=nl&amp;lr=&amp;start=270&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?q=poldberg&amp;hl=nl&amp;lr=&amp;start=270&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>, none of them mentions Alborg or Aalborg<a href="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=poldberg+aalborg&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=poldberg+aalborg&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>, making this for the moment an article that fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, as well as still being for the most part a genealogical entry. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:38, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, based mostly on the geographical entry. Although it does fail <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, it's probably true, and could be verified from non-internet sources... I can see why there might not be anything on an obscure Danish hill on the web. As the genealogy, I don't know the exact policy on this, but I think that a description of a surname ought to be at least marginally OK. We should have (if we don't already) articles on the origin of Smith and Campbell etc. without really getting into genealogy, which (I guess) is more about the descent of indivual persons and all that. Now, Poldberg is a pretty minor surname, and the article does tend to border on just being genealogy, but all in all, with the geographical note and the material on the origin of a surname, I think it should be kept. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 14:10, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: how can something fail <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and still be kept? It is up to those wanting to keep something to show that the subject is compatible with the Wikipedia policies: just supposing something is true is not enough. If the creator or anyone else wanting to keep this can't provide us with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources (which may of course be off-line), then we have no choice but to delete it. This looks to me like the information someone gets from a selfmade genealogical search (whether correct or not), not the kind of thing any reputable third party source will have published. The origin of Smith, Campbell, ... has been discussed in major books and magazines, since it is such a common name: the origin of the name Poldberg, and the assumption that they are all rather closely related, is not very likely to be the subject of such major articles though. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 14:45, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I misunderstood <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>; after looking it up, I see that it means <i>verifiable</i> rather than <i>verified</i>. So as to the hill Poldberg, that is presumably verifiable in large Danish library or at the Alborg city hall, if its true, which I assume it is. The family name Poldberg is different. Whether archives kept in Elkhorn or Kimballton or elsewhere exist, I don't know; but they probably do, I'd guess. Granted, verification would be difficult. Now, none of the material is actually verified by cites, but that can be remedied. We are not talking about the material but the existence of the article itself. Generally, articles shouldn't be deleted just because they are bad articles (unsourced or whatever), but only if the actual subject of the article is not encyclopedic - that is, even if the article is cleaned up and sourced etc. it should still not exist. So I stand by my vote. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 14:56, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which states <i>"If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it."</i> We shouldn't be keeping articles because there are "probably" sources somewhere that no one has found yet. Better to not have an article on a topic than to have one that contains possibly inaccurate info that has not yet been properly verified. Once someone <i>does</i> find good sources, the article can be recreated at that time. --&#160;<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatori_Son_3c62.html" title="User talk:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 15:38, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Contested prod. Lengthy and well written article, but sadly on a non notable band, which fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.

<p>Response: I'm new at making articles for wikipedia, so I'm not really sure where I should post my response. Wikipedia is my favorite site and I use it extensively, for hours every day, just reading, learning, etc. I am a talented writer as well and have written several screenplays, so I decided to try my hand at wikipedia articles. I wrote this article about a band I knew a lot about, and if you could not delete it, I would really appreciate it. I know a lot of people who would appreciate this article's preservation and among those people is a huge group that cares about this band. If for no other reason, please don't delete this article simply because it is my debut article. I know that is an irrational reason, but this article means a lot to me and I hope to become one of wikipedia's valued article editors. I have noticed a lot of poor writing on this site and was using this article to practice for editing some of those articles. I know many people do not know the band Martial Law, and that this article may be a little long for an unknown band, but I assure you that they have had a lot of success and do fall into several of the categories that are required for a notable band. Thank you for your consideration. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Letitithrash17 (<a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELetitithrash17_ea96.html" title="User talk:Letitithrash17">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Letitithrash17_7081.html" title="Special:Contributions/Letitithrash17">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> and leave the same. Hey, I created this page and I studied for months and worked hard to get it done. I am Durin's Bane and I found all of this information from the internet, in tolkiens personal writings, from the Hobbit, Simillarion, Lord of the Rings, Unfinished tales and much more. I worked hard on this and it should not be deleted. Most of my information came from Tolkien's Guide to Middle Earth, it is a book that describes every living thing or race or character. He mentioned them much more than once, and it cannot be put all into two sentences, mainly because of the fact that nothing in Tolkien's world could be described in two sentences. Like I was saying in the section of stone giants it specificly states what I have written. The information came from what Bilbo had written in The Red Book of Westmarch. This is all accurate and correct. Even the information of the giants in the Battle for Middle Earth 2 game. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Durin's Bane (<a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurin%27s_Bane_c33b.html" title="User talk:Durin's Bane">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Durin%27s_Bane_9c68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Durin's Bane">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>Unless you found it in something written by Tolkien, you can't just say it as if he invented it that way. He never wrote a "Guide to Middle Earth". If you found anything about "mountain giants" in <i>The Silmarillion</i> you were seeing things. I recall nothing about them in <i>Unfinished Tales</i>. He mentioned them once or twice in <i>Letters</i> as anomalies that don't fit well into the rest of his mythology, IIRC. And in any event, I believe he called them by no other name than "stone giants"; "mountain giants" must come from somewhere else. I would guess that and everything else here was either made up by the author of the Guide, or is from some game or other. Either way, you should say so and provide references. Do that and I'll ask for this AfD to be withdrawn. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 04:36, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What are YOU talking about. Tolkien did write giants in the Similarion he wrote them possibly being the ones who created Helm's Deep. And yes he did write a Guide to Middle Earth book. It was edited by his son, I have the book. I don't know how to site sources but I'll try, and if this is demolished I will write it all again! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 199.44.18.70 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_199.44.18.70_a8a5.html" title="Special:Contributions/199.44.18.70">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> (edit conflict) I see little evidence of notability via google. The fact that every other eating club seems to have an article in Wikipedia is interesting; I have not examined those pages for independent sources of information about each club, but I don't see a source for this one.

<li>Being admitedly new to this process, I was wondering if completeness is a valid argument for inclusion. Wikipedia deciding to represent only the eating clubs could be seen as lopsided. individual articles may be neutrally written, but the content as a whole may not be neutral.<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron.michels_fdf3.html" title="User:Aaron.michels">Aaron.michels</a> 00:23, 11 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is specifically not a criteria for inclusion, precisely because the other articles you mention are can be nominated for deletion at any time, and because two wrongs don't make a right. The argument is derisively called the "Pokemon argument" because editors often note that there is a complete set of articles on every last Pokemon card (and a community of devotees that won't let them be deleted), so why not an article on (insert name of topic)? The answer to articles that shouldn't exist is not more articles that shouldn't exist. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 00:37, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for being clear, Robert. I now understand this argument. Which makes me think, "Gee, You must have this problem a lot." From a new user's perspective, you learn what is appropraite on Wikipedia by looking at what is currently on Wikipedia, not by looking at what would be in an encyclopedia on my shelf. In this case it seemed to be safe territory for a new article, as it appeared to be an ommision among articles on parallel organizations.

<li><b>Keep</b>, or alternatively <b>merge</b>. I originally added the article because leaving out discussion of the student coops misrepresents an important aspect of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_University_960f.html" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>. <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eating_clubs.html" title="Eating clubs">Eating clubs</a> have been called Princeton's "Peculiar Institution" (see, e.g. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rule_of_Four_5850.html" title="The Rule of Four">The Rule of Four</a>, Page 88), and in the late 1970's student activism, including an occupation of the administration building, led to the creation of 2D as an alternative. Most of the sources currently cited in the article are from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Princetonian_36aa.html" title="The Daily Princetonian">The Daily Princetonian</a>, which, as you will note from the Wikipedia article, has a circulation of approximately 8,000 and a budget of $400,000, which indicates that it is distributed well beyond the campus community (in addition to online readers). One of the other references, Princeton Alumni Weekly, has a circulation of 65,000 <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~paw/advertising.html" class="external text" title="http://www.princeton.edu/~paw/advertising.html" rel="nofollow">source</a>. Certainly many niche Wikipedia articles cite sources with comparable distribution that are considered <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> -- note both publications are independent and meet the definition of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary source</a> (and in fact have been used for historical scholarship). 2D has also been featured in a best-selling novel and is included in other books on Princeton, and is at least mentioned in passing in a New York Times article. 2D was also the subject of at least two anthropology studies/papers, although I'm not sure how to find the citations for them. It will take a little time to build out the article and provide proper sources, but I believe it is already better sourced at least than most of the articles about the <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eating_clubs.html" title="Eating clubs">Eating clubs</a>. I don't think the "Pokemon argument" argument applies here, as <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eating_clubs.html" title="Eating clubs">Eating clubs</a> and the cooperative alternative are probably the most important indicators of the socioeconomic dynamics of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_University_960f.html" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>, which itself I think we can all agree is quite notable.<a href="../../../a/j/k/User%7EAjkessel_f2c5.html" title="User:Ajkessel">Ajkessel</a> | <a href="../../../a/j/k/User_talk%7EAjkessel_f6b1.html" title="User talk:Ajkessel">Talk</a> 02:28, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article has little context on the notability of the surname itself, and mostly consists of links to others of encyclopedic merit who have the surname without providing any explanation of what their surname had to do with it. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueSquadronRaven_0385.html" title="User:BlueSquadronRaven"><font color="blue"><b>BlueSquadron</b></font><font color="black"><b>Raven</b></font></a> 23:08, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oookay... this is a really tricky one. I am James Dignan, and though I have no objection to having an article on WP, I really don't think I'm quite notable enough for one. I had this as a subpage of my user-page, as much as anything as an "example article" (and it is still there), but someone noticed that several articles had my name as a redlink and decided to copy it over to article space.</p>
<p>Trying to look at it objectively, there are several claims of notability here, and I certainly get loads of google hits and - as I mentioned - there are about ten links from other articles to this page. But there are also some significantly trivial aspects to a lot of the article. But I don't know... the best solution I could come up with was to lay it all out in an afd and see what the consensus is. My gut feeling is either "trim thoroughly" or "delete with no objection to a later re-creation if I become more well-known", and keeping the "userfied" version as is. Consider this more a procedural <b>no vote</b> than as a yay or nay. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 23:34, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. Should stay in user space for now. Sorry, but I don't see any solid claims to encyclopedic notability here. Clearly a valuable part of the New Zealand cultural scene, but nothing so far merits encyclopedic inclusion on the basis of this article. When the book that's being written is published and is proclaimed by reliable sources to be significant, the case will be stronger.

<li><b>Weakish keep</b> (i.e. stronger than weak but weaker than regular) This is a case where I'm not sure that any individual achievement listed in the article would necessarily confer sufficient notability, but I feel that everything stacked together does assert enough significance so as to warrant an article. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 05:07, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per SandyDancer. After performing a Google search, out of the hits prior to the WP article, the top was the CCF itself, followed by numerous blogs (not sure what JAS was thinking of, but commentisfree.guardian.co.uk is a blog), one article <a href="http://core2.trg.org.uk/staff/timmontgomerie.html" class="external text" title="http://core2.trg.org.uk/staff/timmontgomerie.html" rel="nofollow">linked here</a> notably with a misspelling, and one commentary/editorial on The Independent. The following page are all bloggers' responsa to him, or mentioning him. Per the articles he has written, Montgomerie has no real notability except through the CCF, and yet no one knows exactly what it is he did as director. Therefore, I would have to come to the conclusion that while the CCF seems notable, Montgomerie's notability is <i>not</i> asserted. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 04:06, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Was that the Google search that came up with 60,700 hits? So the first nine have a number of blogs, the lesson being that blogs tend to be over-represented on Google. Have you actually looked at the article which shows articles in the BBC, New York Times, Weekly Standard, Guardian, Observer, Sunday Herald and Financial Times? Yes they don't come up on the first page of Google, but looking a bit further, or even looking at the article, will show that he's quoted on a number of times. I'm tired of the "haven't heard of him" school of deletion. Wikipedia should have a place for the influential backroom types as well as MPs. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 10:15, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> surely lots of the 60,700 hits would be for <i>other people</i> called Tim Montgomerie? I am sure there are hundreds of them in the world. And some refs would be misspellings of the more famous athlete's similar name. Just as you may be sick of people nominating for deletion because they hadn't heard of the person (admittedly a weak argument), I think quoting the number of hits on google doesn't work, particularly if the subject of the article is a person with a relatively standard name. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 11:25, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please re-read the comment. I said that MSJapan had relied on the first two pages of the Google search, and that with 60,700 hits there was likely to be more information. My point is that you can't talk about sources if you don't look at the article and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tim_Montgomerie&amp;oldid=87438384" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tim_Montgomerie&amp;oldid=87438384" rel="nofollow">at the time he put in his comment</a> the article had citations from a large number of news sources (admittedly there are more now). <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 11:36, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> SandyDancer, I -am- a deletionist and I voted keep here. Citations are made in the article through, among other publications, The New York Times, the Financial Times, and multiple mentions on the BBC. My idea of the notability guidelines is that they are intended as an extension of the verifiability guidelines, in that a non-notable subject will also tend to be unverifiable. However, in this case, the subject is both notable and verifiable, and clearly passes the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> requirement of multiple secondary source mentions. Please also do remember to <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">be civil</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 10:34, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you do believe I've been uncivil, please let me know why and I'll take your concerns under consideration. However, comments such as you made to JASpencer are neither civil nor assumption of good faith, being a pure guess regarding another user's thoughts and motives.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Such a structure appears to exist, although the identification of large scale structure in the direction of the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgo_Cluster_ec67.html" title="Virgo Cluster">Virgo Cluster</a> is difficult (for example, see what is written for the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Sombrero_Galaxy_f3e0.html" title="Sombrero Galaxy">Sombrero Galaxy</a> and the <a href="../../../n/g/c/NGC_4631_Group_479b.html" title="NGC 4631 Group">NGC 4631 Group</a>). The major problem is notability, even within the professional astronomy community. The NED and SIMBAD resources above list informaton on almost all extragalactic objects, but this thing is so non-notable that it is not catalogued in their databases. If professional astronomers do not think that the W cloud is notable, then it certainly does not belong on Wikipedia. A redirect also does not seem like a logical solution, as I cannot think of where to redirect a search for a "W cloud". (I honestly think that it is more likely that someone searching for "W cloud" is looking for a <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W.
