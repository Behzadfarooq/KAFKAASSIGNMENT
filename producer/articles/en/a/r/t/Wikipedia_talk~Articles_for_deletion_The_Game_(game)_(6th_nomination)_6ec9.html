<p>AfD is note a vote, it is a discussion of whether the article merits inclusion. If problems with core content policies exist, no amount of keep votes will overcome that. Substantial argument against the pro-deletion arguements rooted in policy would be required. Please do not polarise the issue by making it a for-or-against matter—anymore than it already is, anyways. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37"><b><span style="color:#DF2F2F">Big</span><span style="color:#3F3F3F">Nate</span><span style="color:#DF2F2F">37</span></b></a><sub><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html" title="User talk:BigNate37">(T)</a></sub> 03:05, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It doesn't need to be cleaned up—taking away the discussion and leaving only a tally defeats the purpose of the discussion. If the keep arguments are more sound than the delete arguments, it shouldn't matter if they were outnumbered ten to one. At best, the tally doesn't affect the outcome, but in the worst case it could bring about the wrong decision. And yes, I concede that you're not organising a vote and I do believe that you're trying to do a good thing.

<p><b>Terminate this mockery of a shoutfest in favor of a discussion on the subjects that actually matter here.</b> I've followed this debate ever since the first AfD and watched its slow decline into a ridiculous parody of itself through the second and third and fourth and umpteenth AfDs, DRVs, IRAs, PVCs and variety of other TLAs. The ludicrousity of it is just incredible in so many ways that I don't even know where to start. Is it the convenient ad-hoc paranoia surrounding savethegame.org and its campaign to infiltrate sources that pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, as if our goal weren't appropriate and informative articles (or lack of the opposite) but to make it absolutely clear that no-one manipulates Wikipedia, beyotch? Is it the laughable clinging to the Belgian newspaper article by those who favor keeping, who I somehow doubt are deep inside truly, utterly convinced that a single whimsical column completely devoid of any research or analysis validates an encyclopedia asserting a global phenomenon? Is it the equally as laughable dismissal of the gigantic weight of the evidence indeed pointing at the existence of the subject because teh internets is stupids and doesn't count which trumps any possible line of argument to the contrary and that's that? Is it the obsessive-compulsive citing of Wikipedia policy pages like <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> or <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> or <a href="../../../o/m/g/WP%7EOMGWTFBBQ_36a9.html" title="WP:OMGWTFBBQ">WP:OMGWTFBBQ</a> even though the lack of consensus surrounding these policies and their interpretations in the context of this problematic article should have become perfectly bloody clear to everybody involved given the shiny words <i>for the sixth time</i> pasted on the AfD notice or, failing that, the fact that the policy pages <i>themselves</i> are the subject of heated discussion and edit wars? Is it the gargantuan maelstrom of unearthly shouts of DELETE! and KEEP! and OMG VOTESTACKING! and THIS GUY DOESN'T COUNT! and YES HE DOES! and NO HE DOESN'T! immediately following the meager little silly announcement at the top, meekly noting that technically, this is not a vote?...</p>
<p>I'm not against the process of AfD, understand. I think the consensus-driven process of AfD is a good idea and a much better alternative than most others, and generally I am not a whining quack here to run in angry circles and vent about the futility of process (picture that, if you will - <i>Whine! Whine! Quack! Quack!</i>). But I seriously think that by this point playing by the usual rules of AfD has proven itself futile for dealing with the more fundamental issues disputed here, such as at what point exactly does a collection of assorted sources surmount the verifiability challenge, and which sources count and which don't, and whether or not the esoteric nature or silliness or magnitude of claims made within an article's subject matter should affect the degree to which we're strict with the policy requirements on it. Sure, nobody's /admitting/ that these are the issues and everybody's pretending they're not there and this debate could be settled if one side were to fling a decidedly large chunk of Wikipedia policy at the other, but that does not make them any less the issues. And above everything else, for me what transpired just above is proof positive that if you set up your discussion in a way that walks like a vote, talks like a vote and quacks like a vote, it will be a vote. Attempting to discern anything useful from where this discussion is going at present yields something to the extent of "ooh, the deletes are shouting louder and have longer paragraphs and there're more of them, so delete it is, then". That's instinctive and natural and obvious and WRONG in every possible way if we want this encyclopedia to be run by something with at least a semblance of consensus rather than mob rule.</p>
<p>Inevitably some Admin's time is going to be terribly wasted reading this whole discussion and the vast resources of new and compelling syllogisms in favor of one side of the other that nobody was aware of during the last five AfDs, amounting to approximately nil. I suppose there could be many ways to deal with what this discussion has become; and though I stay away from most AfDs, somehow I have a hunch that a lot of them have become like this, and likewise an idea for what could possibly be a better and cleaner way to run AfDs like these (or any AfD for that matter). Let the proponents collaboratively construct the respective cases for keeping and deleting, and sign their name at a separate section in the end, like <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAceMyth_AfD_6d60.html" title="User:AceMyth/AfD">This</a>. It wouldn't solve everything, but I believe it'd be a step in the right direction. --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAceMyth_ce06.html" title="User:AceMyth">AceMyth</a> 10:39, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>After reading that, I'm still wondering what gives paranoia the distinction of being "ad-hoc" and what sort of accomplishment it is to make an admin waste his/her time reading a rant that complains about wasting admin time. It doesn't really add to the AfD discussion at hand. I've given this nonsense its own section to separate it from the AfD debate/discussion/vote/whatever, but it probably ought to be moved to the talk page instead. In all seriousness, the only thing keeping AfD from being a vote is the fact that closing admins do not (or at least should not) be counting heads, but deciding whether an article merits deletion based on policy after considering the points raised in discussion. If that happens, people can do all the votestacking they want and it won't skew the results. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37"><b><span style="color:#DF2F2F">Big</span><span style="color:#3F3F3F">Nate</span><span style="color:#DF2F2F">37</span></b></a><sub><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html" title="User talk:BigNate37">(T)</a></sub> 17:13, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. "what gives paranoia the distinction of being "ad-hoc""? That there are a myriad groups out there interested in manipulating any and all media outlets in any and all directions. You'd expect somebody enlightened enough to point accusing fingers at potential sources because of savethegame.org to point similar fingers at controversial material cited pretty much everywhere and go "halt! But this could be the illuminati!", clearly reducing this line of argument to an absurdity. That this sudden pre-emptive skepticism about potential verifiable sources emerged independently like that carries a strong scent of ad-hoc about it. I'm not pretending that the fact some people set out to manipulate Wikipedia isn't disturbing; it is. But in the end nothing good can come out of falling prey to such alien considerations, and they only make our decision process vulnerable to manipulation in a different way (consider that I can now decide to open up a website that pretends to advocate some controversial article I actually want /out/ of Wikipedia).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>3. "In my experience, admins are typically much more sophisticated in their closings than this caricature." First of all, the majority of the people who have to put up with this are not the admins but the <i>editors</i>. It's been almost a year and we're still having almost the exact same dispute with the exact same arguments and counter-arguments after being terminated and re-opened for five times not counting DRVs and such. Can you honestly say there's nothing wrong with that? Second, that admins are expected to formulate a balanced opinion based on solely the arguments involved while paying no heed to the fact that text devoted to one opinion dominates 80% of the page space does not mean that psychologically they actually do, as after all they are only human. Given what we know about humans, a skew is inevitable, and it's for this reason that the NPoV policy says this in a section called "fairness of tone":</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>If we are going to characterize disputes neutrally, we should present competing views with a consistently fair and sensitive tone. Many articles end up as partisan commentary even while presenting both points of view. Even when a topic is presented in terms of facts rather than opinion, an article can still radiate an implied stance through either selection of which facts to present, or more subtly their organization — for instance, refuting opposing views as one goes along makes them look a lot worse than collecting them in an opinions-of-opponents section.</p>

<dd>This is talking about article space, but consider the rationale guiding it: That the person coming across the page in question would be the most likely to form their opinion based on the strength of the arguments for and the arguments against.

<p>Because this is not the place for a discussion of this level, I'll try to be brief. Assuming you are correct, how do you intend to bring about change on with a cynical tone, on a specific AfD? It would be more productive if you could come up with a better process and suggest it at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_977d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_policy_ab70.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy">Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy</a>.

<dd>"How do you intend to bring about change on with a cynical tone, on a specific AfD?" I wanted to get the attention of people involved in this AfD and the admin who will eventually make the decision one way or the other. I figured it belongs very well right in the living, breathing example of what it sets out to prevent. I do have positive suggestions: One, that is admittedly a long shot, is the elimination of the way a tone can dominate an AfD page regardless of what the arguments for or against happen to be; Two, that is very relevant to this specific AfD, is to put this discussion on hold and figure out the ambiguities in policy that are fueling it. Because otherwise there will always be another AfD or another DRV, and if you delete and salt sooner or later another article will crop up with exactly these controversies surrounding it - and I'd very much rather see it promptly kept or deleted rather than having to follow a gazillion discussions throughout two whole years all over again.<br /></dd>
<dd>As for the cynical tone, from my experience not much of a powerful rhetoric is conveyed when pointing at absurdities with a care bear stare. --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAceMyth_ce06.html" title="User:AceMyth">AceMyth</a>
