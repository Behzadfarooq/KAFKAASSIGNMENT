<p>This "group" does not exist. The article mentions more than once that it might be a joke, and says that they only thing "they" apparently do is run a website. The talk page is full of people asking over and over for reliable sources, but no one answers. From reading the talk page, it apparently survived a VFD back in December 2003 or January 2004, but sourcing was a lot looser back then. These days, it fails <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 12:40, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I forgot to answer these earlier. These links are completely unacceptable. The first, I have already dealt with in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Libertarian_National_Socialist_Green_Party&amp;diff=108685586&amp;oldid=108613040" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Libertarian_National_Socialist_Green_Party&amp;diff=108685586&amp;oldid=108613040" rel="nofollow">my reply to WMMartin below;</a> it contains a single sentence that Weise posted messages on nazi.org, and then it quotes from their press release. Completely trivial, and nothing to write an article from. The second, a CNN transcript, has two sentences, one saying Weise posted there, the other with some CNN commentator saying essentially "I browsed the website!" The third has no content at all, it's just a list, no hint of a reliable source whatsoever, and it's on a K-12 teacher's website (nothing scholarly, for sure). The fourth, an MTV link, has one sentence and again quotes from the nazi.org press release. The fifth is a Yahoo Answers link that contains a cut and paste of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_dd3b.html" title="Bill White">Bill White</a> article! The links themselves are very strong arguments for just mentioning the site at <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Weise_64a3.html" title="Jeff Weise">Jeff Weise</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_dd3b.html" title="Bill White">Bill White</a> (no real need for a merge, even), and <i>at the very best</i> leaving this page as a redirect to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_dd3b.html" title="Bill White">Bill White</a>. I wouldn't see much to gain from such a redirect, but others here seem to think that's better, and I'm not dismissing that opinion; I just don't share it. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 18:33, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note also that the fact that Bill White has run in elections has nothing to do with nazi.org, as he did not run <i>as their representative</i>. He runs in elections but never for them, and he's not even a member, he just picked up the opportunity to advertise himself as Public Relations for nazi.org after Weise's incident; this is all very clear upon reading White's article. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 18:40, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Pretty much sounds like something made up...somewhere. As stated in the article, "<i>The LNSGP at present has no intention of gaining ballot access or fielding political candidates</i>". I'm sorry, but if this party has no intention of running in election and is not registered as a party with the applicable electoral authority of any jurisdiction, this "party" pretty much verges on being speediable as a non-notable club. Any relevance this "joke" may have in regards to other articles referred to in this AfD can be mentioned in those articles. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 18:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. This group, like most extreme political groups, is not notable because of their performance in elections, just the oposite. It is their influence on the fringe and youth (like <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Weise_64a3.html" title="Jeff Weise">Jeff Weise</a>), the nature of their message and their underground activity and imapct on popular culture that makes them notable. This "club" has recieved quite a bit of news coverage and it is both verifiable and notable via these channels. Remember, popularity is not an indicator of notability. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 18:38, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I agree that popularity does not equate notability.

<li>Wether the subject is satire or ideology is not the concern. That is an issue to be addressed <i>in the article</i>. The only thing I can assume you mean by "substance" is "<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>" as that is the criteria for the worth of a subject's substance on wikipedia. The issue is wether the subject meets the <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">criteria for deletion</a> which it does not; It meets the requirments of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and there are reliable sources to prove it.

<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLLOCKS_9aa6.html" title="WP:BOLLOCKS">WP:BOLLOCKS</a> may not be policy, but <a href="../../../h/o/a/WP%7EHOAX_ea37.html" title="WP:HOAX">WP:HOAX</a> is, and it's grounds for deletion (though not speedy). Bill White has a history of grabbing attention for himself by claiming to be "public relations" for whatever made-up white power slogan he can get his hands on, and there's no evidence that this "group" amounts to anything but its own name. If we're going to argue notability from Bill White, then the page should simply redirect to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_%28neo-nazi%29_48b0.html" title="Bill White (neo-nazi)">Bill White (neo-nazi)</a>, like <a href="../../../u/t/o/Utopian_Anarchist_Party_c724.html" title="Utopian Anarchist Party">Utopian Anarchist Party</a> already does (another of his toys). <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Weise_64a3.html" title="Jeff Weise">Jeff Weise</a> was never a party adherent, he was a webforum member of this and many other non-notable white power forums. There is no evidence that the "party" has any members, and all they have going for them is well-parked web domain real estate, nazi.org, and a silly name meant to associate themselves with two somewhat-successful United States third parties. Note that all the notability they may have picked up has only been for Bill White or for Jeff Weise and his webforum posts. No notability for any "Party", and so no notability for the supposed subject of this article. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 20:34, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>In order to delete something on the grouds of it being a hoax you have to prove it is a hoax. Simply saying "it sounds like a hoax to me!" is not acceptable esp when the subject has garnered this attention from reliable sources. Like I said this is all to be hashed out in the article itself. I'm not saying the article is good one way or the other, I'm saying that the subject itself meets all the requirements for a article on wikipedia. Barring real evidence that it is a hoax (not having "real members" like the two major political parties could mean it is impossible to register as a member of the party which still makes it an ideological group, not uncommon or grouds to label it a hoax) this doesn't meet a single portion of the criteria for deletion.

<li>I understand that it might or might not be a joke. For the sake of argument let us say that it is. With all the events surrounding this topic the subject retains it's notability. If you have issues with the verifiability of some statments in the article then go ahead and change the article. The subject itself though, and it effects, are documented and verifiable, therefore the article is alright. I'm not sure if I'm making myself clear, it's kind of a fucked up way to argue notability I suppose. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 21:32, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, you're making sense, but I just don't think the sources argue for any notability of the "Party". The fact that Bill White argues it's real is evidence that it's not real, just like the <a href="../../../u/t/o/Utopian_Anarchist_Party_c724.html" title="Utopian Anarchist Party">Utopian Anarchist Party</a>. And like that other hoax, the notability supposedly attached to this is at most enough for a redirect to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_%28neo-nazi%29_48b0.html" title="Bill White (neo-nazi)">Bill White (neo-nazi)</a>, imho. A little off-topic but I loved one of the comments on Reason.com: "<i>This should be a warning to any teen in a lunatic fringe party: don't do a school shooting--Bill White will just hog all the glory after you're dead.</i>" —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 22:07, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>That's an outstanding quote. I suppose the difference is that the "Party", which in all probability is not an actual entity, does not warrant an article under <a href="../../../h/o/a/WP%7EHOAX_ea37.html" title="WP:HOAX">WP:HOAX</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> with the first policy cancelling out the primary "reliable sources" which could be used to establish the second. With that in mind I would still say the subject of the article is notable and verifiable in popular culture, all things considered. If there is not enough material to substain a rewritten article with this in mind I would not be opposed to a redirect and merge to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_%28neo-nazi%29_48b0.html" title="Bill White (neo-nazi)">Bill White (neo-nazi)</a> and a mention in the two realvent school shooting articles. I just worry that the topic has touched to many stand alone articles and merging it would result in navigational pains. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 22:32, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If nazi.org is notable on its own, then there will be third party coverage out there, independent of the situations involving Bill White and Jeff Weise. There is no such coverage. There is no notability for nazi.org except as it pertains to these two individuals, and so it should not have its own article but should simply be mentioned in those individuals' articles. The point of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#The_primary_notability_criterion" title="WP:N">WP:N#The primary notability criterion</a> is that "<i>In order to have a verifiable article, a topic must be notable enough that the information about it will have been researched, checked, and evaluated through publication in independent reliable sources. [And] In order to have a neutral article, a topic must be notable enough that the information about it will be from unbiased and unaffiliated sources; and that those interested in the article will not be exclusively partisan or fanatic editors.</i>" The problem with this article is that because all the sources are really about Jeff Weise and Bill White, the coverage of nazi.org is all <i>trivial</i>. There is not enough <i>non-trivial</i> coverage to write a verifiable, npov article about nazi.org. This is a controversial topic, which is why it's <i>extremely important</i> that the content of the article be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, however, with the triviality of the sources, this is impossible. So the article can never be encyclopedic. The best mention that nazi.org can get is passing references in the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_dd3b.html" title="Bill White">Bill White</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Weise_64a3.html" title="Jeff Weise">Jeff Weise</a> articles, because it gets no substantial coverage in the third-party sources that we would need to write an article from. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 07:20, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The last reference I list was to a slideshow that appeared to have been presented at an academic conference on monitoring dubious/terrorist activity on the internet; this group appears to have been specifically studied by academics. Whether the group actually "exists" or not - one suggestion is that it started as a joke but attracted enough people that the joke was subverted - is not relevant: as the Reason Online article cited by this article points out, we here appear to have an example of the <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_theorem.html" title="Thomas theorem">Thomas theorem</a>. In any case "non-existence" is not a problem for us - we have plenty of articles on <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_T._Kirk_07e0.html" title="James T. Kirk">James T.

<li>You're muddling the waters, WMMartin. The "Libertarian National Socialist Green Party" <b>is nazi.org</b> and nothing more. Your google cache of arizona.edu link states this quite clearly: it's about the nazi.org forum, and they didn't study the "Party", they simply used that webforum as an example of how a "hot thread"-detecting metric works.<a href="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:EVpX0Y_z8GsJ:ai.arizona.edu/hchen/slide/ICDAT-DarkWeb-Oct2006.ppt+%22libertarian+national+socialist+green%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=74" class="external autonumber" title="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:EVpX0Y_z8GsJ:ai.arizona.edu/hchen/slide/ICDAT-DarkWeb-Oct2006.ppt+%22libertarian+national+socialist+green%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=74" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> That citation says <i>absolutely nothing</i> about the "Party", what they "do", what they're about, anything. It's only the briefest of trivial mentions of nazi.org, in a computer science case study of a generic algorithm. The fact is that all these links you've come up with are trivial, and thus they all fail <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> (which says the sources must be <i>non-trivial</i>), because you can't write an article from them. Let's actually look at the links you've provided (<b>the reader is strongly encouraged to actually click on these links and follow along</b>). Besides the google cache of arizona.edu, you've got something from artsandlettersmagazine.com,<a href="http://www.artsandlettersmagazine.com/FeaturedStoryHMathewBarkhausenIII.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.artsandlettersmagazine.com/FeaturedStoryHMathewBarkhausenIII.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> which has <i>two sentences</i>, both saying that the "Party" issued a statement: they "refused to wring hands over a 'tragedy'...", etc. Does this tell us anything we can write an article from? No, it belongs in <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Weise_64a3.html" title="Jeff Weise">Jeff Weise</a>'s article, because it doesn't inform us at all about the "Party". Let's look at your NPR link.<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4557742" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4557742" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> It's about Weise, again, and it says that he posted lots of messages to lots of (other non-notable) neo-nazi web forums. It's got <b>one</b> sentence, at the very end, which says that Weise posted some messages to nazi.org. What does this tell us about the "Party"? What information here can we write an article from? We can certainly add the short reference into <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Weise_64a3.html" title="Jeff Weise">Jeff Weise</a>'s article, but that's it. Again, because you seem to have overlooked this, the point of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#The_primary_notability_criterion" title="WP:N">WP:N#The primary notability criterion</a>, which asks for <b>non-trivial</b> coverage, is that "<i>In order to have a verifiable article, a topic must be notable enough that the information about it will have been researched, checked, and evaluated through publication in independent reliable sources. [And] In order to have a neutral article, a topic must be notable enough that the information about it will be from unbiased and unaffiliated sources; and that those interested in the article will not be exclusively partisan or fanatic editors.</i>" There's no non-trivial coverage yet to use. Let's look at the Guardian link,<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1443462,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1443462,00.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> which is again that exact same issued statement that was in the artsandlettersmagazine link. It's just direct quotation from nazi.org,<a href="http://www.nazi.org/nazi/policy/weise/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nazi.org/nazi/policy/weise/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> but no independent investigative reporting, no verifiability here. As <a href="http://www.nazi.org/nazi/policy/weise/" class="external free" title="http://www.nazi.org/nazi/policy/weise/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nazi.org/nazi/policy/weise/</a> demonstrates, it's a press release, expressly forbidden by <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, which clearly says: "<i>The "independence" qualification excludes all ... press releases</i>". There's nothing more in the Guardian link besides a reprint of the press release, so this is both trivial <i>and</i> not independent. Still failing our simplest notability requirements. What about CNN?<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/03/22/school.shooting/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/03/22/school.shooting/index.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> One sentence that says <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Weise_64a3.html" title="Jeff Weise">Jeff Weise</a> posted there, again, fine for his article, and then <i>more reprinting of the nazi.org press release</i>. There's absolutely nothing there, in all of those links, to write any kind of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wp%7Everifiable.html" title="Wp:verifiable">wp:verifiable</a> article from. And the fact that nobody has actually bothered to investigate them is evidence that nazi.org is in fact non-notable; no journalists or academics are interested in them enough to study them and write anything approaching a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wp%7Ereliable_source.html" title="Wp:reliable source">wp:reliable source</a>, because they have no notability whatsoever outside of the <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Weise_64a3.html" title="Jeff Weise">Jeff Weise</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_dd3b.html" title="Bill White">Bill White</a> articles. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 20:46, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. A website is not a political party. They have run no candidates, have held no conventions, no membership to speak of, no major role in any significant protest movements, no publications outside of their own website. They do seem to have gotten some attention in outside articles but only because of the utter weirdness of the idea or speculation whether this is a joke, so does not completely fail <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> but doesn't clearly pass WP:ORG either. Notability is a judgment call in this case and I would suggest applying the same criteria here as to other non-notable upstart and web-only political parties, such as the United States Pirate Party, <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragomiloff_1fd6.html" title="User:Dragomiloff">Dragomiloff</a> 02:44, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> If people treat this party as real, then it is real as a concept, and since it is obviously N judged by the comments above--even of those who were arguing for delete. If there were any doubt about N, it no longer exists, after Jeff Weise who is widely known to have supported their principles. it is the sort of think which goes into WP. In fact, articles like this <b>should</b> be thought of as essential parts of WP--it is good that there be some relatively reliable guide for web users who come across this for the first time. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> (<a href="../../../d/g/g/User_talk%7EDGG_49c8.html" title="User talk:DGG">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DGG_009a.html" title="Special:Contributions/DGG">contribs</a>) 01:23, 18 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li>I'll assume you weren't being intentionally disingenuous in saying that my words really amount to "keep". Even with honest intention, it's certainly not a fair argument. I believe I've been perfectly clear in the reasons why this article fails notability, and you haven't addressed those reasons. Simply, without reliable sources to write an article from, <i>we cannot create a "relatively reliable guide</i>" for anyone to read here. In addition to non-notabilty, the article fails <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, and it fails hard, as I've demonstrated above. Discuss the sources if you like, but as the case currently stands, we have no verifiable content whatsoever except "Jeff Weise posted some messages and Bill White distributed a press release." And no one is showing up with better sources. <span style="white-space: nowrap">— <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span>acan</a></span> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant: small-caps">lk</span></a> — 04:28, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
