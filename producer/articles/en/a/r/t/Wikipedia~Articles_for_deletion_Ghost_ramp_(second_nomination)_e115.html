The last vote certaintly did not go towards consensus, I don't see how another vote several months later will be any different. Perhaps instead of selecting articles for deletion, you could improve on the article as it contains a wealth of information. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 20:19, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

For instance, there is no need to source an aerial image if it clearly shows or demonstrates that an abandoned ramp or a disused ramp is visible and/or is photographed. Many have also been sourced, see <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_ramp.html#References" title="Ghost ramp">Ghost ramp#References</a>.

<li>I saw it every weekday for many years riding to work, and often when walking between buildings at work. It is like article <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_ramp.html" title="Ghost ramp">Ghost ramps</a> describes. It is listed in the first entry in <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_ramp.html#United_Kingdom" title="Ghost ramp">Ghost ramp#United Kingdom</a>.

<ul>
<li>I don't think the {{Original Research}} tagging of the page is event justified; the issue seems to be more about a complain regarding the quality of the source that is used, rather than whether it truly qualifies as OR.

<dd>If the article was simply about a neologism, I might be inclined to agree; but the article appears to be a well-sourced article documenting the <i>phenomena.</i> If the article was renamed to "Roads with Incomplete Ramps" I doubt we'd be having this discussion (in which case perhaps only a rename, followed by a Redirect, is in order). On a related note, are you seriously announcing that as closing-admin you'll delete an article even in a case where the overwhelming plurality of AfD commenters have presented well-reasoned arguments in favor of keep (please don't present 'AfD is not a vote', which I don't think is the case here--because that reason is not synonymous with 'AfD is a way for admins to disregard comments and make up their own mind'). <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 01:06, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Precisely that, yes. Consensus <i>cannot</i> override policy. I don't want people to have a nasty surprise, so I'm giving fair warning.

I don't think this article expressly violates policy, any content that is objectionable can be removed. The principle itself isn't a problem, just the tone. As such, I'd say it's more a clean-up issue than a deletion one. Treating it the way you have is a tad heavy-handed.

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, I do think this phenomena exists, but I'm not sure it should be a full article, or if this is the right title. Might Abandoned roads or a subsection of <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_town.html" title="Ghost town">ghost town</a> be a better choice? BTW, I'm not sure an Admin should be making a statement of intent to delete before discussion has developed, even with the caveat. It would be much more appropriate to just say "Delete, lack of reliable sources" or some such. The wording chosen has a coercive feel to it that I do not feel is a good idea. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:12, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Google for <i>"ghost ramp" OR "ghost ramps" -wikipedia -wikimedia</i> found 976 hits with a great variety of starts to their web addresses. This looks to me like that the phrase "ghost ramp" is widely known and used. It is nothing like a <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_town.html" title="Ghost town">ghost town</a>, and a ghost ramp usually does not mark a road built and then abandoned, but an abandoned plan to build a road. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Appleyard_20bf.html" title="User:Anthony Appleyard">Anthony Appleyard</a> 22:13, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hmm, I wouldn't say it's nothing like a ghost town, they are at least the same in that they are not use. At the least, I'd consider that there is enough in common that some linkage would be desirable. Whether the roads were abandoned, or just the plans to finish them doesn't matter to me, but I could also get behind unused roads if you think that might be better. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:57, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is not my major area of subject-matter expertise, so I don't know what print resources one would seek out to locate terminology of this nature. I could see a redirect to "stub ramp" (rather than vice versa) as an outcome here if that is used more commonly. But we are dealing with something that certainly exists, and is entitled to an article, irrespective of what it's called.</dd>
<dd>To overintellectualize this more than it might deserve, there are three separate issues here. One is whether the type of ramp described is entitled to its own article. The consensus is yes. Second is what to call the article. "Ghost ramp" seems to be supported by at least some non-Wikipedia sources; the term isn't a hoax or anything of that nature, even if no one has yet checked the Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Highway Terminology or whatever might exist for such a thing. Third is whether the listing of examples is accurate. The list itself seems to be reasonably sourced, and to the extent individual sources are inadequate they should evolve over time consistent with the standards applicable to other roads and highways articles.</dd>
<dd>In any event, I would like to think I am as strong a proponent of maintaining the standards of the encyclopedia as anyone, but I don't see a sufficiently serious violation of policy here to justify deleting against not just consensus but pretty much unanimity, and I will personally <a href="../../../s/p/i/WP%7ESPIDER_911a.html" title="WP:SPIDER">climb the Reichstag dressed as Spider-Man</a> should you do so. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 20:25, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unused highway is a neologism in the sense of not being used anywhere to refer to these unused ramps. It is verifyable that there are web and print uses of "Ghost ramp" and "Stub ramp". The article refers to highway ramps, not highways as a whole. An unused or abandoned highway article is fine, but it's not a redo of this article. <b>Unused highway ramps</b> would be more more precisely aligned, but again, it's not what's used out there: people use "Ghost ramp" and "Stub ramp". Creating a new article title, even if it's self-evident, when that's not what is used in practice, is committing neologism. Please don't!

<dd>No, because "railroad" and "commuter rail" are the standard terms used widely for those technologies. 'Unused highway ramp' has 7 ghits, none of which are official documents; '"Ghost ramp" freeway' 1,340, and '"stub ramp" freeway' 74. The only reason "stub ramp" is a valid option is that a couple of those hits are US state highway department publications, one of which I noted and cited in the article. Ghost ramp wins. The term is past the line from mere neologism into common usage, even if it is not verifyably referenced yet. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 03:02, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am backing NE2 on the neologism issue. Unused is defined as something that is "not yet used" or "not finished." Highway is defined as "road or way open to the use of the public." Combine the two and you have: "Not finished road (snip)." Not hard to determine that from those two words, and from the contributions and the widespread use, it's appearant others have no problems putting two and two together. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 04:44, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
