<li><b>DELETE</b> I love these AFD's simply because they are easy to defend. First, the World Of Warcraft game has over 7.5 million users world wide. The World of Warcraft english forums have over 2 million registered users. Eve:Online has a userbase of just under a million gamers, while the Eve:online Forums have just over 190,000 registered users. Just because these forums are part of a notable game, it doesn't make them in-and-of themselves notable. The Sci-Fi.com offical forums are often visited and posted on by people such as Ronald Moore (the creator of sci-fi's battlestar galactica) some of the BSG cast and the many writers of the Stargate series. As of today they have 60,162 registered users.

</ul>
</li>
<li>ok, lets break down <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and this article...</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>Web-specific content is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1) <i>The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Not that I can find. It has been mentioned <b>in passing</b> my newspaper articles, but a couple sentances or a mention of the BBS in an article talking about saving the "Enterprise" tv show does not qualify as a valid source.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations. except for the following:</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>a) <i>Media re-prints of press releases and advertising for the content or site.</i></dd>
<dd>b) <i>Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, the times at which such content is updated or made available, a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or content descriptions in internet directories or online stores.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>A mention in passing is exactly what the article on the "save enterprise campaign" was, hence...trivial. I was mentioned (actually quoted) in a newspaper article about a local 300 person LAN party. Does that mean I mean <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and deserve a wikipedia article of my own?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>2) <i>The website or content has won a notable independent award from either a publication or organization.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>No, it has not. Examples of such awards: Eisner Awards, Bloggies or Webby Awards. See <a href="../../../a/w/a/Category%7EAwards_ea71.html" title="Category:Awards">Category:Awards</a> for more. Being nominated for an award in multiple years is also considered an indicator of notability. This site has not won any.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>3) <i>The content is distributed via a medium which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Again, No it is not.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>The article itself must provide proof that its subject meets one of these criteria via inlined links or a "Reference" or "External link" section. Even if an entire website meets the notability criteria, its components (forums, articles, sections) are not necessarily notable and deserving of their own separate article.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Well it doesn't provide such proof and as far as I can see, does not pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Those arguing it does, please point out how.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The published works must be someone else writing about the company, corporation, product, or service. (See Wikipedia:Autobiography for the verifiability and neutrality problems that affect material where the subject of the article itself is the source of the material.) The barometer of notability is whether people independent of the subject itself (or of its manufacturer, creator, or vendor) have actually considered the content or site notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works that focus upon it.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>This means outside of the Trek-world, has anyone actually considered the content or site notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works that focus upon it? Not that I can find. Only trivial works like the fore mentioned article.--<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a><sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bschott_2362.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bschott"><font color="green">view my history</font></a>)</sub>/<sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 19:34, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>– No, you don't get an article of your own, any more than Bonnie Malmat would. But if you were part of a 6.000 person group that helped start a LAN party that was reported on throughout North America, then yes, maybe that group deserves a mention. TrekBBS was the place where those groups began, where their founders came from, and it's still a place where published and established writers and many other Trek notables have joined and participated, and continue to participate. <a href="../../../e/l/h/User%7EElHoserGrande_6e70.html" title="User:ElHoserGrande">ElHoserGrande</a> 05:46, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Good for it!

There are no Reliable Sources so it doesn't pass <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Again...concider the World of Warcraft forums. 2 million registered, active users. No article. Concider the Sci-Fi channel's boards where the writers, directors, and actors post and talk with fans. No article because it doesn't pass wikipedia's standards for inclusion. As it stands the article provides no sources, no proof it passes the fore-mentioned rules/guidelines and no reason it should be kept. BTW: if we even would suggest that the newpaper interview was a vaild source (which it is not) that is only one source. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> requires multiple non-trivial sources reporting on the subject (the bbs board itself) and normally most admins set a bar to a minumum of three sources. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a><sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bschott_2362.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bschott"><font color="green">view my history</font></a>)</sub>/<sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 06:17, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> maybe it doesn't pass WP:WEB but these rules aren't intended to be binding to every single case; clearly a notable website and a worthy article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThedreamdied_b4b9.html" title="User:Thedreamdied">Thedreamdied</a> 22:10, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If you admit the site does not pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, I don't see on what basis it could be kept. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a web directory.--<a href="../../../r/w/r/User%7ERWR8189_3944.html" title="User:RWR8189">RWR8189</a> 21:21, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The burden of proof is on those who advocate retaining this article, not on those trying to ditch it. Proponents of keeping this article have yet to provide any affirming evidence that TrekBBS meets the notability standards, in particular an independent source making significant reference to/commentary upon the site. So far, the strongest contention I've seen for notability is the TrekBBS-UGO connection, i.e. #3 under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>: site is published by well known folks independent from site's creators. Is UGO well known? --<a href="../../../e/e/m/User%7EEEMeltonIV_6dc8.html" title="User:EEMeltonIV">EEMeltonIV</a> 00:21, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
