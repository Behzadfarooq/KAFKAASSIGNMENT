<li><b>M/K</b> Difficult one, but I don't think these things are here gratuitously - if someone wants to WRITE about sh-t, then someone out there is like to want to READ about it.

<li><b>Keep</b> --- I'm guessing that Wahoofive thinks that a large number of hits is meaningless because both "contemporary" and "classical" are common words. However. If you search <i>as a phrase</i>, you still get over 100,000 hits, and many seem to describe a genre. Also if you Google for the individual composers described in the article, you will find hundreds of articles for each one describing them as "contemporary classical". ----<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 01:54, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><strike><b>Strong Keep</b></strike> (vote changed to <b>Merge</b>) - I fail to understand your reasoning that googling is useless.

<li><b>Strong delete</b>: The reason the Google test is irrelevant is that "contemporary" as an adjective applied to "Classical" as an adjective is going to generation bazillions of hits for "contemporary recording of classical music" and "contemporary classical recording," etc. I.e. it's not going to reveal a <i>genre.</i> So that's that. As for the reason for deletion, the term is an oxymoron. See <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_music.html" title="Classical music">Classical music</a>: the term refers to a particular type of serious music, not all serious music. I.e. there is <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romantic_music.html" title="Romantic music">Romantic music</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baroque_music.html" title="Baroque music">Baroque music</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_music.html" title="Classical music">Classical music</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minimalist_music.html" title="Minimalist music">minimalist music</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serialist_music.html" title="Serialist music">serialist music</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstract_music.html" title="Abstract music">abstract music</a>, etc., all of which are called, by people who don't study music, "classical music." So, is there a neo-Classicism movement underway right now that is a genre? If so, it has entirely escaped the notice of the music press. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:35, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>If you'd added more narrative, I might have changed my vote. But you just added a lot of scores. In my opinion, that makes the article even less useful.

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 15 "delete" votes, 8 "keep" votes (9 anonymous or very new user's votes were discounted) and 3 comments that were too ambiguous to call.</p>
<p>Reviewing the content and the comments below, I find 1) an argument that the article is lexical rather than encyclopedic and 2) an argument that <i>if verified</i>, the contents of the article might form the basis for a new article at the title ROFL Attack. (An article by that title does now exist but was apparently created by cut-and-paste during the discussion period.) The facts supporting the first argument were never disputed. The "keep" voters instead expressed their dissent with the policy that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a dictionary and argued to keep despite the policy. (Wikipedia has an admittedly inconsistent precedent on that question.)</p>
<p>I find the content related to the word and it's derivation to be both <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">unverified</a> and more appropriate to Wiktionary than to Wikipedia and hence deletable. However, because content from this article was used to create a separate article, I am going to exercise my discretion to call this decision as a "keep as redirect" in order to preserve the attribution history. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 00:06, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I did the same thing with Notable lines in the Star Wars series (saving "I have a bad feeling about this" from otherwise certain doom). The difference is that I've tried to show with each line listed in that article why it's notable.

<li>They are together if they have become an animation genre. As I said, this is predicated on whether this one web site is the sum-total of the animation genre.

If somebody who know more about gay issues than I do could track down that source and add it to the article, it would push <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friend_of_Dorothy_d2f0.html" title="Friend of Dorothy">Friend of Dorothy</a> over the dicdef/article boundary.----<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 01:43, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have to disagree. The gay icon aspect of Judy Garland is only one part of the <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friend_of_Dorothy_d2f0.html" title="Friend of Dorothy">Friend of Dorothy</a> phenomenon. The key point is that there was a time not so long ago when gay people needed to talk to one another using code. This was one of the common codes in the 50's and 60's and the article has a lot of potential to grow. It's ironic that this is coming up for VfD during GLBT history month.<a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobycat_72d8.html" title="User:Tobycat">Tobycat</a> 04:32, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ditto TobyCat. Although every hobby today might call itself a "subculture", Garland was truly a subterrarean icon. The term passed into common language only long after Garland death, once the political climate changed, so including that explanation in her bio-article would grossly distort the historical development of the term. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 04:59, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Recently Danny has commented in his blog on how Google had curiously demoted his site in their search rankings so that even if you search specifically on the name of his site the actual site appears well down in the returned results. I speculate that a reader of Danny's blog may have thought that adding an entry to Wikipedia on Danny with links to his site may positively affect its Google ranking. Notice I am certainly <b>not</b> suggesting that Danny did this or would condone adding material to Wikipedia for this purpose. <a href="../../../o/s/k/User%7EOska_3d36.html" title="User:Oska">Oska</a> 00:12, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually, my current best theory as to why Google thinks my web sites are spam is that lots of spammers/scrapers have created junk pages with links to my pages on them. And part of that problem comes from having so many Open Directory entries...

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is, to anyone with even a basic knowledge of physics, patent nonsense. Having just completed a physics course which included some quantum theory, I have to say that this "discovery" throws much of what we know about matter entirely out the window (see gravity comment above) and at the same time has absolutely zero outside validation of his results. It is not being taken seriously by the scientific community. It shouldn't be.<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a> 20:27, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>If you want to delete this article because it isn't peer reviewed, then I suppose I can understand that. However, just because something isn't peer reviewed doesn't automagically mean it's incorrect. So if the information can be deemed correct, why not keep it? Mr. Hudson's work does indeed throw a lot of what we 'knew' about matter completely out the window. As such, I challenge you to listen to his lectures and see if it doesn't make sense.<br />
Now, regarding the 4/9ths gravity claim: Hal Puthoff theorized that gravity is an illusion cause by matter interacting with the space around it. He did some math and came up with the 4/9ths figure. This was in the 70s I believe. Now if you look at the patent link so graciously provided by pstudier, you will see about 12 Thermogravimetric analysis graphs about halfway down. They chart relative weight as a function of temperature. Take a look at those. There is obviously something anomalous happening.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe1physicist_cf45.html" title="User:The1physicist">the1physicist</a> 22:09, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This may be argued to be a deletable article on a variety of grounds, but it isn't patent nonsense so I've restored pending closing of this discussion. At worst it's original research--but as I found no problem finding independent references to the Hudson claims it isn't that either. It's somewhat POV and lacks references for one or two of its claims, which are presented as fact rather than speculation. If we can write perfectly good articles about the likes of <a href="../../../e/-/m/E-meter.html" title="E-meter">E-meter</a> and <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenu.html" title="Xenu">Xenu</a>, I don't think ORME's will present any problem. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 03:51, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm arguing to keep on the grounds that it <i>is</i> verifiable and obviously isn't patent nonsense (it's a crank theory, which would come under OR if not widely circulated).

<li>Does it really matter whether the <a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxonomy.html" title="Taxonomy">taxonomy</a> of a crank theory is Original Research or Patent Nonsense?

<li>Yes it does matter. The former is not a deletion criterion, the latter is. Patent nonsense would be basically something that doesn't even consist of coherent sentences in English.

<li>Being new to this process, I'm kind of curious as to why the lecture links were removed. Someone mentioned it could be advertising, but what is being advertised? If I was trying to increase that site's traffic, I would've linked to that site instead of directly to the audio files. I'm not trying to be a nuisance or anything, but I think further discussion of the validity of ORMEs/Mr. Hudson's claims would necessitate the restoration of the links. Also, regarding peer review, in his lectures Mr. Hudson references (several times) VERY similar research to his own being published in Physical Review C.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe1physicist_cf45.html" title="User:The1physicist">the1physicist</a> 06:11, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>The lectures are not peer-reviewed. He can say what he likes in them. That's the problem.

<li>No, I didn't say they were. I said that there is indeed peer reviewed research being done on VERY similar topics to his.

<p>non-notable: 11 googles. Possible neologism combining bacteria and economics, but is it an excepted field of knowledge?

<li>It's not a hoax. The <a href="../../../-/o/m/-omics.html" title="-omics">-omics</a> is a serious development in biology relating to holistic approaches to genetics, biochemistry etc. This therefore refers to the omics of bacteria, which could have an article written about it, but this is probably not it. There are many more hits for bacterial proteomics and even more for bacterial genomics. My best guess is <b>redirect</b> somewhere, probably <a href="../../../-/o/m/-omics.html" title="-omics">-omics</a>. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 11:07, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, then <b>autoclave</b>. As a biologist, I can emphatically state that we don't need another -omics word. It's as bad as the recent epidemic of -izzle suffixes in pop culture. On a more serious note, it only pulls eight unique Google hits, and only one scholar.google.com hit (where it was in "scare quotes" in a conference program, since even the group that used it knew it was a neologism.) There are no references for it on PubMed. This is a wannabe buzzword that just hasn't gotten its big break.

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was <b>delete as an unresolved copyright violation</b>. Please note that the content is sourced right in the article as taken from Obsidian Forum Community, a site which is clearly marked as copyrighted. No one came forward during the discussion period with any claim or evidence that this content is allowable under any of the fair use exceptions.</p>
<p>I will, however, note that no concensus was reached on whether there ought to ever be an article on this topic. There was a clear concensus against keeping this as a stand-alone article. The majority opinion (but short of concensus) was to merge any salvagable material into <a href="../../../k/n/i/Star_Wars%7E_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_II%7E_The_Sith_Lords_a2c1.html" title="Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</a>. I have not carried out that merge because the only non-copyvio content I saw already appeared to be well-included in the target article. This decision should not be considered precedent if a non-copyvio article is created on this topic. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 20:58, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I will content myself with no more than two simple assertions: this is not original: paradigmatic analysis has been common in semiotics for years; and the fact that Google does not hit the phrase in the title, is hardly relevant to determining whether this is notable. If that were the criterion, many topics covered predominantly in the hard copy or limited internet access academic world would never gain exposure in the wider world. It amuses me that the opinions of a student seem to have triggered this. I have offered to retitle, to merge the material or simply to let him re-edit. Rather than negotiate, this page has been posted for deletion. Well, since humility is required, I vote for deletion immediately and let's all get on with something else more important. -<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid91_7ed4.html" title="User:David91">David91</a> 07:02, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I was not able to verify the source of the article from my university or public library. It was already clear the title does not represent whatever subject it describes (seemingly "semiotic aesthetics") but the one source that is referenced is also of questionable representability. --<a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlac_7f30.html" title="User:Slac">Slac</a> 14:07, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have some significant problems with this. Semiotics of ideal beauty? Excuse me, but semiotics presupposes a transhistorical grammar of signs, and yet everything in the article is about historical conditioning of aesthetics. Also, the writing is in lecture format, still, so that makes it more of a presentation and original research than it should be. The best idea might be to reduce the material and merge it to <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semiotics.html" title="Semiotics">semiotics</a> ("Semiotics in aesthetics"]] or <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beauty.html" title="Beauty">beauty</a> ("A semiotic approach"). However, it seems to me utterly hopeless. Semiotic analysis as I learned it would never ask if there is an ideal beauty, but would rather ask what the token "ideal beauty" does and how it is applied linguistically and epistemically in all cultures, and it would seek to do this by never asking if a beauty were beautiful, but merely look for all contexts of the beautiful and try to trace the structures behind those uses. I suppose my suggestion is <b>move to user page</b> and then <b>merge to appropriate topics</b> in various pieces. I simply can't see this highly, highly specialized and exceptionally narrow pursuit being a topic sought in an encyclopedia by this lemma. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:58, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>merge, rename, delete</b> — What is left over when the lecturing is removed can find a place under Ideal beauty or <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aesthetics.html" title="Aesthetics">aesthetics</a>. It is suspicious there should be "Semiotics of Ideal beauty" before and until we have a long article on "Ideal beauty" itself (see <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia_talk%7EImportance_cac4.html#Depth" title="Wikipedia talk:Importance">Wikipedia_talk:Importance#Depth</a>). "Semiotics of..." in a title should be a last resort of exporting from a really overloaded article.

<li>The biggest value of Wikipedia is where Google fails. This is exactly the case. The article gives the correct description of the term difficult to find elsewhere. The starting war between transhumanists and biocinservatives is an emerging social issue of a rapidly increasing importance.

<li>I wrote this article to share the results of my research on Transhumanism and I also like Uncle G's version better than my original. If it must be redirected, the most appropriate place would be NOT to <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyborg.html" title="Cyborg">Cyborg</a>, but to <a href="../../../p/o/s/Posthuman.html" title="Posthuman">Posthuman</a> that already refers to the term of "Participant evolution". "Cyborg" is a mere "mixture of organic and mechanical parts" and does not necessarily imply any kind of "evolution", it is only a subset of "Transhuman". However the Posthuman article already has much more information while the Transhuman article essentially just refers to it. So <a href="../../../p/o/s/Posthuman.html" title="Posthuman">Posthuman</a> would be the best redirect to right after the words "Homo sapiens", if it must be redirected. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPresscorr_d31c.html" title="User:Presscorr">Presscorr</a> 00:16, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The group is a purely educational club, teaching students the values of leadership, cooperation, and activism. Your claim of the teenages "trying to take over the world" is a ridiculous one. I'm sure the members realize that such an undertaking is on the verge of impossibility and isn't a reasonable venture. Google would not be a help, as this is the first time we've posted anything on the internet. This was to help keep in touch and continue organization while we're spread apart. We were interested to see if we would come across any similar groups in the process, as well. -kingalex456 (I hope my username doesn't further your idea of us "trying to take over the world". Alex is my first name, King being my last.)</p>

<li>No, it's just one, as I said. All of your examples would be under more rational titles than "important" for English speakers, just as List of Askmen.com's 10 most powerful men in the world should be and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_TIME_Magazine%27s_100_most_influential_people_of_the_20th_century_ee32.html" title="List of TIME Magazine's 100 most influential people of the 20th century">List of TIME Magazine's 100 most influential people of the 20th century</a> <i>already is</i>. "Important" is an absurd title for any of those. (The last one is actually about <a href="../../../l/i/s/Listed_building.html" title="Listed building">listed buildings</a>, for example, as its very title tells you.) Adjectives do not make encyclopaedia article titles. Finding web pages about other things (such as <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_heritage_site.html" title="World heritage site">world heritage sites</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Listed_building.html" title="Listed building">listed buildings</a> — both of which <i>also</i> already have their own "lists of", note) that just happen to have the word "important" in their text does not demonstrate the contrary. You're grasping at straws. There's only one way that this title should be anything other than a redirect. I've already pointed it out. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:21, 2005 Jun 12 (UTC)</li>

Only one of the lists is both (a) sourced and (b) not a substandard duplicate of an existing article, and that would be better served by being at List of Askmen.com's 10 most powerful men in the world, akin to the other list. Excise the duplicate and unsourced contents leaving that 1 list and <b>Rename</b> to List of Askmen.com's 10 most powerful men in the world, adjusting the resultant redirect from the adjective important to point to the noun importance, ready for an article there or someone to decide to write about <a href="http://www.importantrecords.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.importantrecords.com/" rel="nofollow">the record label</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:23, 2005 Jun 12 (UTC)</li>

<p>This text was created in order to push information about Laogai into the Wikipedia. However, it is a city article that should cover information about the city, this information is largely missing.

<li><b>merge</b> into an appropriate article, or perhaps <b>rewrite</b>.

<p>Hi, I'm Dawud, the guy who created this page. To merge it into "Baha'i Faith" would make that site overly long, no? It's really not possible to cover criticisms of it in less than article length.</p>
<p>On the POV thing, I do hope to be fair to all sides, and of course anybody else who feels like it can join in. As you can see I've just started. I'm not sure if this format is the best--maybe somebody has a better idea...? 218.167.177.148 06:01, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)Dawud</p>

<li><b>comment</b> the problem is that it can appear an agressive attempt to criticise the religion in an article form. There is no similar page for any other religion that I've noticed. Criticisms would (in my opinion) be better in line with the text. Besides most of the arguments on the page are rather general against utopian thinking -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomhab_fa0f.html" title="User:Tomhab">Tomhab</a> 10:35, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>Tomhab, the "principles" section is more utopian than the others would be, if I (or anyone else) ever get around to writing them. (Doubtful in view of the visible momentum towards "merge or purge".) These principles are, in the main, the points emphasized by Baha'is when presenting their religion.</p>
<p>Maybe "criticisms" gives the wrong impression. Maybe "Baha'i controversies" would be better? Although that suggests intra-Baha'i discussions, and this is intended to be broader. <a href="../../../d/a/w/User%7EDawud_5c1e.html" title="User:Dawud">Dawud</a> 01:18, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Assuming that the form of voting carries on, no information needs be deleted, just merged where relevant into the other pages. I don't like the idea of controversies, because almost all of it is not controversial for Baha'is (which the title would suggest). Just for those who might consider being Baha'is, but find certain beliefs to be challenging. I've been busy at the minute so need a bit of time to re-read it all but a lot of it cuold get put on the main page in a much smaller summary. The Women on the UHJ is the most important one to mention (Baha'is don't really even understand it) and could be done in much more detail on the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_House_of_Justice_dedd.html" title="Universal House of Justice">Universal House of Justice</a> page (as well as a short amount on the main page).</dd>
<dd>Again this is just my view so needs ratification through a consensus. -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomhab_fa0f.html" title="User:Tomhab">Tomhab</a> 10:57, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't think merging with the main page is a good idea. There's simply not enough room. The Women-in-the-House issue does deserve a mention on the UHJ page, sure--but not in this form, it's just not right for that context. <a href="../../../d/a/w/User%7EDawud_5c1e.html" title="User:Dawud">Dawud</a> 11:37, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>comment</b> I view many of the "criticisms" of this page as providing interesting food for thought, though many are not in fact criticisms of the Baha'i faith at all (though they may be positions or theories that contain aspects contradictory to Baha'i belief). It doesn't necessarily make sense to include these on this page. That having been said, deleting the page seems like a bad idea to me. Some parts of the page pertain directly to the Baha'i faith and should not disappear altogether; incorporating these parts into other pages seems to me a recipe for their eventual extinction. One of the Baha'i religion's great strengths is its tolerance of a variety of opinions; I think that properly edited this page has something valuable to offer. -- Louigi 19:10, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> The page is great! Keep the page as it is! The title, content all are OK. It gives people who want to rant on an opportunity to do it, which keeps them off the main page. People reading the principles are smart enough to notice the utopian nature of the Faith's beliefs, and don't need any of this information in an introductory reading. External criticism of the Faith is something that Abdu'l Baha prayed for! And women were barred from the Guardianship as well as the House of Justice!

<li><b>Keep</b>. Actually I was thinking about expanding this recently, so perhaps it's lucky I didn't if it's going to be deleted. This is definitely more notable than the average proposed radio station, mainly because it's on longwave. There are now only two stations broadcasting on longwave in the UK and Ireland, both run as long-range repeater services by the two countries' state broadcasters, and the only longwave-only commercial station went out of business a few years ago. The possibility of starting another one has been talked about for years now. Great controversy surrounds it because running a longwave transmitter is thought to be unprofitable and fruitless these days, and these people are trying to use <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossed_field_antenna.html" title="Crossed field antenna">some new untested kind</a>. This station has been trying to get started for quite some time and is discussed and argued about endlessly. This is much more notable than some proposed local mediumwave or FM station, for example. There are very few longwave stations in the world (see <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longwave.html" title="Longwave">the article</a>), so we should allow for the possibility that a new one might be notable before it's even started broadcasting. We should also remember that this station has a potential audience of the order of 100 million (I haven't seen the figures). If it really does never get off the ground I would probably vote to delete myself, but at the moment there appears to be a fairly reasonable chance that it will. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 17:51, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm familiar with this project too, and while I believe that it's notable within the radio industry, there are a lot of radio projects out there that never get off the ground. Does Eric Wiltsher's little Slovakian project <a href="http://www.rti.fm" class="external text" title="http://www.rti.fm" rel="nofollow">1</a> merit its own page in Wikipedia, for example? At present, I don't feel that this project has any more notability than your average RSL or pirate resurrection pipe dream. <b>Abstain</b> for now. <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmileyrepublic_1cbc.html" title="User:Smileyrepublic">Smileyrepublic</a> 16:50, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't know anything about that Slovakian one, but looking at the website it appears to be on the air and broadcasting, in which case it certainly is notable and deserves an article. I think this project is quite a lot more notable than an RSL because RSLs are confined to a small area and are ephemeral in nature. This being a project to launch a new national station, in fact not a national station but one broadcasting to several countries, on longwave as well, it seems rather more notable than a planned local station. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 19:07, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>First, there's no reason to believe that this is a genuine topic; as the article stands, at least, it's a personal essay.

<li>The text begins: "Jewish supremacism is the variety of ...". If you don't see a problem here, then try read more about difference between POV and fact. If one wants an article about a " 'theory' in some circles", the text should start, e.g., "Jewish supremacism is the term used in &lt;some circles&gt; to describe what they perceive as...". In any case, the article gives no reputable sources, hence original research. It does not matter that the term is all over google. It is not the job of wikipedian do describe something.

<li><b>Delete</b>. As it stands, the article is no more notable than an article on "Bob supremacism" would be (that being the belief among a subset of people named Bob that they are superior to those with other names). If the article were rewritten to actually discuss the topic beyond slapping two words together and defining the result, I could understand it remaining. Perhaps the people who have voted to keep this article might take a crack at editing this before deletion and creating a NPOV article that achieves this. --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDachannien_f06e.html" title="User:Dachannien">Dachannien</a> 16:01, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>This is complicated</b>. There is such a concept as "Jewish supremacy" - the <i>idea</i> that Jews believe themselves to be superior to other races. However, I've never heard of anyone other than anti-Zionist conspiracy theorists say that Jews wish to rule the world (and those folks tend to think that such domination has already been achieved). I highly doubt that even the minority of ethnocentric Jews who think they're better than everyone else want to rule over anything besides Israel. The world is, after all, rather a mess,and sternly believing that you're God's chosen for the <i>next</i> world makes this one seem unimportant by comparison. I'd say there should be an article on the peculiar nature of Jewish ethnocentrism, but the suggestion that Jews want to dominate other groups is hokum, so <b>delete</b> what's here now and start from scratch. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 06:15, 2005 Jun 15 (UTC)

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I am calling this as a "delete" in deference to the fairly well established precedent that articles about names are really dictionary entries, not encyclopedia articles. As Uncle G points out below, the exceptions are disambiguation pages, not articles about the name. Since this page only lists a single person (who by the way does not yet have an article), it does not qualify as a disambiguation page. I have elected not to transwiki the article to Wiktionary because there is not enough content to convince me that they would accept it. (The content would be "Herner is a german originated family name.")</p>
<p>This delete decision is made without prejudice if either 1) the article is re-created in Wiktionary as an article about the name or 2) the content is used to create a properly-named stub about the one person listed as an example (that content being "Janos Herner is the creator of the TimeWheel, the monument of time erected in Hungary, Europe.").</p>
<p>I am electing not to create the stub on Mr Herner merely because I can find no evidence that he would meet the recommended <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> but that is a personal decision, not a concensus VfD decision. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 21:14, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> -- I think that the "Cobra gesture" does not need it's own article. I think that somebody could add the "You're Fired" gesture to the existing Donald Trump page. Also, the so-called "Cobra gesture" was only used in season 1 of "The Apprentice". The past two seasons, Trump has used the "Pointing gun" motion. At the end of the day, I think that we could just add a comment about the "you're fired gesture" to the Donald Trump page. This page is useless and consuming space. --- Brendantait 14:01, Jun 21, 2005</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Off the bat, I'm inclined to think that as a rule of thumb, anyone who makes the FBI's Most Wanted list has gained enough notoriety to be notable enough. That said, I know that a lot of these people aren't that notable -- they're just criminals who haven't been caught. Still, at least this guy does have a catchy nickname and some notoriety... Anyway, this appears to be a copyright violation, as the text has been lifted from the FBI wanted poster linked above, so it'd have to be rewritten. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 20:59, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>In light of the comments "anything useful should be merged," I want to stress that the entry itself should be deleted, and that the acting sysop should note that almost everyone so far seems to agree about that. If there is material to merge, this means extra work for the sysop, because a merge-and-delete requires a laborious procedure to merge the history and remain GFDL-friendly, so "merge-and-delete" votes, <i>though valid,</i> are discouraged. (On reviewing this article and <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female_ejaculation.html" title="Female ejaculation">Female ejaculation</a> <b>I</b> don't see anything useful to merge. In fact this article contains POV statements that are well discussed in an NPOV way in <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female_ejaculation.html" title="Female ejaculation">Female ejaculation</a>, so my vote remains a simple delete). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> (<a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dpbsmith_96cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dpbsmith">contribs</a>) 10:18, 12 Jun 2005.</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. That sounds very odd to me. We're editors. Editing is what we do. To write off material simply because it's been misfiled strikes me as the height of laziness.

<p>There seems already to be a consensus and since I'm the author of the entry, I'll put my two cents in. Do what you will, it's of no real importance. I coined the word and felt pretty good about it. Granted, it is merely a new synonym for "Female ejaculation" but as a feminist, I wanted to give it its own name. It was concise and direct and I thought since the culture of this particular sexual act was still relatively unknown and misunderstood, this word would help draw attention and pique the curiosity of people who wished to learn.</p>
<p>When I googled the word 7 weeks ago, there were no returns. Now there are a few, mostly related to my original article, but oddly two porn sites have picked it up. Now what's more validating than that?</p>
<p>When I visited this site yesterday, I searched the word and no results were returned. However, there was a friendly invitation to create an entry for it. So, I read the rules and didn't seem to be violating any of them (I'm not making money, it wasn't gibberish) and made my entry.</p>
<p>Certainly my ego is involved in making this entry, but I don't think it's more than a healthy one. So, it's of no importance that it remains here.</p>
<p>Perhaps I will get lucky and someday the word will enter the common vernacular and it will be entered by someone else. Until then....</p>
<p>Cheers! gballsout</p>

<li>Thanks for being understanding about it. This is no big deal, I encourage you to continue to contribute, and when the word <i>does</i> enter the vernacular it will be very appropriate to have an entry about it. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:21, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't think this is an improvement at all. Almost without exception, references to Mozilla are to the current Mozilla browser, and this should be the primary topic of <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozilla.html" title="Mozilla">Mozilla</a>.

<li>The reason why you don't see a browser in <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozilla.html" title="Mozilla">Mozilla</a> is the same as that in <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netscape.html" title="Netscape">Netscape</a>. Both the word "Mozilla" and "Netscape" has been used for too many things. In fact, "Mozilla" is now turning into an adjective for Mozilla technologies and related stuffs... Also, since there will be no Mozilla 1.8, I think it is a good time to move the browser away from the Mozilla article. --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinghong_2ceb.html" title="User:Minghong">minghong</a> 06:22, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<b>Delete</b> - most of this article is patent nonsense. For example, this quote,</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The concept of a 'curved space' is somewhat logically flawed because space can be defined by the distance between two objects, which is usually by definition always given as a straight line. Mathematicians frequently try to illustrate the properties of 'curved space' through the example of a spherical (or otherwise curved) surface and the associated geometrical relationships.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, a surface is only a mathematical abstraction within the actual space."</dd>
</dl>
<p>totally ignores the work of Riemann, Lobachevsky, Einstein, and all the research since them on curved spacetimes. It is a piece of bad luck in one way that you can envision most 2-spaces pretty well (exception: the <a href="../../../k/l/e/Klein_bottle.html" title="Klein bottle">Klein bottle</a> ) by imbedding them in 3-space. It does help elementary teaching, but it gives the false impression that curved geometries can "always" be regarded as artifacts of selecting a lower dimensional space out of a higher one. That approach has not been useful. I once asked a mathematician how many dimensions of Euclidean space you would have to use to imbed a curved 4 dimensional space and I do not remember the answer, but it was <i>large</i> - I believe 8 or more. So it "helps" you to think of curved 3-surfaces as imbedded in Euclidean 3-space (so long as you do not try to detour across the unoccupied part of that 3-space) but it does not help to envision 3 and 4 dimensional curved spaces stuck in higher-dimensional flat spaces.</p>
<p>I realize that this is supposed to be an elementary discussion and evidently from the "save" votes it has made some sense to some people, but Wikipedia ought to provide a jumping off place for the more serious student, and the idea of using a straight line to connect two points on a 2-sphere and use it as the shortest path is very misleading. The shortest path is the arc of a great circle. Spherical triangles have interior angles that almost never total to two right angles, and you can find that in high school level texts on solid geometry. So it should be reasonable to expect readers of Wikipedia to understand that on the surface of a sphere, the "straight lines" are arcs of great circles, and in higher-dimensional spaces the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geodesic.html" title="Geodesic">geodesics</a> will not be related to any Euclidean metric. <a href="../../../p/d/n/User%7EPdn_a12d.html" title="User:Pdn">Pdn</a> 17:48, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>What can I do but repeat: It is very misleading to speak of a straight line cutting between two points on a sphere (as a chord) when one is describing the curved geometry of the sphere. You are jumping out of the space you are talking about, and in 3 and 4 dimensions this may require adjoining many more. The point of studying curves spaces and spacetimes is to describe ways to measure that curvature and deal with its physical effects without adjoining all sorts of additional dimensions so we can feel happier thinking of the curved space as a subset of a larger flat space. <a href="../../../p/d/n/User%7EPdn_a12d.html" title="User:Pdn">Pdn</a> 03:21, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If the article is so radically wrong, give it a major rewrite. Throwing our hands up and saying the entire thing must be deleted seems a bit drastic.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't want to rewrite it, because I do not know what to write about <i>physical space</i>. Apparently, nobody else wanted to rewrite it for more than a year. Of course, if somebody were to rewrite it and show me that there is a decent article, I'll happily change my vote, but if not, it's better to start all over again. The only part of the article that is good is the second paragraph (In everyday experience ... 180 degrees). The next two paragraphs are passable, I don't know what the section titled <i>Space-time</i> wants to say, the start of the section titled <i>Curved space-time</i> is misleading in several aspects ("[time and space] are the same thing", "[flat spacetime] is a strange intermediate state"), and the part from "The concept of a 'curved space' is logically flawed" is wrong (all IMHO, of course). -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> 12:06, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hmm. By that definition, any article which only offers up an overview of a topic and provides pointers to better understanding might as well be deleted then. Obviously that section is a wordy list of links, outlining their relevance to the topic, and is meant to serve as a pointer to readers. Also note that one of those links will be orphaned if this page is deleted. As for the article on <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_%28physics%29.html" title="Space (physics)">Space (physics)</a>, I don't think that serves any purpose that this page would. Nowhere on wikipedia is an overview of the subject of physical space given, all the information seems to be herded into seperate pools, where it stagnates. I couldn't find an area which addressed the use of space in terms of buildings and farmning, given an overview of the situation, which is something I believe is encyclopaedic. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 12:05, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. In terms of the specific topics you mention, <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture.html" title="Architecture">architecture</a> links to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_syntax.html" title="Space syntax">space syntax</a>, and <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farming.html" title="Farming">farming</a> lists a whole bunch of methods which are implicitly means of using space in farming. Of course, the space where Splash lives, space where Splash is sitting and space where Splash keeps his books articles could be merged into this one - along with every other object, philosophy, activity...that impinges on space. This article has no standalone value since everything it wishes it had said is already dealt with, implcitly or explicitly elsewhere. The Wikipedia should beware articles that attempt to say that there is a topic of standalone encylopaedic value when plainly all its value is held elsewhere - particulaly when the existence of the article implies that there is a <i>topic</i> such as 'physical space' that has such encyclopaedic value. As for the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_%28physics%29.html" title="Space (physics)">space (physics)</a> page - this page starts off trying cackhandedly to deal with space in a physics sense but doesn't have a clue - see the first comment above by PDN. If those separate pools you mention are stagnating, then they need bringing to life - but not by linkages from inane articles like this. Should just say that I don't seek a fight here, just a robust discussion. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 16:07, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The trouble I have is that, okay, the information is held elsewhere, but it's in so many different places that it's impossible to find. I mean, Spatial syntax is just gobbledygook to me. Yet if I look up an article on spce, if that info was presented in a clear manner, I might learn something. I'll be honest here, my formal education finished when I was sixteen, and that's over half a life time ago, so I am a layman in every sense, and it just makes sense to me to have a standalone article which draws all the meanings of space together, even if it points outwards for further information. I'd broadly agree that maybe it would be better located at space rather than physical space, but that's another discussion. As for PDN's comments, I'm sorry, but he lost me at spacetime. I don't even understand the gist of it, as words like geodisc and the like make no sense to me, and I can't quite grasp why a straight line isn't an arc of a circle. Yes, I think it's great that wikipedia be a tool for the serious student, but it should also be a tool for those with less ability in areas who could learn more if they weren't treated like they were idiots for not grasping a concept they were taught maybe up to fifty years ago. However, I'm also a little at sea in the physics part of the page, as well, and it would be great if someone with an academic understanding of the topic could write a layman's guide on space that didn't offend their sensibilities and made sense to a layman, because nothing on Space (physics) makes sense to me. Like I say, I'd rather see the space page be something better than a disambiguation page, more like the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time.html" title="Time">time</a> page, which seems to offer up nothing new. As for linking to space where Splash is sitting and so on, I doubt those pages would get through a VfD, and no, it probably isn't wise to cover every aspect of space, but surely some effort should be made to present information to readers in a manner better that a disambig when all the articles the disambig links to are related. Oh, and there's a link in that psychology part that'll be orphaned if it's deleted, so best keep an eye on that, and I'm well aware of when I'm in a fight as to a friendly chat, but ta. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 18:16, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Ok, I see what you mean. But my concern is that, with this kind of article on the Wikipedia, what readers will take away is the impression that there is a subject, <i>physical space</i>, which is of sufficient concern to people to justify its <i>own</i> article - standing alone from all the other entries on space-related topics. If people wanted to find out what the Wiki knows about 'space', they've got a search function that'll tell them everything it finds without creating misleading impressions (proviso: as long as this page isn't allowed to turn up!). What should probably happen is that the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space.html" title="Space">space</a> page is worked on considerably — but only as a pedogogically expanded disambig page — and this one still deleted. The <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time.html" title="Time">time</a> article makes my skin crawl marginally less than this article as a result - at least it doesn't refer to a non-existent topic. Incidentally, in trying to find an equivalent article, e.g. <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_time.html" title="Physical time">physical time</a>, I found Time: physical and eternal, which looks highly suspect to me, which is a pity since it might contain some useful contributions. Maybe. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 20:12, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

An article is not in need of fixing if everything that would go in it is already handled perfectly well elsewhere - the correct response is to expand <i>those</i> pages up to standard - not to create another poor attempt at them.

<p>[anonymous:06-11-05 5:40 est]I suppose according to the published Wikipedia Deletion policy, specifically the "Such a minor branch of a subject that it doesn't deserve an article" portion, that this is indeed a good candidate for action.</p>
<p>Here are the bones I particularly have with the article.</p>
<p>First, the ATI Radeon, model 9250 is not... I don't know, a unique product. It is a rather vague marketing designation used for Radeon based graphics cards using a certain IC that happen to fit a very broad profile. Now in and of itself, there's nothing wrong with that, but it's my opinion, that it's a poor entry to have as on it's own, rather it should be an addendum to the entry on the IC that the model 9250 is a subset of.</p>
<p>Second, I have some issues with the benchmarks cited. It's rather dangerous, in my humble opinion, to casually cite benchmarks with the addresses of websites, and I also believe that it is in poor style to just randomly quote benchmarks, rather I think that there should be a site wide policy on graphics card benchmarks.[/anonymous]</p>

In this case one article would include Radeon 8500, 8500LE, 9000 Pro, 9000, 9200, and 9250 since all of them are essentially the same chip design. --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerkut_1f38.html" title="User:Berkut">Berkut</a> 13:05, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

Your belief that someone won't read them seems to be based on the fact that you think that you, personally, would have no use for the information. Not good evidence. Moreover your invocation of the word "notable" is not right; there is no notability clause in the deletion criteria except for biographical articles. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 19:04, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>'<i>I can't see what the problem is with an article on all the electronics products ever produced</i>.' Have you any idea how much rubbish that would introduce into the Wiki? What, multiple pages dedicated to benchmarks, on every graphics card, sound card, widget, and CPU ever released? Well, while we're at it, why not put every press release ATI ever released into the WIKI as well? I've put several pages up for deletion before that were just ATI and NVIDIA press releases, and they always got delted. WIKI is not a PR vehicle for large multinational compaies. Maybe you think it is. Besides which, the article is complete nonsense, just form a technical point of view. And since a lot of the IT content is my writing, i.e. AMD, NVIDIA, ATI, etc, I know my stuff. Actually the 9250 is a re-spin of the old 8500 core, and if you wanted to write up the 9250, you would list it as a sub category on the 8500 page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</li>
</ul>
<p>My grounds for deletion is as above, and the WIKI guidelines preclude the holding of info on every electronics product ever made. That would be an indiscriminate list of information. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 21:35, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>A little <a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">WP:RPA</a> has been applied in refactoring the above comments, the sense of which I've attempted to retain.</p>
<p>You're right that press releases should be deleted from Wikipedia--they would be source documents and, subject to copyright and licensing, may be candidates for Wikipedia. You're also right that there are questions about the technical specifications of this family of cards--it owed more to marketing than technology. But those are content questions that can be dealt with by appropriate categorization and editorial content in the article.</p>
<p>While it is true that Wikipedia is not an "indiscriminate collection of information", articles on electronic devices need be no such thing, any more than articles on Shakespeare plays, Beethoven symphonies, Cities in Pennsylvania, musicians with platinum disks, or episodes of The Simpsons.</p>
<p>YOu ask "can I kindly suggest [that the creator of this article] enhance the exisiting Radeon page, as thats the present location for detail on ATI cards" Well it was up to you to do that when you encountered this article--just merge and redirect. Instead of which you put it up for deletion, thus raising the question of whether this information is completely worthless. May I suggest that perhaps it is not. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 21:52, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, it clearly should be deleted from WIKI. I was just trying to point out plenty of other WIKIs now exist, and if you wanted detailed benchmarks and spec sheets on EVERY ELECTRONICS PRODUCT EVER MANUFACTURED, WIKINERDS is the forum for you. They welcome it. The thing is, its people like me who wrote a lot of the IT content in the WIKI, and now some guys come in late in the day, and start adding poor quality material. Well, I'm not having it. I've not written this much content, to see the IT section of WIKI reduced to nonsense, recycled press releases, and page after page of uninformative data sheets. I mean, not to be boring, but the 9250 is just a re-spin of the 8500 core. If someone wanted to write up the 9250 they'd have started an 8500 page, and stuck the 9250 at the bottom of it. Its not even a logical presentation.

<li><b>Delete</b> Vanity article likely created by Mr. Savage's descendant. I believe it was speedied twice before it got to its current form.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I removed the POV. Amiga games of the late 1980s, particularly the Amiga version of Lemmings, used to be streets ahead of the IBM-style PCs of the time.

<li>The list is for Amiga game music, but for the best part this is just a list of a few Amiga games. And no matter how good Lemmings was, thats nothing to do with music. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 00:27, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>To clarify, I mean the music of the Amiga versions of games was better. PC sound wasn't really standardized at the time whereas Amigas came with a pretty good 8-bit wave player built-in. The music for the Amiga version of Lemmings *made* the game. Other Amiga games that were noted for their music (sometimes the music was far better than the game) were Beast, Elf and Toki. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 01:33, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Have you "removed the POV"? All that's happened is you've removed the line where it says "this is the particularly good music", it's still the same selective list as before, of select music in a few select games which the author of the list viewed as good, and although it doesn't say it anymore, it still is just that.

I boldly assume that this list would coincide with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Amiga_games_1cd7.html" title="List of Amiga games">List of Amiga games</a> and therefore should be merged into that; if not then List of Amiga games without music would be a more informative article. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbor_06ec.html" title="User:Arbor">Arbor</a> 12:56, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think this kind of lists are very important. Why? Because if somebody is interest in game music, it may be a hard task to find new interesting songs. If you want to find new good amiga (or other format) songs, you do not find a list like this from the Internet (there are some charts for C64 and NES but not for PC or Amiga or some smaller machines). So Wikipedia can offer a list that gives good ideas for anybody interested in this kind of music. Without this list a person is quite lost since there are so many games and it is hard to know which ones might have interesting music. There is a danger of subjectivity in this list, since anybody can add his personal favorites. But with most of titles we can see, that they contain a music of relatively high quality and thus the problem cannot be so serious (the list is much better as it is now than no list at all) --User:Jarkka Saariluoma 15:24, 22 Jun 2005 (GTK+2)</li>

<p>Seems like vanity to me. Short article, person in question only gets 18 hits on google (most relating to someone at a university, and to a pool club).

<dd>Looks like a consistent enough article - the chap who googles up is at Balliol &amp; the Oxford theoretical physics centre, late of Pembroke Cambridge, entry 1999, which would mean he'd be ending year two or three of his PhD now. One paper published, which is most certainly theoretical physics (you can tell, as I don't know what half the words mean...). Note that the claim isn't that he's the first physicist from there; it's that he's the first physicist at that college from there.</dd>
