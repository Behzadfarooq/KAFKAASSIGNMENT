It is obvious to me now that the QC author's intent with the phrase was "<i>SARLACC</i> Pit of Platonic Frustration", and he was not making up a word "sariacc"... I am now going to go hide in a dark place, and lick the bleeding, torn holes in my self-esteem, received from the vicious and savage 'tongue-scourging' my attempt at a "Request Article" received. If I had known that Wikipedia editors and administrators were this bloodthirsty, brutal, and maliciously vindictive, I <b>never</b> would have submitted the request in the first place. Now I have learned my lesson well: Stay '<b>AWAY'</b> from Wikipedia, and never soil the pristine cyberspace of Wiki with my detestable and malignant presence again. To the Wikipedia Adminitrators: I recommend, to prevent such obviously abhorrant and disgusting "non-Articles" from appearing in the future, <i>please</i> change the "put up a request for it" link on the <b>Search</b>:<b>No page with that title exists</b> page to *not* point to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requested_articles|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requested_articles|" rel="nofollow">"Wikipedia:Requested articles"</a> page. This will prevent such droogs and drubs like myself from dirty-ing the unsullied expanse of Wikipedia with deplorable "non-Articles" like my "definition of Sariacc" request. Thank you.

<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. Reasoning as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discounted are (from the bottom up, just because that's how I did it):</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The anon</li>
<li>werty8473, since that username never edited the page and the IP associated with that edit has not edited werty8472's userpage, so this edit was effectively by an anon. Sorry.</li>
<li>Headcase88, too new</li>
<li>Ewlyahoocom 30th edit, new, <i>and</i> this is their only edit to Wikipedia: space</li>
<li>VC3 (Vcthree), user's only edit</li>
<li>Orioneight, user's 6th and 7th edits</li>
<li>Spriggo, only edit</li>
</ol>
<p>Nearly discount are "Last Malthusian" and "I kant spel", but I kant spel is the nominator so, imo, gets a free comment irrespective of newness. Last Malthusian had only been here a week at the time of entering this discussion which is short but not hypermegashort.</p>
<p>On the raw numbers, then, I count 18d, 10k, 1m. It is unclear if Natejji77's conditioning is activated one way or the other, but considering the addition of some referencing, it might lean towards a keep. The problems, specifically NPOV and OR, cited by the deleters are very serious in this article, despite the (rather thin) referencing carried out. The enthusiasm of the keepers often stems largely from "but other articles with different titles and different subjects are still around" which is rarely a useful comparison since we are talking about <i>this</i> article, not the others. So I find the deleters more persausive than the keepers by a fairly wide margin. However, the raw numbers are somewhat below two-thirds. Since there is a lot of participation here, even dropping those listed above, I'd expect a consensus to be fairly clear: the quantity of comments should see to that. Since we're below the minimum guideline and the consensus is hard to determine, I'm going to call a no consensus.</p>
<p>I do not think this AfD should be considered binding if, in future, someone wants to renominate this on the basis of lack of references and NPOV if those problems have not been addressed. They are key parts of writing an encyclopedia, and trump anyone's loving enthusiasm for an article they do not plan to contribute to. For future reference then, note the title of the article: it is not "games that someone rated with 1/10", but "games considered the worst ever" and it is <i>that</i> that needs sources citing. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 21:01, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Delete: <i>Inherently POV</i> list. For whatever it's worth, I felt the same way about the "50 Worst Films" list, and <i>that one was a report on Medved's list/book.</i> The passive voice "considered" is way too wiggly, and the contents are unreferenced. (I think Jarts was the worst game ever. It involved throwing weighted lawn darts at a circle and the neighbor kids. This article, though, seems confined to computer video games and video game system games.

<li><b>Delete</b> as inherently NPOV, until such time as there is some official body that determines these things.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I liked the list of the films considered the worst ever, and don't believe such a list is inherently POV. Saying that a man, film or game is universally considered 'bad' is not POV, and by extension a list of such people, films or games is not POV either, as long as it's sourced like anything else. Consequently I believe there is room for a 'worst games ever' list.

<li>Clear <b>delete</b>. I cannot see how this list (and that title) could ever be written with a NPOV. The suggestions that it might be okay if the claims are sourced to external reviewers seem to me commendable for their concern for good references, but rather miss the point. Let's say you have game X under consideration, and you find 4 reviewers who say "X is the worst game in the world." Being a good WPn, you also find a source for a different view; this one says "X is certainly not the best game ever, but I felt it's pretty good; it's at least a reasonable buy." Like most things in life, there are gradations of views about games. So would you or would you not place X under a title that said "Games considered the worst ever"? There is no way one can do this in an NPOV fashion; for the list to exist, you'd have to take sides, either for or against. That is to say, lists like this are an <i><b>inherently non-NPOV construct</b></i>. One cannot treat the subject in a fair, neutral manner (like one may be able to do in an <i>article</i> about a subject, for example), because the mere act of placing the game in the list (or deciding not to) is a non-neutral action (and that, you will notice, is because the <i>title</i> is a judgement). The attempt to soften this by adding "generally" to the title is spine-tingling in the assumptions it makes over what the majority may say about the minority. As an illustrative exercise, try populating the list Countries considered the worst ever in an NPOV manner. (Add "generally considered..." if you wish). Lists like this are very damaging to WP, and I hope they do not become prevalent.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">encephalon</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#606060">έγκέφαλος</font></a>&#160; 16:02:58, 2005-09-09 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There are some games created that are universally loathed; games that have been for years the punchline of jokes about bad games. In some cases, the fallout in the gaming community alone is enough to merit a game's discrediting - <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Smart_5ab0.html" title="Derek Smart">Derek Smart</a> instigated one of the largest flamewars in the history of the Internet by proclaiming the greatness of his game, promising the impossible, and eventually releasing a half-finished game. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Romero_710b.html" title="John Romero">John Romero</a> did something similar with his advertisement, in which he threw down the proverbial gauntlet only to wield <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daikatana.html" title="Daikatana">Daikatana</a> as his weapon. Other games truly have zero redeeming qualities - In <a href="../../../o/v/e/Big_Rigs%7E_Over_the_Road_Racing_ae9a.html" title="Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing">Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing</a>, the game is more akin to an exceptionally poorly-done tech demo than a game. Some were created half-heartedly for corporate reasons; <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaq-Fu_e451.html" title="Shaq-Fu">Shaq-Fu</a> began life as an awful fighting game not planned for release that the developers put out just to use the Shaq endorsement. If you want me to, I can find dozens of references from reviewers about games, and point to all sorts of "Worst Ever" lists such as Gamespy's (featuring Action 52, Custer's Revenge, and Bebe's Kids). There are also GameFAQs review pages, where some games have dozens of 1/10 and 2/10 reviews. On top of that, gamerankings.com takes an average score from a number of sites; games with very low scores on that site can very easily be considered awful. On a side note, some lists really should be ignored; previously, many of this article's entries came from Seanbaby's list, which while humorous is a very poor listing of bad games. While this article could in theory be abused, with people saying "Game X is terrible, and should be listed!" despite that game's known quality, it is mostly here for games that are mind-boggingly terrible. All mediums of entertainment have their bottoms of the proverbial barrels; television had Turn-On and movies had Plan Nine from Outer Space - and Wikipedia has lists for all these media. There's no reason gaming should not have a similar one. Therefore, I strongly vote to <b>keep</b> this article. Just give me time to get citations.Dariustriplet 19:35, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, as long as each entry is <b>sourced</b> adaquately ala the movie page. Encaphelon, note that there are some games which indeed are regarded as truly horrible by every single reviewer in print and reporting a POV is not the same as endorsing it. Also "[Barbie House Adventure]] was featured in a segment on terrible games on X-Play. It is a game where you play as Barbie and ride horses and features the line, "You're running out of trust on the friendship meter!""

<li><i>...some games which indeed are regarded as truly horrible by every single reviewer...</i> Hi Sdedeo, thanks for commenting. Your point is a very fair one. The issue for me I suppose is in the reliability of such claims. I admit to taking <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> rather seriously, and so titles and lists like these quickly raise alarm bells. A neutral way to treat these claims is to note them in articles (you could say "X has recieved many poor reviews [ref1,2,3,4,5] which pan it for so and so reasons"). By placing them in a list with the above title, however, you are taking the POV of the reviewers you cite. Is there a national or international organization dedicated to appraising games objectively? If so, and there is no violation of copyright, starting a list along those lines may be acceptable, as MCB suggests. Even so this is a stretch, unless this organization collates review data from every single source, world wide (much like the way the <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cochrane_Collaboration_f662.html" title="Cochrane Collaboration">Cochrane Collaboration</a> collates medical trial data from every single available source). Placing these claims in articles however avoids all the NPOV problems, and is a much better way of recording that information in an encyclopedia.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">encephalon</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#606060">έγκέφαλος</font></a>&#160; 08:45:43, 2005-09-10 (UTC)</li>

<li>Encephalon, the closest thing in gaming to a worldwide collection of reviews is GameRankings. As an example, the GameRankings Big Rigs page (<a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/919220.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/919220.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/919220.asp</a>) lists many sites giving the game 1/10 and such as reviews, with links to said reviews. While it's not an "official" source, it's the closest thing in gaming. Dariustriplet 04:59, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Dariustriplet, thank you for providing that link. I appreciate what you're trying to do, I really do. (If the List is kept, I hope that at least this sort of change will be made to it). I remain unpersuaded, however, that the List as constructed is of a NPOV (I've explained why I believe so above). This website page contains links to just 6 reviews; it is quite apparent that this is not a systematic assessment of the product (this must be a fraction of a percent of the available reviews). And this is the closest thing. If you wish to start a list along the lines of MCB's suggestion, using this website's data and an appropriate title, there may be something to it (although I strongly suspect copyright difficulties), but otherwise the construct is not NPOV, in my humble opinion. There's a good reason why you'll never find this list in a paperless <i>Britannica</i>. best wishes—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">encephalon</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#606060">έγκέφαλος</font></a>&#160; 19:46:16, 2005-09-11 (UTC)</li>

<li>Encephalon, thanks for the support. I can understand your issue with the lack of reviews for games; while a movie may be reviewed by every media outlet in a market, games only have five or six professional reviews at most. For older games such as <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_52.html" title="Action 52">Action 52</a>, there simply are no online professional reviews. Sites like [www.gamefaqs.com] do have amateur reviews, and while a conclusion can somewhat be drawn from those, it should be taken with a grain of salt (a 4/10 review of Big Rigs exists, with the author basing the score on the game's hilarity). For games lacking professional reviews, and thus having near-impossible citations, NPOV will always be an issue as games such as Action 52 and <a href="../../../c/u/s/Custer%27s_Revenge_e8e7.html" title="Custer's Revenge">Custer's Revenge</a> - while universally regarded as awful - have no official reviews. The closest thing I can think of off-hand would be GameSpy's <a href="http://archive.gamespy.com/top10/december02/shame/index.shtml" class="external text" title="http://archive.gamespy.com/top10/december02/shame/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">Ten Most Shameful Games of All Time</a>, or perhaps an article from GameSpy's sister site [www.classicgaming.com]).

<li><b>Keep</b>- It is difficult if not impossible when there is a story of this magnitude to grasp the enormity of it all at once. In any event of this scale, the stories that often hit home the most, and give the best perspective about what the people who lived through it endured are the stories that bring home the individual and personal tragedies and hardships such as this story does. It is unlikely that people will remember exactly how many people lived through the horrors of the Superdome, or the precise number of buildings destroyed, or even the total of how much money was lost. While those kinds of “metrics” might well be important, they don’t tell the story of the people who lived through the disaster. This is one example of a story that does.</li>

<li>Keep, partly because I'm in an inclusionist mood, partly because Geogre's reasoning annoys me, since the whole notability of the dog is based on what has already happened, i.e. this news report this article cites—nothing to do with a "crystal ball" whatsoever. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:13, 9 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The "Crystal ball" was about whether this particular media belch will still be noticed 6 weeks from now or 6 months from now. Let's establish just how widely discussed this dog is, then realize that in-the-news is not part of article space. This is just a soap bubble, at this point -- some red herring the media chased. When it establishes staying power, it would be useful to document it. There hasn't been enough time for it to establish itself yet, and we're not in the business of predicting which submania of the news services will last and which will not. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:04, 9 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But by voting to delete, you are putting yourself in that business. Right? The correct policy to follow if you don't want to be in that business is to let someone make the article if they want, and re-evaluate later. Everyone's notability changes over time. This is a living encyclopedia, and if Snowball is forgotten in a year, delete the article at that point. As you say, it's silly for us to try to predict notability. <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 23:34, 9 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I should point out that this is not the general understanding of notability. We generally view notability as independent of the passing of time; something can't be notable one day and non-notable the next. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:46, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> I was surprised and pleased when I put "Snowball" into Yahoo search and found a link to Wikipedia plus a nice list of links. Snowball is the 'poster dog' for all the animals separated from their families and left behind to suffer and die. It's wrong, it's inhumane and traumatic. Many people died rather than leave their pets in New Orleans and along the Gulf coast. We need legistlation and new rules in place, so this entry will show continuing interest in the topic.

<li>Delete: A scenester from the good old days, but is a Geogre's Law failure (lower case surname), has no indication of any actual <i>recordings</i> done by him. The context listed is all legitimate, so far as I know, but we're left with the question begged of "so what?" Knowing those folks, living near other folks, jamming here and there...makes for great cocktail party banter, but not encyclopedic relevance. The other claim is that he ran the first BBS in Queens in 1990. That's <i>possible,</i> but it's highly doubtful, as I was on BBS's in lowly Durham, NC in 1990. I'm surprised if Queens had none until that year, when there were scores in Raleigh/Durham at the crack of 1990. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:01, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not being snarky, but could one of those who knows this other information please <i>add it to the article?</i> I assess articles solely by what it written, and the sorts of information that would have kept me from voting to delete simply were not present. One of the fallacies of VfD-cleanup is that we end up with people doing research, finding information, and voting keep, but the additional information doesn't always end up in the article. This is, in fact, why I insist on voting for the article, not the topic: if we all vote keep based on the article that <i>could</i> be written, then we end up leaving a subpar article in place. If folks go to the trouble of coming up with additional information, they have only to put it into the article, even in the crudest way, if they're strapped for time or disinclined to write. Again, this is not meant to be a personal attack or insult, but when VfD is over 150 articles a day, voting on a reading of the articles is difficult enough; voting on the invisible other articles is impossible, at least for me. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:11, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I find the responses of several of the keep voters frustrating. "Why are we clogging up Vfd", "no need to keep voting", "article has survived a previous vote for deletion- no more need be said". Guys, Wikipedia is an evolving leviathan- as we go forward, there is nothing to say that old rulings can't be changed. <i>There is no Double Jeopardy clause on Wikipedia</i>.

<li>I agree, adopting this as a norm encourages "I didn't like the last AfD, so I'll try until I get a result I like." This is a dangerous precedent to set, since there are many people with axes to grid who are more persistent than others trying to stop them.

<li>There is some precedent for re-nominating articles that were kept based on low-turnout votes. Six people voted in the original VfD (4 keep, 1 delete, 1 merge/redirect - oddly the nominator abstained).

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. At least a few of the deleters say "unless", and Uncle G's research seems to have convinced a couple of them sufficiently to change their opinion. Some still remain as deletes, although some usages etc have been added to the article. The rewrite, the changed opinions and the fact that, on the numbers, we're below the popular two-thirds level (giving the author a presumed 'keep', seeing as they have worked on the article in light of the AfD), leads me to a no consensus. I could count the merges with the deletes and declare a merge, but the merge doesn't have enough support itself for me to prepared to do that as part of this closure: it can be done by someone else if they like, though. The original author should be warned in the strongest possible terms against making experimental articles, and against using that as an excuse in AfD. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 21:25, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is a tricky one.
<p>Certainly the handrail exists, and certainly it is of some note within the skateboarding community, going by the number of message board posts talking about it that come up in various Google Web searches. (Given that there are various other things called "El Toro", and given that skateboarders tend to communicate in their own argot rather than in English, as exemplified somewhat in this very article, this is quite difficult to search for.) The difficulty is exactly how noteworthy it is in the world of skateboarding.</p>
<p>The message board posts, from as far afield as skateboarding web sites in New Zealand, refer to the rail as "famous". Moreover, research turned up several interviews with skateboarders by their fans, where the fans breathlessly posed questions such as "Are you going to do El Toro?", "Have you ever done El Toro?" and the like (<a href="http://www.emericaskate.com/more/leoblab/" class="external text" title="http://www.emericaskate.com/more/leoblab/" rel="nofollow">example</a> <a href="http://www.emericaskate.com/more/andrewblab/" class="external text" title="http://www.emericaskate.com/more/andrewblab/" rel="nofollow">example</a>) implying that this isn't just any old site for skateboarding.</p>
<p>The list of people who have performed tricks there appears, from research, <i>not</i> to be merely a random list of skateboarders. It is a list of people who have performed tricks on the rail in published skateboarding videos. Searching turns up numerous mentions of a series of "411" videos, but the details are not yet clear without further research. It's unfortunately somewhat tricky to source. (The best source that Google Web turns up is a web site that is currently unreachable from here because of a stupid IP routing table error at 67.19.255.62.)</p>
<p>Currently, therefore, I'm at <b>Weak Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:34:55, 2005-09-09 (UTC)</p>

<li>The New Zealand skateboarding web site changed its web server software after Google's spider indexed it, breaking the hyperlinks that Google Web gives. I've now found out how the web site has changed its URLs.

<li>Okay, I initially made this page to test out the wikipedia process. I knew how poorly written it was, what with the part about not knowing someone's name and quoting a friend of mine, also incorporating my opinion into the article earlier. However, I assure you it is an important landmark for skateboarding, comparable to Wrigley Field or other sports landmarks. Just because you may not care about a particular subject does not make it worthless. Isn't wikipedia devoted to providing information about obscure topics?

<p>I imagine there will be some opposition to this afd, but I nominated it because it gets about 1100 Google hits.

<li>Actually, I believe it goes back at least to the '80s and alt.sex.bondage, but I want to stress to others that these references are for verification; the term is not a Usenet neologism, but has existed in the real-world BDSM community for several decades.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is a term refering to a BSDM sub-culture. I've heard this outside the Wikipedia arena many years before WP even existed, so I'm not sure neologism is the correct term for this. That having been said, the reasons being cited for keeping this article are rather weak. That this text was copied is no reason to keep it. The examples from soc.subculture.bondage-bdsm are a start in establishing this term as one of notability. I'd say the article could stand a cleanup if it survives. Though I tend to lean Keep, no vote for now.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:19, 9 September 2005 (UTC)--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:19, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It is not original research, evidently, since it is a list of facts.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Ladies and gentlemen: this PhD lady, together with Derek Croxton, is one of the two people that most know about the Congress of Westphalia, one of the most important congresses of History. For those familiar with International Relations literature, the Congress/Peace/Treaty of Westphalia is cited in practically every single text, it´s practically a cliché.

<dd><b>Response</b>: I've clearly lost this argument, so consider this a parthian shot. First, I reject the idea that the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Westphalia_9706.html" title="Treaty of Westphalia">Treaty of Westphalia</a> constitutes its own sub-specialty. <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirty_Years_War_9ad9.html" title="Thirty Years War">Thirty Years War</a>, yes. The Westphalian peace treaty (or treaties really), no. Second, the authority of this work is grossly overstated. I could accept your view if you were citing <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Bonney_887f.html" title="Richard Bonney">Richard Bonney</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Parker_1ff9.html" title="Geoffrey Parker">Geoffrey Parker</a>, <a href="../../../c/2E/_/C._V._Wedgwood_52e4.html" title="C. V. Wedgwood">C. V. Wedgwood</a>, even Ronald Asch, and that's assuming you wish to limit yourself to English-language material. But this is a reference work; the authorship is therefore not notable. Moreover, as to your further claim, Amazon returns no reviews and a mere six citations for this academic treatise, which has a sales rank of #1,567,518; by contrast, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Parker_1ff9.html" title="Geoffrey Parker">Geoffrey Parker</a>'s (ed) survey enjoys 121 citations and nine customer reviews, despite its (comparatively impressive) rank of #582,194. You will find similar results from JSTOR, if you have access. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Roberts_1eb3.html" title="Michael Roberts">Michael Roberts</a>, Cristopher Friedrichs as well as Parker, Bonney et al, all of whom are much more famous historians and well-known experts on the Thirty Years War, with much longer publication records, much more established reputations, much more notable university positions, deserve entries. This is a fine reference book, I am sure. But the authors, at the beginning of their careers, with an as yet insignificant publication record and no distinguishing meritorious achievements, are just not notable enough to warrant inclusion. The above comparison with Toynbee is thus a patent absurdity. More like Emma Dench Who? Exactly. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 20:47, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Re-response</b>: I´ve bought both Croxton&amp;Tischer´s and Wedgwood´s books from Amazon.com, and so far the latter has been more fruitufl, I´ll agree to you on that. However, I fail to see why the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_of_Westphalia_adc8.html" title="Peace of Westphalia">Congress(es) of Westphalia</a> can´t constitute a sub-specialty. Sure the Treaties of Utrecht and Versailles are? Not to mention Bretton Woods and the UN Charter. I do have access to <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a>, and you can see that there are both articles and reviews by Derek Croxton there =). As for the review on Amazon.com, I´m planning to write it. Maybe you plan to write Cristopher Friedrichs? You can also see that a research on the Congress(es) can´t be done without precious insights on French foreign policy (for instance). Also, both authors have made works on 17th-century history, they haven´t wrote a single book! Finally, there´s always gain to be made when one stops and thinks about overused clichés - figuring out the actual meaning of what we tirelessly repeat. From my experience as an IR undergraduate, the Peace of Westphalia is an overused cliché.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hi <a href="../../../d/o/i/User%7EDoidimais_Brasil_58b5.html" title="User:Doidimais Brasil">Doidimais Brasil</a>, as you created both pages for these authors and seem to know about them, do you think you could put up a reference to any work on <i>them</i>?

If the article was about <i>The Peace of Westphalia: A Historical Dictionary</i>, then such a source is acceptable, but you are writing biographies about <i>them</i>, as people, and so we would need sources on them to satisfy the requirements of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

<li>The most obvious native name is actually just "香港", while yours is the <i>full official title</i> that is only used in official documents and the likes. Stating just the common short form is not any kind of POV, but common sense. You're simply <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rules_lawyer.html" title="Rules lawyer">rules lawyering</a> a naming convention (not official policy), because you want a separate article for this nonsense and because you're ignoring that it's clearly mentioned in two other occasions in the same article, all visible without even scrolling down. That's not simply trying to be faithful to guidelines, but seems to me as an attempt to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">make a point</a>. Exactly what would happen if this became an exception to the convention? Would a band of rogue editors demand that X other articles follow the same format and demand a change in the naming conventions? Would representatives of the Hong Kong government angrily demand that we reinstate the way it is? No, only a few very rigid Wikipedia editors would ever care. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 10:20, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The origins of this lie in <a href="../../../h/o/n/Talk%7EHong_Kong_7b2f.html" title="Talk:Hong Kong">talk:Hong Kong</a>, but the AfD would've come about no matter what. The initial discussion was about the lead and I was trying to explain how it's not particularly constructive to slavishly follow conventions if they result in clunky leads and conclusions like the creation of separate articles just to mention differing transcriptions and etymology trivia. I've tried to discuss this at <a href="../../../p/r/o/Talk%7EPronunciation_of_Hong_Kong_a640.html" title="Talk:Pronunciation of Hong Kong">talk:pronunciation of Hong Kong</a> and by redirecting the nominated article to the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">main article</a>, but this was reverted without much attempt to discuss the matter. Furthermore, my removals of pure layman speculation concerning etymology was also reverted. What upsets me the most is that one of the pronunciation files I've recorded to be used in main articles is being used as an excuse to keep this warping of inclusion policy alive. If this goes through as an acceptable article I will have to stop recording any files like these every again, since they will only be used as just another excuse to fill Wikipedia with pointless trivia. If Hong Kong gets one, any other city where at least two major languages are spoken and has more than two sentences to describe etymology will be prime targets for further trivia-articles. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 06:53, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I made no suggestion that Hong Kong is refered to as "Xianggang" in English, so I do not know where your reservations lie. Meanwhile, you may be glad to know that <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlas.html" title="Atlas">Atlases</a> produced around the world has increasingly adopted local spellings in placenames, so Wien is actually quite often used in world maps now.

<li>It seems that this is one in a series of articles that makes the point that some Wikipedia editors hate this Romanization scheme, and other Wikipedia editors hate that Romanization scheme. Unlike other voters, I actually <i>don't</i> think this article is awfully informative. That which is educational is pretty lexical. Further, the article is misnamed, as it's not about the pronunciation of the name, but rather what the orthography in the Latin alphabet reflects. That, as I said, goes back to how some hate this scheme, some that scheme. In all, it seems like a fork.

<li>Its offensive towards the Tomatoforum and ITF. If you write an encyclopedia article, you cannot write it from a single point of view, and furthermore you cannot write it in such a way to offend people whose tastes differ from yours. While the Paradox Trifora mainly discusses politics, the Tomatoforum people mainly talk about daily events, which (admit it or not) include pornography, rude words and making fun of someone elses misfortune. But it's unfair to say that it's made out only of "massive amounts of spam, pornography, and references to gross-out humor", since many positive topics are discussed also, so it looks like the author either knows nothing about the forum he accuses or his arrogance doesn't allow him to see what he doesn't want to see.</li>

I find it highly offensive that Paradox Interactive are associated with the kind of degenerates that would operate such a forum as Tomatoland or ITF.

<li>As the author of the original article, I refuse to take responsibility for hijacks by teenagers such as the one mentioned above, nor do I see the point in listening to anonymous criticism by non-members. Paradox Entertainment is one of the most popular forums for video game developers, and especially high among European-based ones. The excuse that it is for not popular webfora is relativism at its best, and perhaps this deletion article itself needs a Neutral POV indicator, since you obviously are misinformed, JDoor. <a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESadistik_a0fb.html" title="User:Sadistik">Sadistik</a></li>

<li>Reply: I'm open to being proven wrong. I would suggest on expanding why they are notable, perhaps at the top of the band's article. There is a *vast* amount about the band in the band's article and *many* other articles, all dedicated to the same people. 95% of it fan-devotion. Now, perhaps buried in it, is an explanation of why they are notable, and what success they've acheived. I tried my best to read through this monument by fans, but only picked up that they had little play on the radio and video on tv. Also, I ask why is it necessary to list all the songs for each album both here, and on the band's article? --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 11:20, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Reply: Well, I don't subscribe to the idea, that once the band's article gets in, every other related article get's in. Some bands are so famous and influential, that individual notable songs qualify, but we don't give every song for every "articled" band an article itself. Nor does every album deserve an article. In some cases, only the band itself deserves an article. Merely being "real" is not sufficient basis for an article. I actually would be fine if wikipedia did start cataloging all published musical albums, even obscure ones. But, that should become a formal policy, applied to all, not just some. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 12:59, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>There was also a "schools project" as well. Did that mean automatic inclusion of every school?

<li>I just checked again, and found no explicit policy on inclusion of *every* album.

<li><a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is a <i>guideline</i>, not a policy. There are very few inclusion/exclusion criteria that are actual policy.

<p>I tagged this as nn-bio speedy, but the tag got removed and the nn contested by a contributor - so bringing it here. This chap's only claim to fame is that he is prolific in IRC (1,000 Googles bears that out) perhaps that's an <i>asserion</i> of notability (I don't know) but it certainly does not <i>estabilish</i> notability for me.

<li><b>Delete</b> nn-bio. I know Vid Strpic personally, and I was on the IRC channel when one of the users came up with the idea to make this article. Therefore, I can say with certainty that the article wasn't Strpic's ego-trip, and that it was a practical joke on his person instead. Also, it's a stain on Wikipedia because Wikipedia is supposed to be useful instead of being a place where people put their verbal garbage for their own amusement. The article should definitely be deleted. Stoko 17:52, 9 September 2005 (CET)</li>

<dd>POVness doesnt even apply to this case because the article is merely reporting what <i>Shias</i> believe as the truth, not what anyone else thinks what the truth is. The article is reporting <i>their</i> perspective. It's like me accusing you (Doc Glascow) of being POV for saying "I am Doc Glascow". Another example: If I say: "I, Zereshk, believe that hyenas are beautiful", you cannot accuse me of making a POV statement, because it is what <b>I</b> believe, not you, nor Mr. X, nor the Wikipedia consensus. You cannot say: "No Zereshk. You are POV. Because I know better than you what you believe in, and the world doesnt agree with you either". Follow the logic? The world's consensus opinion is not applicable here. The article clearly states that it is from <i>the Shia viewpoint</i>, not from the standard Islamic or academic or any other perspective. <b>It is an objective report of a subjective view</b>. Therefore your action of even putting this article to vote for deletion is meaningless. Wouldnt you want to know what Shias think? What <i>they</i> (not you or the consesnsus) believe in? Wouldnt you want to hear what <i>they</i> have to say about themselves? How can you claim what they say as POV? Do you know Shias better than Shias know themselves?--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 20:28, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It is fine to objectively report the subjective views of Shias - as long as we have objective reports of other takes on the issues too. An article that simply recored Shia views on an alledged academic bias without any record of opposing views would be POV. Or else we could have artilces on 'a fundamentalist's view of evolution' or 'a Palestinian's view of Israeli occupation' without any NPOV corrective. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 20:53, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There is nothing wrong with including multiple POV, indeed, this is the cornerstone of NPOV. But if you read the quote I gave above, it says it is "written <b>from</b> the perspective of the Shi'a". The article is not and does not claim to be written from a neutral point of view; it explicitly excludes (including in the title) all but one POV. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 20:57, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Commnet</b> Guys, ther is a factual bias against Shias, as they perceive it, and in what i have understood, even in a factual way, since the net is filled with non-sense presented as acctual Shia belives. Zereshk is trying to represent that, and the topic in it self is to big to fit in the Shia article whithout dominating it. So the subject is real, both in that there is much desinformation about shias and that shias feel that themselves. And as i said, there is to much to make all of it fitt in the Shia article. Dont condemn her article as non-sence without having read, understood and commneted it. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 22:10, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. My recollection is that this was a single. According to Allmusic.com, the single did not chart in the US - the band has had two singles make the Billboard modern rock tracks chart but this wasn't one of them.

<li><b>Keep first half; merge second half into <a href="../../../g/e/e/Gee.html" title="Gee">gee</a></b>. The first half of this article is about a separate topic from <a href="../../../g/e/e/Gee.html" title="Gee">gee</a>, and a merge would be inappropriate. The gee article is about a <i>unit of acceleration</i>; one gee is a certain amount of acceleration. The <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geeforce.html" title="Geeforce">geeforce</a> article is about a <i>type of force</i>; geeforces are something which cause acceleration. Geeforces could be measured in gees, but they are separate topics. As a physics major, I'd like to emphasize that this type of distinction is very important. Also, the geeforce article claims that it is dealing specifically with acceleration that <b>isn't</b> caused by gravity, but which appears gravity-like; thus, it would be appropriate to have a separate article on this, rather than merging with the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> or <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitation.html" title="Gravitation">gravitation</a> articles. All of these topics are related, but distinct.

<dd>The right place to have this discussion is here, and not on your talk page. However, after reviewing the other articles more carefully, I agree with you, you are right, this is a distinct topic. I was wrong about the redirect; the redirect should not be to <a href="../../../g/e/e/Gee.html" title="Gee">gee</a> but to <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictitious_force.html" title="Fictitious force">fictitious force</a>, and all of this article should be merged with <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictitious_force.html" title="Fictitious force">fictitious force</a>, and then redirected to it. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 04:51, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>don't merge.</b> "gee" and geeforce ought to be separate. Technically the g/gee ought to be lower case to distinguish it from G/Gee, the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitational_constant.html" title="Gravitational constant">gravitational constant</a>, but I think it might be a technical limitation of Wiki that we can't fix that.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The "ficticious forces" label is <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaic.html" title="Archaic">archaic</a> - it was a categorisation used by people teachng Newtonian theory who wanted to argue that forces due to acceleration that didn't fit the theory could be ignored, because they weren't "physical". This was not a very scientfic argument, and was roundly rejected by many people including <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernst_Mach_9043.html" title="Ernst Mach">Ernst Mach</a>. Einstein's <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_theory_of_relativity.html" title="General theory of relativity">general theory of relativity</a> implemented these forces as fully physical effects, and the term "ficticious" has generally been considered wrong for the last ~ninety years. I'm sure that they still teach "ficticious forces" in schools, but then again, when I was at school, they still taught "Newton's seven colours", introductory physics textbooks have a tendency to contain a lot of discredited "fossil physics". I think that the existing ficticious forces page does a good job of warning anyone who looks for the term that its a bad old historical thing that should be avoided:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>" Within physics, there is no obvious use for the term "fictional", or even any precise definition. It is not clear that this characterisation is particularly useful, and many deny that forces are "fictitious" or "imaginary" in any real sense. "</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>So: "geeforces" should not be merged into the ficticious forces page, they refer to particular physical effects independently of theoretical interpretation. The ficticious forces page <i>might</i> be merged into geeforces, but since "ff" is a term that we are trying to exterminate, perhaps keeping it on its own little isolated page with links out might be the correct thing to do. "ff" <i>might</i> be merged into a different page (such as <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coriolis_force.html" title="Coriolis force">Coriolis force</a>) , but again, since its a term we probably shouldn't be using, it would be a shame to contaiminate a perfectly nice page like Coriolis force with a paragraph about a dead term that we aren't supposed to use any more. Better to keep "ff" in isolation, I think, and let it wither and die.<a href="../../../e/r/k/User%7EErkDemon_282e.html" title="User:ErkDemon">ErkDemon</a> 13:55, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Merge second half and improve first half</i>, as per Creidieki's suggestions. Two more comments: First, Erk, I see that Linas has also noticed, as I have, that you have a marked tendency toward miscategorization. I ask again that you try to be more thoughtful in future. Second, I see that you said that physics teachers have tradionally counseled students to <i>ignore</i> Coriolis forces. That is not true (unless they are neglible in some situation); rather, traditional physics education warns students that these "forces" are treated differently in Newtonian theory, and <i>also</i> in general relativity!

<dd>Personally, I agree fully that putting individual stations into a general article about a particular line makes a lot more sense. However, the larger precedent is that each station is considered notable enough to deserve its own article. Hence, this should be left as a stub. Eventually someone will write a few lines on it. I think that Terry was (completely understandably) unaware of the low threshhold for notability when it comes to metros - also schools, pokemon, Sar Trek, etc...&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 22:01, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This recently created stub appears to discuss a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> that is featured in some atheist websites, mostly under the term "Insane God-Myth." Those articles appear thoroughly unencyclopedic, and most (if not all) seem to be written by vociferous, non-academic critics of belief in and believers in any sort of spirituality. This appears to also be the POV of this stub's creator; see <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWholemealBaphomet_8fb7.html" title="User:WholemealBaphomet">WholemealBaphomet</a> (<a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWholemealBaphomet_fa42.html" title="User talk:WholemealBaphomet">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WholemealBaphomet_f4bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/WholemealBaphomet">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../b/a/p/User%7EBaphomet._4f31.html" title="User:Baphomet.">Baphomet.</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/p/User_talk%7EBaphomet._005e.html" title="User talk:Baphomet.">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Baphomet._31b4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Baphomet.">contribs</a>). While the term "God Myth" yields over 12,000 google hits, the vast majority of those hits do not appear to discuss this topic. Mostly, the hits include article titles like "God, Myth, and Society," "Moon-god Myth," "Sun-god Myth," etc. I didn't find anything about the topic of this article among the first ten google hits for the term. This article is, at the time of this post, 100% unsourced, and it seems unlikely that it is possible to bring appropriate sources for this term. As such, this article drew immediate criticism on Talk:God Myth. Additionally, this stub is being used as a springboard for virulent anti-spirituality/anti-religious POV pushing. After this stub's creator's recent failed attempt at creating a redundant <i>superstition</i> cat. for his/her own uses (despite the existence of a <i>superstitions</i> cat.) and adding it to numerous articles, he/she is trying a new tactic. Baphomet. seems determined to link other articles to his/her new stub, which compares belief in <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">spirituality</a> to belief in <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_abduction.html" title="Alien abduction">alien abduction</a> (one of several <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> violations in the short stub). I have reverted those links in <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">Spirituality</a>, and Baphomet. has, of course, readded the links. Instead of getting bogged down in frivolous edit-warring, I thought it best to use the same method here as was used for the <i>superstition</i> category. That was placed for CfD, and received %83 support for deletion. This stub's <b>deletion</b> will hopefully obviate the necessity for dealing with the symptoms of this problem through wearying edit-wars over a POV-magnet. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/k/t/User_talk%7EHKT_e311.html" title="User talk:HKT">talk</a></sup> 16:47, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't think the idea of an article describing a major atheist viewpoint is POV when similar articles exist describing other major atheist, theist, and non-religious viewpoints, as long as such description is done in an NPOV way. But this exact term does not seem to be a major atheist viewpoint. The idea of a "god myth" might be encyclopaedic but not to the extent that it needs its own article and can't fit as a blurb in <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 18:04, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Original research, rather than POV, is the primary technical problem with the article. In fact, the existence of the latter in the article is fundamentally dependent on the existence of the former. In other words, if this is simply a <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_phrase.html" title="Weasel phrase">weasel article</a> <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">incapable of being cited with any appropriate source</a>, the claims in the article derive their strength solely from Baphomet's POV. This seems to be the case. As of now, the article is devoid of any citation, much less any acceptable, notable citation. It seems weird that Baphomet recalls specific comparisons between the beliefs in spirituality and alien abductions, yet is unable to cite an academic or mainstream source. Other sources are irrelevant, as academic and mainstream sources are required to show that it isn't a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/k/t/User_talk%7EHKT_e311.html" title="User talk:HKT">talk</a></sup> 20:16, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

At best, this is also a neologism. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/k/t/User_talk%7EHKT_e311.html" title="User talk:HKT">talk</a></sup> 23:19, 9 September 2005 (UTC) P.S. Baphomet has now linked to an atheist website that uses the words "god myth" twice, both times uncapitalized. (This stub refers to <i>the</i> "God Myth." If anything, the uncapitalized term in this site indicates that there is no well established term ("God Myth") that represents the concept/belief that belief in God is a myth; it seems the site could have just as well written "god fable" or "god fiction".) I've not yet researched the website, so I don't yet know if it is academic or mainstream. I suspect that it is neither. If I am wrong, the term still doesn't seem well established. If I am right, the term <i>certainly</i> remains a neologism. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/k/t/User_talk%7EHKT_e311.html" title="User talk:HKT">talk</a></sup> 23:40, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> changed from keep see below (argument used for keep for historical value if any) while I don't agree with the beliefs behind the article I have heard the term used by many people on both sides of the issue and have for years. So I believe this to be true terminology and a vaid article. It may be a bit POV but two things to say about that one it can be reworked and two no encyclopedia in the world is completly lacking POV and no articles on here completly lack POV. It might be better to merge it with an article on Atheism and say that some use this term to describe religion because then it doesnt say anything is deffinatly "god myth" but also aknowledges other peoples POV somewhere.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Firstly I'm confused as to what the article is even talking about, the term "God Myth," or those who believe in a "God Myth." The second paragraph would seem to indicate the latter, since it is all about individual responses (defence mechanisms) to, I assume disbelief, or disbelievers, and attempting to make an analogy by comparing those responses to other individual responses in cases that are, I guess we're to assume containing equal or greater fiction? I'm not sure if this section was just mangled through an edit war, but at best its just terribly confused, at worst its completely POV, either way it has no place here. On the other hand if the article is an attempt to discuss the term "God Myth" itself, than there's a fair bit of miswording occuring:</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The God Myth is a term applied by some skeptics, to any belief in a supernatural, omnipotent, omnipresent parent-like entity that is held to be responsible for the creation of the universe. This belief is common to almost all the major religions."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It would not be correct to simply refer to the belief in something as a myth. It would be proper to say that what one believes in is a myth, or something along those lines, but not that the belief itself is a myth. To discuss a "God myth," one needs to be discussing the myths of or relating to god(s)/God. If this definition is to relate to the actual term "God Myth," it would need be more akin to something like this:
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The God Myth is a term applied by some skeptics, to any story involving a supernatural, omnipotent, omnipresent parent-like entity that is held to be responsible for the creation of the universe."</i></dd>

</dd>
<dd>In which case this article would actually be attempting to discuss "creation myths," a term which is already defined to a much better effect in the "origin beliefs" article.Gheorghe Zamfir 09:40, 13 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: Since the author is just using the term to describe his favorite sort of skepticism concerning the existence of any creating deity, the definition can be adjusted at will to conform it to some more sensible standard. However, the more it is improved, the more obvious the article has already been written elsewhere, and much better; and that this is original research. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 14:51, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Just because it is not correct to call a belief a myth does not mean that those who coined the term were being technicly accurate. Antisemetic people don't hate semites homophobics arent nessasarily afraid of homosexuals many missuses of words exist in terminology that doesn't mean the terms are misused it just means they are a little quirky. But a term being quirky is no reason for deletion.</dd>

<dd>Also I don't find this article to be any more POV than any other article on the entirety of wikipedia the only reasons for delition could be no sources mentioned or sloppy writting as the phrasing is awkward even if it is for the most part correct. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimonnyman_c3eb.html" title="User:Shimonnyman">Shimonnyman</a> 10:53, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b> Well, first of all, neither of the terms you mentioned are misuses of words. Secondly, this wasn't a misuse of a word I was describing, nor an appropriation of words or evolution of langauge, it was a simple abuse of language. To define the term "God Myth" as it was, would be to suggest that it would then be proper to utter a sentence like, "That boy has a firm God Myth in heaven," or "My friend has a wavering God Myth in Buddah." Obviously these sentences are nonsensical, and far from any claims of a "quirky" coinage that's been established in <i>any</i> circles of discussion. Its a non-point at any rate as the definition has been appropriately changed, but even with the reformulated definition I stand by my comment for deletion, as I said before even in this case its little more than a synonym for "creation myth," but being that its neither established or sourced anywhere as such, nor that its definable as any kind of significant variant, it has no place as an encyclopedic entry.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also stand by the comment that its POV, since the second paragraph is nothing more than the author's personal commentary, writing your commentary from the perspective of a 3rd party doesn't make it any more encyclopedic or authoritative. But to top if off its poorly written commentary, since it makes no sense. People have self-defense mechanisms, a myth does not - hence the term "self," which isn't to say removing the term "self" to use "defense mechanism" would make a fix, as it would still be a meanigless use of the term. So despite the claim, NO myths have any self-defence mechanisms. Furthermore, it ends the paragraph by saying "In this way some suppose that the phenomenon of stories about a supreme being with a paternal interest in the petty affairs of mankind can be accounted for." In what way is that accounted for? Supposing a myth has self-defense mechanisms, how exactly does that account for the phenomenon of stories about a supreme being with a paternal interest? Given that self-defense mechanisms in no way relate to or explain either supreme beings or anything paternal, how would they have anything to do with their existance in "god myths"? -Gheorghe Zamfir 11:57, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay I think I understand you now. I reread the article and agree for the most part but I disagree to an extent. There probably isnt enough to justify a whole atrticle on it so I'm gonna change my vote.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However I do believe if there is a section on athesim and termonology it could just have a sentence saying something like: A term used by atheists to describe beliefs in theological stories pertaining to gods. This would describe it perfectly and doesnt give POV however if there is no article like this it isnt important enough just to start an article.</dd>

<p>DEAR "WIkifascist" and UBER-LORD (HIGH ADMIRMAL) BOB if you used the word "wikistupidity in your sentence above how can it be <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nonsense.html" title="Nonsense">nonsense</a> defined by "wikipedists" (sic) as "an utterance or written text in what appears to be a human language or other symbolic system, that does not in fact carry any identifiable meaning" if is so distasteful and detracting then it is not nonsense and there for not deletable as was argued. or is there another and completely unstated argument being offered that should be made for us to distain look down on frown and call humbug? Andrew Zito 18:18, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You know, one of the official policies of Wikipedia is "no neologisms". As you admit that the word is coined by you, that qualifies it as a neologism. Sorry. Also, "wikified" isn't an entry <i>per se</i>; rather, it leads to a meta-page that explains how wiki formatting works. Therefore, your objection on that basis is invalid. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 18:25, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Good <i>God</i>, that was hard to read. I can only assume that English is not your native language, so I will give you the benefit of the doubt. Anyway, the use of wikistupidity in my vote was purely ironic. In addition, note that it would only apply if the article were kept, therefore demonstrating that there was no consensus that wikistupidity is a nonsense term. So for my comment on "wikistupidity" to apply, "wikistupidity" would need to be accepted as a valid concept. <i>Also</i>, I pray, note that my vote to delete was not on the grounds that it was patent nonsense, although I can understand why somebody would think it was. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 18:35, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dear High Admiral Lord Bob of the Church of Bob in the Land of Nod.</p>
<p>Thank you for stating: "I pray, note that my vote to delete was not on the grounds that it was patent nonsense, although I can understand why somebody would think it was. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 18:35, September 9, 2005 (UTC)" as now we really know what you intended to state. Perhaps you and all "Wikidom" (oops another word quick get it into print and can learn a lesson in tolerance and grace so that a less coarse approach to matters and be found. If you object to someone over stating something discuss and fix the matter don't delete whole articles as it causes me to dwelling on how I could buy a shotgun and fix matters (another good metaphor)Andrew Zito 18:48, 9 September 2005 (UTC).</p>
<ul>
<li>You all know what I meant to state, because I stated it. I've never been known for not speaking my mind, as a look at my history will show. I said I can understand why somebody would think it's patent nonsense, because I do. I understand why somebody would believe in <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>, even though I, as an atheist, do not. I can understand why somebody would want to live in <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver%2C_British_Columbia_9a31.html" title="Vancouver, British Columbia">Vancouver, British Columbia</a>, even though I, as somebody who chooses to live in <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria%2C_British_Columbia_4e57.html" title="Victoria, British Columbia">Victoria</a> instead, do not. Do you understand the difference between comprehension and agreement yet? I can't believe I'm having this argument with somebody who doesn't know what a conjunction is, but I'm a sucker for debate. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 18:55, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>So far as I know but in actuality that is not an issue it is in fact a conjunction as was aforementioned and there for valid if you wish you can delete the passage relating to me coining the phrase but then you may have to replace it.

<ul>
<li>My thoughts precisely. I caught this on RC patrol and tagged it. I've been trying to find a clear Wiktionary policy on slang, but have been unsuccessful. There appear to accept protologisms, however, so they clearly must accept slang. I think both bitchslapping and bitch-slap (is the hyphen necessary?) should be deleted and moved to Wiktionary (the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Slang" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Category:Slang">slang category</a> on Wiktionary seems much better done, but surprisingly lacks entries on both the above). They certainly should not stay here, since there is a clear rule against that in a fundamental WP law (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>). A slang cat on WP may be useful to place articles on the development of slang in various languages; clearly, however, it is being misused.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">encephalon</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#606060">έγκέφαλος</font></a>&#160; 18:57:12, 2005-09-09 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>protologisms (usually called <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">Neologisms</a> here) are usually tagged and AfD'd. There are several on the AfD list today. But slang seems to be a grey area, especially if a fairly large article is written with history. I can see a category for <b>types</b> of slang and their origins, such as Cockney Rhyming slang, but listing individual slang terms seems unencyclopedic. I would opt for transwiki to Wictionary, perhaps with a link. --<a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutlanderssc_453d.html" title="User:Outlanderssc">Outlander</a> 20:29, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wiktionary takes slang words, just as other dictionaries do, subject to its normal <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion">criteria for inclusion</a>. Wiktionary does <i>not</i> accept protologisms, as is clearly stated in the criteria for inclusion.

<p><b>Hoax or vanity</b>.</p>
<p>Sigh. It can be difficult to determine whether an Ethiopia-related article should be kept or removed. There is no fixed rule of transliteration for names, so one name may be represented by a wide number of spellings; Ethiopia isn't on the Internet in a significant way, so a small number of hits form Google is not conclusive. And we need more Ethiopia-related articles. However, we don't need articles like these.</p>
<ul>
<li>Buzunish Atsbeha. According to the article, she was of noble birth, ran a couple of nightclubs during the '30s, &amp; fled the Derg for Canada. Substitute "Paris, Brussels, etc." for "Addis Ababa", &amp; "Germans" for "Italians", &amp; you have the story of countless people during WWII. (Let's be snide, make a couple more name-changes, &amp; say this is the plot of <i><a href="../../../c/a/s/Casablanca.html" title="Casablanca">Casablanca</a></i>.) Her claims to nobility rely on the credibility of the next 2 articles, but even if they were about real people, I don't think being the black-sheep daughter of a noble merits inclusion by for itself. (Although knowing that John F Kennedy would be president one day -- or even know of his existence in the late '30s -- might be notable.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dej Desta. Article claims he was a close friend of Emperor <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menelik_II_of_Ethiopia_78b8.html" title="Menelik II of Ethiopia">Menelik II</a>. A check in the index of Chris Proutky's <i>Empress Taytu and Menelik II: Ethiopia 1883-1910</i> (Trenton: The Red Sea Press, 1986) fails to turn up anyone by the name of "Dej", but 4 or 5 "Destas", none of whom fit the biography here. Because Proutky's book is fairly detailed, &amp; mentions all of the people around Menelik II -- especially while he was emperor -- its hard to believe that this person ever existed. A number of other odd statements in this biography confirm this conclusion -- which I can share if people are curious.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Atsbeha. Let's assume that even if the other 2 articles should be deleted: does that mean we can still keep this one? There is one puzzling discrepency in the ancestory that argues this is also a hoax. Assuming that "Subagadis," is another way to spell the name of "Sebagadis" (an actual person &amp; an important warlord of Ethiopia who died in 1831), why would the author insist he was of "royal" blood when the historic Sebagadis himself made no such claim. However, his daughter Diniqesh was married to an Emperor of Ethiopia, <a href="../../../t/e/k/Tekle_Giyorgis_II_of_Ethiopia_1981.html" title="Tekle Giyorgis II of Ethiopia">Tekle Giyorgis II</a>, &amp; his primary wife was the sister of Empress <a href="../../../t/a/y/Taytu_Betul_f582.html" title="Taytu Betul">Taytu Betul</a>, the wife of Menelik II. Shouldn't these connections to the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomonid_dynasty.html" title="Solomonid dynasty">Solomonid dynasty</a> be mentioned, rather than to just another warlord from the 19th century? (FWIW, this name also collides with a far more famous Atsbeha, a legendary ruler of Axum, who needs an article; or it is another indication of the fiction here.)</li>
</ul>
<p>A few more points these 3 articles share: (1) had someone added dates -- say the birth or death date -- to any of these articles, then I might be inclined to believe that these people actually existed, but I guess providing these details was too much work. (2) All of these articles have been contributed or editted from the same 3 IP numbers. (3) Oh yes, no hits on Google for any of these people that is independent of Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:31, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comments:</b> I'm guessing "Buzunish" is a name I've seen spelled in English as "Bezunesh," but "Bezunesh Atsbeha" and other variations in spelling did not turn up on Google (for whatever that's worth). Ethiopian names are often made using the person's given name (i.e. first name), then his/her father's name, followed by the grandfather's first name. Thus, Buzunish Atsbeha's father would be named Atsbeha [Something] - perhaps the editor didn't know the rest of the father's father's name, and so only used "Atsbeha." I looked up <a href="../../../a/d/i/Adigrat.html" title="Adigrat">Adigrat</a> in my Bradt <i>Guide to Ethiopia</i> and it said there was little in the way of sightseeing and did not mention anything about the remains of any castles (though this does not mean they don't exist). (I did tag the Adigrat article with {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENot_verified_a8cc.html" title="Template:Not verified">not verified</a>}}; see <a href="../../../a/d/i/Talk%7EAdigrat_5ce6.html" title="Talk:Adigrat">Talk:Adigrat</a>). Note that the edits in question are from two IPs in Canada, where Buzunish Atsbeha lived - my gut feeling is that someone who knew this person wanted to add her to Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyrofrog_366a.html" title="User:Gyrofrog">Gyrofrog</a> <a href="../../../g/y/r/User_talk%7EGyrofrog_91bf.html" title="User talk:Gyrofrog">(talk)</a> 17:51, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. If this article isn't one thing, it's non-notable. It's a piece of internet history, as Welch already stated. It's a very common used term on IRC networks and gaming forums. If people would like to get rid of this article, we might as well get rid of words like 'cool', 'fabulous', 'awesome' etc. which are also terms belonging to a subculture--<a href="../../../s/o/o/User%7ESoothingR_cd35.html" title="User:SoothingR">SoothingR</a> 17:23, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

I think your arguments for inclusion are arguments for inclusion in a glossary of slang, not an encyclopedia. Even then it might not be notable—what a bunch of sixteen year old kids say to each other on gaming forums isn't very high on the notability scale. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 17:47, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

I asked here because it's a public issue relating to this AfD and not a private issue between Grue and myself. I assumed good faith, but in this case I decided to "trust, but verify".

Would be able to work in the I-class and so on as well), and we could merge this in. As it stands there's not much that can usefully be said on any individual one of them.

<li>And there I was expecting to write it in a month or so! Thanks.

<li>I've worked it out. Apollo 21 was really just an early name for AS-515, which we know as Apollo 20. Because, you see, in early 1968 they didn't expect Apollo 8 to be a Saturn V flight, so AS-503 would have been Apollo <i>9</i>, not <i>8</i>... and then adding twelve to that would take you to Apollo 21.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Are you seriously trying to vote a change to the United States Declaration of Independence? "Inalienable" was a word commonly in use at the time of the Declaration. Even though it was considered, and was even in one of the draft proposals, "Inalienable" was <i><b>not chosen</b></i> for inclusion in the Declaration. If the signers of the U.S. Declaration of Independence had wanted to use "inalienable," they would have used "inalienable." It is not our place to change history. The following two points are historical facts:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Locke_68b4.html" title="John Locke">John Locke</a> defined <b>in</b>alienable rights specifically as "life, liberty, and property".</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence_f3f2.html" title="United States Declaration of Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a> did not recognize Locke's need for property as being a natural right. It referred to "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness" as <b>un</b>alienable rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>The motives involved are pretty obvious: the signers of the United States Declaration of Independence did <b>not</b> want to include property rights in their declaration. They specifically rejected that word from an earlier draft. Are we now to rewrite history and link the Declaration to property rights by saying that the signers really meant Locke's "inalienable"? --<a href="../../../g/o/_/User%7EGo_Cowboys_f9a2.html" title="User:Go Cowboys">Go Cowboys</a> 16:44, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, now that is it is clear it is about a fictional substance. The fictional material is notable enough for an article. I remember reading something that discussed whether such a substance was possible (the conclusion was it was not). It references like that can be found, this article can be expanded. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">Jonathunder</a> 18:10, 2005 September 12 (UTC)

<li>I think you will find that at least some of this is in the links I added to the talk page. More might be worth finding. An obvious problem with the fictional Ice-9 is the energetics -- aligning molecules in a solid state generally releses significant energy, which would tend to disrupt the reaction -- but I don't have a specifc source for that off-hand. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:45, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rewrite</b> I can definitely rewrite this article, but I'd appreciate some constructive input. I apparently shouldn't use existing articles as a model, because I did that and it's caused the ruckus&#160;:) What are your suggestions? I'll start with 1) use third person rather than second person 2)more background on the evolution of the software 3) noted capabilities. Does this seem appropriate? Please remember, this article is listed in the category of "music software", and you can check out the other articles in the category. To my eye, this one follows the same model, so I'm honestly trying to find out what the major problems are here so we can make this an informational entry. I see part of the strength of the Wikipedia as giving current information about a myriad of topics, as well as resources related to those topics (hence the "external links" sections).

<li>Changing vote to <b>keep</b> based on rewrite. It's a little rah-rah, with more detail than I honestly think the subject deserves in Wikipedia, but it reads largely like an encyclopedia entry now, I suppose. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> 00:39, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> based on rewrite. Thanks for doing this, <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherryc_a1aa.html" title="User:Sherryc">Sherryc</a>. It still needs some more evaluation of pros and cons (perhaps third-party) and perhaps a comparison with other programs, showing the differences between it and its competitors. And I agree with <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a>: the article is disproportionately long and detailed, but that's not a reason to delete it. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandywombat_6d0e.html" title="User:Randywombat">Wombat</a> 10:35, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for the tips, and the votes of confidence! I thought about including some comparisons with other programs, but I was afraid that someone might think I was trying to write a "product comparison review" as advertising or something&#160;:) So, I went more with the "what this particular program has" approach (hence the listing of capabilities) so that people would know about these particular programs. Which approach might be better? I don't want to make it a "this versus that" type of article - I've seen some of the discussions on some of the other software articles, and I'm not trying to make a "this is definitively better than that" article. I'm just trying to inform folks about a program that I've found useful, and that others might want to know about since there is a "music software" category in Wikipedia. Thoughts? Suggestions? Thanks! <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherryc_a1aa.html" title="User:Sherryc">Sherryc</a> 16:43, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I respectfully dispute that. Doing your job as an architect is not an assertion of notability. If he'd won an award or co-designed with someone of note, maybe that would count.
