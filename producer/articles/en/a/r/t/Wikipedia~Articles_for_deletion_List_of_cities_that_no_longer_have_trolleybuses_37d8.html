<p>This article obviously has had a great deal of work and has sources, but I just don't feel it's maintainable enough. Plenty of cities, I imagine, had trolleybuses at one point but no longer do; it could easily get unmanageable. (Contested prod, if the talk page is correct.) <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrystallina_cbad.html" title="User:Crystallina">Crystallina</a> 03:37, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't understand the logic: because this list is historical, it cannot be outdated--records don't change. Unless you have cities that can't make up their mind about trolleybuses (highly unlikely in my mind, due to the infrastructure needed to run a system), this page is not going to fall into inaccuracy (it may be inaccurate to begin with, but that's not the issue). Now you can have cities that tossed their trolleybuses and not make it into the list, but the list already looks useful even if it is a incomplete list. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 04:09, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment:</b> My main concern here is that there will be so many cities that once had trolleybuses but no longer do that the list will become large and unmanageable. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrystallina_cbad.html" title="User:Crystallina">Crystallina</a> 04:15, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then the list becomes outdated and in need of expansion, which merit cleanup tags. Worse case scenario is that the list becomes incomplete; It won't accrue <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> issues by aging. In any case, if this hasn't happened yet, why worry about it? <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 18:10, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Unmaintainable listcruft of an arbitrarily chosen, single-aspect characteristic of cities. Why does a cities once having had trolley buses have to do with anything of encyclopedic note? It's a random way of organizing cities and would create a precedent for other "List of cities that no longer have..." articles. Wouldn't that be fun? --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:46, 13 December 2006
<ul>
<li>This list is primarily relevant to the history of trolley busses, and as such it is very much encyclopaedic. The "random way of organising cities" would be a valid criticism if this were a category, but it isn't organising the cities at all. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 02:34, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>There are no problems with getting an accurate list, nor with maintaining it. A city either had a trolley bus system that it got rid of or it didn't. Trolley bus systems require significant investment of time (years) and money (£ millions) to construct and significant (although less) of both to remove. This means that very little, if any, maintenance is needed because the entries on the list do not change. The major change to infrastructure means that finding sources is not difficult. 02:34, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I have been told that Wikipedia is "timeless" - in other words, we should cover historical subjects as well as current subjects. A list of anything should therefore include former examples as well as current ones. It may be suitable to split a list of current examples from the list of all examples, but the historic list should continue to include the current examples. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Amtrak_routes_b75f.html" title="List of Amtrak routes">list of Amtrak routes</a> for a list that I believe to be laid out in a good way (except for the corridor services). --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User%7ENE2_ab1c.html" title="User:NE2">NE2</a> 15:10, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>How is it "unmaintainable"? The only part that might be is that it lists only cities that no longer have them, which a redefinition of its scope would fix.

<ul>
<li>Which is my point. <i>What maintenance?</i> This article needs as much care as a chia pet.

<li><b>Merge</b> per NE2. I live in one of the cities that no longer have trolleybuses and can actually see a relevance to the information, although it should be linked back to specific articles on the history of trolleybuses in various cities. I must admit for no particular reason the title of this article made me laugh - it did seem ridiculous until further examination (I think I read it more as "do not" have - which would be just about any city anywhere). <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 17:24, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
