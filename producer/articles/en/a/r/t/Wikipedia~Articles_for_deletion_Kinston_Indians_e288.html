The Kingston Indians are an A League team (= 4th division, or a reserve league, a category for which players of football are included only in exceptional circumstances, i.e. international appearances) whose players are not notable by virtue of playing there, and none of the articles make any notability claims for the subjects beyond the fact of playing for the Kingston Indians. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 10:47, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b> These players pass WP:BIO. Class A is NOT the lowest level of pro ball. No, none of the players have played in MLB but three have played in AA ball as recent as several days ago. Wikipedia should not be limited. Also, on the Kinston Indians page, the current roster is filled with nearly all red names suggesting a page needs to be made for each player. Finally, why are other A players allowed to have articles (e.g. the <a href="../../../k/o/b/Koby_Clemens_a0a0.html" title="Koby Clemens">Koby Clemens</a> article i just visited recently)?
