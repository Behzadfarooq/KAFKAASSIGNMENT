<li><b>Keep</b> Agreed that Assistant Professors are not usually notable scientists at that stage in their career. But I have checked his publication list, which is very strong--he has published approximately 40 peer-reviewed articles since receiving his doctorate, including 5 in Neuron, the highest ranking journal in his field. These publications have had a total to 1041 references to them from other peer-reviewed scientific journals, four of them having over 95 citations. That's way more than average, since average is one or two cites each and his average is 25. I did not expect to see this--in fact I had written delete before i went back and checked in Web of Science. The numbers speak for themselves. Allowing for those who have cited more than one of his papers, several hundred published scientists have found his work notable enough to cite. Mnemopsis, could you recheck your count--Web of Science is usually the most reliable source. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:09, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Pubmed indicates he has one publication in Neuron, which is not the highest ranking journal of any field btw (Nature, Nature Neuroscience, and Science all rank much higher than Neuron). He has a couple of dozen publications, which is not that many by any standards. Prominent neuroscientists typically have over 200 publications. Furthermore, he is not the recipient of any notable awards, nor do his publications indicate any significant new findings that are in any way notable. Nor does he appear on ISI Highly Cited Researchers. He seems like your typical neuroscientist who falls on the lower end of the publication spectrum. If he has done something significant, I'd like to know what it is. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemopis_cf30.html" title="User:Mnemopis">Mnemopis</a> 02:06, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>it would be interesting to compare standards. He is perhaps in the top 10% of his field--(among those who have acquired the minimum credentials, a PhD) but not the top 1%, (perhaps everyone could agree on that?) .</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Then do we include the top 10% or the top 1% in other areas of human work? Do we include the top 10% of rock musicians who have acquired the minimal credentials of producing one generally released recording?--or only the top 1 in a hundred? Do we include the top 10% of novelists, among those who have published at least one novel? or only the best 1 in 100? Do we include the top 10% or the top 1% of professional football players, among those who have ever played a professional game?
<dl>
<dd>Some of the guidelines say more notable than the average (whatever): That's the top 50%. All associate professors in any research university are within the top 50% of those with doctorates in the field. In fact, so are all assistant professors in a research university--at least half of new doctorates never get a tenure-track job in a research university. Included in the top 50% are all associate or full professors in any four-year college and up, and all full professors at 2-yr colleges.</dd>
<dd>If we think the standards are those whom we could write a meaningful article about, then anyone who has obtained these minimal distinctions count, for it could be done by analyzing their work in connection with their field, their advisor, where they publish, etc.</dd>
<dd>What I do <b>not</b> think is acceptable is to say those about whom a good article is written--we are judging the subject. If the article is inadequate, by all means we should stubbify it, and then protect it indefinitely against deletion. The point of having rules is equity--judging by a fixed standard, applicable to all. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 02:22, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I would not go so far as to say we should include all full professors at all 2-year colleges, as DGG seems to be saying, but that's very different from a rising star at a top research university. I would like to understand the discrepancy between DGG and Mnemopis' citation numbers but a quick check of Google Scholar (ignoring the similarly named B.L. Knutson) seems to lean more towards the DGG side of that equation. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 05:41, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
