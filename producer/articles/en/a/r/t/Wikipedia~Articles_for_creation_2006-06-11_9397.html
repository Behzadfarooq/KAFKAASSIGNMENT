<p>Kenji Urada was the very first human being who's life was verifiably taken by a robot. He was 37 at the time of his death and working at a Kawasaki plant in Akieski, Japan. To perform maintenance on a plant robot, he climbed over a safety fence. He mistakenly did not turn the robot off before doing so. Thus, the hydrolic arm of said robot pushed Urada into a grinding machine where he met his unfortunate end.</p>

<p>Nahelem originally was a code name for Intel's microprocessor which was to be a successor to the tejas, the cancelled incarnation of the pentium 4 after the prescott core. The Nahelem was projected to run at clock speed over 10GHZ at a front side bus of 1200mhz. It was slated for a late 2005 release, but was cancelled due to unexpected heat problems in the 90nm prescott cores.</p>
<p>Nahelem now refers to a new micro architecture slated to succeed the Intel's Core Micro architecture. Little is known about the platform except that it use a 45nano meter manufacturing process. The first presumed processor using the nahelem architecture is code named bloomsfield a quad core chip built on the 45 nanometer process using a shared 8megabyte cache</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-11_9397.html" title="Edit section: F1r3m4n McCarty">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">F1r3m4n McCarty</span></h2>
<p>F1r3m4n McCarty is one of the smallest MMORPGs (Mass Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games). The style of play is quite unique, for it is quite similar to World of Warcraft and possibly Oblivion. After installation, a choice of 3 different characters are available. These characters include: white, black, and mexican. A secret "Arabian" fireman also appears to be an unlockable character at the breach of your character. However, only few have been able to unlock this secret character.</p>
<p><b>White Fireman McCarty:</b></p>
<p>White Fireman McCarty's have quite a unique playstyle. For instance, white firemen start with money that does not need to be earned. Gear included a better hose is also available to your liking. The only real setback of the white fireman McCarty is the jumping ability. The character cannot jump too high to reach locations that need fires put out. Thus, White's have their goods and bads.</p>
<p><b>Mexican Fireman McCarty:</b></p>
<p>The Mexican Fireman McCarty has a few passive skills that are quiet useful. The first, would be the ability to earn money while playing. This would help you get more gear quicker and easier. The second passive trait/skill would be the skill to climb fences quiet fast. This can be helpful with high fences blocking your path of water. Quests such as Z'Thun and Fire Creatures would be slightly easier for the Mexican Fireman McCarty.</p>
<p><b>Black Fireman McCarty:</b></p>
<p>Alas, the Black Fireman McCarty, one of the most-chosen races. First of all, the black firemen benefit in most of the quest given in F1r3m4n McCarty. The famous and helpful passive skills include: Fast movement, (speed increase) high jumps, and shiny gear. Fast movement can be helpful with dodging fires that come your way, or possibly running through the fires with the helpful +30% dodge chance. High jumps can also benefit the player with jumping through fires, getting into buildings, or reaching tough locations. Any gear the player puts on as a black fireman are automatically "shiny," giving the player a great feel of having "bling"</p>
<p><b>Additional Information:</b></p>
<p>Though F1r3m4n McCarty is not that well-known, it is a thrilling Third-person MMO. The original creators/producers include: Michael Jefforson, Thomas Crown, Jeffrey Lee, and more on art and engineering. Three severs are available for the players, which include: West Coast, East Coast, and the new and updated, Central Server. Players are given the ability to make the maximum of 5 characters on any server of their choice. The game can be found and downloaded to install at <a href="http://www.download.com" class="external text" title="http://www.download.com" rel="nofollow">Download.Com</a>.</p>

<p>ZARZAR LAND is the original and the #1 land group on e-Bay, as well as one of the world's most recognized Internet land groups. It has been on e-Bay since January 2, 1999 and is currently in its 8th year! A global leader in land sales and acquisitions for the individual and institutional investor.</p>
<p><br />
ZARZAR LAND is one of the largest land groups of its kind. We work closely with various government agencies and institutions to acquire literally thousands of properties. Once acquired, these properties are liquidated through e-Bay, the world's #1 online real estate market reaching over 100 million people. Our purchase volume allows us to extend savings of up to 80% to small investors and large corporate entities. We also offer prime rate financing with monthly payments as low as $100 on many of our properties.</p>
<p><br />
ZARZAR LAND was founded with the simple mission of providing quality real estate to millions of men and women around the world that had the desire to acquire quality real estate but did not have the financial means to do so. As the new millennium got into full gear and millions of investors were losing their life savings in the stock market, we felt that it was time to offer something different and unique and where all that was needed was the desire to own real estate. Furthermore, with the dawn of the Internet it was becoming clear that even individuals that were physically located on the other side of the world would no longer be shut out of the North American real estate market. Thus, ZARZAR LAND was born and is beginning to change the land acquisition landscape for the small investor.</p>
<p><br />
ZARZAR LAND is the original and the #1 land organization on e-Bay, as well as one of the most recognized Internet land organizations in the world. The ZARZAR Group Of Companies has marketing operations in over 51 countries and territories and offers high quality Real Estate at one of the lowest prices in the industry to individual and institutional investors throughout the world.</p>
<p><br />
ZARZAR LAND currently focuses on land throughout the United States and Canada and is expected to become the largest private landowner in the United States within the next decade. ZARZAR LAND is recognized worldwide and in the United States it is recognized by e-Bay, the world's #1 online real estate market, as a Power Seller. Power Sellers rank among the most successful sellers in terms of product sales and customer satisfaction on eBay.</p>

<p>Bubble Island is a chain of cafes offering teas and smoothies with the optional addition of jellies which are tapioca like balls that are added to your drink. In order to acomodate for the jellies, the straws used are quite large and also have a pointed end so that you can stab it through the lid of your drink. The cafes are franchised and each one has different characteristics. The Bubble Island in downtown Puyallup Washington is designed to be a hang out spot and has a pool table, fooseball table and a few arcade cabinets.</p>

<p>The Society of the Cloak and Dagger is a secret society at Georgetown University. It was founded in 1892 in response to the creation of The Yard, the first student association at Georgetown. Originally founded as the Laenasican Society, the group consisted of upperclassmen student leaders advocating for more student involvement in campus life. (The Yard would not assume responsibility beyond athletic affairs until 1919.) In 1899, the society became a secret senior society, modeling themselves as the Catholic version of Skull and Bones and Scroll and Key at Yale University. They would be joined on campus in later years by the Stewards and Crux Orbis.</p>
<p>Originally the society was compromised of seniors, but in latter years juniors and sophomores were allowed to join. Membership has fluctuated between as few as 5 and as many as 20. Many take their repetitive use of the number five and their self-reference as "The Brotherhood of Five" to indicate that membership stands at 5 or a multiple 5 (similar to the Seven Society). Their seal is a shaded dagger in a circle with five stars above the hilt. They communicate to students and other campus groups via cryptic poems, often in the shape of the Roman numeral V. There is no known way to communicate with the group though they have occasionally requested replies to letters by dropping notes at famous Georgetown landmarks, such as the statue of founder John Carroll.</p>
<p>Most recently, the society captured campus attention when their seal appeared in a basement room beneath Healy Hall in a room that had formerly been the meeting place of Crux Orb is, who had abandoned their meeting place due to excess knowledge of its location.</p>

It is essentially a clickable google map, offering google map's hybrid and satellite geographic technology; enable a user or web surfer to not only register with the site, but as well, to contribute to the site's compendium of information about landmarks throughout the USA. The site enables the potential user to zoom throughout multiple levels, read detailed information about important landmarks from restaurants to community centers to major transportation hubs, and to easily view the entire country, seemlessly and easily, with the help of google map technology.</p>

<p>Bowlplex plc operates 16 "family entertainment centres" across the UK. Although centred around bowling, each complex also has a Grill, serving mainly fried food and soft drinks; The Stadium Bar, which are late licensed until 2am; Video World with Sega arcade games; and a Pool Pit with American-style pool tables. Each centre is either "entertainment" or "modern" themed, and offers corporate, birthday and seasonal packages as well as straightforward bowling.</p>
<p>All Bowlplex centres are located within 'Multi-Leisure' environments. they are only developed where other leisure/recreation operators are present. This allows for better walk in trade (as it is known). Not being the main/only draw for each site is a fundamental element of it's success. People who visit the areas may be there to visit another operator and notice the Bowlplex and visit there also (better brand awareness).</p>

<p>Bowlplex employs over 650 staff across it's centres. Most of these staff are General Assistants, working a mixture of shifts on Customer Care, the bar or the Grill.</p>
<p>Each centre also has five bowling co-ordinators (3xf/t &amp; 2xp/t), responsible for supervising the staff and managing bookings and reception, and duty managers, responsible for the running of each centre. Each Duty Manager has a specific job role, in which they are responsible for. They are: Assistant Manager Operations (AMO - Operational aspect of each department), Assistant Manager Employee Systems (AME - HR and Training), Assistant Manager Centre Support (AMC - Back office and auditing) and General Manager (GM - Oversee's the overall running of each centre)</p>
<p>Each centre also has a team of technicians responsible for servicing and fixing the lanes as well as maintaining the centre.</p>

<p>Bowlplex pricing tends to be lower than most competitors, and as such is often seen as a "budget" competitor in the bowling market. Bowlplex has also tried to establish itself as an all-round entertainment centre, with the bar staying open later than the lanes on Friday and Saturday nights with a live DJ.</p>

<p>Quite often, employees in an organisation are made to do certain activities which do not DIRECTLY result in the achievement of the goals that have been set for those employees. For example, in a company manufacturing cars, the work of an employee in the final conveyor-line would be to assemble parts to create cars. If that employee is also asked to do planning, or to attend meetings to decide the policies of the company, his or her primary work of assembling cars would be affected. His or her goal of assembling car would NOT be met. Planning or forming policies of the company are definitely important activities but are NOT the primary goals of an employee in the conveyor-line. Such activities which do not DIRECTLY lead to achieving the goals are known as METAWORK. It also denotes those activities which are not required for meeting the goals of the organisation.</p>

<p>A home loan online can be either an official 1003 application or an unofficial application used to start the process of attaining a home loan/mortgage loan. Mortgage brokers and lenders use this convenient means to originate leads of potential customers interested in a home loan.</p>
<p>A common misconception is that an online home loan application can result in the immediate approval of a home loan. This is false due to the fact that mortgage loans are attained only after intense scrutiny of an applicants personal financial history which includes, but is not limited to: income, job history, and credit history. Companies that advertise home loans online are primarily referring to beginning the process of pre-approval for the loan. An official home loan is never finalized until after the submission of a 1003 Uniform Residential Loan Application and after the loan officer or broker contacts you to verify, collect, and sign all additional legal paperwork.</p>
<p>This being said a home loan online form is a great tool to begin the approval process of your loan and many times can result in faster pre-approval.</p>

<p>Stitch Up is a prerecorded show that airs on CBBC. It is like Just For Laughs, which shows people being humiliated, or "stitched up". The show stitch up has the same idea, but doesn't have quite as much adult humour. Even so, it is a fantastic show and all ages would enjoy it.</p>

<p>X-Site Skatepark is a recreational area for skateboarders, officially opened on the 22nd of April in Skegness, Lincolnshire. In October 2000, the Lincolnshire extreme sport's assosciation was formed, and after three years of planning, development of X-Site skatepark finally began. 1.5 million pounds has been spent in the development of the site, and the national lottery has funded the project. Local skateboarders, BMX'ers and inliner's have requested that an extreme sport's facility such as this one was needed, however there request was not met until recently. The local community also believes that the construction of this park will help to keep skateboarders of the streets. The location is open regularly now and has already brought attention to the area. Pro skateboarding teams such as "Death" have already provided demonstrations to local skaters, as has Pete King, one of the UK's top skateboarder's.</p>

<p>The Sonora Aero Club was a Aviation club based in Sonora,California during the 1800's. It experimented with various forms of balloons and Dirigible like aircraft. Charles Dellschau was a member of this highly secretive club and it is from his diaries we gain most of the information of this club.</p>
<p>Apparently this club had discovered a secret new fuel for powering their aircraft. Many critics claim that Dellschau's diaries are simply based on imagination and are not real experiences. Many researchers like Pete Navarro and Michael Busby feel there is a connection between the Sonora Aero Club and the mystery airship sightings of 1896-97. Most UFO researchers dismiss the airship sightings either as hoaxes or possible extra-terrestrial spaceships but some believe they were earthly man made airships. The Sonora Aero Club is mentioned as being the inventors of these airships and they were hired by the US military to construct and test fly these Airships in secret. Busby's book Solving the 1897 Airship Mystery contains information regarding these airships,their builders and pilots.Yet debate still continues regarding the Sonora Aero Club and the veracity of Dellschau's writings.</p>

<p>Alex Boncayao Brigade The Alex Boncayao Brigade (ABB), the breakaway urban hit squad of the Communist Party of the Philippines New People's Army, was formed in the mid-1980s. The ABB was added to the Terrorist Exclusion list in December 2001. The AAB is responsible for more than 100 murders and believed to have been involved in the murder in 1989 of U.S. Army Col. James Rowe in the Philippines. In March, 1997, the group announced it had formed an alliance with another armed group, the Revolutionary Proletarian Army (RPA). In March, 2000, the group claimed credit for a rifle grenade attack against the Department of Energy building in Manila and strafed Shell Oil offices in the central Philippines to protest rising oil prices. ABB has approximately 500 members and the largest RPA/ABB groups are on the Philippine islands of Luzon, Negros, and the Visayas.</p>

<p>"Shi`a" uses grave accent (`) for Arabic letter "ayn", which is one of conventional ways of doing it. It would be good to have a redirect to the main article using this spelling as well.</p>
<p>Note on procedure: obviously I'd rather put in the redirect myself and save somebody else's work. But for this I'm unwilling to go through the hoops of registering and remembering yet another password. So there you go.</p>

<p>The Royal Commission on the Status of Women in 1967, began touring the country of Canada. The role of the Commission was to examine the status of women and reccomend some steps that might be taken by the federal government to ensure equal opportunities with men in all aspects of Canadian society. The Commission discovered that... - in 1970 only 3.9% of managers were women -although 8 out of 10 provinces had eqaul-pay laws, women were still payed less than men for doing the same work - two thirds of people that were on welfare were women</p>
<p>In 1970 a report came out with 167 recommendations to ensure that wen and women had equal opportunities. Some recommendations were... -"gender" and "marital status" be prohibited as grounds for discrimination by employers -training programs offered by the federal governmentbe made more open to women -the federal government name more women judges to all courts within its jurisdiction -more qualified women from each province be appointed to the Senate as seats became vacant, until a more equitable balance between men and women were achieved -employed women be granted eighteen weeks of unemployment benefits for maternity leave.</p>
<p>As a result, the Commission helped establish an agenda of reforn for women's-rights groups in the 1970's.</p>

<p>Gamecheetz is an online sprite based comic, featuring many characters from the video game series Sonic, Megaman, Mario, Smash Bros., Metroid, Zelda, Kirby,Earthbound, and various other series. It has many sprite comic features that are thought of as cliche, such as breaking of the fourth wall and a character representing the comic owner. This character was called the director.The fact that it uses megaman sprites does not count as a cliche because they actually represent megaman characters and it uses sprites from other series as well. The "holes that were broken in the fourth wall" even ended up becoming deadly holes to another dimension. It has a very twisted story line, featuring character crossovers between series9(a notable instance of which is when Link from Legend of Zelda entered the world of maverick hunter X. time is actually measured in comics, It is always aware that it takes place in a 2d game world and that the characters are 2d sprites. megaman once got jealous because he was almost the only character who was still 8-bit and everyone else was 16. villains include a character that that destroys virtual code and attempts to cause a GAME OVER, or apocalypse, and a weirdo freak who wants to convert himself and a few others to 3 dimensional polygons and destroy everyone else. I suck at making wikis,if any members who are familiar with gamecheetz see this page, please edit it.</p>

<p>Kumbalath Sanku Pillai one of the father figures of the erstwhile Travancore politics was born in Thottuvayalil Bungalow, a land lord's family on February 15, 1898 at Prakkulam in Kollam. At the age of 18 Sankupillai moved to Panmana to look after the ancestral properties and he settled down there. He was credited with a convetous social influence in the initial days of his public life as a mediator among the people for solving their local disputes. Though an upper caste by birth Sanku Pillai fought relentlessly against untouchablity prevailed in the state following the words and deeds of Mahatma Gandhi. It was the revolutionary traits which spurred Sanku Pillai to organise a mixed meal and bathing with backward class brethren. Then he was barely 22 years old. And even before the "Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936" Sanku Pillai had opened the gates of Panayannarkavu Temple and Kannankulangara Temple near Panmana Asramam to all the people irrespective of their caste. " Backward caste members are also human beings. If God will flee from temple because of their entry into it let God flee " - he had said</p>
<p>It was the late barrister A.K. Pillai who initiated him into politics and Sankupillai became a part and parcel of the freedom struggle by plunging into it. He was put behind the bars many times. He was in the forefront of the struggle to end the Diwan's rule of Sir C.P. Rama Swamy Iyer in Travancore. Centered at Panmana Sanku Pillai played a keyrole in the political scenario of Kerala by taking many major decisions regarding the swearing in and out of some ministries.</p>
<p>In 1948 Sankupillai directed to alter the ministry presided over by Pattom Thanu Pillai for the reason that Pattom denied two cents of land at Thiruvananthapuram for treasuring the physical remains of Swedasabhimani Ramakrishnapillai, colossus in Malayalam journalism. Sanku Pillai had no doubt for doing this though Pattom belonged to his own party - State Congress. He was averse to be in power but he was the "King Maker". He has served as the K.P.C.C president due to the insistence of his fellow men during the short period 1949 to 1951.</p>
<p>The meeting of Sanku Pillai with Chattambi Swamikal was a hall mark in the legendary life of Sanku Pillai. He invited Swamikal to visit Panmana and Swamikal reached there at the fag end of his life. Though Swamikal was 45 years older than Sanku Pillai he always addressed Sanku Pillai as 'Karanavar'. Swamikal remained the mentor of Sanku Pillai. He established an Asramam at Panmana where the Samadhi of Swamikal is situating. Asramam was a nerve centre of kerala politics for half a century as Sanku Pillai was there to steer it.</p>
<p>Sanku Pillai was the founder of many educational and cultural institutions which include Devaswom Board College, Sasthamcottah. Sanku Pillai passed away on April 16, 1969.</p>
<p>Sanku Pillai has recounted his experiences in a book titled "ENTE KAZHINJAKALA SMARANAKAL", which is a pulsing document of the history of Kerala.</p>
<p>Sanku Pillai is survived by two daughters Madhavikutty Amma, Sathi Amma and younger son Vijaya Krishna Pillai.</p>

<p><b>The Arizona real estate bubble and what it means for those with weak credit who still rent?</b> As seen on PRweb right here:--&gt; <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/6/prweb396084.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/6/prweb396084.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>Banker in AZ Offers "Renters" With Weak Credit Equal Opportunity To Lock In At Lower Interest Rates For Home Ownership Why everyone needs to stop renting and buy their own home now.</p>
<p>Tucson, AZ (PRWEB) June 8, 2006 -- Southern Arizona, home of blazing hot days and Saguaro cacti is also home of a "blazing hot" real estate market. Real Estate appreciated almost 30% across the state of AZ in 2005 while the rest of the country averaged about an 8% increase (still not shabby). Analysts are waiting for the "booming housing bubble" to burst across the USA.</p>
<p>Though the market has slowed down a bit in AZ, it has been predicted that steady "above average" appreciation is expected to continue for at least the next 10 years here in the Grand Canyon state. While this is great for current home owners and investors a like, who it is not good for are those who are still renting, expecting that they will buy a home in AZ when they "are ready" or when they "have enough for a down payment", or the most common, "when their credit improves". None, I repeat, None of the reasons are "necessarily" a road block to home ownership in today's market. In Fact using these excuses to delay buying your own home could cost you a lot of money in the long run.</p>
<p><b>For those who currently rent in AZ and are expecting to buy in AZ do not buy soon they may find themselves completely priced out of the market and unable to afford home ownership.</b></p>
<p>Not only are appreciation rates in southern AZ currently 4 times the national average but interest rates are now creeping back up. As interest rates start a slight move back up, many borrowers are locking in their loans at the current interest rates. The process allows them to avoid any future rate increases just to buy time to think about their loan. Typically, the privilege of locking in a rate is only utilized by borrowers with excellent credit. One lender in southern AZ is offering the opportunity to lock in for those with marginal or questionable credit.</p>
<p><b>No second hand treatment for self-employed, single parents, previous bankruptcies, foreign nationals.</b></p>

<p>Maybe you heard a new popular, 2006, slang term "nucka" meaning "nigga",it has been created recently because it less racially offensive and more socially acceptable than, "nigga" which is/was a popular slang term as well. It is the equivalent of "yerd" which can substitute "ya heard" or "yomsayin" meaning "you know what im sayin". It can be used in many ways such as mucka nucka or "nucka brotha" but usually substituted for "nigga"; example: What is up mah nucka!? It was created of two american slang terms, example: Nigga + Sucka = Nucka</p>

<p>RAS SHEEHAMA was born in 1966 in Onakayale in Northern Namibia. The Oshivambo people of the region have a rich and well-developed musical heritage. At the age of 13, Ras went into exile in Angola and later moved to Zambia as a refugee. It was there that he taught himself to play the guitar. At age 15, he felt a calling to the Rastafarian way of life and his love for reggae began. Ras further developed his musical talent in Nigeria and returned to Namibia before independence in 1990. Today he is, without doubt, the most accomplished Namibian performer and has already released four successful albums. Sheehama has performed in Germany, England, Cuba, Portugal and in France in 1997 au Printemps de Bourges and this summer (2005) at the Montreux Jazz under the Sky as well as The Fêtes de Genève. In 2001 he opened for the legendary reggae act Don Carlos in Johannesburg. Ras also opened for Manu di Bango when he performed in Windhoek and Ismael Lo in 1997 in The Reunion. He is always invited to perform at the official Presidential functions. He was in Paris in October 2004 to promote “A Handful of Namibians &amp; Papa Wemba” a compilation of the most promising artists Namibia has to offer.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-11_9397.html" title="Edit section: Prophezine">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Prophezine</span></h2>
<p>The Mission of Prophezine is to carry out the command of the Lord Christ Jesus:</p>
<p>"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations" Matthew 28:19</p>
<p>Prophezine is a Christian publication grounded in the deity of Christ and the inerrancy of scripture. The major intent of the editors is the presentation of the Gospel:</p>
<p>"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; ." 1 Cor. 15:3-4</p>
<p>What We Believe</p>
<p>We believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be the verbally and plenary inspired Word of God. The Scriptures are inerrant, infallible and God-breathed, and therefore are the final authority for faith and life. The sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments are the complete and divine revelation of God to Man. The Scriptures shall be interpreted according to their normal grammatical-historical meaning. The King James Version of the Bible shall be the official translation used by Prophezine (2 Tim. 3:16-17; 2 Pet. 1:20-21)</p>
<p>We believe that Christ will literally rapture His church prior to the 70th week of Daniel, followed by His glorious, premillennial arrival on the earth at least seven years later to set up His 1,000 year kingdom rule from Jerusalem over the earth.</p>
<p>We believe that God's plan for history demands a consistent distinction between national Israel and the church which includes an ongoing plan for national, ethnic Israel that culminates in Christ's millennial kingdom. Prophezine will and always continue to fully support of the nation of Israel.</p>
<p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became man, without ceasing to be God, having been conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary, in order that He might reveal God and redeem sinful men (Isa. 7:14; 9:6)</p>
<p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ saved us through grace and accomplished our redemption through his death on the cross as a representative, vicarious, substitutionary sacrifice; and, that our justification is made sure by His literal, physical resurrection from the dead (Acts 2:18-36; Rom. 3:24-25; I Peter 2:24; Eph. 1:7; I Peter 1:3-5).</p>
<p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ ascended to Heaven, and is now exalted at the right hand of God, where, as our High Priest, He fulfills the ministry of Representative, Intercessor, and Advocate (Acts 1:9-10; Heb. 9:24; 7:25; Rom. 8:34; 1 John 2:1-2)..</p>
<p>WHAT IS PROPHEZINE</p>
<p>Prophezine: the Newsletter began in 1993 as a ministry of sharing news of interest via e-mail, gradually evolving into an electronic newsletter. This is the "core" of the Prophezine ministry. The newsletter is packed with articles concerning prophecy, end-times events, and world conditions of special interest to Christians, as well as timely newsbytes.</p>
<p>The Prophezine website is an outgrowth and extension of the newsletter. In fact, the website has become the driving force behind the Prophezine ministry. In the past on the site we have had a guestbook, discussion boards (forums), archived newsletters, the PZ Alliance division, News Bites Email List, and more! The future brings bigger and better.</p>
<p>Ray Gano - Founder &amp; Owner of Prophezine</p>
<p>I was born May 9, 1961. I attended a private Christian school from 5th grade through high school. I have known the Lord all my life, but only started really serving Him 110% about 1993. I have been into Bible prophecy much of my Christian walk. I now live in Texas with my wife Tracye and our 4 children.</p>
<p>One day while I was visiting my best friend in Montana, he told me about what was going on in the world and that our time here is short. At first I blew him off and said "Yeah right, Rapture and the Mark of the Beast." Tim told me to check it out for myself. So, as a good Berean would, I started digging into the Word and watching the news. Pieces of the puzzle started to come together. Israel a nation... Russia... the EU... smart cards... bio-chips... on and on it went. All this time Tim and I were sending e-mail back and forth keeping each other abreast of any news we found out. A little time later more people joined our e-mail list. And that is how PropheZine came about. Ever since that time I have had a sense of urgency about spreading the Gospel— telling people about the Good News that our Lord is returning soon.</p>
<p>I started publishing PropheZine about 1993 and the Lord has really been blessing me and this work. The web site is an extension of the PropheZine newsletter ministry.</p>
<p>One the main reasons I published PropheZine was to let people see that Bible prophecy is coming to pass and things that are spoken about in the Bible are true. Many people are not interested in "listening about Jesus," but when you begin to tell them about what is going to happen in the future, they are all ears. The Lord has opened many doors this way, allowing me to spread the Good News about our Lord and Savior.</p>
<p>Another reason I published PropheZine is because there are many Christians out there who have fallen asleep and/or forgotten their first love just as I had.</p>
<p>I believe that other Christians need to experience what happened to me a few years ago. That is why I go to great extents to show different stories and web sites as proof that prophecy is coming to pass— the "Shock Treatment." At least that is how it felt to me when my friend and I spoke that first time. A little voice inside my head said" HEY! Wake up and smell the coffee, Ray!" So, in sharing PropheZine with you, I do not mean to frighten you but to inform you of crucial truth.</p>
<p>As many of you know, in 1998 there were numerous changes in my life. I decided that it was time to pursue other interests and passed the mantle on to Bob Lally. Bob was Owner/Webmaster from Sept. 1996 to the Spring of 2002, when the mantle was passed to John Terry.</p>
<p>Now I have come full circle. John Terry asked if I want the mantle of resposibility back and I have gladly accepted. I have rejoined PZ's Management Team in the Spring of 2005 and now currently serve as the Executive Director of Prophezine along with my wife Tracye, we are excited to be back and ready to serve.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy PropheZine. Please print the newsletter and share it with your friends, family, and fellow church members. If you have any doctrinal questions, please see the PropheZine Statement of Faith. We constantly are looking for new articles for the newsletter, so we'd welcome any articles you may have written. If the Spirit moves you, please put pen to paper. This is basically a site to share such information.</p>
<p>I pray that our Lord continues blessing you and your loved ones, until we meet together in the clouds with our Lord.</p>

<p><b>Advomentary</b> - an advocacy <a href="../../../d/o/c/Documentary.html" title="Documentary">documentary</a> motion picture. An advomentary uses documentary production styles to promote a specific viewpoint or “spin”. The objective of advomentary content is primarily persuasion. An advomentary is intended to promote a specific ideology, judgment, attitude, or perspective based upon presentation of the related facts.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Typically an advomentary would cover a political, economic, ecological, or social issue. Other possible themes could be technical topics such as promoting a clean energy technology or a new medical innovation. Any topic that generates controversy is an appropriate theme for an advomentary.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The word advomentary is a linguistic <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portmanteau.html" title="Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> which is formed by combining the words <b>advo</b>cacy and docu<b>mentary</b>.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Advomentaries are typically low-budget productions that are financed by interest groups or producers with a strong opinion upon an issue. Although these productions are often supportive of social objectives, they are intended to make a profit. The viewing public has shown over and over again that they will pay for the privilege of being wooed by a persuasive presentation.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Advomentary vs. Documentary</b></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A documentary is an objective presentation of the facts with non-controversial interpretation. An advomentary uses similar production techniques to promote a specific interpretation of the facts where there is often sharp division of opinion and may also advocate viewer action.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Documentaries are intended to inform.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Advomentaries are intended to inform and persuade.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Advomentary vs. Infomercial</b></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The typical <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infomercial.html" title="Infomercial">infomercial</a> promotes a product, service, charity, or political goal. The typical advomentary promotes an idea or perspective. Infomercials are television productions that are designed to produce a direct quantifiable response from the viewer population. Advomentaries are movie productions designed to produce a qualitative response within the viewer.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Infomercials promote sponsored products or services.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Advomentaries promote broad-based ideas or viewpoints.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Advomentary vs. Propaganda</b></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Advomentaries are intended to be an honest attempt to present a case using factual background information. <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">Propaganda</a> is an attempt to persuade using any available fact or fiction to promote a self-serving agenda. Propaganda is often non-factual and can use demagoguery, fear, and hate to achieve its goals.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Advomentaries use facts to promote a sincere viewpoint.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Propaganda uses facts and/or nonfacts to promote a cynical viewpoint.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>History</b></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Advocacy motion pictures are almost as old as film itself. The unrivalled power of film and video to persuade was apparent from the start. Until recently, advocacy content was rarely intended for profit and required financing from interest groups and sponsors who considered it promotional expense.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The modern era of advocacy film most likely started in 1989 with <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a>’s first hit independent production “Roger and Me”, an investigation of General Motors treatment of employees and the devastating impact of GM layoffs on Flint, Michigan. With that film, Moore proved that people will pay to watch advocacy content and that these productions can generate massive profits. Moore developed a distinctive guerilla moviemaking style that has become synonymous with the genre.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Later productions expanded on Moore’s methods by incorporating classical narrative documentary and investigative journalism techniques to make their case. Higher quality film and video have allowed for slicker productions but many directors have found that the low-budget look often makes for more compelling advocacy.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The market power of advomentary content is now clearly established. Michael Moore’s recent “<a href="../../../f/a/h/Fahrenheit_9_11_5431.html" title="Fahrenheit 9/11">Fahrenheit 9/11</a>” grossed over $200 million in profits and sold 3 million DVDs. This success has inspired big-gun producers to enter this genre. Noted TV producer <a href="../../../d/a/v/Davis_Guggenheim_e784.html" title="Davis Guggenheim">Davis Guggenheim</a> was behind <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a>’s “An Inconvenient Truth”. Other big Hollywood-style productions are now being planned.</p>

<p>Ben Malcolmson was a sportswriter for the Daily Trojan, the student newspaper of the University of Southern California, in the spring of 2006 when his life changed forever. In pursuit of a good story, he tried out as a walk-on for the nationally ranked USC Trojan football team, and he made it.</p>
<p>The next few weeks of his life were a whirlwind, participating in numerous interviews, practices, team meetings, grueling workouts, and even garnering interest in the rights for a movie about his life. His priorities immediately changed, as the graduating senior communications major decided to stay on an extra year as a graduate student and walk-on football player.</p>
<p>Ben spends his free time with Alpha Gamma Omega, the Christ-centered fraternity, of which he was president of for the Spring and Fall of 2005. A standout student, he was a member of the prestigious Order of the Torch in 2006, and earned the title Greek Man of the Year. At the time of this writing, he is rehabbing from a dislocated shoulder suffered in Spring practice, hoping to rejoin the team in the Fall.</p>

<p>The eating habits of the Mauritians inevitably reflect the ethnic diversity of its people: Creole rougailles, Indian curries, Muslim bryanis, Chinese sweet-and-sour pork, French delicate dishes, English bacon and eggs, ...... you name it, you'll get it there. Basic ingredients of the Creole cuisine are the tomatoes (known as pommes d'amour), onions, ginger, garlic and chillies. Palm heart and Camarons (giant prawns), venison and wild boar are favourite items of French cuisine. Fresh fish and seafood set the keynote for Chinese cooking. The traditional blends of home crushed spices are the sauce base for mouth glowing Indian curries. The delicate blend of spiciness and subtle mix of ingredients constitute the setting for the event-related Muslim cuisine. Local vegetables and fruits abound all year round in a colourful selection of mouth watering delights.

<p>The UNEF was created in 1907 as a grouping of local students' associations in order to represent the students with national and local authorities. From 1918 to 1940, the UNEF created university restaurants and sanatoriums and originated the French students' welfare system (creation of the Conseil Supérieur des Oeuvres Sociales in 1936). After World War II, the UNEF adopted the <b>Charter of Grenoble</b> (la Charte de Grenoble) which recognise the student as an "<i>intellectual young worker</i>", which gives him rights and duties. In 1948, thanks to the lobying of the National Union, the French government created the <b>Mutuelle Nationale des Etudiants de France</b> and the students' social security system. In the 1950s, many members of the UNEF supported the independance of Algeria and members who were against any political position created a non-political, non-unionist organisation called Fédération Nationale des Etudiants de France. In the 1960s, the UNEF was divided into many political influences and in 1971 the Union was splited between the <b>UNEF-Renouveau</b> (later UNEF-Solidarité Etudiante, under the communist influence) and the <b>UNEF-Unité Syndicale</b> (under the influence of non-communist left-wing parties). The movement is partially reunited in 1981 with the creation of the UNEF Indépendante &amp; Démocratique (<b>UNEF-ID</b>) by the grouping of UNEF-US and other groups. The final reunification occured in 2001, with the merging of UNEF-ID and UNEF-SE into one <b>UNEF</b> which proclame its independance from any political party. The UNEF is now the main students' and youth organisation in France and played a major role in the mobilisation against the Contrat Première Embauche in 2006.</p>
