<p>The start of a list of high schools, it is actually a list of state-level lists, which I'm also proposing for deletion. This is clearly what categories are for. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 19:14, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Agree with <a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> for this one, categories are enough. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 19:51, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, as well as all the sub-lists. Categories list only articles that exist, while page can show those that don't. And since there seems to be a disagreement on whether individual high schools <i>should</i> have articles, this list may be all they get. <a href="../../../s/j/o/User%7ESjorford_d4b9.html" title="User:Sjorford">sjorford</a><b><a href="../../../s/j/o/User_talk%7ESjorford_13fb.html" title="User talk:Sjorford">://</a></b> 22:09, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b>, though preferably someone should check the schools have been categorised first; an article on <s>"<a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_the_United_States_of_America_19a0.html" title="Education in the United States of America">Education in the United States of America</a>" would be welcome</s> <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_the_United_States_31b7.html" title="Education in the United States">Education in the United States</a> exists however, <s>that page can even list schools (which aren't listed on similar articles related to specific states) if appropriate and where a school requires an article but doesn't have one it can be listed on requested articles</s> why not just merge if we're going to keep <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozzerati_67af.html" title="User:Mozzerati">Mozzerati</a> 22:15, 2005 Feb 2 (UTC) (updated 20:31, 2005 Feb 3 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>Delete, as well as all sub-lists</b>. There are around 17000 schools in the US, as quoted somewhere above. The page would be impossible, even split to sub-pages by state.

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia is not limited in size as are other encyclopediae; it would be wonderful if a user could (eventually) come to Wikipedia and learn about nearly every high school.

<li>Categories are a (relatively) new feature and the idea is to get rid of most lists and use categories instead. This deletion of lists should make maintainance easier, which is to say the reason to get rid of lists is because if we have them the same work has to be done twice in different ways. This has nothing to do with the disagreement about whether to keep school articles or not. The lists of, universities and, prisons and gods should probably go too..</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I must respectfully disagree with <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZantastik_9813.html" title="User:Zantastik">Zantastik</a>. There just isn't anything <i>worth</i> learning about most high schools. On the topic of U.S. high schools, one might find various aggregate statistics useful, but a complete list is just overwhelming. The information on most high schools most properly belongs in an 'Education' section in their parent community's article (or in a related 'Education in Springfield' article.) <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia is not a general knowledge base</a>. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> 17:49, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I see a lot of knee-jerk reactions on this page by individuals that obviously are not considering merits and just voting on preconceived notions. Deleting this page has nothing to do with inclusion versus deletion. One can vote to delete this page and still safely vote to include every school in the country without fear of being called a hypocrite. Back in the dark ages of wikipedia, it was necessary to maintain lists because this was the best way to group similar information. Now, we have the category, which does a much better job. I am against including every school, but if schools are all to be kept, I would not object to categorizing them in a variety of ways, but categories are the answer, not unweildly and unmaintainable lists. I feel that some people are voting here because they see the word "school" in the header and stop their rational analysis at that point. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 19:02, Feb 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The debate rages on. For what it is worth, I tried this with the List of Manitoba School Divisions by first listing each of the school boards, then an alphabetical list of schools in each division. Two words: 1)In, 2)Sane. I hit the 32k wall early. Categories are the way to go with this I think. I created the category incorporating the original division list (which is complete and accurate) and have been removing them from the list as articles are created. A project like every school in the states being listed is just crazy IMO. Creating categories on boards/districts/divisions or whatever term they use in the states seems like a better way to go. Placing each of the 17,000 public schools in one list makes it exceedingly difficult to find any or even a group of them. Categories just make more sense as a way to tackle this, I think. <a href="../../../w/e/a/User%7EWeaponofmassinstruction_5523.html" title="User:Weaponofmassinstruction">Weaponofmassinstruction</a> 05:44, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't know why some people are arguing about deleting lists of schools. <i>This</i> article is a list of <i>lists</i>. Such a thing is plainly better done with the category mechanism, irrespective of how schools are handled. The advantage that lists have over categories is that lists can contain redlinks. A redlink <i>in a list of lists</i> simply makes no sense. <b>Delete</b> in favour of categorizing the individual lists into <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_schools_f0e0.html" title="Category:Lists of schools">Category:Lists of schools</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:34, 2005 Feb 7 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>This page is now preserved as an archive of the debate and, like some other VfD subpages, is no longer 'live'. Subsequent comments on the issue, the deletion, or the decision-making process should be placed on the relevant 'live' pages. <b>Please do not edit this page</b>.</p>
