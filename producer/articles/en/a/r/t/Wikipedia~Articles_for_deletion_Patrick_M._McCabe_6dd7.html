<p>I can't find references to this author online, nor can I find this author's books in libraries or bookstores. Also, it appears the editors who create articles about McCabe, his characters and his stories make very few edits to Wikipedia not relating to this author. I'm not knowledgeable about contemporary Australian literature, so I would like someone to correct me if this figure is indeed notable. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 15:47, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. I just finished mentioning how glad I was that Wikipedia <i>finally</i> has an article on McCabe, my literary hero, in the discussion page.

McCabe is one of Adelaide's finest writers, and it is a great insult to the city and to this great man to remove this article.

<li><b>Don't delete</b> I am the original creator of this article, and I would like to apologise for some of the above comments. I know it looks quite suspicious that all these messages were sent from the same IP address but there is a valid explanation. I am a high school student and a fan of the admittedly little-known author Patrick M. McCabe. I was a relative Wikipedia novice and was pleased to create this article and see it accepted by the Wikipedia community. When it was nominated for deletion, for reasons which I am still unsure of, I was upset and asked various school friends to help save my article from deletion by sending messages of support. I did not realise that apparently every computer in our extensive school network shares the same IP address. Also, as can be seen, some of my friends did not take my request seriously. Some insulted me; some insulted McCabe and others insulted other Wikipedia users. My apologies to any offended Wikipedia users. However, some friends did take this seriously and their points are legitimate ones, not to be dismissed simply because they came from the same IP address. I hope this dispels some of the suspicion my article has aroused. I assure you that Patrick M. McCabe is a real – albeit little-known – short story author. I would dispute the claim that he is too obscure to warrant an article, after all, even ‘Big Brother’ contestants seem to be worthy of Wikipedia articles. The article and related articles contain no lies or deception other than the natural bias that may have surfaced due to my being an admirer of McCabe.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 58.84.67.187 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_58.84.67.187_882a.html" title="Special:Contributions/58.84.67.187">contribs</a>) .</small>

<dd>To put our predicament here simply, we have absolutely no way to know whether what you are saying is right... or wrong. There is no evidence of this person existing as an australian author that any of the contributors here could find, and most authors have their books reviewed in journals, or have them on amazon even.

<li><b>Don't delete</b>.Mr. Patrick M. McCabe is a beacon of success. I was fortunate enough to meet him at one of his very exclusive book signings in his home town. I think Patrick would find it greatly offensive his position on Wikipedia is facing deletion.
