<p>(<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Santorum_cc75.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Santorum">1st AFD</a>) The information in the first five sentences of this article is already in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_Controversy_5577.html" title="Santorum Controversy">Santorum Controversy</a>. The "References in the media" section is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> unless it can be shown that sources independent of, say, the <i>Economist</i> took note of its reference of "santorum." Everything else in the article is unsourced and unsourceable by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> sources that are <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">independent of Dan Savage or those working to popularize this neologism</a>. "Santorum" itself fails <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, which requires reliable sources <i>about</i> the neologism. I didn't wade through all the Google hits, but a cursory look shows lots of unreliable, POV sources like blogs, and I found zero sources in a Lexis-Nexis search (even in local Pennsylvania sources) that discuss "santorum" beyond a dicdef or verify the material in the article beyond the first five sentences. The ADS award,<a href="http://www.americandialect.org/2004_Words_of_the_Year_Final_Vote_.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.americandialect.org/2004_Words_of_the_Year_Final_Vote_.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> of which so much was made in the first AFD, is trivial, and the ADS source provides only a dictionary definition, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" title="WP:NOT">nothing we can build a Wikipedia article on</a>.</p>
<p>I'm puzzled why the first AFD resulted in keep. The closer said there was "substantial support among established commenters that this word has now reached encyclopedic notability." But, assuming "encyclopedic notability" refers to <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">the primary notability criterion</a>, I think the closer's conclusion is untenable, given that the first AFD produced, and the article right now provides, no non-trivial, reliable, external sources of which "santorum" is the subject, which we could use to write a verifiable article. Many keep voters in the first AFD cited "widespread use," but again, at Wikipedia we need reliable sources about the term, not sources that use the term, because Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" title="WP:NOT">not a dictionary</a>.</p>
<p>I suspect that many people who will come to participate in this AFD are shocked that anyone could think this term is not notable. To them I would emphasize that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability has an objective meaning on Wikipedia</a>: if someone can find multiple non-trivial reliable external sources about "santorum," then that would establish notability. Otherwise, not.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <b>delete</b> for failing <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article meets all content policy and criteria. The article itself includes references to independent non-trivial coverage in the media and elsewhere - I don't need to repeat them as they're there for the reading. It's a bit tenuous to say that there must be multiple references then dismiss out of hand the multiple references. Just because one says they are "trivial" does not make them so. The term has been around long enough that the "neologism" label is starting to wear thin. I fail to see how it fails <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> when secondary sources are cited. There is also no evidence to show it fails <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, etc. It appears the strongest reasoning against the article is that it's not "notable", relying on disputed <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">disputed policy</a> that is still under discussion. It strikes me that the other key reason this is up for nomination is because it is "disgusting" or offends someone's political point of view; however, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" title="WP:NOT">not censored</a>. The term has clearly taken on a life of its own and is certainly more "notable" (if relying on that alone) than many of the other pop-culture terms or memes that have articles. Nothing has changed to alter the reasoning for "keep" from the prior AfD. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 00:47, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"references to independent non-trivial coverage" -- If you mean the story in The Philadelphia Inquirer, that story is about Santorum the man. There's exactly one sentence in there about "santorum" the term. The ADS reference is no more than a dicdef. All the other references are unreliable. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> does have a disputed tag on it, but <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> does not, and this fails <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 00:58, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>(further comment) Even if you think the neologism label has started to wear thin (even though "santorum" is still not in any reputable dictionaries as far as I know), then it's a word not a neologism, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a dictionary applies. Whether it's a word or a neologism, it doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:10, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I was the proposer of the original AfD. I became convinced that the political act by Dan Savage was notable, but it seems clear to me that the term itself is not a successful neologism. There are no citations in durable media by independent sources. Savage's use of the term as a political stunt (not intended as a pejorative term) was very successful, and that act needs to be recorded in WP somewhere. I would be happy to see the article changed to "santorum (sexual slang activism)" or something that ceased to imply it was a successful neologism. I'd also be fine with deleting it, so long as the information is mostly retained in <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savage_Love_b882.html" title="Savage Love">Savage Love</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 00:57, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> As became apparent in the last AfD, there are certainly people who dislike the senator who nevertheless voted Keep, so I don't think we can assume an agenda beyond what's in the nom. With regard to the American Dialect Society: the nomination of a word for one of its categories requires no documentation at all; the words voted on are (per an ADS member) typically "stunt words". I think the nomination is evidence of the notability of the political act but it is not evidence of the spread of the neologism. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 02:20, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Actually I did read your comments. Frankly I'm confused by your call for sources about the term rather than those that use it. Those are what are provided. Neither the Daily Show nor the Economist were describing fecal matter and happened to use the word 'Santorum' in that context. But were concerned by the fact that the word <i>Santorum</i> was coined in notable circumstances and is now in use. The Daily Show is admittedly a satirical programme, but one with a considerable world-wide viewership. The Economist however is a totally serious economic and political journal dating back to 1843. That the term has become notable enough for it to be mentioned by that paper in an article about the Senator shows that it is notable not only in the US but also in the UK. Such coverage seems to me to satisfy Wikipedia's objective notability criteria. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 02:47, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm still reviewing your revision, but what I see so far looks like more of what there was before: OR, primary sources, and unreliable POV sources. The one exception seems to be the Slate source, which is no more than a paragraph about "santorum" and the ADS award. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 09:07, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have used primary sources to demonstrate the timeline of creation (which was vague and incorrect before), not for notability. I have tried to make every thing I added a cited assertion, and several of those citations are print media. I'm sorry they are not to your liking, but there is no prohibition against what you call a "POV source" (since all sources have POV). Wikipedia policy requires us to cite POV assertions, but does not prevent their use in articles. I didn't have anything in particular I could do about the website section right now, so that's still unreferenced. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 09:23, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry for coming off so harsh before. Your revision is exceptionally well-written and well-organized, I'll give you that, but still problematic, I think. First, as to POV sources, when the only sources on a topic are POV, it's impossible to write an NPOV article. (I also think that when the only sources taking note of a topic are on the same page politically, the topic's notability should be questionable, but that's open for discussion.) Now let's go over the article. The lead and background are already in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_controversy.html" title="Santorum controversy">Santorum controversy</a>. The "Contest" section, as you acknowledge, is only verified in a primary source, so the propriety of having that material in Wikipedia is questionable. The first paragraph of the "Popularity" section uses one sentence in one source to establish a tenous (at best) connection between "santorum" and Santorum's iconic status as a social conservative. The "Web activism" section, as you acknowledge is unsourced and, I think, is likely sourceable only by primary sources. Now we come to the only material in the article that I think may be appropriate for inclusion in Wikipedia -- the Slate reference. The POV problem remains however. Slate is a reputable source, but its bias is well known, and in the absence of other sources covering the ADS award, I don't think inclusion is appropriate in the final analysis. In any case, this source yields only 4 sentences about the term -- fairly trivial (though not totally, I'll admit). Finally, the rest of the article, is, yes, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, as a synthesis of various media references of the term. Most egregious is the hint, every so subtly dropped, without the support of any reliable source, that the term may have contributed to Santorum's defeat. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 09:56, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>(further comment) So, the big picture, in my view (fwiw): The term itself fails <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. The ancillary material about origins and repercussions is not reliably sourceable -- except for the material you added that's based on the 4 sentences in Slate. I wouldn't object to a merge of this material to <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_controversy.html" title="Santorum controversy">Santorum controversy</a> and/or <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savage_Love_b882.html" title="Savage Love">Savage Love</a>. (Or you could insert it yourself so a merge is unnecessary.) However the Slate reference cannot by itself sustain a stand-alone article, because it's brief (wrt the term) and because there are no other sources to balance the POV. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 10:43, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Re: "good quality" -- I think we can all agree that Dhartung's rewrite is of excellent <i>copyedit</i> quality (I wish I could write and organize as well as that). The problem is that everything in the article (except for the 2nd and 3rd sentences in "References in media" section) is either (1) verified by a primary source, (2) original research, or (3) already in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_controversy.html" title="Santorum controversy">Santorum controversy</a>. Moreover there is still no sign the term itself passes <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. The 2nd and 3rd sentences in "References in media" section are verified in a <i>reliable</i> (though POV) source, which is why I would not object to merging those two sentences into <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_controversy.html" title="Santorum controversy">Santorum controversy</a> (though Dhartung can do that manually himself to preserve GFDL credit). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:16, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not sure what you mean by <b>POV source</b>. There is no requirement that sources be neutral, most will be advancing a point of view. The usual response if one feels a source is partisan is to counterbalance with another source that shows the opposite point of view. In this case, one that claimed the word had seen little use out of the Dan Savage context and had failed to become part of wider popular culture. AfD is not the place to address problems with NPOV or lack thereof- that should be done in the editing of the article. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 16:24, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The point about the POV source is somewhat trivial as it only concerns those two sentences, as the other sources are all either unreliable or primary. But as to the POV issue itself: you make a good point -- "the usual response...is to counterbalance" -- but, I'm afraid, you reach the wrong conclusion: "AfD is not the place to address problems with NPOV." In this case, there is no sign that it is <i>possible</i> to write the article using counterbalancing sources, because those 4 sentences in Slate are the only (even slightly) non-trivial source anyone has found. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:29, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG DELETE</b> I couldn't care less about politics so I feel fairly neutral when it comes to political-based articles like this. Anyway, my thoughts are theses:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1) The TERM itself must be the subject of mulitiple, non-trivial, independent, Reliable, Reputable, third-party sources. What that means is that just like any thing else, the sources have to be reporting on term, not using it. Non-Trivial means that the news/magazine/web/tv/radio article must be completely about the term and nothing else. A sentance or paragraph in a news/magazine/web/tv/radio article talking about a different or slightly related matter does not make that source non-trivial. It's a mention in passing and disqualified as a source.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) Many of the keep votes here are not baseing their arguements on policies but rather their POV. "simply because there's no consensus", "[the] effect that this term has had on pop culture", "per last afd", "[because] no one uses wikitionary". Many of the delete opinions have been made using the wikipolicies to back their comments. I argue on policies, not POV thinking.</dd>

<li>I have to agree with Uucp, unless I am completely misunderstanding guidelines this does seem like a textbook neologism article and, to repeat a comment I made above, I am not sure what further sources people could be demanding - it occurs to me that this article is being held to an <i>exceedingly</i> stringent standard re: debates about the validity/primacy/notability of every source and statement.

<li><b>Comment</b> I disagree with Pan Dan. I DO NOT think that Slate reference as a non-trivial coverage. My requirements are the same as wikipedia's. Articles must be about the term itself and nothing else. They should talk about the term, it's uses, history and such. A paragraph in an article about the senator or about the senator's comments are not what I call non-trivial sources for the TERM. However if I am over-ruled in this case by the closing admin, then I wish to point out....that's only ONE non-trivial coverage. Multiple (and in practice, admins usually hold articles to an unwriten 'three sources' rule) sources do not exist. So the the American Dialect Society called the term Most outrageous of 2004...doesn't matter.

<li>(Further reply to Sharkface) I don't think the rewrite addresses any of the concerns of the delete comments (of course, I can only speak for myself for sure). The term itself still fails <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.

<dd>If that isn't a pretty POV statement in itself. If one has to "reaffirm" ones "!vote" because of the changes, I emphatically reaffirm my comment to keep.

<dd>The paper is independent of Savage in the sense that he doesn't work directly for them. However the fact that the Weekly syndicates his column does raise questions of non-independence as the paper benefits from promoting its readers' interest in Savage's columns.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I find this nomination fundamentally flawed on numerous levels, not to mention a troubling indicator of the mis-application of WP guidelines. I do understand that the article has changed since the original nomination, but there are a number of lingering issues which should be discussed. However, first let's look at the merits of the nomination arguments themselves. The issue of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> has been, for the most part, resolved with the current rewrite, as have the arguments concerning <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_Dictionary" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a Dictionary</a>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The issue of reliable sources is perhaps the most troubling part of the nomination for me, and I find it to be completely unfounded. Dan Savage sources are used to identify the term and chronicle the events surrounding its creation, precisely as a primary source must be used as per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. As it was once put to me: "<i>In the absence of a secondary source, we use a primary source for uncontroversial claims about the subject. Such primary sources can't establish importance, but they can be used for simple, uncontroversial claims in the absence of any alternative secondary source.</i>"</dd>
<dd>Moving on, I fail to see how this article "fails" <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, as it (#1) does not use the term in the article except by way of definition or example, (#2a) is an article <i>about</i> a neologism, not just a definition, (#2b) is backed up by verifiable sources, such as <i>The Economist</i>, <i>Tuscon Weekly</i>, and the <i>Daily Show</i>, concerning both the nature of the word as well as the use thereof, and (#3) is supported by the same secondary sources listed previously. The assertation that the article does not meet some arbitrary "minimum secondary source count" such that it still does not satisfy <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> #3 is another fundamentally flawed argument, attempting to create a requirement where there is none. While it is true that there are not an <i>overwhelming</i> number of secondary sources to support the article, the permience of the term in common sources is naturally limited due to the fact that it is a <i>sexually explicit term</i>; as such, any expectation of finding secondary sources should be adjusted appropriately.</dd>
<dd>Finally, the issue of notability should be no issue at all; though the appearance in common or popular media is spotty, the term has nonetheless been used in a major magazine as well as a major and significant nationally broadcast cable news/comedy program at least twice.</dd>
<dd>Additionally, I find the nomination fundamentally flawed from another significant point: <b>the criterea used to nominate this article for deletion are all <i>guidelines</i>, not policy</b>. Guidelines are either suggestions on how Wikipedia articles generally should be constructed, (e.g. the <a href="../../../m/s/_/WP%7EMS_6031.html" title="WP:MS">Manual of Style</a>) or they are synthesized suggestions on how to interpret Wikipedia policy. (e.g, <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>) If an article can only be nominated under the justification of guidelines but <i>not</i> the underlying policies upon which the guidelines were constructed then the most one should justifiably expect to happen to an article is that it be rewritten. Guidelines <a href="../../../g/u/i/WP%7EGUIDELINES_2048.html" title="WP:GUIDELINES">by definition</a> are more flexible and likely to have exceptions, and as such should not be used as a rigid measure of whether or not an article should be deleted. -- <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Y|yukichigai</a> 00:33, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First, regarding your point that it's OK to use Dan Savage as a primary source for the circumstances surrounding his coinage of the term: The problem here is not just the reliability of Dan Savage as a source, it's that the efforts being described are those of Savage advancing a POV about Sen. Santorum, and these efforts cannot be described in an NPOV fashion because no external reliable sources have <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">taken note</a> of these efforts. It's really a failure both of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. I would further say that in the absence of external sources that have <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">taken note</a> of Savage's efforts, it is unwarranted to use Wikipedia as a platform for advertising these efforts.
<dl>
<dd>That brings another point to mind: <b>there is no policy prohibiting the use of POV sources, only prohibiting the creation of POV articles</b>. Just because an article is dripping with personal opinion and the like does not, under any circumstances, necessarily mean that there are no facts which can be extracted or otherwise referenced from that source. Had the Dan Savage references been used to assert the <i>notability</i> of the topic there would be a serious argument. As it is the references are only used to 1) define the term, 2) show that he held a contest to determine the definition, 3) show that he set up a website to promote the popularity of the term, and 4) provide a quote as to his response to certain key events. Again, these are all perfectly permissiable uses of a primary source. -- <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Y|yukichigai</a> 01:30, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"there is no policy prohibiting the use of POV sources, only prohibiting the creation of POV articles" -- would you not call this section of the article POV? It's about Savage's efforts to advance a POV about Sen. Santorum, and these efforts have been been non-trivially noted by no mainstream media source. It thus calls attention to a negative aspect of Santorum with no possibility of counterbalancing sources. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:59, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>By itself the section would appear to promote a POV. However, the section is in relation to the <i>origin</i> of the term and is simply detailing the history, the facts behind the origin. While there was a POV behind the term it is nonetheless a relevant piece of information concerning its origin. While no currently cited secondary sources have specifically covered the topic of Savage's efforts, secondary sources <i>have</i> covered the term itself and briefly touched on its origins.

<dd>Second, regarding your points about <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>: The problem is not that the <i>article</i> fails <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>; only neologisms can fail WP:NEO. The article fails <i><a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">No Original Research</a></i> for synthesizing information about "the nature of the word as well as the use thereof," as you put it. Your point that the refences are verifiable is irrelevant in the face of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Moreover, the <i>term</i> itself does fail <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, because there are no non-trivial reliable external sources about it.
<dl>
<dd>You're splitting hairs here; it applies to the article, it applies to the word, whatever. The point is that it does not apply here because each one of the provisions the article/word supposedly fails has in fact been met. As to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, there is no synthesis of information done on the article side, beyond the mere collection of information. Each statement is clearly referenced and directly reflected in the sourced material; there is no conjecture, assumption, or any drawn conclusions present in the current version of the article, and <b>I challenge you to explicitly cite any statements you think are Original Research</b>. The most you can argue is that there are some weasel words present, which is an issue for the article's talk page, <i>not</i> AfD, but on the offchance I'm wrong I think it is highly likely that any OR could easily be removed, leaving the article intact. -- <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Y|yukichigai</a> 01:30, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"no synthesis of information done on the article side, beyond the mere collection of information" --"Collection" <i>is</i> "synthesis". We cannot at Wikipedia take note of media references of a <i>term</i>, unless those references have been noted by other media. This is because Wikipedia is not a dictionary. The entire section titled "References in media" is thus original research, except for the 2nd and 3rd sentences. Note, that if this kind of synthesis were permissible, there would be no point to <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>'s requirement of sources that <i>discuss</i> a neologism as opposed to sources that just <i>use</i> it. As for <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> itself, the term fails it because <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> requires that "To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term — not books and papers that use the term." I'm not sure what #1, #2a, 2b, 3, refer to in your original comment -- those numbers are not in <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:59, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

The closest you can come is the section which first defines the neologism itself, which as we've already determined meets the qualification of having a reliable source: the primary source. (Though notability is not established by that source) Collection of information is <i>never</i> Original Research unless it directs the reader towards a particular conclusion; collecting information, after all, is the very core of Wikipedia.

<dd>Wrong. You appear to be unfamiliar with what dictionary entries may contain.

<dd>The requirement of <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> that their exist secondary sources about the term in question does not specify that those sources be <i>exclusively</i> about the term, and there are not one but four separate secondary sources (if I count right) listed which talk <i>about</i> the term.

<dd>Third, regarding your point that my nomination relies on guidelines, which you say are "flexible and likely to have exceptions," unlike policy. You're right that the difference between policies and guidlines is that the former may never be overriden, while the latter may. Still, there has to be a good <i>reason</i> to override guidelines -- especially dealing with <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, which are directly based on the policies of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. You have given no good reason to override guidelines in this case. Besides, as I explain above, the article in its current form blatantly violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:01, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My point is not that the guidelines should be ignored; my point is that <b>guidelines should never be used as the <i>exclusive</i> basis for an AfD nomination.</b> As guidelines are more subject to interpretation, exception, and outright being ignored any nomination that uses them as its sole basis will be on shaky ground at best. If an article really needs to be deleted then you should be able to cite violations of actual Wikipedia policy, rather than the "derivative works" thereof.

Well, perhaps in some instances, but just because something worked in one AfD <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">doesn't mean it was correct</a>.

<dd>One more comment: Your speculation that the term is less likely to be found in printed sources because it's sexually explicit is both irrelevant and unsubstantiated: irrelevant because sources are a requirement at Wikipedia, and there can't be any "excuses"; and unsubstantiated because the term, its effect, its origins, etc., could be discussed in print without explicitly rendering the definition. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:15, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I beg to differ; the fact that we are talking about a guideline specifically <i>qualifies</i> the use of "excuses", as you put it. The issue of notability to which my statement was concerning will be <i>directly</i> influenced by the relative vulgarity of the word, as it precludes its appearance in certain groups of media. You would not, for example, expect an article on the term <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felch.html" title="Felch">felch</a> to appear in the Christian Science Monitor. As for my argument being "unsubstantiated": this is an argument, not an article. I don't need sources for my arguments to be valid; common sense works just fine. -- <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Y|yukichigai</a> 01:30, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Um, we need non-trivial sources to write the article. As for your argument being unsubstantiated, perhaps I used the wrong word. I should have said, maybe, unconvincing. The reason it's unconvincing is, as I said above, that the term, its effects, origins, etc. could be discussed in print without ever rendering the definition. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:59, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

There are several separate issues here that are not fully teased apart in the discussions on this page. This is a long entry; sorry about that but it's a complicated discussion.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Is it the coinage a notable political act?</i>. I think the answer is absolutely clear; yes, it is. The citations in durable media that have been given (without any exceptions that I can see) attest to the political act's notability.</li>
<li><i>Is the coinage successful in that it has entered the language in a permanent way?</i> The article rightly says that this is unknown. The burden of proof is on those who would argue that it has. There is a long list of usage citations on the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Talk:santorum" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Talk:santorum" rel="nofollow">talk page at Wiktionary</a>; these were all assessed (by an editor there) as failing to come from independent sources. Several people above have made comments to the effect that it has entered the language, but no evidence has been presented beyond the citations which (I would argue) only show the effectiveness of the political act. It also needs to be acknowledged that part of the political action that Savage and his readers are engaged in is explicitly to make the word appear to be in general use. I'm not criticizing this, just commenting that it's evidently so, and that this makes the need for citations in independent sources paramount before any assertion can be made (on WP, at least) that the term has real currency. Without independent evidence, WP should not state that the term has entered the language. We clearly do not have that evidence.</li>
<li><i>Should the political act (and hence the coinage) be mentioned in Wikipedia?</i> The answer is pretty clearly yes; the citations make a strong case.</li>
<li><i>Does it need a separate article?</i> This one seems trickier. Although I don't suspect any particular editor here of not acting in good faith, I have to say that if I were one of the people who followed Savage's exhortation to "get the word out there", I would argue strongly in favour of keeping this as a separate article. That's because that would in turn lend support to Savage's stated goal of having an established word out there to outrage the Senator. However, given that AfD is not a vote, I don't think this is too much of a concern; the closing admin is going to look at the arguments, not the votes.</li>
<li><i>What should the title be, if it's a separate article?</i> I could support a separate article if it were (a) clearly titled in a way that made it about the political action by Dan Savage, and not titled in a way that makes it appear the word has gained real currency, and (b) made clear in the title that the content would be offensive to some. This latter criterion is important for the following reason. Suppose that we title this article "santorum (political act by Dan Savage)". Then on the dab page, someone might click on the article who might be very offended by the content. This is precisely the goal intended by Savage's campaign: to present Santorum's supporters with this offensive material as a jolt. We should present this information in such a way as neither to further nor unfairly hinder Savage's campaign. WP is not censored, so that's not the issue: the issue is that we should not mislead viewers with the title. The current title accurately meets criterion (b), but not (a). A title such as "santorum (political act by Dan Savage)" meets (a) but not (b). The only way of ensuring both would be some title such as "santorum (sexual slang term coined as political act)". That would work for me, but a merge back to <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savage_Love_b882.html" title="Savage Love">Savage Love</a> seems more sensible, because given that the entry is really about a political act, it fits naturally within that article. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 16:24, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, as for consensus, the closing admin will determine that. As for the arguments themselves, yes, some of them have been going around in circles. However Mike Christie has just come in with what I'd call a middle position; I will be curious to see what folks think of his views. As for <i>political</i> polarization, I have to disagree with you there, I don't see any evidence of that, although I anticipated that many Wikipedians, who travel in liberal social circles, would weigh in with comments like "of course this is notable" -- see 3rd paragraph of my nom. I don't suspect anybody here of bad faith, I just think many folks have an inflated view of the notability of this term because of their social circles.

<dd>You <i>think</i> it's notable? As in, "it's notable because all my friends have heard of it and use it"? That's exactly the point I was making by saying Kael lived in NYC -- she had a liberal social network and her view of what was going on in the country was badly skewed for that reason. Had she been a liberal living out in rural Missouri, she would have had a different social network and therefore a different view. In addition, what you say makes me suspect that your concept of notability may be subjective, and, as the venerable <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">User:Uncle G</a> said to me a while back, <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">notability is not subjective</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:01, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So because I'm from a blue state I'm unfit to evaluate the notability of this article? As for my "liberal social network", when I said I was a fascist that wasn't a euphemism. I genuinely believe people aren't fit to democratically govern themselves (this debate reminds me why). As to the "subjectiveness" of notability, don't be silly, of course it's subjective. The fact that it's based on "non-trivial" sources, with "non-trivial" left nebulously defined, pretty much assures at least a degree of subjectivity. Clearly the disagreement here is that you believe the article's citations to be trivial, while a good number of disagree. Objectivity, on Wiki as everywhere else, is a goal to be striven for, not something that is ever actually accomplished. Just because the venerable <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> says a thing doesn't make it true. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFordmadoxfraud_5d6c.html" title="User:Fordmadoxfraud">Ford MF</a> 04:08, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Both of you are making my point beautifully. You heard of the neologism "santorum" because you probably have friends who are fans of Dan Savage (or friends who are friends of fans, or, etc.). You never heard of "drive-by media" because you probably don't have friends who are Limbaugh fans.

No. I'm not religious; but I revert vandalism and copy-edit religious articles.

Your comments so far have made no references to sources, which is exactly what objective notability is about; in fact your original comment made a claim about the neologism that I don't believe is backed up in any source. It was therefore reasonable for me to ask you whether you looked at sources. It wasn't off-topic either; we were discussing the reasons why you thought the neologism is notable.

<dd>This is a fair point. I also think that we could have a very lively discussion on why some users do/don't find this notable. However, even if one concedes that this term is popular primarily to "liberals", it doesn't have an impact on the sources at hand and the article's assertion of notability, which of course are what this debate is about.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 19:46, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We've already debated the sources and the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">objective notability</a> of this term, so I won't address those again here. But I agree with the basic point you're making -- the popularity of this term among liberals is irrelevant to the debate itself. However its popularity among liberals may -- just may -- help explain the views of some people in this debate. I suspect no one here of bad faith, but I do suspect that some are reaching their conclusion about this article based on a skewed perception of what's subjectively notable to <i>them</i>, instead of judging <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability by looking at the sources</a> as you have, Dmz. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 20:14, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not as familiar with American politics as most Editors, I imagine, so I'll steer clear of that - specifically, the more I read the relevent articles, the more Santorum seems to be a more important politician than I had guessed. That said, I also <i>understand</i> Pan Dan's argument for deletion, but it's factually incorrect in a number of regards. Tangential discussion of politics + lots of delete&#160;!votes on a article no reasonable editor could&#160;!vote delete for is a highly suggestive situation - I was hoping editors would take a reminder to be objective. I think WJB's noting that:

Apr 10, 2005.Vol.29, Iss. 6; pg. 7 says "Santorum is the Senate's third-ranking Republican, the "standard bearer of social conservatives on the Hill," taking the point position against gay marriage, abortion rights and judges who defend either. He meets monthly with evangelical leaders, and his staff regularly taps evangelical broadcasters to mobilize support for their common agenda. Santorum, 46, is said to have presidential ambitions."<a href="http://proxy.bib.uottawa.ca:2058/pqdweb?did=822035781&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=3345&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD" class="external autonumber" title="http://proxy.bib.uottawa.ca:2058/pqdweb?did=822035781&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=3345&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>
<dd>(My original research and instinc say:) This sexual dirty santorum article and it's "new" definition may be an attempt to slander the name of a potential presidential elect.</dd>

I don't see anything really bad enough to warrant deletion. The irony is still existant and I could understand why some people may want to delete the article. Take for example Newsweek, New York: Jan 3, 2005.Vol.145, Iss. 1; pg. 89, 3 pgs states "As the third-ranking Republican in a majority soon to expand to 55 members, Santorum is close to the White House, operates one of the largest personal campaign funds and is a point man on hot-button issues ranging from gay marriage to Social Security." I haven't read through this vulgar wiki article but I bet you anthing it is the anti-thesis of Rick Santorum.</dd>
<dd>The debate will probably continue on for a long time. And I believe it is related to the person Rick Santorum. Newsweek has even said:
<dl>
<dd>“[RICK SANTORUM] had better get used to it. Attacks-from right and left-are sure to rise as he juggles the sometimes clashing roles of Senate power broker and cultural militant. "Rick is going to have to help make sausage like the rest of us," said a fellow Republican senator. "That is going to mean sometimes saying 'no' to the base." Yet he can't do that too often or he'll lose what is distinctive about his political persona.”<a href="http://proxy.bib.uottawa.ca:2058/pqdweb?did=772615531&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=3345&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD" class="external autonumber" title="http://proxy.bib.uottawa.ca:2058/pqdweb?did=772615531&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=3345&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<li>1) Yes, you're right. It's not a vote. Poor choice of wording on my part, though I think it makes my point (which is the important part). 2) The AfD discussion for "idiotarian" was just closed a few minutes ago. Perhaps if people were more consistant, that article wouldn't have been deleted. 3) "Idiotarian" is far and away better known and more widely used than "santorum" or even "fitzmas."

<li>My bad for not checking the closure time. But to say that <i>Idiotarian</i> is obviously more widely known than Santorum is clearly false. I, for one, have heard Santorum in my real life, never Idiotarian or Fitzmas. This may be a regional or political or social or economic thing - as people, all we need to have in common to be here is a basic grasp of English - so what seems obvious to you may not be obvious to others, or even true. That said, I've little doubt some a few "voters" used to <i>Do I know about this in real life test?</i> that although unsanctioned, I see applied often (and have probably applied once or twice myself). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:54, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

A quick search found <a href="http://lipstickexplosion.com/?p=46" class="external text" title="http://lipstickexplosion.com/?p=46" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://superqueers.blogspot.com/2006/04/chapter-11.html" class="external text" title="http://superqueers.blogspot.com/2006/04/chapter-11.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Considering the nature of the word's definition, it will be difficult to find much evidence, but I have shown that it is out there. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 19:04, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are lots of words that are "out there," yet they don't deserve a place on Wiki. A neologism such as this that has very limited exposure to the general public and even more limited usage even among those who know of it is one of those words. <a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJinxmchue_0531.html" title="User:Jinxmchue">Jinxmchue</a> 19:20, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Wikipedia has no "policy" on neologism. <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> is a guideline, not a policy, and I find it distressing how many people treat guidelines as Holy Writ: that which passes the guidelines deserves to stay, that which fails them must go. This is not the case and never was, nor should it be. This is a term that was coined as a political attack, and I doubt (despite WilyD's undoubtedly good-faith assertion) that there are any reliable sources that have used the term without the underlying political intent. In a few years, after Rick Santorum has faded into obscurity, if the term is still in widespread use, by all means create an article on the subject, but for now the article is premature at best. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 06:08, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, guidelines are not meant to be a rigid standard for evaluating articles; that is why this entire AfD should never have occured in the first place, as the entire justification for the delete is based solely on supposed non-compliance with a few guidelines and a "crystal ball" prediction that the article could not ever possibly meet policy requirements. -- <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Y|yukichigai</a> 19:36, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per arguments in previous AfD. It's a very notable term that has longevity beyond the former Senator and the controversy that it originated from. Disgusting? Yes.

<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Savage_35e0.html" title="Dan Savage">Dan Savage</a>. The word is a neologism, and the article provides no evidence that it is "sexual slang" rather than a representation of the controversy which Dan Savage created in protest of Rick Santorum's statements. My personal rule of thumb is that if people feel the need to popularize a word, then said word is still a neologism, and shouldn't have its own article here. In the absence of Dan Savage's efforts to popularize the word in a <i>political</i> context, rather than a <i>common use</i> context, this word would be completely non-existent except as a surname. The information contained in this article would also be better presented on <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Savage_35e0.html" title="Dan Savage">Dan Savage</a> in order to keep it in a NPOV context. --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDachannien_f06e.html" title="User:Dachannien"><b><font color="black">Dachannien</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../d/a/c/User_talk%7EDachannien_c4c3.html" title="User talk:Dachannien"><font color="blue"><i>Talk</i></font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dachannien_c2da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dachannien"><font color="green"><i>Contrib</i></font></a></sub> 09:27, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, more of a <b>Request</b>. I would ask those who have voted to keep this article to consider supporting condensing it and merging it with Savage's article. I now think it is not notable enough to deserve its own article, but can be a part of Savage's. <a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJinxmchue_0531.html" title="User:Jinxmchue">Jinxmchue</a> 15:55, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, though I'd accept Mike Christie's idea of keeping it under a different title, such as his suggested "Santorum (sexual slang activism)". <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 18:18, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I am surprised there is even a debate about this article - I never usually intervene in these things nor am I too familiar with the Wikipedia policy regarding the notability of articles but I strongly believe this article should be kept. Strangely enough, as a foreigner studying in North Carolina, I heard several people use the term and I even saw someone wearing a t-shirt with the definition on campus. Only months after having first heard the term did I realize Santorum was in fact a senator in PA, as I am not too familiar with American politics. I know my example is a bit extreme but I think it reflects how much the term has infiltrated subcultures on US campuses and in the LGBT community. I think articles detailing the origin of such terms are exactly what make Wikipedia so unique and interesting - which is why I believe, whether you agree with the term or not, these are quite important to keep. <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVincentl_7002.html" title="User:Vincentl">Vincentl</a> 18:42, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment/Suggestion</b> - If you could manage to, say, photograph anybody you happen to spot wearing a Santorum T-shirt it would both provide an excellent GFDL picture for the article as well as providing a bit more evidence to support the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> of the article. -- <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Y|yukichigai</a> 19:32, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- appears to be well-cited now, many major media outlet mentions eliminates lack of notability. Don't see why not. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 03:04, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
