<li><b>Delete</b> (slight revision of my previous comment) as an attack page, and certainly without any redirects. This criticism could be merged as appropriate into the actual article pages on the various subjects (actually, it is there on all of them already). I am on good terms with some of the eds. who created this article or support it, and hope to remain so. But they made a mistake; the mistake impairs their good repute; and they would serve their cause best by agreeing to the deletion of this article. Whatever one might think of some of the hypotheses discussed, it would still not be right to use WP to express personal views--and certainly not in an article deliberately so oriented and so titled. This is the very model of a POV fork, of the most blatant kind. (Subtler POV forks use subtler titles). It illustrates perfectly the importance of NPOV. Renaming is possible, but something like "Hinduvtva pseudoscience controversy" would not help much. Many other subjects on and off WP have shown that the best way of refuting what one thinks nonsense is to let it be expressed freely. If one thinks it merely wrong, that's handled by balanced presentation. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 19:54, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
<b>Keep</b> a) Google with [+Hindutva +pseudoscience] gets 566 hits: not all that many but certainly not none.</p>
<p>b) Nanda and Sokal both make a serious presentation of the mix of postmodernism, pseudoscience and religion that is being pressed into service, apparently with political aims. There does appear to be a real and current phenomeonon (and one that seems to discredit both science and genuine religious believers).</p>
<p>c) There also appear to be clear examples of heavy promotion of one or two Indian scientists on Wikipedia; and occasional claims for discoveries in mathematics that stretch credibility somewhat. For myself, I feel that outrageous claims are disrespectful towards the early mathematician, and possibly towards religious pioneers also.</p>
<p>It is not easy, however, to see an easy solution. I'll have a look at the entries for the BNP, Christian fundamentalism, Dawkins and Reductionism and maybe change my mind. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavy_p_9a26.html" title="User:Davy p">Davy p</a> 23:19, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b>. The term "pseudoscience" is associated with "Hindutva" in a number of scholarly works, including some cited in the article. I don't find any examples of the phrase "Hindutva pseudoscience"; but what's important is that a number of scholars have written about a phenomenon of ideologically/religiously motivated re-writing of Indian prehistory associated with the Hindutva movement. The WP reader might be better served, however, if this material was in <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a>; if not, this article should be a spin-off of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a> in accordance with <a href="../../../s/u/m/WP%7ESUMMARY_66b7.html" title="WP:SUMMARY">WP:SUMMARY</a>. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 03:45, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b>, bad faith resubmission (by Bakaman, who is very close to an rfar these days). Valid topic, concerns of imbalance (cite your acedemic sources!) and title (suggest a move!) nonwithstanding. <b>speedy keep</b> in fact, there is simply no way a well-referenced article will be deleted (as opposed to merged or moved), quite regardless of afd vote ballot-stuffing by ideological tag-teams. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 08:59, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

If there was any good faith involved here, people would make suggestions for moving and/or merging. If any good faith was involved here, there would have been attempts to debate concerns on talk.

<dd>I have expanded the article.

"Synthesis of published material" or "selection bias" in this case means "selecting" academic sources and ignoring blog postings and crank authors, which is just what we do on Wikipedia. I don't know if Scheibenzahl is aware of this, but Bakaman knows this perfectly well, and it is not possible to assume good faith here. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 10:20, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

My merge and delete vote in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hindutva_pseudoscience_828f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hindutva pseudoscience">previous AfD</a> was because of "Hindutva pseudoscience" in the title and a little content that could easily fit into <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a>. The content of the article is legit, but it has a POVish tone, which makes it look like an essay/<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> -- this needs to be fixed. I would request <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> to delete the redirect "Hindutva pseudoscience" -- it's neologism (if <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> doesn't delete it, it should be listed at <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_discussion_6c7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion">Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion</a>). <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 12:30, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>no, I maintain <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Hindutva+pseudoscience+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Hindutva+pseudoscience+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Hindutva pseudoscience</a> is a legitimate term. The collocation is a straightforward title, and it is nitpicking to allege that the "term" doesn't exist when ample evidence has been presented that Hindutva propaganda is classified as pseudoscience. This is a mere matter of choosing a concise title. An obsessively correct title would be pseudo-scientific currents in Hindutva propaganda, and we can yet move things there, but without the bad faith attacks on the article as such, this wouldn't even be an issue. Of course the article takes a "pov" opposed to the pseudoscientific literature. You may or may not be surprised to learn that our <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_science.html" title="Creation science">Creation science</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/w/Dowsing.html" title="Dowsing">Dowsing</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible_code.html" title="Bible code">Bible code</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_astronaut_theories.html" title="Ancient astronaut theories">Ancient astronaut theories</a> do precisely the same. It is "cultural relativism" or "political correctness" gone terribly wrong to assume that Indian pseudoscience should be treated less rigorously because, after all, "it is cultural" (viz., because you think the poor Indians don't know any better: they do, but they have their cranks and madmen just like people do in the west). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 13:07, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
