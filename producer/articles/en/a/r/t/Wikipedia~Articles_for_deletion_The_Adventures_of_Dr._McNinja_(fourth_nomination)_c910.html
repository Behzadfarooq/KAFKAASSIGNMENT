<li><b>Keep.</b> While Alexa ranking is not one of the WP:WEB criteria, the rank of <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/main?q=drmcninja.com&amp;url=drmcninja.com" class="external text" title="http://alexa.com/data/details/main?q=drmcninja.com&amp;url=drmcninja.com" rel="nofollow">42,000</a> (trend seems to be increasing, today it is ~21,000) suggests we should take a close look at whether the comic does meet the criteria. Googling "Dr. McNinja" currently yields 140,000 results. Besides being in the major directories, the comic has been reviewed in many, many personal blogs and forums, which together, in my opinion, is as significant as being mentioned in a single "leading" publication about webcomics (this is not something I'd put into WP:WEB as such, but I think as an argument it has merit on a case by case basis). One could argue that the comic is somewhat borderline between Internet meme and traditional web comic.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 17:47, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I certainly don't see any "new interpretation, analysis, or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts, or arguments that appears to advance a position or, in the words of Wikipedia's co-founder Jimbo Wales, would amount to a 'novel narrative or historical interpretation.'" as stated on <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a>
<ul>
<li>For example, the idea that this webcomic uses "high contrast Black-and-white, similar to the style used in Frank Miller's Sin City" seems to be the opinion of a wikipedia editor, not the opinion of a reliable, reputable third-party source. Per <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, <b>"Articles should rely on credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. ...

<li>And with all things on the internet as time passes they can gain notability. A 21,000 page rank on Alexa is nothing to scoff at. While there may be no publications that have written about the webcomic I don't see how that can automatically say its not a notable website. As stated on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines</a> this a guideline and not set in stone.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm going to side with Eloquence on this one. McNinja was deleted so many times because its fans jumped the gun and made an article for it long before it should have had one. Then it kept getting recreated. At first I thought it was because it just had some very persistent fans, which is why I locked the article down as a {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDeletedpage_0567.html" title="Template:Deletedpage">deletedpage</a>}}, but as I looked over its history, I noticed the recreations were all by different people and the text was dissimilar. There's also been a fair amount of buzz about it in the blogosphere, which, of course, is frustratingly difficult to quantify. I guess what's deciding me, though, was its membership in <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayfree_Press_6295.html" title="Dayfree Press">Dayfree Press</a>. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 18:22, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Addendum</b> I would have preferred that this come up a few months from now, when I think all the questions of notability will have been settled. Probably in McNinja's favor. The buzz just feels a lot like what's happened with other big name comics. Don't bother quoting guidelines and policy to me (I know them all by heart) because I am aware I'm venturing dangerously close to crystalballism. The eventualist in me says the references will come soon enough, and I'd rather not waste cycles on more trips to AfD and DRV. If I'm wrong and McNinja withers away without ever becoming anything, maybe I'll change my tune, but right now I'm standing firm on my decision. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 06:02, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as currently lacking reliable, reputable third-party source. I defer in most cases to Adashiel's knowledge of web comics, but in this instance I must demur. We have standards with regards to verification, and testimony of wikipedia editors in not enough of a reason to cast these standards aside. With regards to the Dayfree Press quasi-syndication, I look back to many previous discussions in the history of <i>talk WP:WEB</i> where consensus is that syndications does not allow inclusion "by marriage" as it were. There are several other webcomics in Dayfree press' stable that are notable, but we know this <b>because of third party sources.</b> I'd urge those who are recomending keep to instead go and find some sources. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 02:31, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b> as this is a respectable foundation of an article for a significant webcomic which has consistently been increasing in notability and popularity since its founding, and further since its affiliation with Dayfree. Some bias exists against the article because of its past deletions but, as mentioned before, previous versions were premature and this iteration deserves a fair, objective look regardless of how it has fared in the past. The Alexa ranking just makes this a no-brainer. --<a href="../../../b/d/d/User%7EBDD_7cba.html" title="User:BDD">BDD</a> 16:29, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> - this is a rapidly-growing comic that is a member of a notable group, and notable in its own right. I agree with the Alexa ranking making this pretty obvious to keep, Wikipedia's anti-webcomic crusading notwithstanding. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 74.12.144.141 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.12.144.141_9594.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.12.144.141">contribs</a>) .</small>

<dd>I'd encourage everyone who just rolls off an easy "Keep, notable" to make a little more effort in locating sources. Based upon this being the strongest citations apparently available, my recomendation is unchanged. Oh, and an alexa rank in the 50K range means almost literally nothing.

Please note that the information you linked to is from October 2003, and toolbar coverage (and therefore information quality) may have increased significantly since then. Please also note that the current ranking is in the 20K range. Finally, assume good faith -- there's no reason to believe that the traffic stats were deliberately manipulated; if anything, the outpouring of support for this comic indicates that it is, indeed, very popular. This is also evidenced by some of the links you provide. As I already noted in my earlier comment, I think it is valid in this case to compare a large amount of legitimate low traffic site coverage to a small amount of high traffic site coverage. As the media structure of the Internet decentralizes (cf. <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogosphere.html" title="Blogosphere">blogosphere</a>), Wikipedia needs to adapt, instead of only relying on old models of publishing as an indicator of a concept's popularity.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 01:36, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> I am convinced by Aaron Brenneman's arguments that are researched and well based. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 23:50, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm gonna say <b>delete</b> based off of previous webcomic deletion arguments. Dayfree Press lends no more weight to Dr. McNinja than Keenspot lends to its borderline comics. And the creators of this comic don't have a more established comic to lean on here. -- <a href="../../../i/l/g/User%7EIlGreven_50ab.html" title="User:IlGreven">Grev</a> 04:39, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> because..."I am a NIN-JAAAAAA!" (No seriously, the article looks pretty good.) <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 02:46, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There is no need to delete it - perhaps edit it more strongly to remove the elements unsuitable for the Wikipedia, but there is no need for deletion. OkamiItto 06:41, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
