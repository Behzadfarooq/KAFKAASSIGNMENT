<p><b>Delete.</b> Universist Movement no longer exists, it's now a Foundation with a different mission that is not reflected in this article. The importance of the current Universism article derived from an ongoing membership organization that is no longer there. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">Universist</a> 15:04, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep.</b> The Beatles are no longer a band, but does that mean their entry here should be deleted? No. The Universism entry should remain for historical reasons. Certainly the founder of this now defunct movement (or "religion") himself, aka Universist, aka Ford Vox, should not be trying to cover up the history of the organisation by deleting this article. <a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigitallion_552e.html" title="User:Digitallion">Digitallion</a> May 3rd, 2006</p>

<li>Digitallion is a former member of the Universist internet forum. His post is prime example of why this article should be deleted. Universism is only of interest to a few hundred people who populated its discussion board, and it is a controversial topic even among them. Wikipedia can manage well known controversial topics just fine, but something microscopic like this is ripe for edit wars and no one can say who is right, because there is too little information about this short lived organization in the first place. Why is that? The Universist Movement was always a nebulous idea and different people had different ideas about what it was, and as reflected in the media stories about it, they were all over the map as well. Universism is a story of internet miscommunication and Wikipedia shouldn't be junked with every internet controversy. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">Universist</a> 16:04, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>1) Universism should be moved to Universist Movement or Universist Foundation, because this article is now part of the history of the later organization? This does not require action by an administrator and is not a proper topic for AfD. Or, are you saying</dd>
<dd>2) Universism has never been important enough to merit an encyclopedia article, now or in the past? Or are you saying</dd>
<dd>3) Universism was once important, but has declined suddenly and sharply in importance to the point where it previously merited an article but no longer does? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:33, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This article is really about the Universist Movement, not Universism. Regardless, both Universism and the Universist Movement were important to the extent that there was an active and large membership organization currently in existence. Therefore this article is no longer important enough for Wikipedia. Anything the Universist Movement has done in the past warrants a footnote in another article at best. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">Universist</a> 15:50, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> As in previous nominations, I have been unable to find and have not been presented with convincing, verifiable evidence that Universism currently has enough adherents to warrant an article. This is a personal judgement on my part. I note that Universists obtained several thousands of <i>signatures</i> on a website but this is not in my opinion equivalent to several thousands of active <i>members.</i> I note that the Universists were able to get some half-a-dozen press mentions in mainstream news publications, but I was not convinced that the actual content of these articles (mostly features rather than news) amounted to more than successful publicity-seeking. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:54, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Dpbsmith. I am suspicious of the nominator's claim that this used to merit an article but no longer does, but I can agree with the conclusion that there's no decent evidence it ever deserved one in the first place. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 16:02, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> If I recall correctly, Universism was small enough that they met in a coffee shop and had somewhere around 6-12 people regularly show up at meetings. They had a larger following online, but not large enough: at the time that their forums closed, they claimed 2639 forum members (of course, not all of that number were actually Univerists, and like every forum I'm sure some accounts were duplicates, inactive, lost password, etc.). Nobody's denying that there was some press attention, but still: this is a "religion" with a congregation of about a dozen, which did nothing of consequence during its short life, and is now gone. Even its creator wants it deleted. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 16:38, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>You're right. I meant that <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">User:Universist</a> was the creator of Universism itself. The account has been the article's most vocal defender on the previous AfDs, and is presumably Ford Vox (though I'm not sure whether <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">User:Universist</a> has explicitly said so or not). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 17:59, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>According to their website, the <a href="http://universist.org/convention.htm" class="external text" title="http://universist.org/convention.htm" rel="nofollow">First International Universist Meeting</a> is still scheduled to take place in Montreal on September 14, 2006, with Ford Vox being scheduled to address McGill University's <a href="http://www.worldsreligionsafter911.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.worldsreligionsafter911.com/" rel="nofollow">World Religions After September 11th</a> conference on September 11th. In the last AfD I commented that "It will be interesting to know how many people actually show up at the Sept. 14th Universist session in Montreal." I am still curious. <s>The McGill site, however, does not currently list Ford Vox as a speaker<a href="http://www.worldsreligionsafter911.com/speakers_en.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldsreligionsafter911.com/speakers_en.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</s> McGill has confirmed in an email to me that he will be a speaker. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:25, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Their website still mentions the Montreal meeting September 14, plus one in New York City: Tuesday May 23rd" @ Corner Billiards, 110 E. 11th St., New York, NY 10003 (8PM)." Corner Billiards??? And, if it's no longer "a membership organization," then who, exactly, attends these meetings on May 23rd in New York and September 14th?

<ul>
<li>If you check on what those articles actually said, it's not so clear. There <i>was</i> an actual <i>local</i> news item about cops coming to eject some dozen Universists from a coffee shop when the proprietor objected to their views. The big-name media articles were features, columns, think pieces, interviews with Ford Vox, etc. They were <i>not</i> straight news items documenting an established, growing religion. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:22, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><i>In the context of what we're discussing,</i> and what <i>these particular</i> stories say, sure. I'm saying "it was in the NYT," without discussing <i>what</i> exactly was in the NYT, isn't automatically convincing. An appearance in a column demonstrates only that the writer thought the idea was interesting. And "interesting" could mean nothing more than "colorful" or "offbeat" or "curious." The publication of such material could be part of a process that could lead to a movement's becoming notable, sure, but does not speak to the question of whether Universism is notable <b>yet</b>... that is, whether it is a religion practiced by a substantial number of people--or just the religious equivalent of a <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">micronation</a>. If, come September, a mainstream news source reports that a thousand or more Universists showed up in Montreal for the September 14th International Meeting, then, sure, I'll grant that it's become notable. Right now, it's not even listed at adherents.com, which is sort of the equivalent of a movie not even being listed at imdb. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 16:35, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> AfD is intended to judge the suitability of a topic for inclusion, not the content of the article. If Universism ever achieved the consensus criteria for an organization, then I feel like the article should be kept and updated to reflect the current status of the organization. It appears that verifiable information on that current status is more difficult to come by than the profiles of the group that have appeared in the media over the last few years. It may be that Universism as a topic becomes obscure to the point that it only merits mention among lists of obscure religious movements. I'm not sure that's the case yet, and it would be helpful, I think, to people looking for encyclopedia coverage of what is known and verifiable about the group to still have a Wikipedia article to turn to. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 21:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)
