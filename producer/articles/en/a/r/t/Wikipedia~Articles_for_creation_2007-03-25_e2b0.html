"Josh Tierney" From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search</p>
<p>Josh Tierney is a short story writer from London, Ontario. Although his work has been published in numerous magazines, he is mostly known for his website which is unique in that not only does it feature stories, but artwork created for the stories by notable artists from around the world, ranging from the cartoons of Ramon Sierra to the paintings of Winston Chmielinski. Because of this his stories are mostly popular with artists. Josh Tierney's stories are usually surreal or absurd, involving characters who are placed in impossible dreamlike situations. Josh Tierney has been accused of hiding shallow stories under a layer of gross verbiage, and indeed his story 12 November 1993 was written through the use of a thesaurus. Not much is known about his personal life, but he is considered a notable writer of London, Ontario by the CSLC.</p>

<p>Udo Grashoff is both a biochemist and history graduate who now works as a print and radio journalist with a particular interest in medical history.</p>
<p>Let me Finish (2004) The Times said Let me Finish is "a remarkable anthology of suicide letters... signalling a new fascination and openness about a centuries-old taboo."</p>
<p>Mr Grashoff first discovered the suicide letters used in Let Me Finish through academic research and has lectured widely on the subject of suicide.</p>
<p>Book Extract: "I made up my mind that we'd leave you for ever. It was quite painless, all three of them were fast asleep. I gave them all tablets and beer beforehand... Now that I know they are all dead, I can do it too. I gave them life, so they will die with me too. Believe me, it's better for them this way." [page 43]</p>

Francois the Transvestite was born in Natal, France on December 2, 1735. It was snowy day with winds that exceeded thirty miles an hour. His father, Hippolyte Jean-Paul III, was ashamed of his transvesite baby, who he beat everyday in a effort to make him alter his genders. His mother was homely and responded to the name of Genevive. She supported her child's decision to the point of calling Francois "it." Francois chose to live with a pod of whales, where he could seek refuge in their warm bellies without being digested because they loved him. Their mass love of Francois can easily be explained with the knowledge that all whales are tranvestites as well. They all wanted to be like flowers. One day, Francois found a heat rock at the bottom of the ocean which he curled up on every night as he slept. It was so hot that it killed a hammerhead shark that tried to eat Francois, because it is commonly known among the aquatic community that hammerhead sharks despise transvestites that use heat rocks for beds while living among a pod of whales. Keep this in mind to prevent getting attacked by a hammerhead, especially if you are transvesite.</p>
<p>At the age of 16, Francois the Transvestite met and fell madly in love with a whale who was a rare example of a whale transvestite, who loved to do the "blow hole." It was very satisfying for Francois. More detail would be too explicit and icky so we will leave it to the reader's imagination, if you know what I mean. If you were a transvestite with a whale lover, what would you do? E-mail your answers to: francois.travestite@transvesties.com.</p>
<p>Following a passionate three decade romance with his whale lover, who shall remain nameless due to the fact that it was a whale, Francois proposed. They were married among a series of coral reefs on July 7, 1781. Among those in attendance was the hammerhead shark who years before had attacked Francois. They had buried the hatchet in the ensuing decades, and the hammerhead was his best man...or bridesmaid, depending on perspective. In the next 6 years, Francois and the whale produced many hideous offspring. They were an odd combination of whale transvesite and human transvesite. They had numerous extra holes that served various purposes. One of them was very big boned. For reference to what a "big boned" individual looks like, we recommend any episode of "That 70's Show" that includes Donna Pinnciotti.</p>
<p>After a happy marriage of hot, sweaty, transvestite lovin' that lasted two score and four years, Francois died following an attack by a youthful, punky hammerhead shark. The youthful hammerhead was very violently emo and wanted to kill anyone who didn't posess emo fins; thus was the demise of Francois the Transvestite, who remains a legend among transvestite to this day.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-03-25_e2b0.html" title="Edit section: bobby cash">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">bobby cash</span></h2>
<p>Bobby Cash grew up and resides in Clement Town, near Dehradun (NE India) in the foothills of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>A pioneer in his own country, Bobby is the first Indian ever to release a country music album in India. Born Bal Kishore Das Loiwal, his father used to call him ‚ÄúBabu‚Äù which became ‚ÄúBobby‚Äù- and Kishore became ‚ÄúKish‚Äù, which in turn became ‚ÄúCash‚Äù.</p>
<p>For as long as he can remember country music was played in his house. In the early 1960‚Äôs an aunt moved to Nashville and would regularly send the latest country releases to Bobby‚Äôs mother. With an uncle who made electric guitars and sisters and cousins with a similar passion, Bobby‚Äôs home became a kind of incubator of country music in India.</p>
<p>After briefly dabbling in ‚ÄúHindi pop‚Äù he returned to his first true love- Country Music. In New Delhi whenever any Australian heard him they would tell him he that had to go to the Tamworth Country Music Festival. A chance meeting with Australian Producer/Director Colin Bromley in Jan 2002 turned that dream into a reality when he and co-Producer Gerry O‚ÄôLeary, through their newly formed company Gobsmacked Television, arranged for Bobby to attend the 2003 Tamworth Country Music Festival as the subject of a documentary. As India‚Äôs population had just passed the one billion mark, and Bobby was the only guy in India making a living playing country music, it became ‚ÄúThe Indian Cowboy‚Ä¶One in a Billion‚Äù.</p>
<p>Tamworth was a chance for Bobby to play for, and with, people who truly love the same music he does. While knowing nothing about Bobby, he offered to help Bobby record a CD - in the hope that some of the profits would go to help underprivileged children in India. Bobby returned to Australia in June 2003 and recorded his first country music album - ‚ÄúCowboy at Heart‚Äù. In June 2004 the documentary screened on the Discovery Channel in India in both English and Hindi. In September the album was released through Universal Music (India) and in conjunction with Showtime Events, India, and the Taj Hotel Chain, Bobby toured for 2-3 weeks through Pune, Bangalore, Hyderbad, Mumbai, Emakulam and Colombo in Sri Lanka to full houses.</p>
<p>While country music in India is a niche market, Bobby believes it will have great appeal because it fits in with the Indian psyche. It shares a lot of common values such as loyalty, respect for elders, family and neighbours‚Ä¶ and that some of the biggest selling music in India has been country music, John Denver‚Äôs ‚ÄúCountry Road‚Äù being just one. It‚Äôs just not known as country music. Due to public demand, in July 2004 Bobby re-entered the studio and recorded an album of cover versions of crowd favourites. Titled ‚ÄúPhoenix to El Paso‚Äù it reflects the music Bobby and his family grew up listening to ‚Äìcowboy and love songs.</p>
<p>Bobby attended the 2005 CMA music festival in Nashville after being nomination for CMA Global Artist Award and received a standing ovation from the head of the CMA, Ed Benson, who declared him to be ‚Äúthe real deal‚Äù. ‚ÄúNobody plays Country Music like this anymore‚Äù.</p>
<p>He performed at the 2006 Tamworth Country Music festival and has just recorded his third album to be released in April 2006 when he returns to Australia for his eleventh tour.</p>

RedHot is a young American Rap crew trying and succeeding to put Colorado on the map. Consisting of Cannonball A.K.A. eMCee Donald, White Trash, Candy Cane A.K.A. Weirdo 2, WatermelonSeed, and Sour Milk A.K.A. KingKitty A.K.A. Razzmatazz, the people in the group are part of a society called RapNRoll Family. A couple other people that I heard about in this formed society besides the ones already listed are Bam-It-AllK A.K.A. JuggaloK4Lyfe (former of the 86 South West Juggaloes), and Monkey A.K.A. Maddy. Cannonball has been in the so called 'lotus or posse' The 86 South West Juggaloes as well as the street gangs Crips, Crips2, and Trailor Park Lotus. His Ninja name is CannonballJ, Crip name- CannonCallBk, and Gangsta name- J-Ball. They display thereselves as underground street rats who grew up with out a thing but a gun and urge to kill someone who makes them angry, which in most of there songs they protray anger and encourage obnoxious behavior. If you are a part of there society you are considered an Official RapNRolla or RapNRollette. If you are a dedicated following fan you are just a RapNRolla or RapNRollette. You can identify a society member by O.R.
</pre>
<p>History Formation-When the group was first formed, the group was called The Dark Spirits of Music. That only lasted a few days before they named it The Dark Souls. This was before they had any support and exposure, which they later gained after $horty and Jacob Alvarez left the band and They changed the name to RedHot, an all Rap/RapNRoll/Hip-Hop band. They Started in 2000, with there first mixtape, which was never given a name. They also did 2 c-ds after that, "What The" and "Melt-In." These all were unsuccesful. Now, 2007, they are releasing there EP "Tha RedHot Demo" and later, there LP "World Wide Introduction". RedHots first single was "Party at Mine" which also appeared on the What The C-D.</p>
<p>First Mix-Tape era (2000)- In 2000, RedHot released there first mix-tape, which was never given a title, on there independent label, RapNRoll Records. In 2000, RedHot had just fallen out of rap battles, freestyles, and on-the-street cyphers, and got into making music in the studio and getting more record deals and record labels. They call it the great depression rise because of the drugs and stuff they were going through with there family at the time. Cannonball claims he used to be suicidle. Yet his friends, or as he calls them, homies, thought he was very humoures and witty at the time.</p>
<p>What The era (2001-2002)- In late October, 2001, RedHot, still knows as The Dark Souls, released there first album, What The?! A few songs from it included "What The Fucc!?!?", "My Little Friend", "Humpty Dumpty", and "Boring". By 2002, they had sold 9 copies. There first c-d had went out as a big dud. They weren't getting the exposure they needed, even though the c-d was probably very good. Most of the c-d was about sitting on your porch freestyling and chilling all day, being in jail, and depression.</p>
<p>Melt-In era (2003-2005)- In 2003, the group started on a new project, in hope that it would be a success. By now, The band was RedHot. This time, they sold 10 copies, because a buyer thought that the band was to explicit for any human being on Earth and that the members were way to young to even say a cuss word, authority out numbered them. This hole c-d was about rap battles and living on the edge.</p>
<p>Tha RedHot Demo era (2006-2007)-In 2006, this EP, Tha RedHot Demo, was very witty with good punchlines, about how people thought the lyrics were too controversial and how people take stuff too literally. It is still being sold at the moment but has currently been sold 183 times.</p>
<p>World Wide Introduction (W.W.I.) era (2007-2008)- This will no doubt be there most succesfull c-d, while they have atleast 100,000 people that have there name down to buy it for $15, they haven't even finished it yet. They finally got there touring and signing finished with RapNRoll Records, got there LP to a market, and are making real money. Plus, there DJ, White Trash, is getting the song played in clubs out of the state. They are very well known in Colorado, and are spreading to U.S.A.</p>

With the aim of eradicating poverty through business, C4-world is setting up a global investment platform (MyC4) that allows individuals to invest directly in African businesses - connecting private lenders to entrepreneurs in the developing world (the concept will be proven in Uganda before taken further to other developing countries in and outside of Africa).</p>
<p>'MyC4' investors can expect to receive a return on their investment. The premise is to treat entrepreneurs in Africa as business partners, with return on investment being the most solid foundation for keeping the model moving forward. MyC4 is focusing on knowledge as well as capital through virtual entrepreneurship, to transfer not just funds, but energy and knowledge, too.</p>
<p>The Danish start-up is building an online community to share knowledge and best practices from the global community to serve businesses in emerging markets, starting with the African continent. A closed beta is kicking off in May 2007. Interested investors can currently sign up as MyC4-builders to test the platform and create an active community that's up and running before MyC4 opens to the general public in Q4 of this year. 2,015 builders are expected to invest at least USD 200, with a payback period of 6-12 months for the first projects.</p>
<p>Harnessing the wisdom of the crowds and letting them put their money where their mouths are.</p>

<p>Feline behavior can be erratic and unpredictable at points, and it is an increasingly common phenomena that can be observed in some populations. What are the causes of some of this behavior, and where can they be traced to? While it is difficult to ascertain the source of the problem, a cat with an unusual type of behavior may be experiencing a mild or severe form of epilepsy. <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/People/lowekamp/feline_epilepsy" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/People/lowekamp/feline_epilepsy" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> If you suspect that your cat has experienced this sort of trauma, call your local ASPCA immediately and recount all of the details to the operator. While often of an amusing appearance, these events are quite serious and can threaten the life of the animal with a short period of time.<a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Crazed cat99462620 cbb9c14cca">Image:Crazed cat99462620 cbb9c14cca</a></p>

<p>JJ started his film career in the camera world, lugging props and camera equipment around various film sets in Salt Lake City while he was still in school at The University of Utah. Graduating in 2005 he went directly into the filmmaking world as a camera assistant. His career in the camera department was not short lived, in fact, he continues working as a loader/2nd AC even today "for the incredible pectoral work out".</p>
<p>While working on these films during college he met Kelsey Landry (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1673926/" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1673926/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1673926/</a>), then production coordinator, now Line Producer/UPM, soon to be Director. JJ and Kelsey have collaborated and worked together on numerous films including but not limited to, Heber Holiday and Perfect Sport. They have become incredible friends, and a force to be reckoned with when working together on a film.</p>
<p>It was while working on a made-for-television Disney movie that JJ met Kelly King (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2132261/" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2132261/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2132261/</a>), a production assistant, but also a future collaborator, co-producer, co-writer, and best friend to JJ. With Kelly as writer/director, JJ produced his first film, the award winning short Let Go. The feat did not go unrecognized as another co-worker and friend of JJ's, Brent Geisler (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1664004/" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1664004/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1664004/</a>), asked him to help produce a feature film called The Dance. The Dance was the first of many producer credits for JJ with its production company, Flynn-Daines Productions.</p>
<p>With a number of films in development, and a number of films in the can, JJ takes each show with passion, understanding that there is always something to be learned from each production. His creativity and quick wit along with his experience in multiple departments including camera, art, props and production make him logistically savvy and efficient, as well as giving him a more thorough understanding of the filmmaking process.</p>

<p><b>Zigge Holmgren</b>, artist and photographer particularly partial to digital media. Born 1953 in Stockholm, Sweden. Educated in art- and photo schools. Exhibitions continously especially in Gotland, Sweden, where Zigge is situated, but also in Milano and London. The images are usually digitally edited with his earlier experience of oil painting and photo lab technique as a base. During the last years Zigge Holmgren has experimented with modern portraits partly built upon 18th century style and renaissance works but is also influenced by comic strips and other styles.</p>
<p>Zigge Holmgren is also continuously working with his "Muzak Art" project, where the pieces depict fragments of nature's perfection, from the Swedish island of Gotland. When synthesised with mural surfaces from the medieval town of Visby the pictures are reduced into organic patterns. The style is romantic and decorative and with a longing for purity of mind like an icon. The pictures are intended to realize the inclination of the Nordic, almost ethnic rite, of bringing Nature into the home, like potted plants and Christmas trees. The concept of Muzak Art is an attempt to reconstruct this random process where perfection is built upon pure chance.. A fantasy around the ‚Äúnon-image‚Äù, to find the code between the small print of nature. The artist Zigge Holmgren like to see his pictures as xerox copies of life, as we would experience existance in Afterlife... Like images from children's picture books, for grown-ups.</p>
<p>Zigge Holmgren has been given a lot of attention world-wide and has a permanent exhibition in Cuneo e Associati in Milano, Italy. He is a member of KRO (The Swedish Artist Organization).</p>

<p>Rio de Janiero is famous for its slum districts, which have been allowed to spread uncontrolled. An estimated 1.2 million people live in wooden shacks across these districts.</p>
<p>In the last few years, the govenment has started providing basic ammenities such as electricity and sewers to these huts.</p>
<p>La Grota is one of the 600 slum neighbourhoods with a population of 5000. The residents first came in the 1960s/70s from poverty stricken northeastern Brazil in search of work and a better way of life.</p>
<p>'City Of God', where the popular film is based, depicts drug war in favelas and was an attempt in the 1950s to house thousands of poor migrants in prefab houses. This has now turned into a violent hell.</p>
<p>Most slums left to their own devices and laws, there seems to be no solution to the evergrowing problem.</p>
<p>A project called 'Favela Biarro' was iniated by the government. Biarro meaning 'residential neighbourhood'. This scheme isn't hoping for a miracle and provides basic help, such as water, electricity, child care centres and paved streets. A sense of community can now be felt.</p>
<p>It is now estimated only 1% of Favela Biarro is involved in the drug trade. The paved streets create status and protection against land slides. Residents are strongly involved; this is their community. They are given responsibility such as planting trees and naming streets.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gamersmegatwist.com" class="external text" title="http://www.gamersmegatwist.com" rel="nofollow">Gamers Mega Twist</a> is a video game <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprite_comic.html" title="Sprite comic">sprite comic</a> website. It features popular <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo.html" title="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/g/Sega.html" title="Sega">Sega</a> characters and uses all of them combined in a number of short adventures. Gamers Mega Twist does not own these characters in any way and respectfully acknowledges their creators. It was put into planning on January 1st, 2006, but was first opened to the public on March 21st, 2006. The planning process included organizing the first two comics, the first game and "fun item," and the organization of the layout. The layout started off to be a simple box at the bottom with eight links: "Home," "Comic List," "Games," "Fun Stuff," "Links," "Help," "Unlockables," and "Credits." After about two months, this was changed. It became a sidebar at the left side of the screen with different links: "Home," "Archive," "Fun Stuff," "Links," "Help," "Others," and "Credits." They became the new sections of the site, and some were replaced. The shorthand for Gamers Mega Twist is GMT, not to be confused with <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenwich_Mean_Time_c038.html" title="Greenwich Mean Time">Greenwich Mean Time</a>.</p>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><b><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario.html" title="Mario">Mario</a></b> - Mario, the main character of the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_6929.html" title="Super Mario">Super Mario</a> franchise, is used often in the comics of GMT. Mario does not talk often in the comics, and when he does, it is often in short words such as, "Okie!" Mario is usually in the same comics as <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luigi.html" title="Luigi">Luigi</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Peach_8c84.html" title="Princess Peach">Princess Peach</a>, but sometimes does go solo in several appearences. The sprite of Mario is the same from <a href="../../../s/u/p/Mario_and_Luigi%7E_Superstar_Saga_d6e2.html" title="Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga">Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga</a>, and did not change in Season 2 although <a href="../../../p/a/r/Mario_and_Luigi%7E_Partners_in_Time_ebae.html" title="Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time">Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time</a> was released before Season 2 began. Mario's positions in the comics usually include the silly poses from the battle stage of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Mario_and_Luigi%7E_Superstar_Saga_d6e2.html" title="Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga">Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga</a>.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../l/u/i/Luigi.html" title="Luigi">Luigi</a></b> - Luigi, from the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_6929.html" title="Super Mario">Super Mario</a> franchise, is another popular character in the comics. Luigi usually makes appearences resulting in him getting hurt, a <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running_gag.html" title="Running gag">running gag</a> that developed in the planning process for the comics. Like Mario, Luigi's sprites are from <a href="../../../s/u/p/Mario_and_Luigi%7E_Superstar_Saga_d6e2.html" title="Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga">Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga</a> and did not change after Season 1.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Peach_8c84.html" title="Princess Peach">Princess Peach</a></b> - From the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_6929.html" title="Super Mario">Super Mario</a> franchise, Princess Peach makes appearences in GMT in which she is always innocent to danger. Her major appearence was in Issue #4, "Volcanic Peaches," where she goes into a Volcano while everyone is asleep.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_74b2.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></b> - The popular star of <a href="../../../s/e/g/Sega.html" title="Sega">Sega</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic.html" title="Sonic">Sonic</a> is probably the main character from GMT. Sonic's appearences remain realistic to the video games- Cool, calm, collected. Although the "Amy chasing Sonic" <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running_gag.html" title="Running gag">running gag</a> is not often used in the comics, Sonic does usually ignore when he is spoken to. He is, of course, usually fighting Eggman and other enemies, and making jokes afterwards. Like all Sonic characters, Sonic's sprites are a mixture of <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Advance_ccf0.html" title="Sonic Advance">Sonic Advance</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Advance_2_2528.html" title="Sonic Advance 2">Sonic Advance 2</a>, and <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Advance_3_ab89.html" title="Sonic Advance 3">Sonic Advance 3</a>.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles__Tails__Prower_8fae.html" title="Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower">Miles "Tails" Prower</a></b> - Tails, from the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic.html" title="Sonic">Sonic</a> franchise, is usually seen with Sonic in GMT, like the video games. When he isn't with Sonic, he is usually taking on a <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cameo.html" title="Cameo">cameo</a> role in that comic, or a small appearence.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../k/n/u/Knuckles_the_Echidna_5c32.html" title="Knuckles the Echidna">Knuckles the Echidna</a></b> - Knuckles, from the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic.html" title="Sonic">Sonic</a> franchise, has an attitude that is similar to the video games. Knuckles is tough, but not very bright.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Rose_667e.html" title="Amy Rose">Amy Rose</a></b> - Unfortunetly, Amy Rose from the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic.html" title="Sonic">Sonic</a> franchise is seldom used in the comics of GMT. She did star in her own comic, Issue #17, "The End of the World," titled because of Amy's reckless driving. She does not chase Sonic often like in the games, a <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running_gag.html" title="Running gag">running gag</a> that has not yet appeared in the comics. She does retain her cheerful personality like in the video games as well.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_the_Hedgehog_96c3.html" title="Shadow the Hedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a></b> - Another character from the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic.html" title="Sonic">Sonic</a> franchise. In Season 1, Shadow fell into a trap hole (Issue #3, Dig it) and was trapped. Despite his calls fro help, noone could hear him under the dirt. Two comics later, in Issue #5, Super Power (his next appearence), he appeared in one frame above ground. This may have been a mistake, as he appeared again in the same comic on a TV, being held by Amy during Ragden's explanation on <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shen_Gong_Wu_1559.html" title="Shen Gong Wu">Shen Gong Wu</a>. He appeared in the very next comic, Issue #6, "<a href="../../../x/i/a/Xiaolin_Showdown_9cb1.html" title="Xiaolin Showdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a>", in a holgram form. This was his appearence throughout Season 1. In the first comic of Season 2, Issue #19, The Begining of a New Day, he was rescued by Knuckles. He has not yet appeared in Season 2, but it is predicted Shadow will appear in a normal, solid form after being rescued.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../r/o/u/Rouge_the_Bat_0118.html" title="Rouge the Bat">Rouge the Bat</a></b> - Rouge, from the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic.html" title="Sonic">Sonic</a> series, did not appear much in GMT, but she was the "Heylin Queen" hidden in Season 1. (see "Season 1 Plot") Rouge's appearences in Season 1 were actually that of the Heylin Queen in Rouge's body. When Season 1 ended, the Heylin Queen was revealed to be Rouge in Season 2. It also spoke of Rouge's innocence to the event, and that she is technically new to GMT.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../c/r/e/Cream_the_Rabbit_7a9b.html" title="Cream the Rabbit">Cream the Rabbit</a></b> - Cream, from the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic.html" title="Sonic">Sonic</a> series, does not make many appearences in Gamers Mega Twist. In Issue #18, "Rewind," (the last comic of Season 1,) Cream was one of the few characters who traveled into the past and ended up fighting a Mecha-Knuckles, but was quickly defeated. She appeared in Issue 23, "<a href="../../../s/t/a/Stafy.html" title="Stafy">Stafy</a>'s Big Adventure," in which she went to stop <a href="../../../e/g/g/Eggman.html" title="Eggman">Eggman</a> (with <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stafy.html" title="Stafy">Stafy</a>.) She tricked Stafy into thinking she was being taken away by a ground <a href="../../../w/a/d/Waddle_Dee_87cf.html" title="Waddle Dee">Waddle Dee</a>, while she was actually just getting away.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheese_the_Chao_7c19.html" title="Cheese the Chao">Cheese the Chao</a></b> - Cheese the Chao, always seen with Cream, doesn't have large roles in GMT. In Issue 23, "<a href="../../../s/t/a/Stafy.html" title="Stafy">Stafy</a>'s Big Adventure," Sonic fell on Cheese, resulting in both Sonic and Cheese being unable to go fight Eggman, leaving Cream and Stafy to do it by themselves.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirby.html" title="Kirby">Kirby</a></b> - <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirby.html" title="Kirby">Kirby</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo.html" title="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s pink puffball powerhouse, is a main character in GMT. Kirby does not talk in GMT, but he does sometimes say "Kirby kirby!" as in the "<a href="../../../r/i/g/Kirby%7E_Right_Back_at_Ya%21_5e1c.html" title="Kirby: Right Back at Ya!">Kirby: Right Back at Ya!</a>" anime series,</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../y/o/s/Yoshi.html" title="Yoshi">Yoshi</a></b> - Yoshi is the lovable, green dino from <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo.html" title="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_6929.html" title="Super Mario">Super Mario</a> franchise. Yoshi is not used often, but had one major appearence in Issue #11, "The Hungry Yoshi."</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowser.html" title="Bowser">Bowser</a></b> - Bowser, from the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_6929.html" title="Super Mario">Super Mario</a> series, appears in both Seasons 1 and 2. In Season 1, Bowser was always being pushed around by Wario and didn't have much competance against anyone. He lost both of the Xiaolin Showdowns he had entered. In Issue #7, "Prankstering," Bowser's first appearence, he was in a custom style sprite. After that, however, Bowser joined the rest of the Mario characters and turned into a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Mario_and_Luigi%7E_Superstar_Saga_d6e2.html" title="Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga">Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga</a> sprite. <a name="Appeared_in_Season_1_only" id="Appeared_in_Season_1_only"></a>

</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../l/i/n/Link.html" title="Link">Link</a></b> - Link, from <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo.html" title="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legend_of_Zelda_2f46.html" title="Legend of Zelda">Legend of Zelda</a>, appeared as a main character in Season 1. Link did not have his own comic to star in, although one was in the process of being created for Season 1, this comic and another one were cut off when GMT went into a 3 month hiatus. Therefore, Link only had short, minor roles. In Issue #19, "The Begining of a New Day," Link (along with Zelda) left for Hyrule, promising to return one day. Link's sprites are custom, made by Semi Juggalo and Toadkarter.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../z/e/l/Zelda.html" title="Zelda">Zelda</a></b> - Zelda, from <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo.html" title="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legend_of_Zelda_2f46.html" title="Legend of Zelda">Legend of Zelda</a>, was always seen with Link. There is a speculation that Zelda did not like <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Peach_8c84.html" title="Princess Peach">Princess Peach</a>, because the first and last frames of Issue #4, "Volcanic Peaches," Zelda made poses when Peach was nearby. Zelda's sprites were custom and made by Semi Juggalo.</li>
<li><b>May</b> - May, the female character from <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald was a main character in Season 1. May had few appearences, but did have a battle with Brendan in Issue #16, "Rival Battle."</li>
<li><b>Brendan</b> - Brendan, the male character from <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald was a main character in Season 1. Brendan had few appearences, but did have a battle with May in Issue #16, "Rival Battle."</li>

Slider</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulliver.html" title="Gulliver">Gulliver</a>, Mr. Chip</b> - Animal Crossing characters, custom made by Gonzo, Dixet, and Saxamaphone, each one had small roles. K.K. Slider did have a comic in which he was the star, which presented a (fictional) story of his past. Gulliver appeared in this comic and a few others, but Mr. Chip had minimal time in the comics.</li>
<li><b>Nana and Popo</b> - A surprising duo of characters from <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo.html" title="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s works, Nana and Popo had their own comic called Issue #12, "Nana and Popo Shoot the Moon." Nana and Popo did not have many appearences in Season 1 and left when Season 2 started.

<p>Since video game tournaments have been rising in popularity, and cash payouts have skyrocketed, sponsors have become increasingly difficult to find. For this reason, Pro Halo League was created to determine which players are the most talented and send them to larger tournaments to represent the best of the competition. Pro Halo League feels that some of the better players have no chance to prove their skills because of fincancial difficulties. In response, the Pro Halo League tournaments were created to select the best players and send them to larger tournaments with a huge cash sponsorship. Good luck, and may the best team get sponsored!</p>

<p>The publishers recommend adding beer, soda, and salads to your menu then pizza, fries, and fried chicken. This is merely their recommendation, they encourage experimentations. They also recommend getting some advertisment, the tip jar, the tv, and the delivery service later on. It is also not recommended to buy more than 4 to 6 items on your menu unless you are extremely quick.</p>
<p>Everyday there are 2 "rush hours" in the morning and evening wherein more people come to the restaurant then during other times in the day.</p>
<p>Gameplay can be run using the mouse or the keyboard, though even if you use the mouse for most things, you have to use the keyboard for some things.</p>
<p>Generally, reviews are good pointing out gameplay, replay value, comical newpaper articles, and music. Negative points are graphics, thougth they still function well.</p>

<p>Since the 1970's, this group has been developing the Regenstrief Medical Records System (<a href="http://www.regenstrief.org/medinformatics/rmrs" class="external text" title="http://www.regenstrief.org/medinformatics/rmrs" rel="nofollow">RMRS</a>)<a href="http://www.ijmijournal.com/article/PIIS138650569900009X/abstract" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ijmijournal.com/article/PIIS138650569900009X/abstract" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, one of the earliest <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_medical_record.html" title="Electronic medical record">electronic medical record systems</a> (EMR), perhaps the longest continually opperating EMRs, and the research platform for many research activities. As well as being a critical research tool, RMRS serves as the production electronic medical records system at Wishard Hospital and its community clinics. Additionally, this group has created a citywide electronic medical records systems which currently allows physicians, with the patient's permission, to view as a single virtual record all previous care at any of a number of regional hospital systems, labs, clinics, pharmacies, and other clinical and administrative data sources. It is the keystone for the Indiana Network for Patient Care (<a href="http://www.regenstrief.org/medinformatics/inpc" class="external text" title="http://www.regenstrief.org/medinformatics/inpc" rel="nofollow">INPC</a>).<a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/5/1214" class="external autonumber" title="http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/5/1214" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1480174&amp;rendertype=abstract" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1480174&amp;rendertype=abstract" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> This is one of the best examples of a Regional Health Information (<a href="../../../r/h/i/RHIO_253b.html" title="RHIO">RHIO</a>) or Health Information Exchange <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health_information_exchange_%28HIE%29_7c29.html" title="Health information exchange (HIE)">HIE</a>.</p>
<p>RMRS has decades of diverse clinical and administrative data on millions of patients. Additionally, it provides a variety of an [[Electronic medical record | Electronic Medical Record] (EMR) functionality including results delivery, documentation, clinical communication, and computerized provider order entry that utilizes unique clinical decision support and guidelines. RMRS has a data base of over 3 million patients, with hundreds of millions of on-line coded results, gigabytes of text reports including diagnostic studies, procedure results, operative notes, discharge summaries, and tens of millions of radiology images.</p>
<p>Additionally, the RMRS has been utilized to form a Shared Pathology Informatics Network (SPIN) to facilitate an "Internet-based virtual database that will allow investigators to locate appropriate human tissue specimens for their research".<a href="http://www.cancerdiagnosis.nci.nih.gov/spin/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cancerdiagnosis.nci.nih.gov/spin/" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, <a href="http://www.regenstrief.org/medinformatics/spin" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.regenstrief.org/medinformatics/spin" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> This is a collaborative effort between the Institute (and affiliated hospitals), Harvard Medical School (and affiliated hospitals), UCLA, University of Pittsburg, and the NCI.<a href="http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:17238798" class="external autonumber" title="http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:17238798" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>

<p>There are many methods of ground water purification. These methods include chemical precipitation, chemical degradation, volatilization, biological degradation, biological uptake, and adsorption. Chemical precipitation is when harmful chemicals undergo a chemical reaction, to become a solid. When the water is sinking through the soil the newly formed substance is caught up in the dirt. This substance will not enter the groundwater. Chemical degradation is when the harmful compound is broken down into a less complex compound. The new compound might enter the groundwater, but it is no longer harmful. Volatilization is when the harmful substance is vaporized, then rising into the air. The vaporization will sometimes separate a complex substance or the substance will fall as rain. Then it will either repeat the cycle or undergo another method of purification. Biological degradation (biodegradation) is when microorganisms consume and breakdown the harmful substance. The substance might enter the ground water, but it will no longer be harmful. Biological uptake is when animals or plants eat/absorb the harmful substance; the substance is not broken down. Instead the substance is trapped in the plant or animal cells. When this plant or animal dies the substance can sink into the ground and undergo another method of purification. Adsorption is when the harmful substance(s) accumulates on the surface of a solid.</p>
