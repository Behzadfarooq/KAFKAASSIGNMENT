<li><b>Merge</b>. <s><b>Strong Delete</b></s>. Even though I'm a 1997 Rasor Elementary School alumnus myself, I absolutely cannot see any use in keeping this article. As for the content, there is very little information regarding the school itself. Most of the information is about John Henry Rasor, his family, his properties, and related developments in the history of Plano, Texas. Sure, it's a nice backstory, but it has nothing to do with the school. We don't stick all our information about Todd Beamer under an article about the post office that was named after him. We don't put Martin Luther King's information under an article about one of the many streets named in his honor. If this information is relevant, it should stand on its own in another article. With regards to relevancy to Rasor Elementary, all but the first three and last sentences should be removed.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Those voting "Keep" will then argue that the content can always be changed, but that we shouldn't delete the article itself. I've seen the massive debates about school notability, and I normally side with those who want to keep as many articles as possible. I usually hesitate to delete most school-related articles. However, it's important to note the structure of Plano's school system - there are <b>45</b>, unindividual, non-notable primary schools, with more being built all the time. The secondary schools are big enough to justify an article, but this article simply does not - think 45 articles with no notable information except their location and founding date, unless you want to include the fact that, say, Mendenhall collected the most aluminum cans in such and such year.</dd>
<dd>Others want to go on "precedents" or "implied practices." The implied practice on Wikipedia is not to have a separate article on individual schools in a massive, bureaucratic school district. If you search for directories of schools on Wikipedia, the best listing you'll get is one of New York's high schools. Would we possibly want a listing of each of the hundreds and hundreds of New York City's primary schools? No! Primary schools are largely nonnotable when you single out one in a massive web of dozens or hundreds of completely standardized buildings.</dd>
<dd>Finally, when we look at the category it's listed in (primary schools in Texas), there's nothing that allows Rasor to stand out on its own. There's been no bombings or shooting, it doesn't cater towards a special group of kids, there's been no long history of tradition - it's not even unique within its own school district!</dd>
<dd>I believe that most of the school-related articles on Wikipedia should be kept. But there is a limit to me leaving a "Keep" comment when something is <i>this</i> nonnotable and the content is <i>this</i> offtopic. -<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a> 06:29, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with all of the positive feedback above. Plano is one of the few places I know where all of the schools are named for local heroes/pioneers/etc. so it would be nice to know about the namesakes. Maybe people will write about the others as well? If a student at say George Washington High School or Martin Luther King Middle School (i.e. those who are at the New York City schools mentioned above, most of which are simply named after numbers anyway) can look up more info about his school's namesake, why can't a student at Rasor? <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.255.210.234 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.255.210.234_0296.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.255.210.234">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> I just looked at some of the other local school district's articles and there are several schools that have their own entries without even saying who the namesake is - simply stating BLANK is a high school in the BLANK Independent School District. The private school articles (check out Greenhill's) also don't add much. The Rasor article does say something. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.255.210.234 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.255.210.234_0296.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.255.210.234">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I went ahead and struck out one of the two preceding "Keep"s, as they came from the same person one after another. Regardless, they were unsigned by an anonymous IP user, so the votes technically shouldn't count. I'll go ahead and respond, regardless:</dd>
<dd>Your argument fits well with my vote for deletion. You're saying that a student should be able to look up the namesake of their school, which is precisely why I forked the information to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Henry_Rasor_ba70.html" title="John Henry Rasor">John Henry Rasor</a> as you were writing your comment. The article about the person should stay at the person's own article - not one about a school. Why don't we create an article about "Rasor Boulevard," then, and stick his biography in there? We don't because it's irrelevant and in the wrong place.</dd>
<dd>Finally, you argue with other examples of school-related articles. Greenhill school, for example, is notable because it is "the regionâ€™s first co-educational independent school." It isn't much of an article, especially with lines like this, "Philip Kafka - Graduated in 2005 with a major in women studies and a minor in throwing parties.," but it has at least a very minor degree of notability. -<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a> 06:52, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I don't see how merging this article shows a complete disregard for the category system. When this article was first put up for deletion, it mostly contained information about the person, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Henry_Rasor_ba70.html" title="John Henry Rasor">John Henry Rasor</a>, rather than the school. After the massive debates at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>, many contributors now automatically vote keep to school articles. I am often an inclusionist when it comes to school articles myself.</dd>
<dd>As a result, it simply comes down to the debate about whether we should delete schools - NOT a debate on how categories work in Wikipedia. <b><a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> argues for the merging of this article.</b> I've followed many of the recent talk pages in WP:SCH and Schoolwatch, and they often agree on keeping high school articles as they are. However, the <i>custom is to merge schools like this into the district page.</i> <s>You will see that many of the often knee-jerk "Keep" voters here have agreed that this article <i>should</i> be merged with the district article</s> - this is all in accordance with WP:SCH and all of the customs we have seen on Wikipedia thus far. -<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a> 20:39, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
