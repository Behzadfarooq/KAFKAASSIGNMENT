WIKISTUPIDITY like the word <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikified.html" title="Wikified">wikified</a> "See also Help:Editing, Help:Starting a new page, m:Help:Editing Wikipedia is a WikiWiki, which means that anyone can easily edit any unprotected article and have those changes posted immediately to that page.</p>
<p>Editing a Wiki page is very easy. Simply click on the "edit this page" tab at the top (or the edit link on the right or bottom) of a Wiki page. This will bring you to a page with a text box containing the editable text of that page***"</p>
<p>ALL means that you don't have to be all too very smart to edit, write, or delete. In fact you don't have to smart at all as such the word that best describes that which follows Wikipedia guidelines in form without substance is called Wikistupidity as not only is it intolerantly pompous arrogant pretentious and completely callous in a bureaucratic sense it is also stupid and wikified so combining the two words we get the conjunction of WIKI-STUPIDITY.Andrew Zito 17:21, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>DEAR "WIkifascist" and UBER-LORD (HIGH ADMIRMAL) BOB if you used the word "wikistupidity in your sentence above how can it be <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nonsense.html" title="Nonsense">nonsense</a> defined by "wikipedists" (sic) as "an utterance or written text in what appears to be a human language or other symbolic system, that does not in fact carry any identifiable meaning" if is so distasteful and detracting then it is not nonsense and there for not deletable as was argued. or is there another and completely unstated argument being offered that should be made for us to distain look down on frown and call humbug? Andrew Zito 18:18, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You know, one of the official policies of Wikipedia is "no neologisms". As you admit that the word is coined by you, that qualifies it as a neologism. Sorry. Also, "wikified" isn't an entry <i>per se</i>; rather, it leads to a meta-page that explains how wiki formatting works. Therefore, your objection on that basis is invalid. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 18:25, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Good <i>God</i>, that was hard to read. I can only assume that English is not your native language, so I will give you the benefit of the doubt. Anyway, the use of wikistupidity in my vote was purely ironic. In addition, note that it would only apply if the article were kept, therefore demonstrating that there was no consensus that wikistupidity is a nonsense term. So for my comment on "wikistupidity" to apply, "wikistupidity" would need to be accepted as a valid concept. <i>Also</i>, I pray, note that my vote to delete was not on the grounds that it was patent nonsense, although I can understand why somebody would think it was. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 18:35, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Dear High Admiral Lord Bob of the Church of Bob in the Land of Nod.</p>
<p>Thank you for stating: "I pray, note that my vote to delete was not on the grounds that it was patent nonsense, although I can understand why somebody would think it was. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 18:35, September 9, 2005 (UTC)" as now we really know what you intended to state. Perhaps you and all "Wikidom" (oops another word quick get it into print and can learn a lesson in tolerance and grace so that a less coarse approach to matters and be found. If you object to someone over stating something discuss and fix the matter don't delete whole articles as it causes me to dwelling on how I could buy a shotgun and fix matters (another good metaphor)Andrew Zito 18:48, 9 September 2005 (UTC).</p>
<ul>
<li>You all know what I meant to state, because I stated it. I've never been known for not speaking my mind, as a look at my history will show. I said I can understand why somebody would think it's patent nonsense, because I do. I understand why somebody would believe in <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>, even though I, as an atheist, do not. I can understand why somebody would want to live in <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver%2C_British_Columbia_9a31.html" title="Vancouver, British Columbia">Vancouver, British Columbia</a>, even though I, as somebody who chooses to live in <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria%2C_British_Columbia_4e57.html" title="Victoria, British Columbia">Victoria</a> instead, do not. Do you understand the difference between comprehension and agreement yet? I can't believe I'm having this argument with somebody who doesn't know what a conjunction is, but I'm a sucker for debate. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 18:55, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Note that "Wikistupidity [is] a noun and adjective" is incorrect. <i>Wikistupidity</i> is a noun, <i>wikistupid</i> would be the adjective.

</ul>
<p>So far as I know but in actuality that is not an issue it is in fact a conjunction as was aforementioned and there for valid if you wish you can delete the passage relating to me coining the phrase but then you may have to replace it. In any case how can a small part of a posting invalidate the psoting as a whole if you wish to edit things edit them but if Wikipedia continues to act with a blugeoning axe when a scapel is needed it can expect to reap my criticisms and condemation eternally in this life and the next from the grave also if necessary as you should be destroyed as antithetical to anything sacred regardless of label.Andrew Zito 18:38, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Personal essay about a neologism. Also poorly written.

</ul>
<p>My question is (as you sound like a stiff) "Are you living or living dead?" as you sound so mechanical as to give me the impression of you being a machine. In any case there is no objective consistency to Wikipedia, Wikipedists, Wikistupidity, and you my dear Wiki-idiot you are a great arrogant ESL student.Andrew Zito 19:04, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
