<p>While it may be unorthodox to list a user sub-page for deletion, I believe that this page and the so-called "organization" or "agency" it promotes violate the spirit of Wikipedia. The introduction reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to the Sam Spade detective agency Our goal is to provide top-notch investigative service to our clients, promote justice and discourage corruption, and to combine our efforts as effectively as possible. We collect data regarding dubious persons and circumstances, and put them to good use at the appropriate time and place. Those wishing to be public members may contact me on the talk page. Those wishing to remain confidential may contact me by email or IM.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Any unofficial, unsanctioned, ad hoc organization that seeks as it's stated goal to collect "evidence" of other editors that they consider "dubious" for later use in actions like RFC/RFAR smacks of witch hunts, is antithetical to wikipedia's spirit, will have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas that Sam &amp; crew deem "dubious," and will lend itself to abuses in the form of <a href="../../../v/e/x/Vexatious_litigation.html" title="Vexatious litigation">vexatious litigation</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malicious_prosecution.html" title="Malicious prosecution">malicious prosecution</a>, etc. Consider the group's statement of purpose: <i>"We collect data regarding dubious persons and circumstances, and put them to good use at the appropriate time and place."</i> This there anything that more utterly violates the spirit of wikipedia? Taken with <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html#On_FM_Copyvio" title="User talk:Morven">Sam's recent history of frivolous actions</a> these new efforts to amass evidence prior to any specific charges and recruiting others to do the same on his behalf show Sam to be little more than a vexatious and mendacious litigant looking to expand his reach and scope. Furthermore, the fact that this is a privately organized effort directed at selected individuals will heavily discount the value of any "evidence" this group obtains and presents, and will cast serious doubt on the motive of any subsequent action that Sam or any of the crew that he assembles are party to. <a href="../../../v/e/x/Vexatious_litigation.html" title="Vexatious litigation">Vexatious</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malicious_prosecution.html" title="Malicious prosecution">malicious prosecution</a> are serious concerns at wikipedia and far too common, and this sort of experiment lends itself to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barratry.html" title="Barratry">barratry</a> quite easily.

'Weak' because it <i>is</i> his User space (though there are still conditions of use), and because I doubt that it would do anything but become (at most) a mild irritant. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 08:40, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm not a big fan of this page or of its creator, but it <i>is</i> in userspace, and I don't believe that VfD is the appropriate forum for questionable userspace content like this.

<li><b>comment</b> quite a bleak example of wikilawyering. This sort of activism is certainly not welcome, dispute resolution is a necessary evil, and not the point of Wikipedia. It is in user space, however, and I trust that the community will react appropriately to such attempts, regardless whether it be "professional" wikilawyering or "amateur" wikilawyering. If it is considered disruptive, the arbcom should deal with it, not vfd. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:16, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd>This is called "unfounded hyperbole", and it works quite well as long as people don't counter it with facts. Stricken. I still don't like it, though. VfDs on articles and VfDs on user pages are completely different things. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 15:10, 2005 Apr 11 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In addition, if consensus should be we <i>do</i> decide this sort of thing on VfD, I'd like that to be said more explicitly. Current discussions are bogged down by questions of legitimacy, so I don't think we can rely on "we'll figure it out as we go along" anymore—especially considering Sam's diatribe below.

<dd>You know, I should really sit down and read stuff sometimes. Aside from wasting people's time, it would make me look like less of an idiot, which is nice too. Alternatively, don't try editing Wikipedia when you're busy with other stuff. In my defense: what you're quoting is in a table headed "Problems that <i>don't</i> require deletion", which is probably why I missed it in my fly-by skimming. It should be under "problems that <i>might</i> require deletion".&#160;:-) Thanks to <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a>. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 13:06, 2005 Apr 11 (UTC)

It's also amusing that the note says "<i>After you've been here for a year or so, and written lots of great articles, the community may be more inclined to let you get away with it</i>" good thing Sam hasn't been here for a year and hasn't written many articles, huh? <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 14:46, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am disappointed with the tone of the page, and can certainly see the potential for abuse. On the other hand, I would rather see any organizations like this to be out in the open and not hidden in back channels or completely off the Wikipedia. I agree with several of the people who have said that this nomination is (currently) inappropriate for a VfD vote. If it does look like the organization is living up to my worst fears, then it should be handled through <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> and <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a> and not <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. (1) User pages are generally free to have whatever content you want. I know plenty of people who have frivolous content and even anti-wikipedia sentiment on their User pages. (2) How is this "agency" any different from letting people contact you on your talk page about issues they want your help with. People do that to me all the time. All Sam is doing is creating a separate page for it and adding a little more organization. Perfectly fine. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 17:55, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Comment</b>. Deleting this page will not delete the agency. Sam has been open about his project, and it is being monitored. if this page goes there is no way to monitor what the agency will do, which I think would be a bad thing. If people want to stop his agency here is not the place to do it, and as long as his agency is legitimate then this page should be too. I urge those who want to stop his agency to go through the proper procedure and debate it in the proper forums, then put a Vfd here, --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 18:08, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There is nothing wrong with someone conducting investigations, many users probably do, at least Sam is being open about it. It is a user sub page and compared to many user subpages that are maintained this one does not merit deletion. Regarding starting any kind of "organization" as far as laws and concepts regarding "freedom of association" are concerned I do not think that "we" could stop such a move by Sam and his friends if we tried.

<li><b>Move</b> to Wikipedia namespace and make it a public organization. Run it in the same way as other voluntary and unofficial organizations, as was (eventually) done with a group that had rather similar aims and methods. That should keep potential abuse well in check—but would make it redundant with at least two other groups.<br />
Or: Leave it alone, watch it carefully, and publicize its actions well. Let it stand or fall on its own merits. Perhaps it will acquire a reputation as a stalwart defender of the bullied and downtrodden. Perhaps it will acquire a reputation for bullying and treading down. Perhaps no-one will use it and it will fade into obscurity.

<p><b>Comment.</b> I'm not sure on the page, but the actions describe within should be examined and rebuked if they make Wikipedia a less open and community-based system. Tabs should be kept to make sure this group doesn't get out of line or becomes some sort of police force for Wikipedia, but I don't think the userpage is all that significant until that occurs. If this little detective agency moves forward and violates the community, then my vote becomes a vote to delete.</p>

<li>Checking edit histories, I must conclude that Exploding hasn't contacted Sam about this page, before listing it on VfD. It therefore seems proper to close this VfD, give Exploding the time to contact Sam, and then have Exploding start a new VfD if he deems it necessary. This does sound needlessly bureaucratic, and seems unlikely to actually help. Indeed, this VfD seems likely to end in 'no consensus' either way.</li>
<li>Therefore, the best solution seems to be to take the matter to RfC - that applies to both (and separately) the alleged conflicts between Sam and Exploding, and any disputes regarding existence of a detective agency on WP.</li>

<p>Fine. Let's cut out the needless bureaucracy: Sam, what's the deal with this page? It seems highly inappropriate and I'm concerned also that you're advertising it on other pages as well as embedding it in your user name whenever you sign a post. I have no desire to antagonise you; I would have listed a similar page started by <i>any</i> user, because this type of "organisation" is, in my view, completely anathema to the spirit of Wikipedia and has vast potential for causing problems.

<dd>I have never suggested we vote to delete any user.
