<li><b>Redirect</b>. Conversely, articles would have to be created for many other countries/territories which are similarly effected, if not more. This article is the only one existing for an entity not directly affected by the Tsunami, and its singular existance skews the overall perspective of wikipedia too much in one small direction. In addition, some of its statements, such as "The catastrophe had a large psychological impact" appears exaggerated and overly emotive for an encyclopedia article.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 06:21, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Alright. May I know if <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effect_of_the_2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_on_Norway_3803.html" title="Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Norway">Norway</a> was hit by the tremor or tsunami?

<li>Oh hell yes. The wave slamed into the Indian subcontinent, was uplifted into the air by the <a href="../../../h/i/m/Himalayas.html" title="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>, and smashed squaringly onto poor <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a>. No one could explain why only this particular Scandinavian country was hit, and was indeed a freak chain of events certainly worthy of its own article.

<ul>
<li>Thanks for telling what'd happened. (So Hong Kong is the only country not directly hit to have such an article, since Norway was directly hit. Am I right?) — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 08:38, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li>From your declaring that Norway was directly hit by the tremors and/or the tsunami, and therefore it deserves <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effect_of_the_2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_on_Norway_3803.html" title="Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Norway">its own article</a>, it's pretty obvious that you're twisting some facts to fulfill your targeting on Hong Kong-related topics on Wikipedia. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 10:14, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you wish to use sarcasm/humour in otherwise serious discussions in wikipedia, then others are probably excused for expecting you to be able to accept it too. Once again, your <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paranoia.html" title="Paranoia">paranoia</a> with regards to others' targeting on certain topics has played a bigger part then it should in your editorial judgement, hence again raising questions on your claimed "fairness" and "maturity" in wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Instantnood" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Instantnood" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. When I voted in this article, I did so on the simple reason that the earthquakes effect on HK is marginal at best compared to many other countries/territories without seeing a need to create a similar article. What is written for this article can easily be had in others. I did not notice the existance of an article for Norway until you pointed it out, which I found was an unfotunate occurance as I am afraid individuals (like yourself) would then take it as an excuse to create similar articles on every territory on earth no matter how small the effect actually is.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 10:34, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You were the only person to have mentioned fairness and maturity over there. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 10:59, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>There is such a thing called <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synonym.html" title="Synonym">synonyms</a>.

</li>
<li>Glad you know this word (a word that I mentioned frequently when saying country and sovereign state have to be distinguished). Could you please kindly tell what are the synonyms of maturity and fairness that I have used to claim myself to be?

<li>Just curious, but are you aware what this page is? Do you not feel any sense of shame in displaying this kind of behavior for all to see? If you spent the time to engage in wiki-<a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap operas</a> on explaining the significance of this article, or adding good content to any other wikipedia article, I would think all will be better off.

<ul>
<li>I see. We have (yet another) instance of instantnood refusing to accept any responsiblity whatsoever in any contentious issues concerning wikipedia. All of a sudden, I am now being portrayed as a "troublemaker" who caused the above exchange single-handedly. Suddenly, instantnood's role dissapears completely from view. Do I need to clear my name? Hardly, because I dont attempt to shun responsiblity the way instantnood does, almost like its an inborn habit of his. I am more then willing to say that I felt ashamed that I was participating in this kind of low-level exhange in a page like this. If I hadent felt this sense of shame or guilt, I wont be asking him if he felt the same way. I call this exchange a soap opera, because it reads embarrasingly like one. Who is blaming who for "staging a soap opera", whatever that means? I suppose he dosent seem to feel any remorse based on his ceaseless attempts to be a real pain anywhere in wikipedia, even in a page like this? --<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 13:57, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Huaiwei did not express his feeling of shame or guilt when he was asking me that question <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Effect_of_the_2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_on_Hong_Kong&amp;diff=24723461&amp;oldid=24723392" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Effect_of_the_2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_on_Hong_Kong&amp;diff=24723461&amp;oldid=24723392" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, and I have not said a single word on whether I have shunned any of my responsibility that resulted from my responses to what Huaiwei has said. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 14:24, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>From this response, I could only conclude that either it confirms his chronic inability in accepting responsibility (he practically ignored what I just said and insisted he was still innocent), or he has some difficulty in comprehending the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a>. I rest my case.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 14:52, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I see. I remember this strategy before. When an article/category which instantnood wants to keep is nominated for deletion, he gets every other related article/category nominated too, in his bid to swing the votes around in his favour, even if other similar pages may be far more deserving to remain. This is becoming yet another example of instantnood's constant manipulation and gaming of wikipedia rules/mechanisms, and I do hope other wikipedians and admins may take note of this.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 13:57, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If an article or a category should be deleted, the same reasons would very likely be applicable to other similar articles or categories. How much similarities do the articles share, and whether such similarities merit the same or similar action, are to be decided by the community. Each wikipedian can make her/his own decision, don't think votes can be swung or manipulated. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 14:24, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> IMHO that nomination is very close to violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, wether or not other nations have seperate articles should have no impact on wether or not this article about Hong Kong should be kept. I'm actualy a little supriced Germany or Sweden (and others) doesn't have seperate articles, they lost a lot of people too and probably raised simmilar debate and critisism as we had in Norway about how to handle major disasters involving our citizens abroad. The lack of or exsistence off other articles should have no bearing on wether or not this should be kept or deleted. If it contains information beyond what is in other articles it shouold be kept, otherwise it should be deleted, simple as that. Deleting it just because Hong Kong was not directly hit is just as bad a reason as keeping it just because Norway have a simmilar article. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> 14:09, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Length of an article may or may not be relevant in deciding whether an article should be deleted. If the two articles share substantial similarities, and if the arguments mentioned in this page are readily applicable other similar articles, it would be better to assess them together. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 14:24, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Article length is an often-used criterion in deciding whether an article is deleted or not, and it is a relevant criterion in this instance, since its length does not justify its existance when its information could fit into other articles easily.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 14:58, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>this article violates all sorts of wikipedia standards, but it was created to assist in donation efforts. in its creation, this article was meant to be temporary - and now it is time to delete it. although relief fund-raising continues, it has fallen off, and wikipedia *must* get rid of this article which violates all kinds of policies and standards.</i></li>

<li>The subsequent voting process was overwelmingly in his favour.

<li><b>Comment</b> on expanded article: The only significant expansion we can see in this article is the "Responses of the government and other organisations" section, which quite unfortunately is simply non-relevant to this article which talks about the <i>effect</i> it has on HK. The only other non-dorectly affected country article, <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effect_of_the_2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_on_Norway_3803.html" title="Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Norway">Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Norway</a> makes no mention on relief efforts at all, as all these should be in <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanitarian_response_to_the_2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_5a2b.html" title="Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a>. As for the section on Impact, which should be the gist of the article, it again suffers from exagerated comments, not surprising since we have members here fighting to keep it around and make it appear "significant" enough. The reduction in travel to the region affects the entire global tourism industry, and there is nothing notably different in this text. The humanitarian response and show of emotional care is to be expected in any civilised society. Anyhow, saying "Thai and Indonesian culture is highly visible in Hong Kong" is itself debatable, besides the question of just what kind of and the extend of its impact it can have on HK itself. To sum up...what has actually been contributed to the article besides the obvious?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 19:51, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for the comments. Agree the article needs further improvement. In fact some of your comments are also applicable to the Norway counterpart. Response are results of the effect. The Norway article talks about impact too. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 22:42, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Humanitarian efforts as a result of the "effect", if any, will have to directly addressed to the reader, or else no one is going to make this assumption. Does the degree of "effect" have on the amount of $$$ donated internationally? Please illustrate. The Norway article talks about impact, and rightfully yes it should, because this is mainly what an <i>effect</i> is all about. It does not, however, devote a sizeable chunk of its text on humanitarian responses thou, and there is no reason for it to.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 23:52, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
