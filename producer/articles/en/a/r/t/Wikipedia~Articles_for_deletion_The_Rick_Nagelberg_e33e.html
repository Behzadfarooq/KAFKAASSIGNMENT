<p>Do Not Delete! On a recent visit to Austin, Texas I stopped by one of the UT frat houses. They handed me a drink which they called the Rick Nagelberg. It was amazing! Everyone at UT was drinking them and for the longest time I was searching the web trying to find it. Do Not Delete this entry. It has forever changed how I begin my evenings and NOT just in a small college town. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 172.136.231.83 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.198.204.188_81fa.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.198.204.188">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> not to be rude / a troll or anything, but you'd think college students would have better things to do than spam&#160;:sockpuppets&#160;: trying to keep a short article about a DRINK on wikipedia. In addition, the only informative thing on this page is&#160;:"The beverage consists of three shots of regular vodka and an additional shot of rasberry vodka. The drink is always served on</dd>

<p><b>PLEASE DON"T DELETE. I ONCE DRANK A RICK NAGELBERG WHEN I WAS 17 AND I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND I WAS 52 AND WORKING TWO JOBS JUST TO KEEP MY KIDS IN SCHOOL. IT'S A WONDERFUL DRINK.</b></p>
<p><br />
<b>== The Rick Nagelberg was used to fuel the Apollo 11. True Story. ==</b></p>
<p>Not to be rude or anything, but you would think Tokakeke would have something better to do than to argue with college students over whether a world changing drink should be allowed to remain on the online encyclopedia wikipedia. Clearly it's affecting your life in more ways then it should, so what are you even bothering to protest about?</p>

<p>DO NOT DELETE:::::::to argue WP:NFT, a rick nagelberg was not something that was merely thought up in one day, it has infact been around for a long time and if the postings do not prove to you that it ihttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Rick_Nagelberg&amp;action=edits wide spread then you should consult any bar in any number of colleges accross the country who will say that it is an up and coming popular drink. To argue WP:V, this is not a posting that is looking to harm Wikipedia or inpact it in any negative manner. This is a posting that is there to help people who are searching for resources on the new drink that is sweeping the nation. This is not WP:NOT, this is not what "wikipedia is not." Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that is made to help all people and that is what this post is for. IF you can make some other excuse besides """SOCK PUPPETS""" as a reason to delete this article than make it. As of now, I think you are just coming up with excuses to get rid of this article because you dislike the people making it. You are WP:NOT.</p>
<p>If Wikipedia moderators are gonna delete this page I wish they would just do it already. I posted the listing because I have heard alot of amusing stories pertaining to the drink and from what I can tell, it IS in fact becoming quite popular (at least among the college crowd). If it isn't appropriate then take it down, but the fact that a screwdriver has a listing seems to contradict your logic.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Screwdriver+drink" gets over 750,000 hits. "Rick Nagelberg" gets a WHOPPING one, and from a NN website with only one sentence on&#160;:&#160;:it. "Pasadena Mudslide" (eww) gets over 1,000. As for the guy above, your sock-puppets aren't helping your case. Read the warning I put at the top of the page. With all due respect, you should not be talking about "what wikipedia is not" when you have zero edits. Also, I live near a university, and called the bar most frequented by college students. They had never heard of a "rick nagelberg". If more bars had known about it, wouldn't there be more than one google result? EDIT: Urban dictionary gets no definitions, a website extremely popular with college students. Tokakeke 01:06, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There. We edited it and it isn't so off the wall. As for the traffic argument, I happen to know that the site has been visited alot more than once. Even if that was the case, the page has only been here for a week or so. Let the page stay, it is now down to the bare essentials. I guarantee you will not regret it.</p>
