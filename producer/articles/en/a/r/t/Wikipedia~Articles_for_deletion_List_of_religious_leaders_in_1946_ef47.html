There are lists for every year since 1935, with the odd exception of 1951. All of those articles, as well as lists of state leaders, colonial governors, and leaders of international organizations were created as part of a WikiProject (<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Leaders_by_year_5a16.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Leaders by year">Wikipedia:WikiProject Leaders by year</a>). The reason they are part of separate pages instead of on the year page (as Quarl erroneously claims they are in general--they aren't, and if a specific year page has any leaders, they should be moved off it to the appropriate separate list) because the lists are huge (especially state leaders, which is the set of lists that gets the most attention). -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 07:53, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm leaning towards keep now. BTW the reason I thought years contained political leaders is due to the list in <a href="../../../1/_/_/1.html" title="1">1</a> (I was working on math articles).
