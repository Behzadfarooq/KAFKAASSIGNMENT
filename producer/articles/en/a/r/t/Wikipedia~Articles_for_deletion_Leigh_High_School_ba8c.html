<dd>For the sake of defusing perceived racist overtones in my above statement: I was thinking of a hypothetical school with a smallest enrolment and smallest of locations - and the above is what came to my mind (see also my more polite version of the question, below).

<li>Look, if <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a>, a <s>shitty</s> pokemon character is "worthwhile" enough to be a featured article, just about any school I can imagine is "worthwhile" to have a plain old article. This is the very problem with these debates, some of us consider schools to be worthwhile and the deletion policies provide for these articles to be retained unless there is a consensus to delete them.

<li>And yet the writers of that page found 4 times as much stuff to say about the shitty pokemon character in question then anyone anywhere has to say about your shitty school. We might not enjoy playing pokemon, but it's spawned a cartoon and cardgame, been parodied and mentioned in many other shows and media. It's been the subject of numerous news pieces. It's a subject of debate among religious conservatives. It's the brainchild of one of the most powerful organizations in Japan, and may have collectively led to hundreds of millions in revenue, and was important in spawning entire genres of TV and card games. If historians in 100 years look back on our time, they might make note of pokemon, they probably won't note your school. --<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainManacles_caf8.html" title="User:CaptainManacles">captainManacles</a>

In 100 years (like the details of most fads from 100 years ago) individual pokemon characters will almost entirely be forgotten (e.g. can you tell me without researching which honours can catch the ten in Scotch Whist?).

<li><i>Question</i>: Folks keep saying "notable" and "notable enough" and the like. Since these same people argue that "notability is not a requirement," what I want to know is <i>what sets this school apart from other schools?</i> If this is the sort of school that you would say, "Ooooh, I'm going to take note of that one; it's not like every other one at all," I would like to know what it is that would draw that. I ask because I can't see where the article gives anything, and we are supposed to be talking about the article, and not the article type, not former arguments, not the nominator, and not our general views of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:09, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, bringing up the nominator in a sense answers your question. This school was singled out because a newly registered editor listed it for deletion. There are plenty of other schools whose articles are in worse shape or are less than stubs that are not marked for deletion, partly because experienced editors know that it is very unlikely that a legitimate high school article will ever get deleted (even if they wish they would be). This same editor tried to speedy delete <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Horn_2d8d.html" title="Golden Horn">Golden Horn</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Elizabeth_Catholic_High_School_6f2f.html" title="St. Elizabeth Catholic High School">St. Elizabeth Catholic High School</a>. --<a href="../../../u/s/g/User%7EUsgnus_fc47.html" title="User:Usgnus">Usgnus</a> 12:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Again, other articles needing deletion really doesn't answer why this should be kept. I can agree that the nominator is suspicious, but I don't think that there would be delete votes possible if the article in question weren't failing the guidelines. The people voting to delete aren't trolls, aren't "deletionists," aren't haters of education, America, and apple pie, and the people voting "keep" have been the first to bring in personalities and to label other voters with some imagined opprobrium. If we remain focused on the article and whether or not it violates the deletion policy, it's fair to ask what, about this article, gives us a singular quality to the subject. (I vote to keep schools some of the time, delete some of the time; it depends on the article, not its subject.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:53, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

If an article on a real country says, "Russia is a big country to the east of me," I'd vote to delete the article (not "clean it up"). Further, micronations claim to be countries and are routinely cast out. Further, schools are not like nations in any manner except occupying space.

<li>It's a part of the common law of WP:AfD - not sure if it's codified anywhere. To delete an article titled Russia rather than clean it up is pure madness. If an article about a country is just a stub, it's still worthwhile It's a stub is not a good criterion for deletion. Micronations claiming to be countries in general fails WP:HORSE and thus the position All countries are inherently worthy of articles is a true one. FWIW, I'm not saying that I believe that all high schools are worthy of articles, just that it is a part of the common law that they are. WilyD 14:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Despite your apparently relish for citing your own contributions, these comments exactly categorize the problem with your position on these issues. AfD is <b>not</b> cleanup, and yet you think it is just fine to ignore the stated <b>policies</b> at <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> in order to effectively use AfD as a tool for cleaning up articles that are worthwhile. An article about Russia is so obviously not a candidate for deletion as to beg the question, irrespective of its condition.

<li>I think you need to check your syntax a bit. If you mean that I have a relish for citing my own articles, it is no relish, but rather a refutation to the common thuggery of "you deletionist you," which is an absurdity when applied to <i>any</i> editor. Secondly, "policy" for AfD is the deletion guideline. An article on Russia that is "Russia is a country to the east of me" is <i>not an article.</i> It is not a stub. It is not a substub. It is, instead, a speedy deletion candidate. Please look at the speedy delete guidelines and come to understand them. Also, if you believe that single sentences are articles, I suspect that you may be thinking of HiLites and not an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:21, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>No syntax check required. They are not "your" articles. I assume you are referring to your <b>contributions</b>. I don't care if you initiated ten thousand articles on wikipedia, it doesn't change the fact that you "routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school-related articles", and that you do so on the basis that you don't consider individual schools to be a worthwhile subject matter for individual articles. You're entitled to do so, but the rest of us are equally entitled vote to keep such articles on the basis that we DO consider individual schools to be a worthwhile subject matter for individual articles. You continually (for years now) to insist that we ought to somehow leave the opinion that schools are inherently noteworthy "at the door", as it were - but at the same time you and the rest of those "who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school-related articles" are free to cart your opinion right on into the AfD discussions. Add a dose of heaping condescencion, then brag a little about your own <b>contributions</b> and guess what - despite all that, not a single verifiable high school article has been excised from wikipedia through the deletion processes in almost 2 years.

<dd>Ahem. I vote to keep some schools, delete some schools, and redirect others, as I actually read the article and decide whether it follows policy. You, however, prejudge that all of something fits. As for whether I "routinely" vote to delete, I do not <b>routinely</b> vote any way. I actually <i>consider</i> the article. On the other hand, you vote and encourage others to vote by rote, by routine, to vote universally, without consideration of the individual at hand. This is combined with an absolute error of fact, as several school articles have been deleted just in the last two weeks, much less in the last two years. I assume you watchlist every one of them and watch New Pages obsessively to make sure that every single school is preserved, no matter what the nature of hte "article?" That kind of obsession is unhealthy. As for whether my contributions are my articles, I will leave that absurdity alone. However, what is at stake is much, much more pernicious than a single case of your playing "gotcha": You and others voting <b>by routine</b> rather than by <b>consideration</b> have <i>routinely</i> attacked the character, intelligence, and motives of every person voting contrary to your opinion. You, collectively, have tried to make each consideration personal rather than intellectual and a matter of passion rather than judgment. This is corrosive. While I'm not interested in playing games with the feeble, I am interested in stopping this habit of people attacking nominators and voters. It is absolutely disgusting to observe.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not sure there is a "conspiracy", but there is a concerted effort underway (for some time) to excise school articles from wikipedia and find a way to overturn the overwhelming precedent that school articles are simply not deleted (as a general rule) through the deletion processes. Why do I say there is a concerted effort? Mass-nominations of related schools all on the same day (both this month and last month). Sock-puppet nominations to AfD (such as this one). Refusual by "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" to recognize that there even <b>is</b> a precedent (which there obviously is). (Yes, I recognize that the precedent is not binding upon future AfD discussions, but "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" ought to take that precedent into account before nominating school articles and before engaging in these "discussions"). Repeated assertions and claims that there is "no consensus to keep high schools", when well over 95% of AfD disucssions on high school articles have ended in overwhelming consensus to <b>keep</b>. After over 2 years of wrangling, it really is time for "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" to find a new hobby horse and accept that school articles have become a standard part of wikipedia. With there being over ten thousand articles about schools included in the project to date, average readers will have certainly come to expect to find school articles in the encyclopedia when referencing them. On many days, scores of new school articles are created and the inevitability of the nature of this project ensures that the vast majority of these will reamin in the project and be organically expanded. Those who do not believe that schools are worthwhile, or notable, or encyclopedic have every right to that opinion and to express it, but I think we can all agree that these debates (at least on high school articles) are largely fruitless and irrespective of what side of the debate you fall on, in light of the overwhelming precedent, these "discussions" in and of themselves add precious little to wikipedia. All this being said, it is no excuse for some "inclusionists" to violate <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> in their frustration.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 19:05, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree, Nicodemus, in my opinion deletionism, like a cancer, is eating up the vital information that helps draw in people to the project. The consensus in the community is to keep all school articles. I completely understand people getting frustrated and I think that people after having been frustrated about all their valuable high school facts <i>need</i> to lash out a little bit. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 19:21, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not even going to get into the schools are notable/not notable debate, I'm just here to say <b>keep</b> and that AfD is *not* cleanup. Many of the people who have a problem with this article aren't even discussing notablility. "It sounds like an ad," "Why is the school hymn in there?"

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - this is a high school that makes explicit claims of notability, with multiple alumni who have merited inclusion on their own merit.

<li><b>Delete</b> - per nom by Geogre. Having 3 famous alumni is hardly claim to fame. So its a good school within the state, great, but fails notability.
