<li><b>Delete and merge</b> - back into Muhammad per the above. Article is almost entirely written from one source, and is short enough that anything useful can be merged back.

<dd>Muhammad was once viewed as a demon, Lewis says. After refomations and after the crusades, he was viewed as a self-seeking imposter. Lewis says: "The modern historian will not readily believe that so great and significant a movement was started by a self-seeking imposter." Now, either Modern scholars or Medieval ones were misunderstanding?</dd>
<dd>Merzbow, I can send you the journal article from which I took "the misunderstandings about Muhammad, were brought on by the Crusades and were kept up by Christian and other authorities".

<li><b>Keep</b> Has potential. I'm not sure about renaming to "Understanding of Islam in the West". That's a vast topic, and would encompass everything from the 6th Century to 9-11.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Use of the term "The West" in the context of this article is unencyclopedic, due to its ambiguity, and because the terminology is POV-centric. What is "The West"? And, more importantly, who defines it? Is it the US, the Americas, Europe? Does it include Australia, even though that continent is geographically east? What about the large portion of Russia that is part of the Asian continent? Are Israelis "Westerners"? What about Palestinians living in the same region? Why separate the views of eastern non-Muslims (Indians, Chinese, Japanese, etc.) from those of western non-Muslims? What about the views of Muslims who live in "The West"? Are these not "Western" views of Muhammad? A much clearer, less POV-centric, more encyclopedic title for this article would be "Non-Muslim views of Muhammad." If the article is kept, a summary paragraph will still need to be included in the Muhammad article. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 18:23, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Keeping a summary paragraph with a pointer to longer article is quite normal. As for the 'West', it is a bit vague, but not unencyclopedic. It is used for short hand in many academic discussions to mean Europe, America and those part of the world sharing much of their their cultural assumptions (so yes Australia and NZ etc.). THe nations that would once largely have been seen as predominantly Christian. As for Muslims in the West, there's no explicit reason why they shouldn't be included, although probably only in so far as their views might be distinguished from other Islamic views of the prophet (I don't know whether they can be or not).--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 18:32, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The article currently does not define what it means by "The West." If the term is commonly used in academic discussions to mean Europe and culturally related countries, that ought to be clarified and works cited to support the distinction. I found that Non-Islamic views of Muhammad already exists, and this article is redundant with that one. What is the justification for keeping this separate article? <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 18:46, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We should see how Britannica Encyclopedia is using that. In medieval times, it refers to Europe I think. This article focuses on the views about Muhammad as they historically developed and explaining the reasons behind this development etc etc. Non-Islamic views of Muhammad presents different sample views of different scholars but not in a systematic way. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 00:40, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I generally try to avoid political, religious, and political-religions articles, but I have to say, all these articles that keep getting created (like this one) are just serving to make wikipedia ever more a publisher of original thought, essays, and synthesis, however "encyclopedic" the article's title makes the page sound.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 05:58, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The section for which this article is supposedly an expansion is actually entitled "Medieval Christian views of Muhammad"--that's a huge disconnect. I would have to agree with Dmz5. This article is a synthesis of views of various authors (heavily weighted toward Muslim scholars), and thus constitutes original research. A more apt name for the article in its present state might be <i>Muslim views about the image of Muhammad in the West</i>. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 06:23, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't understand why somebody calls it POV. There are different POV about him in the west. We can't merge it in the main article(Prophet <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>) because that article is long and this is not a main issue. So we should make a new article.--<a href="../../../s/a/2E/User%7ESa.vakilian_5dc3.html" title="User:Sa.vakilian">Sa.vakilian</a> 07:26, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

It's the article itself that is the trouble. It's incredibly POV and inaccurate in its current state. Using just one source for this kind of thing is never a good idea.

<li><b>stong keep</b> and rename to Christians view of Muhammad, making it a sub-article to Non-Islamic views of Muhammad. Having this much content on the christian view would seriously unbalance the Non-Islamic views article, that article already having to much christian views material compared to other religions and non-religions. So, merge the chritian views of the non-Muslim view article to this article, and make a short summary there. I am going to be bold and do that, except for the renaming part. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> 14:03, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> a special aspect is not a POV fork. That there was once a negative image in the west is not POV; first of all it's objectively true, and it can perfectly well be used equally to show the ethnocentricity of W Europe. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 10:56, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The fact remains that this is incredibly POV as it stands. There is no attempt to explain why such a negative image arose. Western contacts with Islam hardly began with the Crusades. <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heraclius.html" title="Heraclius">Heraclius</a> and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Poitiers_6c20.html" title="Battle of Poitiers">Battle of Poitiers</a>, anyone? As I've said, it also has little about later attitudes, particularly those of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment figures (e.g. Voltaire's highly ambivalent attitude towards Islam and Mohammed). At the moment it is an extremely crude, black-and-white propagandistic piece, the sort of thing that gives Wikipedia a bad name. There's a quotation from Jerry Vines, but no reference to <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Massignon_41f9.html" title="Louis Massignon">Louis Massignon</a> (there is a longish Wikipedia article on the latter).Using this article to "show the ethnocentricity of W Europe" is hardly going to solve the POV problems here. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 11:23, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Folantin, you are right. The article lacks the views of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment people and most importantly the view of Modern scholars. Please help. It is 100% justified to add POV tag to the article. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 11:28, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Unfortunately, I'm relying on memory and I don't have the resources to hand at the moment, except for that Rodinson chapter, which is good but relatively short. It also deals with the image of Islam as a whole in the West, rather than Muhammed in particular, and it makes no mention of Carlyle, who is probably going to be a key figure in any article with this title.</dd>

<ul>
<li>Why lump Christian views of Islam together with those of secularists and humanists, while excluding those of Hindus and Buddhists? Christians have a lot more beliefs in common with Muslims than they do with secular humanists. This distinction between the West and the East really makes no sense in the context of this article, and is quite arbitrary. And what about Jewish views. Do they come from the "East" or the "West"? <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 22:27, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The use of "West" in the title is not arbitrary since major scholars like Rodinson use it. See also: <i>Islam and the West</i> by <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a>, <i>The War for Muslim Minds: Islam and the West</i> by Gilles Kepel, <i>Islam, the West and Challenges of Modernity</i> by <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tariq_Ramadan_ff0b.html" title="Tariq Ramadan">Tariq Ramadan</a>, <i>The West, Islam and Islamism</i> by Caroline Cox and John Marks, <i>Islam and the West: Conflict or Cooperation?</i> by Amin Saikal, <i>Islam and the Medieval West</i> by Stanley Ferber, and - above all - <i>Islam and the West: The Making of an Image</i> by Norman Daniel and <i>Image of the Prophet Muhammad in the West</i> by Jabal Muhammad Buaben. You can look "West" up in a dictionary: it means European civilisation and its offshoots. Voltaire, Gibbon, Carlyle et al. emerged from the same culture as Dante and Peter the Venerable and this article should examine the shifting attitudes of Westerners towards Muhammad (it is often very difficult to assess just how Christian, agnostic or atheist some of the major Western figures are after the Enlightenment). Hindus and Buddhists have had a completely different historical experiences of Islam so their attitudes towards Muhammad should have separate articles. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 09:12, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
