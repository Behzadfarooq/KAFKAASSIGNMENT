<li>While some of us may have been slightly harsh I would like to point out that while, yes, we all were new users once, I sincerely doubt <i>any</i> of the above voters ever behaved like this, particularly after being told <i>numerous times</i> that such behavior was disruptive and not appreciated. He continued to make lists only slightly more viable than List of movies with the words "good", "bad", and "ugly" in the title on one extreme, and List of movies about stuff on the other, as well as making substubs that didn't even contain the most basic information an article requires. Most had to be salvaged by some of us who cleaned them up to make them even minimally viable. I can't speak for the user's intent, not knowing what it is, but keep in mind intent is the difference between murder and manslaughter. It doesn't get you off the hook entirely. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 02:48, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
