According to <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>: "An edit counts as original research if it proposes ideas or arguments. That is: &lt;snip&gt; it introduces or uses neologisms, without attributing the neologism to a reputable source" Here, the neologisms are being attributed to a reputable source (namely, <i>The Rush Limbaugh Show</i>). If somebody disputes the use of a term on the show, it can be verified by pointing to an episode of the show in which the word was used. In particular, if the disputed term was used less than 30 days in the past, it is available on the web via the Rush 24/7 service; older references would require going to an archive, of course. — <a href="../../../d/l/j/User%7EDLJessup_f14d.html" title="User:DLJessup">DLJessup</a> (<a href="../../../d/l/j/User_talk%7EDLJessup_a6a0.html" title="User talk:DLJessup">talk</a>) 15:40, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. These terms are notable because of Limbaugh's huge influence on American political (esp. conservative) culture.

<ul>
<li>I don't hate Limbaugh (or are even very familiar with him) . . . my vote was due to the fact that the article seemed like a list of new words coined and that WP is not a dictionary or list of slang, although there are lost of entries that seem to violate that idea. If the words are notable enough and used widely, then maybe I would be Ok with merging it into a sort of "conservative American culture" article, to give it more context.

</li>
<li>Keep or Merge- the article would stand alone because Rush Limbaugh's name provides enough context by itself. Perhaps the name of the article should make reference to parlance rather than jargon.

<li><b>Keep</b>, here's why:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It's about <i>Limbaugh</i> not about the <i>words</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article is not a <i>dictionary</i>, for that would be the standard definitions of these words. Some of the jargon is not <i>neologism</i> but puns, slang, cultural references. In its own context, it is very useful. It's all <i>cited</i> and both suporters and critics of Limbaugh are contributing, and it is <i>above all, useful</i> to the fans or those simply curious about the show. In terms of the structure of the Wikipedia, it has a <i>natural origin</i> since his jargon began to get entered into both the bio article and into the the show article, making a third article as a spin off necessary. If <i>keep</i> loses, the editors of that page will in all likelyhood, recreate the article again if the pattern we saw in 2005 repeats in 2006. The simple analog would be the <i>episode guide</i> and <i>character guide</i> articles of other creative material. And what's <i>motivating</i> this AfD, anyway? Is this a Wikivote on who likes Limbaugh? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatsw_2d50.html" title="User:Patsw">patsw</a> 03:33, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Way to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>.... No, it shouldn't be a wikivote on who likes Limbaugh. It should be on whether it satisfies WP policies. It's one of a great many lists of slang and jargon that were put on AfD in mid to late Feb, including <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Internet_slang_772f.html" title="List of Internet slang">List of Internet slang</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_US_railfan_jargon_f700.html" title="List of US railfan jargon">List of US railfan jargon</a>, all of which should have been deleted if policy were what truly mattered. So no, particularly considering the context of all those other noms, I think the nom is pretty clearly not a case of anti-Limbaugh bias. There is no doubt a place for all of the lists (internet, railfan, Limbaugh jargon, etc.) somewhere on the web, just not here. I don't know where you get the idea the Limbaugh list is all cited; aren't there just seven cites on the page?</dd>
<dd>It needs a lot more context. When Limbaugh uses these nicknames, how does he use them? Does he say something like "So and so, or as I like to call him, (insert puerile pun here)" or does he say the nickname without ever using the person's real name at all? If the former, or in the cases where the real name is obvious, or context makes the real name obvious, there's really no reason for the list. Also, some of the names seem to indicate faults he finds in the person, but others don't convey any obvious meaning at all. If his fans want to get really <i>encyclopedic,</i> rather than engaging in fanlistcruft, they'd try to: (1) establish when the name was first used by him (2) if he invented it, or if it was in prior use by others (3) what the name means (if not original research), (4) document whether the name was used more than once, and if so how often (otherwise definitely not notable), (5) whether the use of the name has spread beyond his fans (otherwise hardly notable). If all those conditions could be satisfied, possibly the reasons I cited above for why the page should be deleted would not apply. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 04:23, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> As others said, if it merged with another article it would be to one that is already long enough. Given the importance of the show, and the need for someone to already know what he means, this list is necessary.--<a href="../../../b/e/d/User%7EBedford_bc5c.html" title="User:Bedford">Bedford</a> 03:58, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article is misnamed. It may contain references from the show, but it's not <i>jargon</i> so much as schtick. Some of it is manufactured terms, some are portmanteaus and some are just puns, but it's almost all part of Limbaugh's satire and sense of humor/comedy routine, none of it is about creating new definitions or establishing new jargon. It's about commentary, satire, editorializing, etc. In many ways, Limbaugh's manufactured terminology is a defining characteristic of his show, just as such terminology often is with any show. At most, I'd merge it back into the Show article (e.g., South Park's "jargon" schtick is all contained within the show's main article). We have an entire article dedicated to what various abbreviations in World of Warcraft mean. That's far closer to documenting definitions than this article is, and I think neither needs to be removed per policy. <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 16:07, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
