I think that pretty much anyone who has a basic understanding of either Islamism or Fascism realizes that this concept is nonsensical, but despite this it is inarguable that the term is today a popular one.

<li><b>Merge &amp; redirect</b> to <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a> . The article is just gonna be used for attacks on Islam . People who want this article are well known for this non-sense . When there is a whole big section on Islam &amp; fachism , there is no point of starting a new article on it . Bush uses a lot of terms , like the famous "we are on a crusade" , or the "operation shock &amp; awe" , that is now changed to "operation enduring freedom". But is bush running this site?? Furthermore why isnt there any separate article on christianfascism or hindufascism . And most important , Americanfascism . The information black outs ( &amp; the media that calls itself free &amp; unbiased ), attacks on countries without UN permission , "either you are with us or against us", pre-emptive strike doctrine ....isnt all this fascism . Same standards should be followed for every article . This POV pushing is the kind of thing because of which no person would use Wp for serious research . Because there always are people who consider their biased understanding as facts . <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarhansher_7fdc.html" title="User:Farhansher">Farhansher</a> 19:40, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Bigotry, Hate speech, and Systemic bias are all things that aren't too good. However, being that Islamofascism is a word that is widely used today, my position on this article is that it should be kept and we should discuss exactly <i>who</i> uses the term, <i>why</i> they use the term and <i>when</i> the term is used.</dd>
<dd>I appreciate that you know I don't support the use of such a term. However, imagine you are an ordinary Australian who knows nothing about Islam and all of a sudden you are confronted with such a term in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Telegraph_eab7.html" title="The Daily Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a></i>. You think to yourself, "I wonder what this is all about?". The average Australian would normally go to Google and do a search on it.</dd>
<dd>What do you want them to find? A conservative blogger who pushes their illegitimate POV in a convincing way (and doesn't point out the counter argument for why it isn't a valid term), or the piece on Wikipedia that details, in a neutral fashion, all sides of the argument?</dd>

That word implies that not only are there lots of lefties on WP, but that there will <i>always</i> be lots of lefties, and that leads us to ask why that should be.

<li><b>Keep</b>...not because I believe Islam is inherently fascist (despite my several objections to Islam), but because the term "Islamofascism" has gained rather widespread currency (for reasons that should be and are covered in the article)... I appreciate that the continued nominations for deletion of this article are brought by muslims who feel insulted by the expansiveness of the article, but I am bound by WP policies regarding notability, to vote to retain the article, keeping in mind that its existence is due to the <i>extensive</i> amount of usage of the term which led to its initial spinning off from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_epithets.html" title="List of political epithets">list of political epithets</a> (which were beginning to inappropriately imbalance that article)... Wishing a phenomenon would go away by repetitively requesting deletion of the article addressing it on Wikipedia is counterproductive (and I think I speak for the vast majority here)...what Muslim Wikipedians and their fellow coreligionists who object to the term and its incumbent castigation of Islam should <i>instead</i> be working on, is cleaning up the well-sourced shortcomings of the Muslim community in addressing and fighting the phenomena the term circumscribes. You don't like the fact that people distrust and mistrust Islam and Muslims? Great. I have no fight with you. Don't cry "foul" tho, just because you disagree with the people against whom the charges are levied. Instead, do something to build up confidence in those who see an enemy in Islam. Don't piss and moan about "anti-Islam" sentiment, when you do nothing to fight against the stupidity carried out in the name of what you believe is a great religion. If you expect people to accord your position any respect, stand up for what you believe are the GOOD points of your religion, instead of fighting blindly against anyone who dares to malign it based on the manifold shortcomings of so many of its claimed adherents.

The text section on the page <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism_%28term%29.html" title="Islamofascism (term)">Islamofascism (term)</a> has 1336 words (with commented out sections counted). The claim above, therefore, does not make a lot of sense. Most of the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism_%28term%29.html" title="Islamofascism (term)">Islamofascism (term)</a> page simply repeats what is already on <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a>. <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism_%28term%29.html" title="Islamofascism (term)">Islamofascism (term)</a> primarily consists of quotes. <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a> also has a discussion of the concept both in the Islam section and the general section that includes cites to scholars.

<dd>Just to chime in here: there are <i>several</i> issues of neutrality in the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html#Islam" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism_and_religion#Islam</a> section: it's full of weasel words, unsourced claims and peacock terms (why are we arguing for or against a particular POV through the use of persuasive language?). And, as I've already stated I feared, the section is far larger than the rest of the sections and has unbalanced the article. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 01:27, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well, the reason <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism_%28term%29.html" title="Islamofascism (term)">Islamofascism (term)</a> resembles a cut-and-paste job is that we've sourced nearly every sentence in order to discourage OR and POV warring. <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a> has more unsourced musing, so it flows more nicely but is more vulnerable to POV warriors who want to charge in with a thorough rewrite. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 18:51, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, Brandon, there are also more articles exploring Israeli shortcomings than there are articles exploring the shortcomings of any Arab or Muslim country. So imbalances go both ways. Wikipedia reflects the interests of its contributors. We can't force Wikipedians to be equally interested in everything, and we can't enforce an "equally offensive to each community" policy. We require a certain minimum of notability, and an NPOV approach. That's served Wikipedia pretty well, and I can't think of a better alternative. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 16:14, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>And this is exactly my point. I don't imagine the trolls are going to be very even-handed about this. However, when an editor like yourself acknowledges with equal fervor that the hatefulness of the terms Zionazism and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> are entirely beside the point, and that both articles are notable, we're getting somewhere. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 16:18, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I've said this from the very beginning, Brandon. You've wanted to paint me as some kind of anti-Islam partisan, but I've insisted all along that notable terms are notable, no matter whose cockles they get up. Jewish cockles or Christian cockles or Hindu cockles or atheist cockles have no more bearing on notability than Muslim cockles. I've never heard the term "Zionazi" used, and it certainly doesn't have the currency that "Islamofascism" has attained, but based on the citations you gave above it looks like it probably is notable enough for a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 16:32, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Presumably you would also vote to delete Unitarian Jihad and Gay Niggers Association of America, as well as all other politically related articles that fail to meet the standard you've proposed above? <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 00:32, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Don't know anything about Unitarian Jihad, but where do you get off saying GNAA doesn't meet standards of notability? GNAA has loads of mentions in mainstream press. It was subject to the same sort of "purge the offensive topic despite its notability!" hysteria as <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> has been subjected to.

<dd>You misunderstand. Unknown person above whom one could identify by perusing the history of this page said that the standard for notability was seeing a term "in the general press as much as <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>." I think that's an entirely arbitary yardstick for notability, and it sounds like you do, too. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 01:10, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I think a topic can be less notable than "Islamofascism" and still be notable. If Yasser Arafat owned a book titled "Zionazism" that probably establishes notability for me right there.

<p>Sorry no change to my vote, I would vote to keep an article intitled Zionazi. Like Islamofacism it is a largly contentless confusion but that doesn't change the fact that in the non-perfect world we live in people talk nonsense. One of the reasons that we don't have an article for Zionazi is that we most of us live in England or America and thus focus on our idiot leaders rather then the idoit leaders of the Arab world and the propaganda they use to controll their population. By having articles on these phrazes wikipedia can infact play the positive role of exposing their vacuousness. --<a href="../../../j/k/_/User%7EJK_the_unwise_23f9.html" title="User:JK the unwise">JK the unwise</a> 09:02, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The unknown person was me, forgot to sign the comment. And your twisting my words. I dont mean that whatever-level-of-notability Islamofascism is should be where the line is drawn. I mean that IF Zionazism was as widely used as Islamofascism, I would without hesitation vote to keep it. However, if you want an ancedote, I saw 'Islamofascism' mentioned in an article in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Economist_bbe2.html" title="The Economist">the Economist</a>, undoubtedly a mainstream news source, today. I have never seen Zionazism mentioned in anything approaching a mainstream news source. --<a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERaiderAspect_b3e0.html" title="User:RaiderAspect">RaiderAspect</a> 11:01, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You see my point, though. Determining notability based on what you personally happen to have come across in a newspaper is not the way to figure out which articles to keep and which to delete.

<li><b>Keep, and keep (term) in the title.</b> "Islamofascism" is indeed a widely used term; however, it is itself a POV term (and IMHO, a misleading one), and so there is good reason to be wary of simply titling an article <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>, since that implies that such a beast exists, and that that's what the article is about. In practical terms, putting/keeping all of the material in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism_%28term%29.html" title="Islamofascism (term)">Islamofascism (term)</a> in the Islam section of <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a> makes the latter article too long and overly tipped against Islam. Much of that material should be broken out into its own article, which on any other, less controversial topic, would be titled in a way that follows logically from the parent article. However, in this case, most of the material in that section doesn't concern any actual connection between neofascist movements and Islam or Islamism, but the characterization of Islamism and jihadism as totalitarian, and therefore fascistic, by its opponents. This vilification is real, it is prominent in the English-speaking world, and it needs to be confronted and discussed. There is no better way to do it than in the existing article. No matter what happens, any surviving article must stay NPOV, and should continue to focus on the term itself (as does <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">this article</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminazi.html" title="Feminazi">this one</a>), rather than the phenomenon it purports to describe.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I understand the impulse to want to keep this pejorative, misleading, POV term out of Wikipedia entirely. We must not permit Wikipedia to become a vehicle for the partisans who employ such terms to advance their propaganda aims. However, something still needs to be said about the term, including its origins and context, and if Wikipedia doesn't say it, who will? Like <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominionism.html" title="Dominionism">Dominionism</a>, this should not be a word simply left to incubate and strengthen itself within partisan echo-chambers indefinitely. And for the record, I would also support keeping a Zionazism (term) article around, as long as that "(term)" part stays in the title, and the article itself can be kept NPOV and focused on the term itself and not what it supposedly describes. <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkoosh_95d4.html" title="User:Skoosh">skoosh</a> [[User_talk:Skoosh|(háblame)]] 14:51, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
