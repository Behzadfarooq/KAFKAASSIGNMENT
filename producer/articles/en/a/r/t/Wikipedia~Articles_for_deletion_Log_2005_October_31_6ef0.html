<p><b>Delete</b> This article was added by an anon with IP address 212.21.138.161 which is registered in Bulgaria, and cites a cranky web page in Bulgaria.

Yes, it is, if we use the time relativity." But "the time relativity" is never defined or explained.

<li><b>Keep.</b> I applaud the effort at an easy to understand introduction to relativity. This might qualify as a "trampoline" article, designed to introduce novices to advanced concepts, similar to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity_for_beginners.html" title="Special relativity for beginners">Special relativity for beginners</a>. See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_General_Audience_b9fe.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject General Audience">Wikipedia:WikiProject General Audience</a>. As such, any flaws should be fixed and the article improved upon, rather than deleted. As for the time relativity line at the end, I believe that was meant as a joke. It can certainly be taken out. As for whether it was written by an anonymous I/P from Sophia, Bulgaria, I don't see how that disqualifies a contribution. As far as I know, Wikipedia has no policy excluding contibutions from certain locations or from anonymous contributors. If they are referencing themself, those refs should be taken out. In short, we may just be dealing with a newbie who doesn't know the rules, so let's show a little patience, please. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 22:39, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Stu, please keep your shirt on. The location information was simply to support my presumption that the anonymous edits were made by Marinchev. That is relevant because I was invoking <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> in nominating the article for deletion.

<li>If we assume that the last line is a joke, I still have to say I don't see the article as useful. It similar to stating Euclid's axioms and calling it a "5 minute explanation of geometry." Unless you happen to <b>be</b> a Euclid—or an Einstein—it doesn't really "explain" anything. So, yes, I applaud the effort, but I reject the article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:53, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>That's the issue, there's not much here we can use. So we have an article <i>idea</i> that might be fine, with content that has to be wholly rewritten and a title that has to be changed.

<dd>Stu, about <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_General_Audience_b9fe.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject General Audience">Wikipedia:WikiProject General Audience</a>, I am certainly one of those who has been raising the technical bar with my own contributions to the Wikipedia, but I don't disagree with the goals of that project unless your goals statment means "every article in Wikipedia should remain accessible <i>in its entirety</i> to a general audience". Actually, even then I might not disagree, since I am beginning to think that there may be case for Wikimedia forking the Wikipedia into a <i>populist general audience encyclopedia which anyone can edit</i>, as in the current Wikipedia model, and a <i>controlled content scholarly/scientific encyclopedia</i> which is <i>much less up-to-the-minute but much more reliable</i>, as in the Britannica model. However, in the short term, statistics seem to show that many of the most active and knowledgeable editors of the Wikipedia are involved in creating articles on highly technical topics, including physics topics, and in such articles, I advocate (following accepted encyclopedic practice) that the articles should <i>begin with a nontechnical summary accessible to a general audience</i>, and <i>subsequently introduce technical material as needed</i>, if possible with <i>monotonically increasingly technical demands</i>, after the Baez model of exposition.</dd>
<dd>In any case, while it might be beneficial to discuss such policy issues elsewhere (maybe on my talk page?), in the case at hand, the key point about why this particular article has been nominated for deletion was succinctly expressed by SCZenz: <i>there's not much here we can use</i>. Don't forget one of Einstein's own favorite sayings: a (theory, explanation) should be <i>as simple as possible, but no simpler</i>. What we have in this article is something so simplified it doesn't even make sense, not just to a physicist but even to a general audience member. Bearing this in mind, I hope you will reread the article and change your vote.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 16:14, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I would characterize the goal of the project as "every article in Wikipedia should be accessible <i>in its entirety</i> to a general audience, inasmuch as it is possible to do so without deleteing technical content. Introductions to articles which the general audience is likely to encounter should be accessible to a general audience, even if movement of technical content from the intro to the body is required." <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 17:21, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

However, I still don't understand your stance, StuRat; nobody's attacking the concept of a simple introduction, nobody's voting against the concept of a simple introduction, and deleting this article isn't getting rid of the concept of a simple introduction.

With that said, I think some of the content, like the Galileo and Newton references, should be merged into <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity_for_beginners.html" title="Special relativity for beginners">Special relativity for beginners</a>. Then this article can be deleted. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 03:26, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Anders_Hackzelius_324a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anders Hackzelius">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anders Hackzelius</span></h3>
<p>This unreferenced article is very close to being a hoax. There really was a 17th century Anders Hackzelius who was a parish vicar in the Katarina parish in Stockholm, and later in Holm parish in <a href="../../../u/p/p/Uppland.html" title="Uppland">Uppland</a>, and who can be found in a couple of genealogy pages on the web (e.g. <a href="http://home.swipnet.se/Hack_ell/andreasl.htm" class="external text" title="http://home.swipnet.se/Hack_ell/andreasl.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>).</p>
<p>The article, however, attempts to give the impression that this Anders Hackzelius was somebody more important: <i>"Anders Hackzelius was a priest, a Church master and the Curator of <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden-Finland_fd60.html" title="Sweden-Finland">Sweden-Finland</a> during the most influential time of the superpower period of the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_Empire_c5e7.html" title="Swedish Empire">Swedish Empire</a> in the late <a href="../../../1/6/0/1600%27s.html" title="1600's">1600's</a>."</i> I don't know what Swedish title "Curator of <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden-Finland_fd60.html" title="Sweden-Finland">Sweden-Finland</a>" is meant to translate, but the fact is that Hackzelius can <i>not</i> be found in <i><a href="../../../s/v/e/Svenskt_biografiskt_lexikon.html" title="Svenskt biografiskt lexikon">Svenskt biografiskt lexikon</a></i> (the Swedish Dictionary of Biography), <i><a href="../../../n/o/r/Nordisk_familjebok.html" title="Nordisk familjebok">Nordisk familjebok</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalencyklopedin.html" title="Nationalencyklopedin">Nationalencyklopedin</a></i>. A person of some significance would have been found in one of these reference works.</p>
<p>It also claims that <i>"[t]he Hackzelius family was an influential family of political and spiritual leaders as well as warriors and cavalry men."</i>. Well, no other members of the Hackzelius family can be found in any of these standard Swedish reference works either - how influential could they possibly be? (Finnish prime minister Antti Hackzell may well be a descendant, but he lived centuries later.)</p>
<p>The article continues: <i>"The name</i> Hackzelius <i>refers to the brave and fiercely fighting <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finnish.html" title="Finnish">Finnish</a> <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakkapeliitta.html" title="Hakkapeliitta">Hakkapeliitta</a> cavalry men, knights [...]"</i> 17th century cavalrymen were not <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight.html" title="Knight">knights</a>, but that may be excused as just a bad translation. The statement on the name is unsourced, as everything else, but anyone with some knowledge of how Swedish family names were created in that period will find it much more likely that the name is derived from Hackzelius's birthplace: Hacksta.</p>
<p>The short article also throws in an implicit reference to a long-debunked genealogical myth about a never-existing ancestor of <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_Continental_Congress_f56b.html" title="President of the Continental Congress">President of the Continental Congress</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hanson_546e.html" title="John Hanson">John Hanson</a>, see comment by <a href="../../../v/i/p/User%7EViper_Daimao_b750.html" title="User:Viper Daimao">Viper Daimao</a> at <a href="../../../h/a/k/Talk%7EHakkapeliitta_69e7.html" title="Talk:Hakkapeliitta">Talk:Hakkapeliitta</a>. This doesn't strengthen the credibility of the article.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I find the argument for deletion confusing. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a>, if the article contains unverified material, or overstates some claims, is there any reason to not simply edit the article? <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- Jkelly, because it's a hoax, and at best the article would get edited down to "Anders Hackzelius was a vicar in 17th-century Finland", which is up there with listing every <i>other</i> citizen of 17th-century Finland and the rest of the world. I can't verify Uppland's references myself but it's his area of expertise. (A bit strongly argued, but that's the best-supported deletion argument I've seen in some time.) —&#160;<a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel">mendel</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/e/n/User_talk%7EMendel_d73b.html" title="User talk:Mendel">☎</a> 01:27, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sorry for being confusing. I couldn't think of any way to explain more briefly or simply what is wrong with this article, but Mendel summarizes it well, except for the Finland part. (As far as I can see, the real Hackzelius was born in Uppland in Sweden and worked there and in Stockholm. It is possible that he served with the Finnish <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakkapeliitta.html" title="Hakkapeliitta">hakkapeliitta</a>, but it is in any case not very significant. There were thousands of clergymen following the Swedish(-Finnish) troops during the 17th century.) The article not only lacks references, but the general character of the article makes it impossible to put any trust in any parts of it. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 07:12, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

If it is a badly-written article, and no-one cares enough to edit it, then get rid of it as not being worthy as an encyclopedia article. But until "non-notability" has been accepted by the community as a valid reason for deletion, it isn't one. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 14:28, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Bowker says ISBN will take 1-3 days to update. It is not currently listed because ISBN entry was mistakenly entered too recently (the publisher, to be honest, isn't the most efficent). It should be up by Monday night, though it may be Wednesday at the latest. However the ISBN publisher prefix is current and verifiable. It has a strange title, yes, but it's a real book from a real publisher. It will be for sale at Amazon, B&amp;N, and other bookstores by the end of the week.

<li><b>Comment</b> Interesting, but I'm still sticking to my theory that this is a conspiracy by a poetry group.

</ul>
<p>A poetry group may have access to the ISBN / amazon registration service of a publisher.

<p>1/ The Paradox Inc. poetry nonprofit has a staff webpage which lists an "A. Alkon" as Vice President - <a href="http://www.paradoxinc.org/advisory.html" class="external text" title="http://www.paradoxinc.org/advisory.html" rel="nofollow">see this page</a> i.e. Alakon. So if the book does exists, he's vice president of the company which publishes it.</p>
<p>2. But this Alkon seems to have a taste for fakes or hoaxes. On the poetry website neopoet.com (also part of the Paradox group of poetry websites), the <a href="http://www.neopoet.com/modules.php?name=Your_Account&amp;op=userinfo&amp;uname=alakon" class="external text" title="http://www.neopoet.com/modules.php?name=Your_Account&amp;op=userinfo&amp;uname=alakon" rel="nofollow">User profile for Alkon</a> lists a website of a fake hedge fund company called <a href="http://www.alkonfn.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alkonfn.com/" rel="nofollow">Alkon Financial</a> as his Personal Website. This site comes complete with a link to a real initial SEC registration (i.e. basic paperwork), but apparently has no information or real webpages at all beyond a pure text legal notice. The only informative hits from a google search reveal that Alkon Financial hired a Overtech Technologies to build a Counterstrike (i.e. the video game)<a href="http://www.overtechtechnologies.com/help/corporate/prior_work?DokuWiki=356faa5ef1a66b0bd2c8f2b093499cd5" class="external text" title="http://www.overtechtechnologies.com/help/corporate/prior_work?DokuWiki=356faa5ef1a66b0bd2c8f2b093499cd5" rel="nofollow">"control panel for their game server so they could have a high-speedy trustworthy place to host their online gaming tournaments"</a>. Overtech Technologies is a small-time (student run?) local webhosting outfit to which the person Alkon was appointed an Executive Director and Vice President of (possibly as a joke) as you can see on the <a href="http://overtechtechnologies.com/blog/?p=189" class="external text" title="http://overtechtechnologies.com/blog/?p=189" rel="nofollow">Overtech "corporate" blog</a>. In Fiscal Year 2004, Overtech claimed to have achieved a <a href="http://overtechtechnologies.com/blog/?p=4" class="external text" title="http://overtechtechnologies.com/blog/?p=4" rel="nofollow">net profit of 916 dollars, 82 cents</a></p>
<p>3. A Whois database search reveals that the website for Alkon Financial is <a href="http://www.whois.net/whois.cgi2?d=www.alkonfn.com" class="external text" title="http://www.whois.net/whois.cgi2?d=www.alkonfn.com" rel="nofollow">registered to a Mr. Alkon who lives in an apartment at the University of Rochester</a>.

<li><b>comment</b> "waddington trout" gets beaucoup Google hits. A little investigation suggests that a "Waddington" is the body of a type of lure, to which a treble hook is usually attached. This in itself doesn't prove that the book is a hoax; the author could have picked "Waddington" as a pen name for the connection with trout, or it could be a coincidence. It's mainly the alleged connection with game theory that keeps the alarm bells ringing. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 18:04, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Because of this, it is commonly referred to, but without a URL or other helpful information.

<li>Well I thought the point of this was to make the best case possible for the page by building and editing to make it notable. Since that is one of the requirements for the site to be added.

<li>To clarify, Wikipedia reports on sites because they are already notable—web sites don't become notable just because someone has created one or more articles about them on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> this article under A3. It is merely a link to the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corpus_christi_monastery.html" title="Corpus christi monastery">Corpus christi monastery</a> article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Actually, after further investigation, the entire Corpus christi article is a copyvio from different parts (home page and history) of the website. Should we speedy delete that article under copyvio and speedy delete this one under A3? --<a href="../../../s/p/r/User%7ESpring_Rubber_78f1.html" title="User:Spring Rubber">Spring Rubber</a> 03:03, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This one can be speedied under A3. However, as at least part of the article isn't from a commercial content provider but from the Monastery itself it will have to go through the normal process for AfD/copyvio. It would have to be nominated for deletion for AfD or listed as a copyvio. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 03:27, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>All right, I'll speedy this one, but what do you recommend we do with the other one? Obviously it can't stay as it is. Should we put it under cleanup, Afd, or copyvio? --<a href="../../../s/p/r/User%7ESpring_Rubber_78f1.html" title="User:Spring Rubber">Spring Rubber</a> 03:48, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Taken care of. I put this up for speedy delete-A3 and put the other one on copyvio. I guess that settles it. I just wonder how long the copyvio case will take with all of the backlog there. --<a href="../../../s/p/r/User%7ESpring_Rubber_78f1.html" title="User:Spring Rubber">Spring Rubber</a> 04:36, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, per nomination, with the added comment that the technical predicates for the article are mostly correct, but the assertion that astronomers don't realize this is inaccurate. It figures prominently into cosmological theory.

Time (and therefore 'young') is measured very differently on an astronomic scale.

<li><b>Comment.</b> I don't know why the title and claims should strain credibility, except perhaps for the 'best-seller' claim. A study of elk breeding and migration certainly seems plausible, and it's not unknown for serious natural-history books to have lighthearted titles (e.g., <i>Mice All Over</i> by Peter Crowcroft). Having said that, I don't see any evidence that this book really exists. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerodicticus_237a.html" title="User:Perodicticus">Perodicticus</a> 13:36, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I suspect that criterion was really meant to convey something more along the lines of "the determination of hoax status may require more than one set of eyes; sometimes what looks like a hoax to you might actually be just a bad article about a legitimate topic". I don't think it was ever meant to suggest that hoaxes somehow have an inherent right to stick around. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:57, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I dunno... It doesn't seem like "This does not include hoaxes" has a lot of ambiguity in it. Wouldn't that more than one set of eyes mean the AfD process? Don't worry, I don't think it's saying that hoaxes have the right to stick around (I'm the one who flagged this one, in fact), only that they need to be AfDed first to confirm that they're fake. After all, it's not as if letting the article live for an extra few days is going to do any harm; it's tagged as an AfD, and who's going to come to Wikipedia to look up "Elks on the Up and Up" in the next week anyway? =) --<a href="../../../d/v/y/User%7EDvyost_72a4.html" title="User:Dvyost">Dvyost</a> 06:11, 3 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Understood; I'm just saying that I have seen obvious hoaxes, where the AFD consensus went in favour of speedying, which then got speedied in advance of the formal AFD closing with no objections. So I don't particularly think that voting to speedy when something is obviously beyond question as a hoax is an unreasonable thing to do. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 06:15, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>—Regarding "merging," I like the new SCOTUS demographics article, but I don't think this should exist as a redirect even if the "fact" contained in this stub gets appropriately mentioned there.

<li>I created this article after editing the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan_University_934b.html" title="Wesleyan University">Wesleyan University</a> article to include reference to the great diversity of sexual identities and words to describe those identities there. All of the terms that they use already had wikipedia articles except for this one, so I made this article so that people would know what I was talking about in the wesleayan article. Is there perhaps a better way to do this, perhaps within the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan_University_934b.html" title="Wesleyan University">Wesleyan University</a> page, since I'm pretty sure that the only time someone would end up at this article is through a link from the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan_University_934b.html" title="Wesleyan University">Wesleyan University</a> page.

<li>Welcome to Wikipedia. Please familiarize yourself with our <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">no original research</a> policies. An encyclopaedia article on the concept of flexuality would have to be verifiable and not original research. It would have to cite reliable sources to show that such a concept existed in the first place and that it had also been peer reviewed and accepted into the corpus of human knowledge by other people. No such sources have been cited, or can be found.
<p>In contrast, a Google Groups search reveals that people consider "flexual" to be a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.bi/msg/94363e109b7346d7" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.bi/msg/94363e109b7346d7" rel="nofollow">silly neologism</a>, that is <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.bi/msg/c717d3ef29e33592" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.bi/msg/c717d3ef29e33592" rel="nofollow">"just another in an <i>endless</i> line of weasel words"</a>, and that <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.bi/msg/23d4a39e816302da" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.bi/msg/23d4a39e816302da" rel="nofollow">makes them want to barf</a>.

<li>I'm ok with it being deleted, and after looking at some of the policy articles, the resons for its deletion are beginning to make sense to me, but without it the wesleyan article seems incomplete, since it references the term "flexual" without providing any context for what it means. Any ides on how to fix that? I'd rather not remove all reference to "flexual" from the wesleyan article, since queer issues are very important on campus. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.133.4.34 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.133.4.34_37bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.133.4.34">contribs</a>) 2005-11-01 03:37:37 UTC.</small>

<li><b>HOLD your fire</b>, This article has not been up for a day. Do you know that someone tried to make it dissapear before I even created it? It is a link from the article on Golden Sun and should be separate because someone only wants to know about passwords in depth when he needs to use one. As for the article's usefulness, GOLLY&#160;!!! I know that there is no other place with the information. I know that the knowledge of what a password does is pieced out among - isolated - gamers. Wiki's structure is designed with the intention of gathering and distilling knowledge that is scattered among isolated persons. As for the possibility that the knowledge is solely useful to gamers, is this a criterion for deleting it? Why not pick another group and delete the the entries that are uniquely helpful to that group?</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I suggest the editor of this article to create a wiki in <a href="../../../w/i/k/WikiCities_b967.html" title="WikiCities">WikiCities</a> or other similar resource to start a wiki about the game.

<li><b>If You Read Only One Thing, Make This It</b> GameFAQs says its not the place for this, and frankly the purpose of Wikipedia may not be to store every little thing for every little game, it is meant to compile the knowledge of it's user in a way that makes it conveniant. I see no problem in allowing this page to continue, and people that have a bone to pick with GameFAQs shouldn't take it out on this rather nice idea.

<li><b>Keep</b> The Golden Sun Password article is collecting facts and knowledge. This article is being accused of having no context of misusing Wikipedia as a message board and as an "every little thing of a little game." For the sake of argument, let us say that these accusations are true: What we are still left with is a <b>demand</b> that the article be deleted yesterday. What we are left with is that Wikipedia is not for the likes of you. This article is not a fungus or a virus that will contaminate Wikipedia. This article is not a cancer that is taking over Wikipedia. I believe that the demands that the article be deleted are consuming more Wikipedia resources than the article.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by CobraGT (<a href="../../../c/o/b/User_talk%7ECobraGT_a291.html" title="User talk:CobraGT">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CobraGT_90e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/CobraGT">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>One good thing about a slow process like this is that we can try to explain why it doesn't belong. In the end passwords are part of the game, but listing them don't help readers to <i>understand</i> the game better, so they don't belong in an encyclopedia article. You say it's taking a lot of resources to get it deleted, that's true, but if it says wikipedia will be taken over by similar pages of game passwords/tips/challenges/whatever which will end up consuming a lot more resources than this discussion. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:56, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b> The statement that passwords do not help readers to <i>understand</i> of the game sounds as though you know what you are talking about but the statement is not true. This is like saying that a picture of a particular species of plant does not contribute to an understanding of plants. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by CobraGT (<a href="../../../c/o/b/User_talk%7ECobraGT_a291.html" title="User talk:CobraGT">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CobraGT_90e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/CobraGT">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia's purpose is to give information right? Well, this article gives information for the Gameboy Advance game, Golden Sun. It will help new players and/or other people who play this game understand Golden Sun's password system. It also helps the player as if you don't have the original Golden Sun, you don't have a password to use. People who just bought this game (part 2) can simply choose a password from the list to use.

<li><b>Delete</b> It's inherently a how-to article. It's also redundant given that <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane.html" title="Hurricane">hurricane</a> is a good article.

<li><b>Strong KEEP</b>. I came to it because I was just thinking of creating an article about it.

<li><b>Comment</b>.

<p>Wikipedia is about educating and sharing of knowledge. There is a deep lack of accurate information available regarding Australian composers and performers. Please consider the possibility that a lack of google hits does not equate to the importance or noteriety of an individual.</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Ignoring the Google test, as a musician and music student myself I regret to say that I simply am not aware of this gentleman having done anything worthy of note. I have neither seen him mentioned in any journals, nor come across any of his compositions; indeed, I had not heard of him before I read the article, and I regret to say that we cannot possibly have an article on every single music graduate that ever existed. If I had even heard of one or two of his compositions, or heard that he had obtained a resident composer or musical directorship position with a (reasonably) notable orchestra outside of Wikipedia, I would not advocate deletion. As talented as this fellow be, I fear he does not meet the Wikipedia levels of notability that are usually expected of musicians. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull"><font color="#906040">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></font></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_NicholasTurnbull_2b3e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/NicholasTurnbull">(e-mail)</a> <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINMC_f912.html" title="WP:TINMC">(cabal)</a> 15:32, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi, JtP here . Just thought I'd mention that I didn't enter this, nor did I ask anyone to. I don't think anyone was attempting to use Wikipedia as an advertising vehicle, I think that one of the readers of the website just got excited about the project and added it to Wikipedia. No harm was intended, I'm certain. Anyway, I just thought I'd say that. Please delete this entry if it's in violation of policies (or even if it's not... I don't know that I need to be in Wikipedia, I've not really done anything noteworthy just yet).</li>

<li><i>"Larry Kissell" congress</i> gets two Google hits, and neither one of them is relevant. And the writing style (<i>"In 2005, Larry could take it no more.

<p>According to the Wikipedia guidelines the person's notability should be above an average University Professor. Mrs Boroditsky is a junior faculty at Stanford.

<li>After reading the supplied sources I changed my mind from <b>Strong Delete</b> to <b>Weak Delete</b> as I still do not think she is notable enough. The Whorfian question is almost an urban folklor now, and she certainly did not invented it. The first of the new external links shows to an absolutely strange article. I am a native Russian speaker myself and I can tell that the word for the <i>cousin</i> is either <i>Kuzen</i> (pronounced similar to the English word) or <i>Dvojurodny Brat</i> (a simple <i>Brat</i> is for <i>Brother</i>). There is absolutely no way that a Russian (having enough command in English to follow the play) would hear <i>cousin</i> and decide that it means sibling. I hope that it was the error of a jurnalist not the quality of her research paper. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 03:59, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is customary to wait a fair amount of time after an AFD ends with a "keep" result before renominating. See <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#If_you_disagree_with_the_consensus" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion#If you disagree with the consensus</a>. While there is no "official" period of time that must elapse before a renomination is made, many people consider a period of six months to be a minimum. A renomination made within a few months of the original AFD is likely to be closed early as a "speedy keep". There is no policy or guideline that a user may not inform other users of an ongoing AFD. On the contrary, there are several <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">WikiProjects</a> and notice boards designed to inform users of, among other things, AFDs on articles that may interest them. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 22:26, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I am pretty aware of the rules and contrary to some heated opinions I am not a troll. I will renominate only if I decide that the vote was skewed by Pascuale. His position that all of us voting here are voting just besause "we like or don't like it" is deplorable. Unlike those who "like it", I provided serious arguments why these pages are wrong place. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 23:31, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>NOTE: It is only fair to warn long-time users and contributors to a certain page that that page has come under attack. This is not skewing the vote, as I had no idea how those users would actually vote. Surely, we don't want an article's fate to be decided by people who have just stumbled into it for the first time and didn't like it! The users and contributors I warned are in no way "my colleagues" any more than any other Wikipedia users, but are indeed users who have repeatedly contributed to that page. (And, in any case, at least eight "Keep" votes so far are from users I have not contacted and whose names I have never heard, while at least one that I contacted -- <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">Aecis</a> -- has voted the other way. Check my user contributions for confirmation.) I am in no way "the main opponent" here. I simply consider myself responsible because I unwittingly alerted this attacker to the existence of these pages, which he has then IMMEDIATELY nominated for deletion. Is this not troll behavior?

<dd>I'd like to offer a little unsolicited advice to both aggrieved parties and hope it is taken in the spirit it is given.

<dd>It's not worth raising your blood pressure, or upsetting you, or ruining your evening. It's not worth ruining your digestion, or your after-dinner cocktail, your birthday, or whatever is happening in your <b>real</b> life. Don't let the users' behavior on the Wikipedia get to you. Because it doesn't matter.</dd>
<dd>That's right - it doesn't <b>really</b> matter, that much, does it? I would hate to lose this information to the Wiktionary, but really, what does it matter? If you think it SHOULD be in the Wiktionary, and it stays in the Wikipedia - what difference does that make to your life? You might never have run across it. Take this pent up frustration and go for a run, or volunteer at a hospital, or hug your kids. Do something worthwhile and uncontroversial.</dd>

He first made some remarks the other day on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_European_regions_with_alternative_names_a1b6.html" title="Talk:List of European regions with alternative names">Talk:List of European regions with alternative names</a>, denigrating and ridiculing that particular list. I explained to him that that list closely parallels others, such as the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_country_names_in_various_languages.html" title="List of country names in various languages">List of country names in various languages</a>, the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_cities_with_alternative_names_c059.html" title="List of European cities with alternative names">List of European cities with alternative names</a>, the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_rivers_with_alternative_names_3bd1.html" title="List of European rivers with alternative names">List of European rivers with alternative names</a>, all of which he was not aware of, and so what does he do? He turns around and advocates for the deletion of all these pages, whose existence he has just become aware of. Maybe I am not a very bold Wikipedia contributor, but I would never even think of doing something like that. And, yes, I do find this behavior extremely objectionable and censurable. Frankly, I am amazed that you fail to see how inconsiderate this is. To me, it would be as if someone with no interest in linguistic reconstruction should argue for the deletion of your <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Celtic_language_a609.html" title="Proto-Celtic language">Proto-Celtic language</a> article. I think it's truly insane! And, furthermore, it is idiotic to buttress this kind of argumentation by ridiculing the notion that someone just might want to know what Zimbabwe is called in Finnish (see below). Should I be ashamed if I wanted to look up all the names Zimbabwe has in as many languages as has been possible to collect in one place by Wikipedia users? Please tell me: Should I be ashamed? I stand by my above comment. I think it is extremely called-for. And as for the Wiktionary, personally, I never use it. And I truly doubt anyone would ever look up Zimbabwe in the Wiktionary. One final thing, Angr: You just added the Bân-lâm, Breton, Esperanto, Lojban, and Japanese names for <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_Country_e62e.html" title="Basque Country">Basque Country</a> to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_regions_with_alternative_names_7ff9.html" title="List of European regions with alternative names">List of European regions with alternative names</a> for the simple reason that the same names already appeared in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_country_names_in_various_languages.html" title="List of country names in various languages">List of country names in various languages</a>, and now you don't have the guts to break a lance for these lists which are being threatened by a wolf in sheep's clothing (namely, a vandal camouflaged as a serious Wikipedia contributor).

<dd>I'm not taking any sides in this particular discussion; you may have noticed I haven't voted. (Incidentally, neither have you, technically.) I was defending his right to make the AFD, not supporting the AFD itself. Yes, I am still editing these lists because there is a good chance they will be kept. Yes, I have found these lists to be very interesting, and have been quite active in editing them. Nevertheless I can also see that what they cover is really more Wiktionary's jurisdiction than Wikipedia's. If <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Celtic_language_a609.html" title="Proto-Celtic language">Proto-Celtic language</a> were to be deleted, the information would be completely lost, because there's nowhere else to put it. This information will <i>not</i> be lost if this AFD results in a delete; it will just be transferred to Wiktionary. You say you don't use Wiktionary; that's easily enough remedied: just go to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wikt:Main_Page">wikt:Main Page</a> and sign up. Finally, making <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> against the nominator of an AFD is not going to win people over to want to support your side. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 21:50, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, Angr, if I haven't voted, I guess it's because I don't know how to. Where do I send in my ballot? And as for you, I know full well that you have repeatedly contributed to these lists and do find them useful, except that now you suddenly seem to have such little interest in them that you can't bring yourself to take sides. I am sorry, but that's what Pontius Pilate did. And, by the way, I am not making any <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> here. I am being very objective. If you read carefully what I wrote, you will see that I am simply reporting facts. To someone who just came across this AFD, it may not be apparent that its nominator had just stumbled into all these lists and, having found them of no use to himself, and having repeatedly ridiculed them and their users, promptly filed a petition to delete them. This is simply an abuse and if you don't recognize it, then I simply don't understand how your mind works or what you're doing to protect the Wikipedia content. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 22:18, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I beg to disagree, Angr. Words, as you know, have objective meanings after all. To me, "vandal" is someone who wishes to destroy something without rhyme or reason, in this particular case, with barely any knowledge or familiarity with the object of his vandalism. You seem to think I am using words as expletives or gratuitous accusations. I am not. I am trying to offer an objective assessment of what's going on here and now. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 15:47, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maintainability isn't an issue; Wikipedia is just as easy to maintain as Wiktionary. Easier, probably, because there are more people at Wikipedia to keep an eye on things.

<dd>Did you have a chance to look at the page I listed for comparison? The maintainaability '<b>is</b> most definitely the issue. Also, wiktionary is a good place to talk about etymologies of the names. As for more people, don't forget there is also more articles. I contributed about hundred geographical articles (towns, rivers, mountains, etc.) and edited may not less than a thousand ones, and only recently I stumbled upon these lists.

<dd>Belarussian wikipedia is a playground of belarussian russophobic nationalists with archaic ideas to roll back the Russian influence in Belarussian language. I even don't bother to contribute there. "Ангельшчына" is a colloquial term, loosely translated as "land of Englishmen", a standard Slavic construction, and indeed is in informal use, but no way it is the name oif the country. Just try to google "Ангельшчына" (185) vs "Англiя" (44,900). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 22:11, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I don't think that people "informed" in such a way will vote fairly, so either their votes should not count, or Mikkalai should be allowed to repeat the vote after less than six months, without such interference. By the way, I'd probably voted <i>keep</i> had this not happen in such a way. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 09:01, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Excuse me, Nikola, if I dare ask you the following question. Are you saying that what I wrote is not an exact description of what happened? Did you not like the tone or the substance of it? If it is the tone, I truly do offer my humblest apologies for offending your sensibilities. If it is the substance of it, then, I am sorry, with all due respect, I stand by what I wrote to the letter, because that is EXACTLY what happened. And what good is your opinion, anyway, if it is affected by perception rather than substance? You say you would have probably voted <i>keep</i> but now you're prepared to sacrifice a good Wikipedia page just because of my zealous tone in defending it? <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 00:46, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I understand your concern - but it's mirrored by a concern that we lack articles in this area, and stubs are better than nothing. Lord Cam the calypsonian is verifiable. There is almost certainly an element of vanity in the creation (over a year ago). While it might well have a hard time meeting the burden of "notability" in comparison with American (or even Trinidadian) musicians, so would anything from Nevis. But, tiny as Nevis is, it is a major component of St Kitts &amp; Nevis, with a strong independence movement. You need to look at the person in perspective. Many Caribbean or Pacific heads of state would fail the google test. But that does not make them undeserving of an article. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 17:35, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I remain unconvinced that more notable Caribbean or Pacific personalities would fail the Google test (as with my "Dis N Dat" example below).

Rather, it merely indicates that he was eliminated in the semi-final round of that competition, and as such, finished no higher than a tie for <i>ninth</i>.

I'm sure that there are significant calpysonians from Nevis; I just don't see any evidence that Lord Cam is one of them. Compare the results for his name with those of another Nevisian, Dis N Dat (the current Culturama king). Despite the same "small country" handicaps as Lord Cam, there are mentions of him <a href="http://www.nevisculturama.net/kings.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.nevisculturama.net/kings.htm" rel="nofollow">winning past competitions</a>, <a href="http://d276130.u27.infinology.net/entertainment/pan_united_band_launching.htm" class="external text" title="http://d276130.u27.infinology.net/entertainment/pan_united_band_launching.htm" rel="nofollow">performing other gigs</a>, and even <a href="http://www.sknvibes.com/Sports/ViewSports.cfm?Idz=%23%221S%3A%0A" class="external text" title="http://www.sknvibes.com/Sports/ViewSports.cfm?Idz=%23%221S%3A%0A" rel="nofollow">serving as president of the Nevis Cricket Association</a>. There are two major regional newspapers giving coverage to other local calypsonians, and I just have to think that if Lord Cam were significant, he'd be mentioned there as well. Even if he weren't, I'd still look to give him the benefit of the doubt if anyone other than a user with the same name as him had made substantive additions to the text, but nobody has. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 12:51, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I understand what you're saying, but as this area is hugely underrepresented on Wikipedia, I don't see the harm of keeping it. As to the main contributer's username, it may be that the contributer is "Lord Cam," but it also could be that the user just signed up for a one time edit and couldn't think of any other name. Either way, though, we can't be sure. Less than 100 articles on Wikipedia mention or are related to <a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevis.html" title="Nevis">Nevis</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Nevis&amp;limit=100&amp;offset=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Nevis&amp;limit=100&amp;offset=0" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, and I think that this article, albeit in a small way, may help improve people's understanding of Nevis' culture.

<b>Keep</b>First, Wikipedia can use any article it can get. Second, no one in Morris actually calls it by its full name. Most of us use "Sammy," "Sammy Morris," or just "Morris."

<dd>Right, but just because it is important at that specific college doen't mean we need an encyclopedia article on it. However, that is your right to disagree.

<dd>I guess what I meant is that your figure of 76 hits is inaccurate, as no one would use the full name of the dorm except in official circumstances. People talking about it on their website aren't going to use that exact phrase. Also, there doesn't seem to be anything in the deletion rules about how articles must be about a sufficently popular subject. I don't think that this would qualify as a vanity page. <a href="../../../1/9/2/User%7E192.195.234.26.html" title="User:192.195.234.26">192.195.234.26</a> 04:10, 30 September 2005 (UTC)brokenfrog

<dd>Well, as long as it isn't in a name conflict, I really don't think it can do anything but help the wiki be a more rich source of information. I mean, it doesn't use more than a few kilobytes of space, and it contributes useful information. If a new student googles the dorm, he might just be able to find some good information on it here. That makes it worth it to me. <a href="../../../1/9/2/User%7E192.195.234.26.html" title="User:192.195.234.26">192.195.234.26</a> 04:10, 30 September 2005 (UTC)brokenfrog</dd>

<li>In all seriousness, you really don't have a sense of humor. This was only put up for fun and to see if it would last. It was obvious from the beginning that it wasn't going anywhere. I don't even know why it's still up. In other news, Saberwyn clearly indicated that it shows potential to be a 'real' article, which goes against all the other's proclamations that it is a cut and dry removal piece. Clearly the standards need to be worked on. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.81.166.99 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.81.166.99_0e5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.81.166.99">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><i>May</i>. The key word is <i>may</i>. I originally did not believe personally that there was potential in this article. Mind you, my judgement is hampered in this case because I live on a different continent. I was only stating the possibility that someone who knew the place better that I did (and wasn't an original contributor to the article) could possibly have looked at the piece and given the rest of us informed advice. Jacqui has given us that informed decision, and I see no evidence here to counter her claims.</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If there was any desire by the original contributors to make this into a decent article (which there apparently wasn't according to the comment above) that effort has been completely blown out of the water by the behaviour of the article's contributors and their allies during this AfD. Mind you, some of the accusations by the regualar users are almost as bad.</dd>

<li>Well, Well, Well. Looks like we gots ourselves a bunch of retarted moderators here. Seen um before I have. Yup, they go around getting a sick high off deleting enjoyable articles. Yeah, them some nasty buggers. They pretend to be high n' mighty while striking down the weak and unedumicated. Bastards. Nope, you just can't get rid of them. They hang around like flies on dead bodies. We can only pray that someday, maybe, they will understand harmless humor, and find something better to do with their time. But for now, we all must put up with their stank.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Very cute...</li>
<li>Does anyone know anything about calculus? I'm having a hard time with one of my homework problems and I was hoping someone could help me out. The problem reads: We are planning to put a space shuttle in gepsynchronous orbit at a distance above the earth`s equator of 22, 300 miles. It`s objective is a point in space 240,000 miles from the earth`s center. We know that the best time to leave earth`s orbit is a little more than 3/4 of an orbit past the point,C, which is the closest point in the shuttle`s orbit to the object, M, However, we need a bit more accuracy that that. A) How long from the time when it is closest to the objective, M, should it fire its rockets so as to be on a direct course toward the objective? B) How fast will the shuttle be traveling toward the objective just before firing the rockets to leave earth orbit. The picture given has earth inside of this larger circle. The point C is directly below E on the circle and the point S, is directle to the left and down, like at 280 degrees on the circle. I know that: you have to use the radius of the earth, divide by 24 to get how fast the space shuttle travels in one hour, and that the circle is the orbit of the shuttle. I would really appreciate your help. Thanks for taking time out to help.</li>

<li>Not necessarily. I'm all for speedying stuff that needs to be speedied, but if you're not sure that something is a hoax or non-notable, I think it's definitely better to go to AfD, because if the topic is notable, that way there's a far better chance of someone coming up with the important reference or whatnot. I tag a lot of stuff for speedy deletion under A7, but if I'd run across this one, I'd have gone to AfD myself. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 09:41, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>An article about an airline which does not currently exist, nor can any information be found in news sources. The airline industry is a volatile one, and it is quite likely that this airline will <i>never</i> exist. Likewise the Callie group (parent company which is launching the airline) article cannot be verified by news sources, web searches or local phone directory searches. Not notable.

<p>I would ask that you do not delete the information entered for the USS Sproston. My Father Lawrence H. Ernest and the remaining shipmates of the USS Sproston recently had a reunion in Charleston, SC. They have a wealth of information concerning this ship and all related mater to enter an outstanding article about this ship. I felt that the little bit of information I placed there would let others know that a more detailed article would be forthcoming and looked better than no information at all. However now that it has that UGLY tag for deletion on it I would much rather you delete it. I have contacted the parties that can provide us with a much more appropriate entry. Please forgive my enthusiasm and sub par work in this matter. Please delete the information I entered ASAP or remove the deletion notice. Thank you, Lawrence Ernest.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> but not for lack of merit. I like the concept and think it could be easily applied to less broad concepts, viz. to illustrate German Expressionism in the context of an article on the whole Expressionist movement. That would be extremely useful in illustrating an artist's or genre's work. (Call it like having a set of nice color plates in a paper encyclopedia.) As it is, though, a grand article about a Visual List of American Artists is too broad and unencyclopedic to be useful, and, as such, should be deleted. - <a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESensor_bf13.html" title="User:Sensor">Sensor</a> 03:38, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

What's the matter with keeping these as separate discussions?

<li><b>comment</b> I don't think this qualifies as <i>original research</i> since the source article is a review article, which ought to be a summation of the state of scientific knowledge on the matter at the time of writing, and therefore encyclopedic. That being said, I have real doubts that Macmillan has relinquished their copyright on the article so that it could appear in four chunks on wikipedia. The journal prints nothing but neuroscience reviews, if this permission is the publisher's policy, it's quite conceivable that every article of every issue would appear on wikipedia. I wonder if Kosslyn (Dept of Psych, Harvard U.) is aware of, and endorses, the actions of Kosslynlab? <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 06:45, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> with other short-lived recurring SNL sketches. I don't think this fits with Zagat's Survey (although a mention of it in that article wouldn't be out of place). I'm currently working on getting information together on most of the recurring sketches that appeared on SNL. I would like to put them all into categories so there aren't all these stubs hanging around. But it's a process, so please bear with me. I would like any input I can get on what the categories should be. I have two in mind so far "Characters That Appeared On Weekend Update" and "Short-Lived Saturday Night Live Sketches" (which would include anything that recurred four or fewer times). Suggestions?
