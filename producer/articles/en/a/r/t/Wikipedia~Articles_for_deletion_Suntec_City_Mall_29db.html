<li><b>Possible withdraw AfD:</b> It has been brought to attention that this venue holds the world's largest fountain. This is more than an acceptable claim to notability. The article makes no mention of that, so in its current form is not notable; however, were that fact to be added to it, I would happily withdraw this AfD. I have tried Googling for it, but the claim seems to be contested by another fountain in Illinois, and the Guinness page about the fountain is no longer supported by the official Guinness of Records website (Google has a cache copy).

<dd>I've nominated them all together because they were brought to my attention all together after I nominated one. As for the rest, I too smell something fishy: it seems to me that far too many of the "keep" comments come from Singaporean editors, and it is conceivable that they may have contacted one another to try and lobby the debate page... although again, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> applies, so let's assume that is not the case. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 15:16, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And so I suppose you expect most of the "Keep" comments to come from Italians, for something less fishy? It is a no-brainer why most of comments are coming from Singapore. And if you wondering why most of them are "Keep" votes, have you considered the fact that not every mall in Singapore has got an article? How sure are you that I will not question an article about a truly insignificant Singaporean mall?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 17:21, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, I would prefer if comments on the inclusion or deletion criteria for any given article were not based on the editors' area of residence, but only on the article itself. For an example of what kind of reasoning I'd prefer not to see, try <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jurong_Point_Shopping_Centre_5081.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jurong Point Shopping Centre">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jurong Point Shopping Centre</a>, where the deletion of the article has been defined by one editor as "a great insult to all Singaporeans". I wish this kind of reasoning would not become a factor in Wikipedia debates. My concern is not really that being a resident in the area might colour a single editor's judgement on differentiating between local notability and Wikipedia notability (although that is certainly possible); my concern is that some editors with a common interest or characteristic (in this case, residence) may have rallied privately to "lobby" the debate in disregard to the Wikipedia public. But again, let's assume good faith and deem it not the case. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 17:55, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>To substantiate my post earlier: Urban Redevelopment Authority (<a href="../../../u/r/a/URA_db44.html" title="URA">URA</a>), a Singaporean government statutory board cites that <i>Suntec City is one of the <b>largest</b> commercial developments in Singapore to date</i> at <a href="http://www.ura.gov.sg/spore1_1/publication1-32.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ura.gov.sg/spore1_1/publication1-32.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. <b>Suntect REIT</b>, developer of the Suntec chain of commercial complexes, cites that <i>Suntec City Mall is Singapore's <b>largest</b> shopping mall</i> at <a href="http://www.suntecreit.com/propertyoverview.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.suntecreit.com/propertyoverview.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, further stating that <i>Strong branding of the</i> Suntec <i>name and Fountain of Wealth is recognized domestically and internationally, and Fountain of Wealth attracts <b>half a million visitors</b> a year</i>, while <i>quality tenant base including oreign institutions, prominent local corporations and multinational companies provides <b>enhanced stability</b> of rental income</i>. The Mall along with the exhibition complex, was awarded two <i>FIABCI Prix d' Excellence awards</i> for excellence in all aspects of real estate development (Overall winner and Commercial / Retail winner) in 1999 and the <i>Outstanding Contribution to Tourism</i> award in 1998 from Singapore Tourism Board. The site too states that the mall <i>is a one-stop shopping, fashion, dining, recreation and entertainment destination that attracts about <b>24 million visitors</b> a year</i>.

<dd>Now <i>this</i> is what a Wikipedia reference should look like. Kudos to Silvester. The Suntec reference cannot be considered "independent", but the URA reference and the awards definitely are. Personally, I think that if the AR3 and this one are added to the article, that would be referencing it enough for a speedy keep. =) --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 07:06, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is interesting to note that Nehwyn considers a Singaporean statutory board acceptably "independent", while a publication called the Singapore Book of Records (2005) is not.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 07:33, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as I know, the <a href="../../../u/r/a/URA_db44.html" title="URA">URA</a> is a governmental entity, not part of Suntec, and thus considered independent. Suntec, having built the venue, cannot be considered an "independent source" about the venue itself. As far as the Fountain record goes, on the other hand, the Singapore Book of Records statement currently is contested, and the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_World_Records_df77.html" title="Guinness World Records">Guinness World Records</a> (generally considered the standard authority on world records) has withdrawn mention of the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fountain_of_Wealth_5702.html" title="Fountain of Wealth">Fountain of Wealth</a> as the world's largest fountain about a week ago. They might in fact be checking the claim, for all we know. As soon as the record is re-listed by Guinness, I'd say that will solve the problem. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 07:52, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Still, even though this entry has been withdraw by Guinness, it once appeared in the book for a period of time. Even if it is disputed, the fountain is still notable, and is still the largest outside <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>.
