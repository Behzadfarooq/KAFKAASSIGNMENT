<li><b>Appendum to my comment</b> - I think it's probably worth contrasting Pure Pwnage to something like <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_64.html" title="Mega 64">Mega 64</a>.

<li><b>Commment Response</b>*Sorry? It hasn't stopped people on this site before. While series like Star Wars and Dr. Who are amidtablly more notable than Pure Pwnage, the fact is they have larger articles and sub articles than World War II on this site (which, is funny since the first has its own Wiki). This goes for a whole bunch of other series as well. Like for example, before I would get fansubs for Gundam Seed Destiny, I'd check here first for the spoiler's. And they were fairly extensive. So, unless you are going to attempt to be a great champion of the wiki and nominate every single one of those article for deletion, I think the PP article is fine and short in comparion.<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendantheJedi_f1e8.html" title="User:BrendantheJedi">BrendantheJedi</a> 04:31, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What Does that have to do with anything? The last time a I checked, this was encyclopedia could edit. So if if 20 people with only mild contributions vote to keep this, we are somehow viewed lower in opinion to one man with 1000? You stop focusing on the rep of the poster, and look more the value of the post itself. Even if someone with 2 trillion contributions says something totally stupid, that statement is still foolish. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendantheJedi_f1e8.html" title="User:BrendantheJedi">BrendantheJedi</a> 04:40, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Someone with an abnormally low edit count is (purportedly) less likely to be knowledgeable about wikipedia policies and/or a sockpuppet used to vote multiple times. This isn't a vote anyways and only their 'vote' is discounted, not their view, opinion, or evidence. Of course, I am one of the people in the 100-999 range of edits under this user so take that however you will. If you care to know I have only heard of this in passing and only seen one episode. It was the googles that did it for me. kotepho 05:46, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But, you could be a long time lurker. Also sometimes I've made edits not with my account. In any case I know what cruft is, but I also know as long as their is at least 125 articles about mobiles suits, I don't think the cruft is well enfornced. I know wiki prefers to look at itself as encyclopedic, but this in an encyclopedia that be edited on the internet. Because of the demographic, the articles on this site may lean towards geekish followings. They can only go after smaller things like Pure Pwnage on occasion, since they still feel the futile need to look sophisticated. But we all know if they tried to cut down on articles on Star Wars, they attept would most certainly fail (unless of course it was a character article about obscure person in the fandom).-<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendantheJedi_f1e8.html" title="User:BrendantheJedi">BrendantheJedi</a> 17:00, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment.</b> I seem to have forgotten to add the comparison details in my earlier vote, so here goes: Not only was there an already large fanbase during the previous AfD almost three months ago, but it's grown considerably since with another episode released. The &lt;200K for Google has jumped to around 300K (I just picked up 312K), Alexa ranking's jumped from 39K to 34K, his then-month-old MySpace has gone from 3K friends to almost 10K<a href="http://www.myspace.com/teh_real_jeremy" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.myspace.com/teh_real_jeremy" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and the forum members of 11K to 15K.<a href="http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> And presently, a TeamSpeak chat with the crew will be held on Saturday; I expect 300+ participants like it's happened before. Also, as said above, a lock of the protagonist's hair is going for more than US$4,000, now with over 100 bids and 225K hits, even after a bunch of relatively high bids were taken down for more safety from fake ones.<a href="http://cgi.ebay.ca/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=7601131682" class="external autonumber" title="http://cgi.ebay.ca/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=7601131682" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHeteroZellous_ad35.html" title="User:HeteroZellous">HeteroZellous</a> 01:45, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
