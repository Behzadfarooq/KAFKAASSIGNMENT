<li><b>Delete</b>. There is no negative zero. There may be a position in computer memory that is used to indicate the sign in non-zero numbers. A bitstring in a computer may be the same as zero except for that position. That does not make it negative zero.

<ul>
<li>Actually, 2's complement has its problems too. For example, an 8 bit 2's complement number has values in the range -128 thru +127.

<li>Stars that are visible from where? Stars are not even in the same league as bricks and mortar on the corner store. I'm not arguing that every quark in every nucleus of every atom of helium in every star warrants an article. But I thought that wikipedia would contain the sum of all human knowledge or something along those lines.

<li>Its an issue of scale. Every known star is notable as far as I am concerned. Even if not visible to the naked eye. (As an aside, I wear contacts. If some evening I do not have on my contacts and cannot see a certain star, can I vote to have it deleted?) I'm not suggesting we catalog every brick just because each is unique in its own way, but every star? Stars are just so darned big that how can one argue they are non-notable. I'm also not suggesting that wikipedia be merely a directory of dry facts either. That's why the article need still be labeled stub.

Even to limit it from containing known verifiable objects of the magnitude of an M-class red dwarf? If 100 yrs from now wikipedia is still around and people are wanting something to put in the encyclopedia, only to find that guys like Merovingian have already cataloged all 'visible' stars, then will it be worthy of entry?

<li>First Gaff, take a deep breath. It's going to be kept OK? Yes, you're repeating <i>all</i> "stars are significant and notable" but there is no argument as to why beyond darned big and that strikes me as insufficient. "Keep but expand"? In a large number of cases expansion isn't really going to be possible. There is very very little that actually differentiates one star from another and that which does—<a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallicity.html" title="Metallicity">metallicity</a> say—isn't a notability claim. As, I think, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Rees_c795.html" title="Martin Rees">Martin Rees</a> once said "an insect is more complicated than a star." A series of single sentence entries doesn't strike me as useful; indeed, creating constellation lists and having the star name redirect there might be more user-friendly. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 13:27, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for your expressed concern regarding the volume of my respirations. Rest assured my breathing is just fine.

<li>But I do appreciate your comments about keeping things user friendly. A centralized list of stars might prevent sprawl. It will be a very long list, but might be a better way to go tha trillions of separate articles. Although, there is something cool about hitting the random article link in the sidebar and finding a star.--<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff">Gaff</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff">talk</a></b></small></sup> 16:35, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Not a centralized list for all: arrange by constellation and have each individual star name re-direct to it. If not in a constellation then yes, a generic list. Save individual star pages for stars that have planets, are super-massive etc. And create a template chart: apparent magnitude, spectral class, planets (yes/no), metallicity, variable (yes/no) etc. Searching "56 Aquilae" and coming up with a list like this rather than the page as it stands <i>would</i> be more useful. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 22:12, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The article already links back to its home constellation. I see no harm in having a separate article for each star. I do like your proposal for organazing stars on the constellation page, although the way they are already is nice as well. Kudos to Merovingian btw for tirelessly plugging in star article after star article the way that he has been recently.

<li><b>Delete</b> - All these uninteresting stars don't need an article of their own. They should be listed on one page. Any star that is notable can get a page to itself.

<li>I should add: just because a certain bit of information is worth having in Wikipedia, it doesn't automatically make it worthy of an article to itself.

<li>Okay, then, merge to that list. As to the issue of "all stars", that must be decided on a case-by-case basis, but I say that stars get articles if and only if there is something more to say about them than the standard luminosity, spectral class, size, date of discovery, etc. ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 19:09, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That may in fact be the most reasonable course, then maybe have redirects from the names of lesser stars back to their specific constellation. The "all stars" issue is a current issue, that maybe needs to be addressed on more than a case by case basis. Merovingian and other users have been working hard to create many, many articles on individual stars that they feel are notable enough to warrant individual articles. Perhaps a project or taskforce 'stars' could be created to reach a consensus on how to handle this question. I was the one to first nom this for deletion. However, I see that it is not a clear cut issue, as evidenced by the fact that the contributor is Merovingian, who has made extensive contributions to WP and is running for the arbitration committee. There are many, many star articles on WP now, and perhaps a more formal policy needs to be created to manage such an enormous topic.—<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff">Gaff</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff"><font color="purple">talk</font></a></b></small></sup> 20:47, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Very, Very Weak Keep w/ Major Expansion</b></s> Abrams seems to have been drawing a lot of attention to these candy bars--they appear in the hatch and in the flashbacks, and Rose has taken one to give to her husband upon their reuniting. The author really should have gone into much more detail, but, because of how the candy bars have been portrayed thusfar in season 2, there is a good possibility that they could become almost as important as "The Numbers." <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFraghappy_c2ef.html" title="User:Fraghappy">Frag</a> 19:44, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Update</b>: Apparently, the show's creator, J.J. Abrams, borrowed the name from a popular bite-sized candy made by the Japanese candymaker, <a href="../../../m/e/i/Meiji_Seika_706c.html" title="Meiji Seika">Meiji Seika</a>. I tried wikifying the introduction and providing a bit more context, but found that my knowledge on its signficance is fairly limited, due to its so-far very limited exposition on the show. However, if Lost maintains the patterns that it has established in the past, <b>the fact that they have made a particular point of mentioning the candy several times in the show means that it will have some strange significance later on</b>. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFraghappy_c2ef.html" title="User:Fraghappy">Frag</a>

<li>Someone has made a screencap of a season one episode where Boone is eating an Apollo chocolate bar. At the IMDB boards, some people are speculating that it means something, some people are speculating that it's just a prop, and it's nothing more than the chocolate bar in the Lost world, like Oceanic Airlines is the airline in the Lost world. In terms of Wikipedia, I think it may well become significant, and require its own article, but at the moment it's not significant, and we have nothing to go on beyond our own speculation. <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithD_2f0d.html" title="User:KeithD">KeithD</a> <a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeithD_fbd8.html" title="User talk:KeithD">(talk)</a> 07:34, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>This article has been a victim of sabotage from day one. Us viewers have learned that some people can roast out other people`s 100% Wikipedia approved (by the deletion policy) valid articles by:</li>
</ul>
<p>1) Reporting a random article for deletion with no case, followed by</p>
<p>2) Spamming the feedback discussion with negative remarks, thus making the sentinels feel like all is bullshit.</p>
<p>3) Some other measures include measures like adding ridiculing other articles, like this "Wolfensteinroid" article was designed to do.</p>
<p>4) Editing delicious typos to a given article. Somebody edited and has been editing the Castleroid article to have the same childish typos from day one. Like "Castleloid", and RPG-element to "PPG-elements", three times now. Everytime I edit them accurately back again, somebody else is editing these same things back to have these same typos.</p>
<p>So this is pure sabotage. Sentinels please check the issue like it is, and mind the bickering, since it is most probably caused by one particular angry person, who wishes to sabotage an article he/she doesn`t like.</p>

<li>Yup, a Castleroid and a Metroidvania are the same. Both terms are popularized by modern gaming media of today. The purpose of my article was to make clearer how the original term makers feel. And this is what I stated in this article, also. And both Castleroid and Metroidvania are adapted from the fandom, it is a generally accepted subgenre, as synthetic it might sound. Now if fandom`s opinion isn`t enough, I apologise. But since those terms live even inside even Konami`s official sites at <a href="http://www.konami.com/gs/officialsites/castlevania/" class="external free" title="http://www.konami.com/gs/officialsites/castlevania/" rel="nofollow">http://www.konami.com/gs/officialsites/castlevania/</a> (adapted from the fandom, OUR fandom, mind you), and this article in itself is very coherent and on point, I do not understand what the problem is. I read the policy of deletion, and in my understanding everything should be quite kosher. Except the fact, that this article has had a huge amount of sabotage for some reason (like some obvious hinders, like that "Wolfensteinroid" article.) Funny, how this person has had more influence in the judging process, than the actual article makers! Well whatever, I trust you guys know the best, but I plea you would actually learn the situation, like by visiting Konami official sites, if nothing else. Been inside the Castlevania fandom from the eighties, and I sincerely didn`t mean this article as a joke, eventhough all this petty sabotage might make it seem like BS. So sentinels, all I ask is for you to get a neutral grasp, if you indeed need to control this article. -Paavo

<li><b>Comment</b>: I was undecided about this article but Wahoofive and Isotope23 have, I think, really put it in perspective; the only elements of the article which are about "censorship by organized religion" rather than "censorship by &lt;particular organized religion&gt;" are uncited personal-essay claims.

<p>I've studied Christmas fairly extensively, and I've never heard of anything like this.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> this is a semi-hoax, but a notable one. The pickles are quite commonly sold in the US (and probably other places) with the story that there's a German tradition behind them. The German origin story seems to be false, and the pickles aren't even sold there. However, the myth is so widely believed (and almost always hald as truth even by respectable sources) that it's worth documenting here. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 16:16, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> of course. Now I did submit this article, and would like to state that because some Church of God groups do not keep this, that it should not be merged into the Church of God page. I thought that part of the purpose of Wikipedia was to have information on many topics. The Christian COG view of this time is different than that of the Jews. The article points this out. It is better not merged with the Jewish Sukkot as that article is entirely about the Jewish view, while my article explains how a minority group of Christians view it. FWIW, years ago the Feast of Tabernacles was the largest annual worldwide convention of its type in the world. I will be leaving to observe the Feast of Tabernacles myself early Sunday morning and would be happy to address any specifics. Thank you for your consideration.

<dd>* I already said <b>Keep</b>, but wish to add an important point. The monthly/bimonthly magazines of the three largest COGs (UCG's <i>Good News</i>, PCG's <i>Philadelphia Trumpet</i>, and LCG's <i>Tomorow's World</i>) go to over 1,000,000 subscribers each issue. Between them, these three groups are on over 300 television stations in the US, plus have radio and international impact (there are also many other similar groups on tv and radio, etc. that observe these days). There are people who would like to know more about the days that these and other groups observe. And the impact of these groups is not so obscure as to be irrelevant. But I do not object to the titles like <i>Day of Atonement (Church of God)</i> with the comment in it that some non-Church of God groups keep it. COGwriter 03:48, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> as the articles are distinct and informative. There is no reason to delete or merge them, as suppression of valid information is against the intent of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/j/a/User%7EMjas_12ab.html" title="User:Mjas">Mjas</a> 03:18, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> for the following reasons:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The articles in question are about holidays that have a <b>distinctly Christian</b> interpretation of each Jewish holiday. If you read each article carefully, it is clear that these are not simply "Jewish holidays" to those Christians that keep them. Rather, they are holidays which have a meaning that is wholly different from how most Jews would understand them. (How many Jews would equate the sacrificial offerings with <i>Jesus</i> or the Feast of Tabernacles with the second coming of Christ?)</li>
<li>If we are to merge all religious holidays that have different (or overlapping) interpretations, then the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecost.html" title="Pentecost">Pentecost</a> article should be merged with <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shavuot.html" title="Shavuot">Shavuot</a> – two holidays that have the same origin, but totally <i>different</i> interpretations depending on whether you’re Christian or Jewish. The same would be true for <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passover.html" title="Passover">Passover</a>. To merge Jewish and Christian holidays onto the same article would ultimately fail to adequately describe either religion's perspective of those holidays.</li>
<li>A number of Christian groups have origins <b>separate</b> from the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_God_9c39.html" title="Church of God">Church of God</a> that <i>also</i> celebrate these holidays.

<li>In addition, some mainstream Christians choose to observe such holidays as the Feast of Tabernacles – even if they do not consider it Biblically required for Christians today.

<li>I have commented/replied to many of the objections here, but been ignored. I don't want to repeat myself, but I will. <b>62.5% of Australian Linux users, when asked to name a Linux online retailer, name <i>Everything Linux</i> as the first and sometimes only one they know.</b> Yes, its a very small sample size, but 62.5% is significant, qualifies (for me) as the biggest in the country, and implies that the store definitely passes company inclusion guideline #4. It's a bit hard to prove what is common knowledge in a certain circle, but no-one has gone out of their way to prove in the past.

<li>STRONG <b>KEEP</b>:So? All of the other Final Fantasy characters have articles, and there's too much information to include in the main Final Fantasy VI article.

<p>The original research could be removed. The information about Adlai Stevenson is pretty humorous, though, and it well known among the Final Fantasy VI community.</p>

<li>True, but I think it's important to note that the only reason <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_V_dfac.html" title="Final Fantasy V">Final Fantasy V</a>'</i>s Gogo has an article is because the one from FF6 does.

<li>There's also the fact that I voted "Keep" on all the more important characters, and it wouldn't make much sense to delete just those two and keep all the others, IMHO.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> I am a technician at CERN and have personally verified the authenticity of Professor Vincent and indeed Dr Wilcox, who is a personal friend. I can catagorically state that gravitational oscillating plane theory is GENUINE, although the article here is not the most accurate.

<li>I've been wondering what might be the motivation for 86.9.0.194, 82.14.4.161, Dr uri krossavich, Dr greenson, Lithium412. Their contribs (actually, I think the same youngster in Hampshire might be behind all these edits) suggest that this is some kind of Dungeon's and Dragons game (various named 'planes' seem to play a role in that game). I tried to suggest to "krossavich" that he try using some of the spoof Wikipedias rather than the real one for this kind of game.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 18:53, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

Analysis of the wording on the page (i.e. "<i>as part of their propoganda campaign to stop him from releasing a superior operating system and defeating Linux in the Open Source NOS Market</i>" and the posting IP leads me to believe this page was created by Merkey to goad his detractors as well as create a thinly veiled attack page against them.

<p>This article concerns a witness in the court martial of <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_L._Richmond_%28Pfc%29_76be.html" title="Edward L. Richmond (Pfc)">Edward L. Richmond (Pfc)</a>. The text of the article and external links are similar to the Richmond article. The witness is not notable other than in the contextof the Richmond case, so perhaps this article could be <b>merged</b> with <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_L._Richmond_%28Pfc%29_76be.html" title="Edward L. Richmond (Pfc)">Edward L. Richmond (Pfc)</a>, or, if not, <b>deleted</b>.<a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaquin_Murietta_3d07.html" title="User:Joaquin Murietta">Joaquin Murietta</a> 15:05, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>keep</b> -- In the interests of full disclosure -- I started the Jeffrey Waruch article. In the interests of full disclosure, <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaquin_Murietta_3d07.html" title="User:Joaquin Murietta">User:Joaquin Murietta</a> filed a copyright violation on another article, that I consider to be in bogus and in bad faith, and an attempt to game the wikipedia rules. I called them on it in a comment filed just a few minutes before JM filed this {AfD}. If JM believed in full disclosure they would have acknowledged this themselves.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Granted, the two articles contain common elements. But Waruch, IMO, merited an article when we learned he too was under inquiry.</dd>
<dd>JM suggests we should merge these articles when Waruch's inquiry is still in progress? The results of Waruch's inquiry will have nothing to do with Richmond. Remember, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. There is no downside to keeping the two articles distinct.</dd>
<dd>JM says in their explanation that the article should be merged, or if not deleted. So, why didn't they apply the {mergeto} tag instead of the {AfD} tag? This is, in my opinion, a misuse of {AfD}.</dd>

<p>KEEP THIS ARTICLE! I am not trying to force on everyone. THe problem is I am very much educated on Kashmir &amp; most of you guys dont understand that the person who wrote the original Kashmir page, leaves out alot of facts (which is why u see it is disputed) and makes it long and boring. My version has the same info he has, and then some, and its also shorter and easier to understand. So thats why I made this new page and I dont think its right to delete this.</p>

<li>Indeed they should. And that's why there is Google. Lists that I've encountered here on Wikipedia have corresponding articles. There is no <i>Magic club</i> article. And, to me, it seems this list was created as a link farm for <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_Club_of_Vienna_993d.html" title="Magic Club of Vienna">Magic Club of Vienna</a>, itself a dubious article. I'm not opposed to <i>Category:Magic clubs</i>, but I don't think anything less than about 10 entries is worthy of a list. And this isn't a topic that's going to have that kind of growth very quickly. -- <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrash_3aff.html" title="User:Krash">Krash</a> 13:21, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>...You're not assuming good faith because you don't like that I AfD'd your favorite articles. It is impossible to get these deleted - for the sole reason that you people will never allow the deletions to happen. Hibana is trying to vote to keep, and he showed interest in getting the AfDs removed. Seriously, if you edit on Wikipedia, you respect the rules and guidelines. It is a matter of notability.

<li><b>Please dont delete</b>- I'm sorry that i did that to new order's section, i have learned my lesson. I use this site for all my school work and it is one of my bookmarks. New order is one of my favorite bands (Fav songs: Regret, Temptation, True Faith, Here to Stay). Mosbi is a real band. We have three members. We lost our bassist, his mom wont let him be in our band because he is in some cover band and busy with other things. But we are real, i am sorry for doing that to the new order page.
<ul>
<li>Hi, I'm sorry, but we just don't have web pages for up and coming bands. Even real bands, and even good bands who aren't yet know. It's not personal, in any way. I suggest looking to MySpace.com or other free web space providers. Also, you probably don't even want an article here, since once made, its not your property, and anybody else can edit it. You're better off getting your own free web space, elsewhere, which is your own (and you can even upload music to), which you can't do here. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 02:29, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If "unencyclopedic" is a description of the tone, it can be fixed. If it describes the topic, I disagree. I can understand it, and so could any reader, so I don't think it verges on nonsense.

<li><b>Edit and keep</b> Maybe it belongs among "web phenomena" or something similar. It's not exactly "encyclopedia-worthy", but it should be here to explain what it is to people so that they don't need to see the video. It's being called "the next goatse", so it's likely that it will be showing up in forums for years to come, there may as well be some background information on it somewhere legitimate so that people who are curious don't need to actually search for it on google and read every forum post filled with people saying "that's gross". The article doesn't have a lot of information in it, because it's fairly self-explanitory. It's a gross video of a sexual act resulting in death that is being posted around the internet as "shock humor". Not sure how to correctly sign my name here, I apologize. As for why it is different than the other floating porn videos, this one resulted in a death, which is at least newsworthy - original poster - 02:43:48 14 October 2005<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.96.233.102 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.96.233.102_3764.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.96.233.102">contribs</a>) 02:52, 14 October 2005 (UTC).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is a very persuasive case to keep the article. If it is a phenomena, and it is talked about, then it IS noteworthy, and it SHOULD be referenced. However, I question the merit of "self-explanitory." The article should explain a secondary consensus and/or debate on the phenomena and provide references. Clearly, however, it is not original research, so I think this has potential to be saved. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalecasta_ddbb.html" title="User:Malecasta">Malecasta</a> 04:10, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is, in fact, not a substantially similar recreation of the old article. After the anonymous author started vandalizing VfU with requests to undelete the original article (and threats to continue vandalizing until he got what he wanted), I blocked him and made him a deal: to be unblocked, he was to rescind the threat, write a NPOV treatment of the subject and abide by the community's consensus if it ended up at AfD again, and also not commit any more vandalism. To my knowledge, he has concentrated only on improving this article and has not messed with VfU or anything else. (I can't remember which IP he was editing from at the time; I'll find diffs if requested.) This should be allowed to remain on AfD for a full discussion. <i><b><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a></b></i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">ndroid</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 19:01, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Probably not, since (as the subject is dead) this is presumably someone else entirely. It wouldn't really be user-page info, and would probably be seen as an end-run against well-established AfD consensus. Still, that doesn't mean there's nowhere in the world this could be put...

<li><b>Delete</b>: Wikipedia isn't a place to warn people about frauds. If the fraud was notable - several major media mentions, perhaps it would be included. Also, there hasn't yet been a conviction, fine or settlement, so we have nothing but allegations, even though they may be true.

I WAS the one who added a lot of information to the page of "Gogeta" though some of them have been removed by "kids". I am only doing this for the benefit of the western world who seems to think the information they have is more accurate than from a Japanese source for A-ni-me. For those who doesn't like the page of "Super Saiyan 4 Gojita" can goto "Gogeta" page instead. Super Saiyan 4 Gojita is not a duplication of Gogeta, it concentrates on SSJ 4 Gojita only. This is a special character in the Dragonball GT series and deserves an entire page on its own. "Super Saiyan 4 Gojita" page provides more information on the character, not to mention it is the most authentic.</p>
<p><br />
For user SS Plough: Just visit page "Gogeta" Do not bother with page "Super Saiyan 4 Gojita". My page provides authentic information from JAPANESE ORIGINALS with pictures, not western dubbed rubbish. If this is a web page, it would be more nicely laid out, but most people on here are interested in information, not decoration, much like crap such as Macromedia's Flash. Page Gogeta is also a messy page, information is not in any order or structure.</p>
<p>For people who are interested in general information on the character Gogeta may visit page Gogeta. For more detailed information on Super Saiyan 4 Gojita (the most powerful character in Dragonball Z/ GT universe, this is mentioned in the Japanese original version), they should visit "Super Saiyan 4 Gogita".</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete and redirect</b> as per Saberwyn. Gogeta in any form only appears in one movie and maybe one or two GT episodes if I recall correctly. We don't need 2 pages about him. Besides, SSJ4 Gogeta is the <i>same person</i> as Gogeta, just using a special ability. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowersofnight_dd24.html" title="User:Flowersofnight">flowersofnight</a> 13:25, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would want to vote for <b>merge</b> with <a href="../../../g/o/g/Gogeta.html" title="Gogeta">Gogeta</a> and redirect. However, the author does not want to merge. In my opinion, this means he is withdrawing his decision to put this under GNU/FDL. Although technically we would have the right to do this, since the text is indeed under GNU/FDL, I think the honorable thing would be to <b>delete</b>. - <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndre_Engels_23d0.html" title="User:Andre Engels">Andre Engels</a> 13:29, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It IS NOT the same person. SSJ4 is an important and most powerful character in the whole Dragonball universe (please refer to Japanese web sites or ask Mr. Toriyama himself as he has approved the story). Page Gogeta talks mostly about SSJ 2 form of Gogeta and why should that page has importance and priority over "Super Saiyan 4 Gojita"?? What about importing page Gogeta's information into Super Saiyan 4 Gojita??</li>
</ul>
<p>Erased page will be resubmited over and over again. If you don't like the Gojita page, then read Gogeta page. Do not bother and disturb the Gojita's page.</p>
<p>It is also very interesting to know that all of the sudden there is a group of people supporting the other page. Does the author of page Gogeta have friends or companies forming an alliance? ......or seemingly different people but in fact self-support masqueraded by the same person??? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Masato (<a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMasato_f2e6.html" title="User talk:Masato">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Masato_0b02.html" title="Special:Contributions/Masato">contribs</a>)  08:40, October 14, 2005.</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per Andre Engels. I'd vote <b>merge</b> as well, but as the creator of the article does not WANT it merged, the only choice left is <b>delete</b>. Masato, note that there aren't pages for SSj1 Goku, SSj2 Goku, SSj3 Goku, etc. They all go under one article page. All versions of Gogeta/Gojita should do the same, because they are NOT seperate characters. This seems a clear case of you wanting to have your own page rather than doing the much more logical AND Wikipedia-rules friendly action of cleaning up <a href="../../../g/o/g/Gogeta.html" title="Gogeta">Gogeta</a> rather than complaining about it.

<li>Masato: That is NOT the point. I do not disturb other's work and do not care if there are pages on different characters for any series. I don't have to read them and do not concern about erasing other's work. I am only concerned with information. You read what you like and stick with the other page if you like. Don't dictate what others do!</li>

Very unencyclopaedic and, though I'm sorry to say it and don't want to offend a hardworking contributor, essentially worthless. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 20:53, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

Generally, I have deletionist tendencies, but I actually found this article interesting. Also, to me this article doesn't come across to me as a rant or as a tourist manual - the "Advice given to tourists" section provides reference material.

<li><b>Keep</b>:So? All of the other Final Fantasy characters have articles, and there's too much information to include in the main Final Fantasy VI article. There is nothing wrong with making separate articles for the <b>main</b> characters. Articles for NPCs are another issue however.

<dd>I believe the page should remain up. It provides insight into a different aspect of the internet world that many do not know exist. <i>(Anonymous comment made by 148.177.1.213)</i></dd>
<dd>Are there any articles based on any other private clubs throughout history listed in Wikipedia? A quick search does in fact show that those type of articles do exist. Haeleth's objection to the article based on his quote of "private internet message board" seems questionable.</dd>
<dd>While some may wonder about the importance of this entry, to people interested in the cross-section of literacy, technology and social-cultural interactions, the treehouse is quite noteworthy. The phenomenon of people from a wide variety of backgrounds interacting with each other through written language is worthy of further study. Relationships are forged and broken, political sides are taken and defended to the posters' literary ability, wits are sharpened.</dd>
<dd>How does race, gender, and socio-economic status effect online relationships? Do private social worlds like The Tree House loosen the bonds of society's artificial barriers? Can there be a social world where good looks and money don't count as much as a quick wit and a glib "pen?" The glimpse provided here into the Tree house should be of interest to sociolinguists, and anyone else interested in the dynamics of vastly different people from vastly different backgrounds, voluntarily communing together through the internet. <i>(Anonymous comment made by 67.9.151.177)</i>

<li><b>Comment</b> While your argument is well intentioned, and seems to be well thought out, the fact is that this page doesn't belong on wikipedia. Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedia. It is not a directory of every chatroom on the internet. It is not the place to publicize your online community. Will this page mean anything to someone who is not a member of your community? I doubt it. If you want to put it up somewhere else, that's fine, however it does not belong here.--<a href="../../../a/l/h/User%7EAlhutch_2589.html" title="User:Alhutch">Alhutch</a> 04:56, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> See <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. A board which, according to the article itself, is only accessible to 67 people, is <i>ipso facto</i> non-verifiable.

<p>The definition of encyclopedia is:A comprehensive reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects or on numerous aspects of a particular field, usually arranged alphabetically.</p>
<p>By definition, there is no definition of what should and should not be in an encyclopedia. To delete this article would by all means show that Wikipedia is in fact not an encyclopedia at all, but rather a web site in which a small group decides what can and what cannot be posted. This sounds like a "private" group, much like this "Treehouse" group.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>All</i> encyclopedias have a small group of people who decide what goes in or not. You cannot just add something to the Encyclopedia Britannica: does that mean it's not an encyclopedia?</dd>
<dd>In the case of Wikipedia, the "small group" includes every living human in the world. Anyone is welcome to argue whether something should or should not be included. But we also take into account precedents and policies, which represent the existing consensus of the majority of contributors, and save most people from having to vote on every single article. Several of those policies happen to suggest strongly that this article should be removed. That is why you see all these people voting to remove it. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 21:41, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. Discounted are Dark Twilkitri (too few edits, all Wikipedia: to this AfD), unsigned keep was actually a comment by an anon, with the bolded keep added by another editor, SuddenPresence (two edits total, both here) whose actual vote is also numerically discounted, Spigot the Bear (too few edits; 20 total, only 6 to Wiki space, turned up in part to lob insults around). The nominator's userpage does have a sockpuppet tag on it, and it is the IP of <a href="../../../o/m/g/User%7EOmgwtflolz_6b4e.html" title="User:Omgwtflolz">User:Omgwtflolz</a>, but I don't see why there is a claim of bad-faith, so I'm not discounting. All of which is slightly academic, because I'm calling a no consensus since the numbers are 5d-3k which is below two-thirds, there is nothing compelling to lower the common threshold, and even the numerically discounted comments do have some content to them. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 03:11, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>That argument could be made for GameFAQs, and possibly Download.com - I may have gone a bit overboard - but I struggle to see how you could make it for Zophar's. In any case, according to <a href="../../../u/n/e/Unencyclopedic.html" title="Unencyclopedic">here</a> (yes, it is marked as proposed and not finalised, but one wonders whether it is really going to change that much), an article is considered important if <i>There is clear proof that a reasonable number of people are or were concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community).</i> I don't think you'll be able to find that Whirlpool isn't at <i>least</i> well-known in the translation romhacking community - more like it is the <i>most</i> well-known in that community. --Dark Twilkitri 10:26, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>One would think that Alexa results would tend to be biased towards sites visited by the sort of people prepared to have it on their computer. In any case, it isn't a site with universal appeal, so one wouldn't expect it to have a high Alexa ranking. The site is notable in the translation romhacking community, not the entire population. --Dark Twilkitri 01:59, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I was fan of the video game console emulation community in the late 1990's. I have heard of this site but it is just not notable to have an article in Wikipedia. It is somewhat popular "underground" news site about Japanese video game console ROM images translated into English or some other language. That's just about it. Wikipedia is not a web guide.

<li><b>Keep</b> - "Not encyclopedic?" The site itself <i>is</i> an encyclopedia of games translated to English that were never officially released outside of Japan. It's no different than being an encyclopedia of software emulators (Zophar's Domain) or FAQ files (GameFAQs). It is a conrnerstone in the game translation community such that if it disappeared, much of it's content would be hard to reproduce, as many of the originating sites for the files hosted are no longer online (while The Whirlpool has remained so for five years itself). I would also point out there has been an entry for Whirlpool for over two years at everything2.com, another encyclopedia site. An encylopedia site where not every spiteful/disruptive Joe, Dick, or Mary can press a button to change the content.--SuddenPresence 10:29, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It might have an entry there, but it's a comment piece rather than an encyclopedia entry.

<li><b>Keep</b> It's interesting to note that a church's reputation or relevance comes down to goggle hits. I also suggest that their needs to be a guidleline to what is to be recognized as to what is not beyond what the big three deem is to be recognized (Christianity/Judaism/Islam). If it were left up to them Wicca would never be listed here either.

<li>There is sufficient evidence that <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wicca.html" title="Wicca">Wicca</a> has a substantial number of followers. The burden of proof that the <i>Thomasine Church</i> has any is with the original editor, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is clear in that regard. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 13:31, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The Thomasine Church was listed on the "NACGB" (nacgb.org), "Order of the Grail" page (www.orderofthegrail.org/listing_of_gnostic_churches.htm )as well as some guys blog site (nascentgnosis.blogspot.com). Those are 3rd parties varifying that such an organization does exist. Did you write to them? BTW I am not lost on the "Pilate" and "Pope" names which call for deletion. As someone who follows Druidry I am not surprised that some are calling for this groups deletion. --AnDruidh 00:22, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> / <b>copyvio</b> there is some non copyright and original material in there (probably Jung hyuk (<a href="../../../j/u/n/User_talk%7EJung_hyuk_093b.html" title="User talk:Jung hyuk">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jung_hyuk_8d16.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jung hyuk">contribs</a>) has put in very much good faith work, which it is terrible to lose) but the original edit and material which is still in the article are actually copied from <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/to/tornado.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/65/to/tornado.html" rel="nofollow">The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-05</a>.

However, I vote delete anyway, since such unclearly sourced material is bad even if it turns out that we could get away with keeping it.

<p>This is M. W. Secoy and I am the one who started the XWE page. Now, I don't seem to see what kind of a problem this site has with small pages, but this is a huge work in progress which I can only attend to a handfull of days a week. I plan on adding much more content on the sites, pictures and all at permission of the company and would like to hope I can continue to slowly build this site without having to worry about this sites standards. From what I can see, this is a harmless page without foul language or nudity. It's a chance to show off a small company of hard workers on a broader scale. The intent of starting this site was so that we could possibly have people have might be searching for independent wrestling stumble upon the site, gain interest from it and check it out. No where have I shoved any advertisement on the site, nor have I even listed the adress of the building. As for the link issue, I don't seem to see what it is you are talking about. I click on the links to get back from wrestler to the XWE and they seem to work just fine for me. Again, I know this seems like a small site but trust me, it's a work in progress and I'm doing it for the benefit of many great hard working guys. Besides, what could it hurt? Do you guys get paid to surf around and find web pages started by people that you don't think is worthy of Wiki? There's a webpage about XWE on Wiki. So what? What does it really matter to you? No real skin off your nose in the long run, right? Why not just leave it be if it's only showcasing a growing thing in Ohio? Like I stated before, it's an innocent site without foul language, nudity, or other things like that. Delete those pages, but leave this one alone? Thank you for listening.</p>

<li>There is a harm in having an article on such an unknown organization. None of the information in the article, can be confirmed with reliable sources. Information, on a well known group, like <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wrestling_Entertainment_4940.html" title="World Wrestling Entertainment">World Wrestling Entertainment</a> can easily be verified, and false information quickly removed. Anybody could put anything in this article, and other editors would have no way of knowing what's real and what's not. Also, wikipedia isn't a venue for promotion, and we don't give free advertising. Advertising costs money, this page has a cost, even though you and I may not be the ones paying. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 02:27, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Question</b> for M. W. Secoy: in this case, how professional is "professional"? I assume that money must surely change hands, but do the wrestlers generally consider their involvement with Xtreme Wrestling Entertainment to be their career and primary source of income, or is it something they do as a hobby or "on the side"? To compare this subject with precedents set by previous articles, we generally keep truly professional sports organisations, but generally do not keep amateur/hobbyist organisations. In either case, please do not consider this anything personal against XWE. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:25, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I enjoy watching wrasslin', but minor league wrestling companies such as XWE are more than likely going to be only trivia for wrestling fanatics ten years from now. The only reason for siding on the side of Keep instead of Delete for me is that the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_promotion.html" title="Professional wrestling promotion">Professional wrestling promotion</a> article includes a whole bunch of redlinks for minor wrestling promotions such as these. A short article, detailing the highlights of the promoytions history would be appropriate, along with an external link to the companies website might be appropriate. Listing every wrestler and making an article for the same, definitely is not. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 18:37, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
