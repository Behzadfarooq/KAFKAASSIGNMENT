<li><b>Keep</b>. Contrary to the assertions of Squeakbox, 9/7 is by no means a consensus. The previous AfD was closed as a keep by another admin and this decision was changed by Squeakbox two months after the initial closing of the AfD. Although the two terms bear some superficial resemblance, they are by no means the same. The use of "ned" pre-dates "chav" by at least forty years. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraemeL_c5a8.html" title="User:GraemeL">GraemeL</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraemeL_c70d.html" title="User talk:GraemeL"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:10, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It was me that reverted the redirect, not Pilatus (who I assume the comment was directed to). Personally, I have no problem with you taking the issue back to AfD. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraemeL_c5a8.html" title="User:GraemeL">GraemeL</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraemeL_c70d.html" title="User talk:GraemeL"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:29, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>And I have no problem not making it a redirect but just merging relevant material and deleting. I am not arguing that scally should get the same treatment because Ireland is a separate country. We have already deleted Charver and Charva on the basis that they are other words for Chav, and it should be the same for Ned, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:55, 25 September 2005 (UTC) <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:55, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It may interest you to know that England and Scotland are also separate countries; They just happen to be part of the same state. Charver and chavra are obviously derivatives of chav and do not deserve separate entries. The same cannot be said of ned, which is of completely different origin. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraemeL_c5a8.html" title="User:GraemeL">GraemeL</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraemeL_c70d.html" title="User talk:GraemeL"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:15, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am English but I respect the indisputable fact that Scotland is a nation with its own culture. By the way there is no such thing as a "marginal consensus" only a marginal vote, which is not a consensus at all. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 18:29, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Why does everything that is distictively Scottish have to be homogeneised and fitted in to an English perspective of the planet? Variety is the spice of life. For another example of this linguistic <a href="../../../l/e/v/Leveller.html" title="Leveller">levellerism</a>, see <a href="../../../p/u/b/Talk%7EPublic_school_%28UK%29_4d87.html" title="Talk:Public school (UK)">Talk:Public school (UK)</a>.--<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 19:22, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>This is distinct to Scottish culture, irrespective of similar expressions that may or may not exist in other Britannic cultures.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 22:44, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Neds are particularly and peculiarly Scottish, in the way that <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogan.html" title="Bogan">Bogans</a> are Australian. There is no such thing as an English Ned. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 23:00, 25 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's an argument that doesn't work. Consider <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gasoline.html" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrol.html" title="Petrol">petrol</a>. That "there's no such thing as American petrol and no such thing as English gasoline" doesn't mean that we have two separate articles. See below. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:48, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This argument relies on a false analogy. "Gasoline" and "petrol" are synonyms: two words used to refer to the same concepts, albeit in different dialects. On the other hand, "chav", "ned", "bogan", etc. refer to similar -- but not identical -- concepts, because they refer to different subcultures of people. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColinMcMillen_2486.html" title="User:ColinMcMillen">Colin M.</a> 01:31, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>It's best not to. This is not supposed to be a dictionary article about a word, but an encyclopaedia article about a type of people. For a dictionary of slang, see Wiktionary, which has a <i>long</i> list of these regional slang words. (See <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chav" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:chav">Wiktionary:chav</a> and what it links to.)
<p>The discussion on whether or not to merge is not a linguistic one, as several editors above have erroneously painted it, but a sociological one. We don't have separate articles where the titles are merely synonyms for the same person/place/concept/event; nor do we have separate articles where it is simply the case that different countries have different words for the same things. (Witness <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gasoline.html" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a>/<a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrol.html" title="Petrol">petrol</a>, <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squash_%28fruit%29.html" title="Squash (fruit)">squash</a>/<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marrow_%28vegetable%29.html" title="Marrow (vegetable)">marrow</a>, and so forth.) This is an encyclopaedia, with one article per concept, not a dictionary with one article per word. The important question to answer is not about the words at all, but is whether the two concepts are in fact the same. That's (a) a discussion that belongs on the talk pages not here (since merger of <a href="../../../d/u/p/Wikipedia%7EDuplicate_articles_da79.html" title="Wikipedia:Duplicate articles">duplicate articles</a> doesn't involve deleting anything) and (b) a question that can only be answered properly by citing sources on the subjects of these concepts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, citing sources is exactly what is almost <i>never</i> done in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">chav</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charva.html" title="Charva">charva</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townie.html" title="Townie">townie</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogan.html" title="Bogan">bogan</a>, gogan, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westies_%28people%29.html" title="Westies (people)">westies</a>, <a href="../../../f/e/r/Feral_%28subculture%29.html" title="Feral (subculture)">feral</a>, and their ilk. The articles are perennial original research magnets. (Witness as an example the edit wars over what vehicles certain stereotypes own and drive, and the lack of cited sources on <i>all</i> sides of those disagreements.) These discussions have been, too, with editors using "I am English", "I am from Newcastle", "Xe is not Scottish", and so forth as the <i>sole</i> bases for their arguments — bald assertions that that add no weight at all to the arguments that they supposedly support. I encourage both editors who assert that neds and chavs are the same and editors who assert that neds and chavs are different, to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:48, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Personally I think the definition of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">Chav</a>, at least as given in the Wikipedia article, is much less precise, and also that article is subject to a factual accuracy dispute at the present time. That dispute, for me, is enough for me to support keeping the articles separate for now. The term Chav, as used in England, is much more wide-ranging than ned, being used to label anyone who is alleged to demonstrate poor taste in their choice of clothing, motor vehicle or lifestyle, even if that person of royal blood (Prince Harry). OTOH, "Ned" is a much more precisely defined term, covering mainly teenagers who are almost exclusively working class. English teens with a similar lifestyle are only one part of the amorphous Chav grouping. If the Chav article is improved then I <i>might</i> support a merge, but not at the present time. -- <a href="../../../r/u/g/User%7ERugxulo_c2ad.html" title="User:Rugxulo">Rugxulo</a> 22:11, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The previous discussion is <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ned_%28Scottish%291_dc3c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ned (Scottish)1">here</a>. Squeakbox did link it at the top of this discussion. It was closed as "keep, strong suggestion to merge and redirect." by admin Dmcdevit·t on July 27. For some reason, Squeakbox decided to overrule that decision two months later. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraemeL_c5a8.html" title="User:GraemeL">GraemeL</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraemeL_c70d.html" title="User talk:GraemeL"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:53, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Actually I followed the strong suggestion to merge and redirect, and got reverted, which is why we are here. So I did it for the rather obvious reason that that is what was suggetsed in th elast Vfd. Your comment aqbout my overturning the decision is false and makes no sense. I enacted the decision, not overturned it. Or are you suggesting that merging with and redirecting to chav was not a "strong suggestion to merge and redirect." <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 14:29, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> and recognise <b>charva</b> as a totally different thing too. How do you reopen these deletion votes? I never got a say on the last one.</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;&gt;We have already deleted Charver and Charva on the basis that they are other words for Chav, and it should be the same for Ned,&lt;&lt;= BS. Charva is totally different, I suppose in southner terms it is a mixture of a chav and a hoodie (though it does mean more then this). They are certainly not 100% chavs. Charvas also predate chavs by a decade or over, you have only started hearing about chavs this century but charvas have been a common part of the NE for as long as I can remember. &gt;&gt;Charver and chavra are obviously derivatives of chav and do not deserve separate entries. The same cannot be said of ned, which is of completely different origin. -&lt;&lt; Again total rubbish. Chav is the derivative of charva, chav is a more mainstream, non-criminal popularization of charva culture with far heavier american aspects mixed in. Just as Scotland has its own culture north east England also has its own culture equally distinct from that of the south. The petrol argument doesn't work. It could apply if we were talking about western petrol and that totally different stuff they used to have in eastern Europe though for petrol/gasaline, two words for the same thing. Definatly not.-Josquius</p>

<li>Keep and <b>Un-merge</b>. Is it not time we wrapped up this strand and just get on with un-merging the Ned content that was prematurely tagged on to the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">Chav</a> article?--<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 10:00, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> as separate article. Notable also for the political fallout when <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosie_Kane_ae24.html" title="Rosie Kane">Rosie Kane</a> (Scottish Socialist MSP) said the term should be avoided. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 14:58, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> and unmerge. The term is in widespread colloquial use in Scotland,among all classes. It certainly deserves its own article. Its not as if we are going to run out of pages, and it prevents suprprise when someone follows a link and ends up in an apparently unrelated article. --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENantonosAedui_1bf2.html" title="User:NantonosAedui">Nantonos</a> 19:49, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
