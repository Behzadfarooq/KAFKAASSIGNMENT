<p>THE BEST MOVEMENT EVER!!!! This is a completely valid form of art and I cry when I think that people thing otherwise! Please keep Art Dreco on Winkopedia <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.3.238.192 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.3.238.192_a7b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.3.238.192">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Art Dreco is as good and valid a performance art concept as The Church of the Subgenius, SCHWA, and anything Andy Kaufman ever did including his untimely passing. Its roots can be traced to the very heart and soul of Dada, not to mention Mama - especially YoMama, but I will admit, not YoYoMa who is in fact a cellist. Look it up if you don't believe me. To dismiss Dreco as a conceit by one mad individual does a great disservice to all the other mad individuals who have given so much to the movement - and taken so much from its detractors. The short-sighted criticisms of a few bitter rivals (you know who you are...) only proves my point. Long Live Dreco! When Wikipedia is but a faint bzt bzt bzt echo of cyberdust, I promise you - there will still be Art Dreco. You'll see. We'll show them all! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.3.238.192 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.3.238.192_a7b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.3.238.192">contribs</a>).</small></p>

As page author I'd like to clear up some misconceptions of some earlier postings.</p>
<p>Art Dreco is not the work of any artist. A cursory look at the Art Dreco Institute website reveals work spread out over two centuries and created on every continent.</p>
<p>Art Dreco is not a commercial or promotional endeavor. The Institute has existed since 1973, has been listed in the Encycopedia of Associations, since 1976 and has been reported on in numerous magazines, newspapers, radio and television programs.</p>
<p>It raises valid aeshtetic, philosophical and artistic issues. In order to value, understand or appreciate this art movement a sense of humor is important... I find this also to be true in life <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Pdrexler (<a href="../../../p/d/r/User_talk%7EPdrexler_cbfe.html" title="User talk:Pdrexler">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pdrexler_12b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pdrexler">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Show them the pictures, Paul! Show them the pictures! Then they'll believe in us!! Kitch is a mere mouse flatus in a tornado compared to the depth and texture of the Great Dreco Legacy. I've devoted too much of my waking, non-medicated life to this movement to be dismissed by a pack of effete ivory tower art school poseurs. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL! I AM SOMEBODY!! I was an extra in a commercial with Paul Hogan for Gopod's sake!! Quick, somebody, call Jesse Jackson about this OUTRAGE! Just you wait. Some day, Tachen will do a book about us, and then won't you be sorry, Mister Smartypants. We'll be featured guests on David Letterman while our detractors watch in their dank garrets, eating cold pizza, ramen and lots 'n' lots of CROW! Dreco will not be silenced! Long Live Dreco!

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is priceless. The concept itself is a work of art. The beauty is obviously in the eye of the beholder. It needs work, but it should not be deleted. Let the authors work on it some more before considering deletion. There are certainly articles less desirable than this one. --<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 20:21, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The idea of censoring, ignoring or eliminating the definition of an art form such as Art Dreco because of a difference in taste,some personal pique or someones idea of sociopolical/artistic correctness strikes me as reminicent of the recently devolved Soviet attempts to limit its citizens' exposure to and participation in anything but exclusively Kremlin approved art, publications and other personal expression. Such limitation, while growing more dangerously prevalent in these fear driven days of neoconservative domination, are inconsistent with the intention of this republic's original comittment to basic freedom of expression and should be exposed and resisted whenever uncovered. Limitation of intellectual/informational choice is especially ironic and antithetical to the rationale for this Wikipedia's open-source existence. As a University Professor at a northeastern graduate faculty and as a Visiting Professor at a bay area Jesuit university, I have referred to Art Dreco as a jazz-like American art form and listed its Art Dreco Institute as a source and resource in each class syllibus. Its samples and examples communicate the rapidly evolving nature of our creative/production-related culture and helps portray the ideal of individualism in a society moving towards anti-intellectual artistic conformity. Dada had a similar history: obscured at its origins by a totalitarian necessity to demand and define 'realism'. Other historic examples of such artistic limitations include the violence that erupted at the debut of Stravinsky's 'Rite of Spring' and book burnings following the first publication of Allen Ginsberg's 'Howl'. The recent banning and derision of The Dixie Chicks (some of their cd cases having become good Art Dreco examples) by disinformation and censorship along with allegations of anti-patriotic/un-Americanism has unfortunately appeared here (with certain ominous echoes) for those not predisposed to the influence and lessons of history. Art Dreco's proponents and its many collectors are much better sources than I am for in-depth analyses. It clearly has many of its roots in humor and I was happy to be able to find it with some of its best and most classic commentary in this Wickipedia entry. As a suggestion for those who have made its authenticity an issue, I dig back a few decades for a phrase often used by young people directed at adults who were unduly obsessed with their limit and control&#160;: "Get a life". Were I to see that homily stitched on linen or stenciled on dayglo paper, I would likely consider it Art Dreco and would likely add it to my personal collection of classics (now including an African-American curb jockey, a rusting change box from the old Los Angeles 'Red Car' street car line....and a collection of backyard incinerator pieces from 1940 pre-smog-abatement back yards now an 'alternative living space' for a family of cats. Art Dreco is where you find it; a most art-lover-friendly form. I was pleased to find the Art Dreco listing here, and hope it remains a part of this valuable collection of information not always available in more limited and restrictive publications.
