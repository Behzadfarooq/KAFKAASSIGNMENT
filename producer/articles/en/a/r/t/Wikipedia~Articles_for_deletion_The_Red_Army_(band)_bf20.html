<p>I believe this articl;e should remain. I will continue to improve it, there are more references to cite, and the ones I have given are good (in my opinion). The BBC website is a good example of this. It is my belief that this tag should be removed.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2174.html" title="User:The Red Army Band">The Red Army Band</a> 20:42, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><strike><b>Delete.</b></strike><b>Keep</b>. With the release of only two singles so far, this band does not meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">notability criteria for music</a>, not to mention it probably fails <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">Conflict of interest</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAuto_aa00.html" title="WP:Auto">Autobiography</a>. The references are mostly self-published and what aren't are trivial. I would suggest the article be written later after the band is more fully established and more notable. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECricket02_ffdd.html" title="User:Cricket02">Cricket02</a> 21:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I change my vote to <b>Keep</b> as more reliable references have come to light. I did clean up and removed any links that were self-published/spam/adverts/blogs that are not considered reliable sources, but there are still plenty of reliable sources to consider this group to be influential in the local area and culture. Also, the author argues that although the article is within the scope of an <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAuto_aa00.html" title="WP:Auto">Autobiography</a>, it does not fail <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral point of view</a>, and I agree. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECricket02_ffdd.html" title="User:Cricket02">Cricket02</a> 02:46, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><strike><b>Keep.</b></strike>*I would argue that it is written from a neutral viewpoint, and therefore not a conflict of interest. Also, the discography remains incomplete, as an album was released in 2005 (One Way Ticket). There are articles from the BBC, Radio Cornwall, and independent websites cited already, and the state of the artist is a large influence in the local area and culture, as can be seen from the wikipedia articles that already link to the page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2174.html" title="User:The Red Army Band">The Red Army Band</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2645.html" title="User talk:The Red Army Band">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Red_Army_Band_5e11.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Red Army Band">contribs</a>) 21:57, 13 February 2007 (UTC).</small>--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2174.html" title="User:The Red Army Band">The Red Army Band</a> 21:58, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as the band appears to fail <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> at this time.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>The main point I believe them not to have failed WP: Music is "Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city". They are the most prominant and wellknown anti-folk band in Cornwall, and lead the movement with bands on the local scene. They also have toured in England "at least a medium sized country", and therefore I argue do not fail this criteria. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2174.html" title="User:The Red Army Band">The Red Army Band</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2645.html" title="User talk:The Red Army Band">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Red_Army_Band_5e11.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Red Army Band">contribs</a>) 22:33, 13 February 2007 (UTC).</small>--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2174.html" title="User:The Red Army Band">The Red Army Band</a> 22:34, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I find the comment "come back in a year" frustrating. The artist in question have been around since 2004 (that's three years now) and the references I have cited list from a range of times. True, the impending release of their new album in the summwe will elevate their notability, but the article can just be edited then surely?--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2174.html" title="User:The Red Army Band">The Red Army Band</a> 22:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Strongly referenced, including an interview by BBC. Article needs to be cleaned up, but should stay. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELastChanceToBe_b802.html" title="User:LastChanceToBe">LastChanceToBe</a> 22:59, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: The article's got good references, is better written than many articles and pertains to a band who are somewhat more significant than certain others with Wikipedia articles. It'll likely be improved further soon, as will the band's real-world profile (inevitable after recent developments) and therefore should be kept. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenphillips_a268.html" title="User:Benphillips">Benphillips</a> 23:03, 13 February 2007 (GMT)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Also see <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Burley_9941.html" title="Philip Burley">Philip Burley</a></b> Just a heads up, guys, there is also a new stub article someone created about <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Burley_9941.html" title="Philip Burley">Philip Burley</a>, one of the members of the band. Obviously the results of this afd should also probably be applied to that article. I'd recommend adding it to this afd nomination. (Note: Even if the band article is kept, as it currently appears might happen, the Philip Burley article might still be a good candidate for merger into the band's article.) <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:52, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Comment:</b> The article that has been added so far on Philip Burley appears to me to be biographical and fairly irrelevent to that of the bands page. I suggest it is not merged therefore, unless subsequent editing deams it similar to the bands page.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2174.html" title="User:The Red Army Band">The Red Army Band</a> 23:58, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
