<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I agree with you; There are articles that are less notable. However, if we're to follow Wikipedia's notability guidelines, it would be insane to try to delete the articles in order of notability starting with the least notable. For that reason, I think it's best to just look at the guidelines we have and not at other articles. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_1142.html" title="User:BradBeattie">Brad Beattie</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBradBeattie_69e6.html" title="User talk:BradBeattie">(talk)</a></sup> 13:36, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Of course one can't expect every unnotable article to be deleted&#160;:P. But see what I posted just below, it's notable enough on an "average scale", at least that's what I think. <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETorte_51d5.html" title="User:Torte">Torte</a> 15:52, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> One mistake should not compound another, and if there are less notable things in WP they should be nominated as well.

<li><b>Comment</b> No, I know they shouldn't, nor am I saying they should&#160;:P. But what I mean is that it's, on an "average scale", it's still notable enough to be kept. <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETorte_51d5.html" title="User:Torte">Torte</a> 15:52, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Wait a minute, how am I a single purpose account? I didn't register just to vote on this AfD. I've written the articles <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samkin_Aylward_bf29.html" title="Samkin Aylward">Samkin_Aylward</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hordle_John_3d11.html" title="Hordle John">Hordle_John</a>.

<ul>
<li>Fine, removed. I was suspicious because you've only had two other edits ever, both of which were nearly a year ago. Also, judging from your rationale to keep, I figured you weren't really an experienced editor- you're basing your opinion on a completely subjective statement that doesn't really hold its ground. I was under the impression you were "called" to the discussion and remembered you had an old account you hadn't used in a while. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 16:14, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom and because it's cruft. As for the keeps based on what Torte wrote, that's invalid. Simply because we haven't gotten around to deleted every un-notable article is not a reason to keep an unnotable article -- otherwise we could accomplish logic. <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_logic.html" title="Circular logic">Circular logic</a> is neither required nor desired. --<a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl">In ur base, killing ur dorfs</a> 15:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> As I said above, of course one can't be expected to do that&#160;:P. But what I really meant was that it was still notable enough on an "average scale" to be kept... I should just put that argument in my ctrl+C, shouldn't I? =P. <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETorte_51d5.html" title="User:Torte">Torte</a> 16:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't understand your argument at all. What exactly is the "average scale" youre referring to? --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 16:31, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps you should read <a href="../../../i/n/c/Wikipedia%7EInclusion_is_not_an_indicator_of_notability_abaa.html" title="Wikipedia:Inclusion is not an indicator of notability">Wikipedia:Inclusion is not an indicator of notability</a>. There is no such thing as "average scale" of notability. An article is notable, or it isn't. Have you read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>? Use that, and not this "average scale" theory that you made up, to make your argument. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 16:43, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Nyah, sorry about not being clear, I was tired at the time of writing and probably didn't make it much clearer, or possibly worse. My apologies. I still stand with that I think it's notable enough to be kept. Also, what I meant with "average scale" is that there are things that, as far as my knowledge goes, are less noteworthy but are considered notable. Once again, my apologies if I wasn't making much sense. (P.S. I'm not very well versed with the policies on the site either, so thanks for linking it to me, I'll read it as soon as I have time available.) <a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETorte_51d5.html" title="User:Torte">Torte</a> 23:21, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> What exactly is your criteria for being "noteworthy"? You say that there are things that are "less noteworthy" but notable. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 00:09, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - While the comic may not have a significant Alexa rating, I believe it has been an influence in several similar gaming comics, and is highly unlikely to cause a cluttering effect on anything in particular. It may be helpful to trim the article to a somewhat reduced state, such that it shows the history of the webcomic rather than a high level of fluff (such as detailed character listings), but deletion may be over the top. Theogrin 04:41, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> We can't just take your word that it has been an influence on other gaming comics. You'd need to provide <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable third-party sources</a> to prove it. Deletion is not over the top if none of the information in the article can be verified. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 06:21, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm fairly certain that sources exist that would make this article pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. I personally don't know them, but I encourage anyone who does to add them to the main article now. Once the article passes <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, any claims of notability are nullified and this article will survive AFD. <a href="../../../i/n/m/User%7EInmatarian_fe79.html" title="User:Inmatarian">Inmatarian</a> 04:45, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, I spoke to the author of the comic, and he gave me some links which might satisfy <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. If anything, these do at least demonstrate that the comic exists as an important part of the fan-based community of Ragnarok Online. <a href="http://www.ragnarokproject.com/ro-guide/online-games/a-comic-on-life-in-ragnarok-online.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ragnarokproject.com/ro-guide/online-games/a-comic-on-life-in-ragnarok-online.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://ro-quebec.com/liens.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://ro-quebec.com/liens.php" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://rocards.de/Fansites.rc" class="external autonumber" title="http://rocards.de/Fansites.rc" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://www.cgforest.net/shadowmaidens/links.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cgforest.net/shadowmaidens/links.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. I again stress that if these links help satisfy <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, that someone make sure they are incorperated into the body of the article. <a href="../../../i/n/m/User%7EInmatarian_fe79.html" title="User:Inmatarian">Inmatarian</a> 05:06, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The links you provided are of fansites, which are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> because they are self-published by fans.

<li><b>Comment</b> - While the article may intrinsically fall under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, as may several other listed webcomics, it contributes to both the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_webcomics.html" title="List of webcomics">List of webcomics</a> (which is, in its own manner, a directory) -- and the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_eab2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics">Webcomics Wikiproject</a>, should the article meet the requirements for a meritable one.
