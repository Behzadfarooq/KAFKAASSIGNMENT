“It’s not your intentions or your dreams, but only what you do that counts.” That is what you hear from Paul Davis a Seattleite who is the founder of Human Harmony. What started off as a trip to Egypt while serving in the military 17 years ago has turned into an entrepreneur calling in song writing, production, and making music come alive. Paul started teaching himself piano at age 22 then professionally around age 25. Some teachers did not encourage him indicating he was “too old”. He was a late bloomer but was determined to play. This determination is now geared towards supporting and cultivating students of all ages and creative artists who just want a chance. “Having your purpose as a producer has its challenges, but, if God has given you a gift, you either use it or lose it. This is one gift I can never hide.” The first play Paul wrote was about David and Goliath, in which the little guy overcame the big guy. The inspiration for “Choices” developed when he began looking around at different situations people face and developed a story live that incorporated music and theatre with the premise being that one can overcome those challenges with hope and faith. It’s a reality based theatrical show that is great for all ages and viewing audience. “Choices” is a show filled with high energy that speaks to your inner self and takes you to a level of consciousness about how you make your everyday decisions. The reason the band stays on stage versus being in a pit is because he wanted to keep the live energy on stage, this way people can identify with the actors, the story and with the musicians. Human Harmony was formed by Paul Davis over 10 years ago through a vision that is now very much a reality. Paul originally wanted a vocal group that would consist of a 5 part harmony. This inspiration came after his work with original members of the Grammy Award winning group “Take 6” where he was impressed with their ability to work as a team to create a beautiful harmonious sound. That idea has grown to include vocal and instrument lessons, and a theatrical group. The Human Harmony Music Academy is one that helps fill the gap of music education that is depleting from the school systems and helps to fulfill the dreams of adults who would like to enhance their skill or perhaps who have not had an opportunity to perform artistically. The Music Academy will, for ages 5 to adult, provide lessons in such; music, drama presentation, vocal and instrument lessons, choir and dance, and will be teaching these things and staging quarterly recitals to bring the lessons to the stage. Human Harmony plans to build an organization housed under one roof where people can grow, mature, become empowered and become more confident artistically then go back to their community knowing they can read music, play instruments, and mature their vocal ability. Human Harmony is a spirit filled organization where people from all backgrounds can fulfill their artistic dreams and goals. This is the sole purpose. Human Harmony has produced numerous projects ranging from Pop, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Gospel, and R&amp;B. Paul Davis is very generous with this time and talent. Surely there will be many more projects from the soulful groove called Human Harmony. Interested people can become part of the program by enrolling in the fee based lessons or apply for scholarships to support their desire. To help ensure these programs become a further reality, Human Harmony would love to partner with the community by encouraging your support by giving donations, sponsorships and by volunteering your time. Please contact Human Harmony for more information: 206-362-2559 or visit the website at www.HumanHarmony.com.</p>

<p>Lane Spina, after serving 10 years on the United States Freestyle ski team, including 2 Olympic medal winning performances, chose to enter Engineering school at UNLV to pursue a formal education in technology. The 1988 Silver, 1992 Bronze Olympic medalist, culminated his ski career by winning the 1991 world championships at Lake Placid, NY. When offered an Olympic and US Ski Team scholarship, he packed his skis up and headed for Las Vegas where he still lives today. After receiving his Mechanical Engineering degree from UNLV, Lane took up doing 3-D solid modeling for the Gaming company Bally Gaming to design and manufacture gaming device, a leading engineering industry in the Las Vegas area. After 3 years with Bally, an opportunity to create a new business offering the first wireless gaming terminal was too much to walk away from. He partnered with two other Bally Engineers to formulate Excel design. After completing the design the partners were able to sell the technology to Online Gaming, a company needing a wireless terminal for their Online gaming system and software. Although Online gaming never caught on in the United States, the experience lead to an opportunity join one of the leaders in the gaming industry during their time of need. WMS Gaming hired Lane on to manage the development of their new CPU-Nxt operating system, which was the major tool to the companies re-emergence. This reemergence was due to a flaw in their previous operating system and was the basis for their comeback. After 2 and 1/2 years the new operating system hit the market in the new Bluebird cabinet designed specifically for the new operating system. Celeste Cooper, Lane's superior then recommended Lane for WMS Employee of the Year, another tittle which Lane now holds. Since that time Lane has evolved to looking after the entire line of products offered by WMS Gaming while raising two sons. His wife of 16 years, Laura, Enjoys the annual family trips to the very places where Lane used to complete in his ski career. Annual visits to Paris and Park City, where the family spends time with former US Ski Team member Fuzz Fedderesen and his wife LeeAnne, who are raising two children of their own. It seams Lane has come full circle, lending what he has learned and knows to the next generation. As stated by Lane at his last ski trip to Lee Canyon, outside of Las Vegas, "I told the kids that i would meet them at the bottom of the run", then he proceeded to point the skis straight downhill and get in touch with gravity. at the end of the run he was making his last turn before the lift and looked behind him only to find his oldest son following right in his ski tracks. Surprised as he was, he said "is that as fast as you can go"? The response was "nope" by his son Trevor. Kyle the younger son was laughing when he made it down the hill, because he saw the whole thing.</p>

<p>Cp-opportunity is a consumer cooperative that is based in Santa Monica California. It was started by a group of people in the Santa Monica area in the early 1970's to provide it's members with a source of organically grown food. At its inception there were no sources of organically grown produce, or were not located nearby, or the prices and selection were high and limited, respectively. The meetings and distribution of food were originally conducted in a members garage. Leter they rented a space on Santa Monica blvd (which is currently occupied by a used book store), then in an industrial space on Broadway and 16th, then in the 1990's to it's current location, also the corner of Broadway and 16th street.</p>
<p>Co-opportunity nearly went bankrupt in the late 1980's. It recovered financially. There are currently , as of 2006, about 12,000 member/owners.</p>
<p>Co-opportunity specializes in meeting community needs. It has one of the largest selections of fresh organic produce in the area.</p>
<p>In the late 1990's and early 2000's, Co-opportunity has experience elevated levels of competions for its customer base, from stores like Wild Oats, Whole Foods, and Trader Joe's.</p>
<p>Co-opportunity is frequented by a loyal community of celebrities whom call the westside home.</p>

Stanlake Samkange was born in 1922 in what was Rhodesia in 1922 and is Zimbabwe today. He grew up in Bulawayo and attended Fort Harare University in South Africa where he graduated with honors in History. As a teacher, he gained perspective on what was missing from education in Africa. He found a way to help by assisting in the creation of the Nyatsmine College, an institution that provided academic, technical and commercial education for Africans. He first began writing through his studies and work and after gaining a PHD from Indiana University, he worked as a journalist and ran a PR firm. His book, On Trial for My Country traces the white man's conquest of Rhodesia, the struggles of the native people during the conquest and the clash between Cecil Rhodes and Lobengula, the Matabele King. He uses authentic documents and letters to transport us to that moment in time, take a look:</p>
<p>A letter from the Queen to Lobengula:</p>
<p>"The queen has kept in mind the letter sent by Lobengula and has now desired that Mr. Moffat whom she trusts should be the one to tell Lobengula what she has done for him and what she advises for him to do. Wherever gold is, or wherever it is reported to be, it is impossible for Lobengula to exclude white men and therefore the wisest and safest course for him is to agree, not with one or two white men separately but with one approved body. If he does not agree with one set of people, there will be endless disputes among the white men and he will have all his time taken up in deciding the quarrels."</p>

<p>FilmsExposure Awards is an international award for low budget films and their crews. The Filmsexposure is annually held on the third Tuesday in September. It's a oppurtunity for films and their crews to share there footage and get noticed by more people. The goal is that the awards ceremony will be held in a different country and a different continent each year.</p>

<p>In 2004 a mixed group of filmmakers and film journalists from different origins got into to a lively discussion on a internet forum why there "superb" film didn’t get the attention it deserved. The “we don’t get as much media attention as high budget films do” kept coming up. Which fault it was low budget films didn’t get the attention that it deserves was never agreed on. However a lot of people in that discussion agreed on the fact that some great films didn’t get the attention it deserves. The conclusion was that with the help of the film critics and journalists it should be possible for these film to get more attention. The method used to realise this, is by organising a awards ceremony with media attention for the contestants.</p>

Mark &amp; Graeme had known each other through playing together in another band, The Remedy, some years before. When Mark met Steve in February 2004 at the call centre job where they both worked, they discovered a mutual love of music and agreed to a jam session. This soon became a regular practice and within a few weeks they were working on original material.</p>

<p>The band played their first gig at the Menagerie Bar in Belfast in October 2004. In March 2006 on their own budget they went to Neal Calderwood's Manor Park Studio to make their first recording, 'EP1', which they self-released and sold at gigs. The lead track, 'Dead Man's Funk', was soon picked up by local radio, and got played by Across The Line on BBC Radio Ulster &amp; Rory McConnell on Radio 1's Session In Northern Ireland. Local press was also favourable, with Francis Jones from www.culturenorthernireland.org calling it "a fantastically impressive release for such a fledgling band".</p>
<p>The band started receiving interest from various labels when Radio 1's Colin Murray played the track, but as yet are still unsigned.</p>
<p>They returned to Manor Park in November 2006 to record their next EP, 'Desolation Blues', which they self-released in January 2007. Although currently without a label, the band have released their two EPs on iTunes and other digital music services in association with Tunecore.</p>

<p>The band is named after the Irish Hell-Fire Club located in Rathfarnham, just outside Dublin. It was founded in 1735 by the 1st Earl of Rosse, Richard Parsons, known to be a 'sorcerer, dabbler in black magic... and a man of "humour and frolic"'.</p>
<p>Their sound is directly influenced by early blues music from the American Deep South, as well as later blues rock bands such as Led Zeppelin. They have also been described as falling into the psychobilly genre.</p>
