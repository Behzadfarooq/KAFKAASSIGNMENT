<dd>There's been some changes to this article since I nominated it for deletion, and while I never actually voted, I've starting to think that it was a poor AfD candidate — the OBE has been confirmed, and the addition of her book helps that much more. I originally mistook this as a vanity article by Beere herself, which it isn't. Since AfD's exist to establish whether an article is appropriate for inclusion here, and others have demonstrated that it indeed is, I'm retracting my support of the AfD and changing my vote to <b>keep</b>. Thanks to those who went through the effort of improving the article since the nom. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass">¡Épa!</a></sup></b> 02:27, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, seems to correspond to the "notable in her field" criterion. More sources could be found, but I've made a start on probably the biggest one. Multiple non-trivial mentions in major news outlets. 8 hours is way too fast for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jackie_Beere&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jackie_Beere&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">progressively saved article</a>, please don't harass new contributors.

<dd>For a six hour block, the editor <i>wasn't</i> working on it, and lacking any sort of information to indicate otherwise, it suggested that the article had taken the form he intended it to take — hence the prod. If you'd look through the edit history to see who had added the speedy deletion tag, you'd notice it was <a href="../../../p/a/p/User%7EPap3rw8_be5d.html" title="User:Pap3rw8">User:Pap3rw8</a>, who has a history of overeagerness when it comes to article deletion (and is likely not monitoring this vote). And had you looked at the talk page, you'd see an explanation and offer of assistance from me. Finally, I suggested to userfy the article so the user's work wouldn't be lost (and possibly be available for an article in the future if consensus is for deletion but he can later establish notability). Please don't insinuate that this AfD is about harassing a user — it's not, and the suggestion can only breed bad faith. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass">¡Épa!</a></sup></b>

<dd>I apologize, I was not trying to insinuate that this was an <i>intentional</i> harassment campaign on Gainax. It's just that, from looking at the article's history (which I did do before I posted here), there's a pattern of quick, terse deletion edits while Gainax worked for several hours to improve the article to try to stop them from coming. By the time you prodded, the article already had the OBE claim (unsourced at the time, but certainly a claim of notability). Only <b>after</b> gainax asked on the talk page did you engage in a discussion, rather than a place-a-template-remove-a-template <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shell_game.html" title="Shell game">shell game</a>. I know New Pages patrol is a pain in the ass, and a lot of crap does try to get posted here, I was merely trying to remind folks that AFD should be the last step, not the first one (the initial speedy was appropriate for the state of the article's first edit, of course, but things evolved rather quickly from there). I don't think six hours is all that long a time to take a break... remember <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_panic_9c22.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't panic">Don't Panic!</a> -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 19:21, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
