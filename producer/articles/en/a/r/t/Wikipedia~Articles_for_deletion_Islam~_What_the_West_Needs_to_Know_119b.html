<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Although the article describes the point of view of the film, the article itself doesn't express any particular point of view. Wiki's NPOV rule is meant to prevent articles from being written with a particular point of view. The NPOV rule does not preclude having articles about subjects that represent or possess a particular point of view. As for it being a non-notable film, there are hundreds of wiki articles on films, TV shows, comics books, etc, that aren't particularly notable. The film exists, thus it has as much right to be written up in a Wiki article as any other film. Simply the fact that it was premiered at the American Film Renaissance Festival in Hollywood makes it notable. Its not just some home movie of unknown people. Its obvious that the person wishing to delete this article simply finds the film offensive. This consideration for deletion is nothing more than an attempt at suppressing information that some party dislikes. Take a look at IrishPunkTom's user page - it clearly states that he is a member of some group called the Muslim Guild. Obviously, he would dislike this subject matter. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENortonew_82d5.html" title="User:Nortonew">Nortonew</a> 14:32, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's what held me up at first as well -- it had a fairly significant amount of links in Google, so I voted for keep. But Google News only uncovers two news links to it, and from what I can see, it has only been shown in one particular film festival, and there's no talk for getting it distributed. That kind of clinched it for me, so I changed my recommendation to delete. I do note, however, that the film festival that it appeared in, the American Film Renaissance, doesn't have a Wikipedia article yet. That, IMO, is more notable than this film, and should be added. — <span style="font-variant: small-caps"><a href="../../../t/-/b/User%7ET-Boy_4523.html" title="User:T-Boy">T-Boy</a></span>: <small>(<a href="../../../t/-/b/User_talk%7ET-Boy_2fe0.html" title="User talk:T-Boy">complain bitterly</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_T-Boy_b210.html" title="Special:Contributions/T-Boy">laugh contemptuously</a>)</small> 06:40, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The most promotional thing I see in the article is that it claims the movie is "unflinching" and "sober", those terms are definitely debatable and should be removed from the description. The rest of it seems like nothing more than a description of the film's contents in a fairly mundane fashion. If there have been any Islamic groups, (or other groups), that have issued statements condemning or criticizing the film, it would be appropriate to add a section in the article documenting those statements.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENortonew_82d5.html" title="User:Nortonew">Nortonew</a> 16:24, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think that saying this is about censorship is at all ridiculous. If one compares the obscurity of this film to all the other documentaries at <a href="../../../d/o/c/Category%7EDocumentary_films_8671.html" title="Category:Documentary films">Category:Documentary films</a>, this film is probably actually more notable than many of them. A lot of them get fewer hits on Google and didn't get showings at film festivals. Also, there is good motivation for this film to be censored. Its really close to being a hate film aimed at Muslims, (maybe beyond just being close actually). It claims to contain information that people need to know about Islam, but it documents massacres committed by Muslims against people of other religions over a thousand years ago. Those incidents are not exactly pertinent in todays world, unless you are trying to just scare people and stir up negative feelings about Islam. If this film had been aimed at Jews or Catholics, I would be willing to bet it would have been a Jew or Catholic nominating it for deletion. Sorry, but assuming the best intentions in this case is simply burying your head in the sand. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENortonew_82d5.html" title="User:Nortonew">Nortonew</a> 03:05, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - Fascists in Christian Clothing: The Vast Right Wing Conspiracy was deleted on a 6 to 3 vote and it has confused me very much. I don't particularly care if we have a policy that keeps or deletes non-notable books that are critical of religion... we just need to have criterion set so that we don't get huge amounts of variation. That book was more popular on Amazon than The Nazi Connection to Islamic Terrorism (book) with every other sign showing that it was just as important. Wikipedia is not paper but along with that Wikipedia should not be systemically biased. So, that is my major worry in all of this. I have historically voted keep on this type of thing but I am worried when it seems to come to different notability standards on books critical of different religions. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/i/m/Wikipedia%7ELimited_administrators_6c2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Limited administrators">?</a></sup> 06:09, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
