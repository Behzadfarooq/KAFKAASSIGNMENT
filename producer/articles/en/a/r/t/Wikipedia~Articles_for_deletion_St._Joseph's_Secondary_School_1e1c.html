<li>I disagree. I believe that, just as incorporated places, universities and Category:British railway stations seem to have generally agreed upon notability, so too should high schools and secondary schools. "If someone wants to write an article about their high school, we should relax and accomodate them, even if we wish they wouldn't do it." —<a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> (<a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-November/008266.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-November/008266.html" rel="nofollow">Full context of quote</a>) --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">BaronLarf</a> 20:17, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for that context. I notice that Jimbo talks about a "good article" from a "good contributor", which lends support to the idea that a certain standard could be required from school articles. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 20:31, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would agree that school articles should be improved as much as possible, just as any article should. But he makes no mention of "notability," only verifiability. Granted, lots of these schools start out as horrendous articles by anonymous users who just want to brag about their school. But through edits by "good contributors" such as ourselves, I believe we can turn them into "good articles."--<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">BaronLarf</a> 21:34, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)

<li>A table and some categories do not make a stub on some non-notable subject into an article worthy of an encyclopedia.

<li>Weak <b>delete</b>, despite BaronLarf's improvements, due to lack of evidence of anything to distinguish this school from all others. I strongly disagree with both Angr and RaD Man in their opposing viewpoints: Schools are neither inherently significant enough for WP inclusion, nor inherently insignificant enough to auto-delete. Editors using templates to keep all schools or delete all schools are far less persuasive than those who research the individual school and discuss it on its merits. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:27, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>My point of contention is that we're able to include any commercial music album, not to mention every Pokemon character under the son, for the sake of completion. Be it by way of Dr Zen's template or not, the message doesn't change. If you don't believe all schools are notable, the issue of me using a template isn't going to change your mind either way. Count on me to vote <b>keep</b> on each and every verifiably accurate school article every time there is an opportunity to do so. —<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadman1_1309.html" title="User:Radman1"><b>RaD Man</b></a> (<a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadman1_76e9.html" title="User talk:Radman1"><i>talk</i></a>) 01:02, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Of course we can have those things over schools <i>for completion</i>, because, unlike schools, we can actually have a complete set. Pokemon are finite. Even since they've introduced more than the 150, the number is hardly large enough to cause a problem. Albums are also finite, the <a href="../../../n/m/g/WP%7ENMG_d058.html" title="WP:NMG">criteria</a> the artists have to meet take care of that - we can never have too many, because the bulk don't meet the inclusion criteria. What you idiots don't seem to realise is that, unlike Pokemon, major albums, major computer games, major characters from RPGs, railway stations, etc. without defining a much stricter set of criteria than "<i>if it's real, it can stay in</i>", schools are <b>not</b> finite. Wikipedia is <b>not</b> infinite (as those of you who have actually <i>read</i> <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINP_a8ac.html" title="WP:WINP">WP:WINP</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">WP:WIN</a> properly will know), thus we need to restrict the articles we have. We can include things "for the sake of completion", because we know we have something we can complete. We can never hope to document every school in the world ever - it's physically and logically impossible, as well as making Wikipedia unmaintainable and a print edition unfeasible.

At the rate that Wikipedia is growing, the percentage of articles devoted to high school articles in the end will never be over 1%, I believe.
