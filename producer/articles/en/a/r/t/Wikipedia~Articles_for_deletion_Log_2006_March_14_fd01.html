<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This article is NOT OR. Someone in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Diplomats_fd13.html" title="The Diplomats">Dipset</a> camp brought this up not too long ago as part of their defamation campaign against Jay-Z (also known as "beef.") IIRC, they even stole the argument from someone else. I think it's a valid issue, as Jay-Z is a big name and hip-hop prides itself in originality, I just don't know if it warrants its own article or if it should be merged with the Jay-Z one. If anything, though, the article needs cleanup. Usonophile 18:07, 14 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This article is OR because its coparisons of songs, and its labeling them as being plagirisms, is not sourced. You'd need a source for each song mentioned--one that's not the lyrics--where some person of critical authority said "Jay-Z bit this. It is not a tribute or an allusion; he stole someone's lyrics." --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 22:34, 14 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What's "critical authority?" From what I understand, the allegations were made in a track called "Biter/Writer" on a mixtape about a year ago (<a href="http://nahright.com/news/2006/01/20/public-service-announcement/" class="external text" title="http://nahright.com/news/2006/01/20/public-service-announcement/" rel="nofollow">here's</a> a link that discusses the track and <a href="http://www.hiphopworld.net/newslet/articles/jayz-biter-mix.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.hiphopworld.net/newslet/articles/jayz-biter-mix.htm" rel="nofollow">here's</a> a website that will play it). And then <a href="http://nahright.com/news/2006/01/18/cam-finally-disses-hov/" class="external text" title="http://nahright.com/news/2006/01/18/cam-finally-disses-hov/" rel="nofollow">the Dipset released an updated version</a>. Those are the sources I got. I think most of the lyrics in the article are presented in the original track. Usonophile 03:54, 15 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The "Biter/Writer" song is unattributed. As such, it's no better than the unreferenced article. You need verifiable sources for encyclopedia articles. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 12:11, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> if the accusation that he steals lyrics can be sourced. It appears like someone added to the intro that another rapper has accused him of it. If that can be sourced this seems like a keep. I agree that sourcing the lyrics doesn't count (unless another rapper accuses him of biting in <i>their</i> lyrics).

<ul>
<li>One mention of Jay-Z biting lyrics doesn't justify the original research and author opinion that makes up most of the page. You'd need a verifiable source which references <i>each</i> of the alleged cases of biting. Even this, this whole article is slightly ludicrous (no pun intended) as it is; what rapper <i>doesn't</i> reference other rappers' lines? At best, a sourced sentence or two can be included in the main Jay-Z article. No need for a seperate page; this is an encyclopedia, and not a place for unpublished analyses. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 22:34, 14 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think the author is necessarily giving his opinion, just stating that the "Biter/Writer" track was released and made some waves in the hip-hop community. Besides, to reference a famous line by another rapper (making the tribute obvious) is one thing, but Jay-Z "borrowed" numerous more obscure lines to fit his rhymes without giving any credit. I think it's at least worthy of debate. Usonophile 03:54, 15 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia articles are not forums for debate or speculation. A mention of Cam'ron making a Jay-Z diss song can be done in one sentence in the main Jay-Z article. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 12:10, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Greetings all. I submitted the page in question. Obviously I'm a newbie - not a hard core Wiki person. I guess I am clueless about the rules here. They seem to be pretty clear to all of you. Not quite so clear to me. Yes, the article is self-serving. And informative. Is that the problem? Help me outhere. Feel free to edit. Or tell me what the specific problem is. I don't understand your shorthand notes. S DuPlessie E: steve@gnbc.org</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> nn ('not notable'). (Nothing personal, Steve. Wikipedia has developed a set of guidelines about what is worthy of a wikipedia article and what is not. The most important one is 'notability'--otherwise someone will catalogue every blade of grass on their front lawn. In the judgement of the people above, you church is not notable enough to have an article. They also reject it because its purpose seems to advertise rather than to inform.) <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> 05:42, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is a very new article (the oldest content is from 9 days ago) and its nomination seems premature and raises the question of whether there should be a minimum age requirement before an article can be nominated for deletion. It does have an extensive collection of links but they do seem "content-relevant" to the unique subject matter as opposed to just for "mere" collection's sake, the later of which seems to be the main concern of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and they're no more extensive than many of the references/footnotes in thoroughly credited articles. It might not be a bad idea to review/revise the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> to take this type of article into better consideration. Also, the Brokeback parodies are not just an Internet fad. The film was extensively parodied across other mediums including television and print and is arguably the most parodied movie of the year. They deserve their reference amongst the film's cultural impacts and given the considerable length of the excellent main article, a separate page for their inclusion is not unreasonable. Overall, I recommend a "Keep" and to give this article a reasonable amount of time to develop. Santress 08:27, 15 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There must never be any policy that makes any article immune from AfD, under any circumstances. Moreover, articles are not deleted because they are underdeveloped. Articles are deleted when they are irredeemable and any development would be a waste of effort, so a policy against deleting new articles would be especially unwise. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 08:41, 15 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can see your point but the quality and content of an article is often related to its development and nine days seems premature to nominate an article for deletion unless it contains a very obvious violation of Wikipedia policy. Best regards, Santress 09:12, 15 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But I am saying that present "quality and content" are ultimately irrelevant. We are here to judge whether an article on a given topic should exist at all. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 09:24, 15 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It seems they do factor in here since the collection of links (content and even arguably quality) has been cited for many of the delete reasons. Take care &amp; happy voting, Santress 10:13, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This page came into being because there was on balance too much information about parodies in the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brokeback_Mountain_37a1.html" title="Brokeback Mountain">Brokeback Mountain</a> article, and it was decided to move the information to a new page. Many people have contributed to the article, and by Melchoir's assesment, this is a "waste of effort" and "irredeemable". But why? Who is being hurt? What is the damage? I was unaware of these parodies before I came accross them here. The contributors don't mind contributing, and it is a current cultural phenomena. I think the burden of argument here should be on the delete side to make a case for what makes this irredeemable. The phrase "Brokeback Mountain parodies" gets about 17,000 hits on google. Without the quotes it is about a quarter million. This is a notable subject. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 10:06, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Is it so notable that every single video hosted by dailysixer.com needs a link? If you were to delete the spam from this article, you'd get maybe four items, which belong at <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brokeback_Mountain_37a1.html" title="Brokeback Mountain">Brokeback Mountain</a> under Trivia. What is being hurt is the mission of Wikipedia, which is to write encyclopedic articles, not to generate lists of external links, <i>no matter how embellished</i>. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is policy for a reason. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 10:18, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article started out looking like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parodies_of_Brokeback_Mountain&amp;oldid=42113402" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parodies_of_Brokeback_Mountain&amp;oldid=42113402" rel="nofollow">this</a>. I too think that it doesn't need most of the links. That is an argument for editing the page and not deleting it. That someone chooses to add too much information does not hurt the mission of Wikipedia. What hurts is deleting articles that people have put effort into without helping to tailor the articles into something that would be worthwhile keeping. What hurts is having discussions about deletion instead of putting efforts into constructive improvements. A comment about the over-abundance of links on the talk page would have been much more constructive. I have not had much time at Wikipedia in the last few days, and much of it has been distracted by this AFD. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 23:59, 15 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I fix up far more bad articles than I nominate for deletion. In this case, I didn't think it would be worth my effort; you are welcome to disagree, but actions speak louder than words. Discussions about deletion do not hurt the encyclopedia; they help by clarifying the application of policy for new and old contributors alike. The use of Wikipedia to advertise web content must not be tolerated; for that message, AfD speaks louder than a talk page. I am sorry if individual people find this AfD distracting, but I think it is necessary to the furure of this article, even if it is kept without consensus, which seems to be the case. I'll do the honors of removing the spam, since no one else seems willing. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 23:23, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Almost certainly nn, but I would think that it can't really be treated differently than all the other similar packages listed at <a href="../../../t/e/l/Category%7ETelevision_news_music_packages_e70c.html" title="Category:Television news music packages">Category:Television news music packages</a>. The whole thing is utter cruft, to my mind, but clearly <i>someone</i> is interested in this stuff.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> millions of people hear the contents of these music packages and may be curious as to their origin. killing off the <i>entire category</i> would be be a profound disservice to wikipedia, and singling out this one entry would be bizarre, as Sinclairis a notable name in broadcasting. The fact that some people may not already be familiar with the nature and creation of these music packages does not make them nn - they are widespread, and, again, they are heard by <i>millions</i> daily. effort should be undertaken to integrate these music-package articles more thoroughly into the articles about their corporate creators, so that they are not orphans. that is the only problem here - lack of integration. merging, however, is not neccessary or desirable. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P.

<p>Delete. Any article which pertains to provide a fair overview of a subject needs to include both pro and con attributes of the subject matter. This article has been repeatedly edited so as to remove information pertaining to the cons of this product so as to portray only supposedly good things about this product. This product was was originally designed for the Macintosh platform only, and for many years it ran on the Macintosh platform only, and then with the introduction of RB2005 this product was extensively modified. The cons the modifications need to be reflected within this article as they are both part of this product's history and portray an accurate portrait of the reliability of the product. The original Macintosh interface and numerous features have been removed since the introduction of RB2005, which has upset numerous users of this product, who are not being allowed a voice in pointing out their displeasure with the product as easily verfied by examining copy of the last major release of this product (5.5.5) prior to the revamping of this product within RB2005. In addition there are issues with an extensive increase in the amout of bugs experienced with this product since RB2005 was intoduced, as verfied by this product's own feedback pages upon the publicsher's own web site. There have also been concerns about changes made to terms under which the demo of product can be used, differences between pro and standard version, and modifications made to the pricing of this product (i.e., a move away from simply purchasing a update to having to buy a update and subscription instead. Wiki is not suppose to be a free advertising site for Real Software.

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> There are <i>643</i> slurs here. Compare that to the <i>39</i> slurs on "List of sexual slurs" page (34 of which were created by me) and the zero listed entries on "<a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_slang.html" title="Sexual slang">Sexual slang</a>". Further, <i>they won't allow the two to be merged</i> because these ones don't have sources.<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_sexual_slurs&amp;diff=41177447&amp;oldid=41176401" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_sexual_slurs&amp;diff=41177447&amp;oldid=41176401" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></sup> Many of the entries they refuse to allow are obviously real (e.g., <i>dike</i>).<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_sexual_slurs&amp;diff=39450011&amp;oldid=39449941" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_sexual_slurs&amp;diff=39450011&amp;oldid=39449941" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></sup> The reason they moved these to the "old" subpage was to exclude unsourced entries. But deleting these slurs will create an increadible amount of vandalism as well as alienate many legitimate users editing anonymously on the page. Perhaps we could add a tag to the "old" subpage specifying that it is a page specifically for unsourced entries? Making it almost impossible to find the terms by moving them to a user page would be wrong. I have <i>three slang dictionaries</i> at my house, so trust me when I say that the vast majority of the words here <i>are</i> true. If an editor thinks an entry sounds suspicious, they can add a {{fact}} tag to it and give the author some time to find a source. The vast majority of these entries were written before the recent push for citations, so the authors didn't know that they were doing something wrong by adding the unsourced material.--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 09:33, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>From the originator of the article on Jack Coggins</b> Jack Coggins was a <b>very</b> well known artist and writer - checking Google will show the number of references to his works. Someone who has produced so many books, paintings &amp; illustrations surely deserves a place in an encyclopedia. The information given is all factual and supported by documentation. A quick scan of Coggins's work on the referenced web site may indicate the breadth and effect of his works. Dcoggins.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Sounds notable for awards and galleries where he is represented. However, author is user:Dcoggins and article is too subjective in present form.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - you can't toss an article about an obviously notable person (16,000 google hits, awards in his field) just because it was created for unencyclopedic reasons. Some people just have friends or relatives who are notable...the fact that they also know how to use wikipedia doesn't make said friends or relatives non-notable all of a sudden.

<li><b>From Dcoggins</b> Obviously I am a novice at Wiki - I have tried to "de-personalise" the article. Jack Coggins was an associate of Fletcher Pratt, Chesley Bonestell, L. Sprague de Camp and other sci-fi notables of the 50s, many of whom have entries here, so there is a precedent.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I can't believe that once again somebody has put this article up for deletion, only six month after the last AfD. The results of the last vote were to keep the article - what's changed since then. Moves to delete this article are blatantly POV - I should remind those who keep brining this article up for deletion that just because you disagree with this ideology or disagree with the fact that they call themselves anarchists is <b>not</b> a valid reason for deletion. I'm reposting from the last AfD why I think this article is important and should be kept: "The argument for deletion is blantly POV and sectarian in nature and smacks of censorship. (Which this move entirely hypocritical coming from so-called anarchists, but I've seen worse similar hypocrisy coming out of that movement before.) It is simply an attempt by Toothebarricades to delete an article based entirely on the fact that he does not like national anarchists calling themselves anarchists. Whether or not "national anarchists" is a valid as an exponent of anarchism (and I happen to agree that it isn't good anarchism) is entirely irrelevant to whether there should be an article on this topic here on Wikipedia. The argument that the argument is too non-notable to warrant a Wikipedia article is entirely false - the long list of links on this page, the large number of websites (both pro- and anti-NA) resulting from a Google search for "national anarchist" or "national anarchism", the obvious influence it has in the neofolk music milieu, plus the very active National Anarchist Yahoo Group are all evidence that this is a topic of interest and criticism for many people and therefore well-deserving of a Wikipedia page to introduce interested people to the topic. There are plenty of Wikipedia articles on Trotskyist tendencies that are far more obscure.

<dd>Hi, thanks for your comment, I'm disappointed that you suggest that my motivations for posting an AfD for this article are different from what I have described. Is there one of those google hits that you would classify as a scholarly source? As for a very active Yahoo Group, does this mean that we should support keeping articles for all kinds of forums, after all, there are many forums which are pretty active (and probably more active than that one) without articles. Forumcruft is not something that really floats my boat so to speak. I can appreciate that I'm not going to change your mind on this, but it would be nice if keep voters actually attempted to show how this "group" (for want of a better word) is notable instead of crying loud about some kind of perceived censorship. See above for my response to "blatantly POV and sectarian". - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisTyers_1664.html" title="User:FrancisTyers">FrancisTyers</a> 20:04, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to ask, though, just what is your motivation for deleting this article, if not POV? Especially in light of the fact that an AfD for this article was up only 6 months ago and it was decided that the article should be kept. Did you even bother to review the previous arguments about the articles relevance? It seems to me that the reason this article keeps coming up for AfD over and over again is because its on the hit list of various left anarchists who really don't like the idea of a far-right and racialist ideology calling itself a kind of anarchism. I'll point out again that whether its good anarchism or not (and I happen to agree with critics who say it isn't) is totally irrelevant to its relevance as a Wikipedia article.</dd>

<dd>I have serious doubts about your criterion for dropping this article, in any event. The active Yahoo Group, plus the website Rosenoir.org, plus 596 Google hits, are quite sufficient to me to state that this is an ideological tendency with actual adherents and has an active place in the marketplace of ideas, and not just some kind of hoax that somebody made up off the top of their head. This is not to mention the controversies around national anarchism and similar ideas - do a Google search for "Anarchist Heretics Fair" and you'll see that there was a rather large controversy in the anarchist and anti-fascist press about this ideological tendency. I'll also point you to <a href="http://www.fluxeuropa.com" class="external text" title="http://www.fluxeuropa.com" rel="nofollow">FluxEuropa</a> for an example of the influence that "national anarchist" or "third position" ideas have in the milieu of <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofolk.html" title="Neofolk">neofolk</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martial_music.html" title="Martial music">martial music</a>, and other "dark music".</dd>

<dd>If your criterion is that National Anarchism too small of a tendency to be taken seriously (which I think is a pretty dodgy reason for dropping an article), here's some other groups which you might want to float AfD's for: <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Bolshevik_Tendency_0cf2.html" title="International Bolshevik Tendency">International Bolshevik Tendency</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Action_%28Canada%29_37d1.html" title="Socialist Action (Canada)">Socialist Action (Canada)</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotskyist-Posadist_IVth_International_c4ff.html" title="Trotskyist-Posadist IVth International">Trotskyist-Posadist IVth International</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_Trinidad_and_Tobago_b69c.html" title="Communist Party of Trinidad and Tobago">Communist Party of Trinidad and Tobago</a>, <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typhonian_Ordo_Templi_Orientis_86f1.html" title="Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis">Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Thursdayism_d112.html" title="Last Thursdayism">Last Thursdayism</a>. If National Anarchism is too obscure of a subject, why should these other obscure groups get to have Wikipedia pages?

The entry may appear as a Vanity Article but I set up this reference so as to provide a starting point that will enable other users to expand upon, which will occur because of the relevance they hold as a resource for many others related to the formentioned topics. <small><i>(unsigned comment by Georgemturnerjr) <a href="../../../%28/a/e/User%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User:(aeropagitica)"><font style="background: #800080" face="Ariel" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;(aeropagitica)&#160;</b></font></a></i></small></li>

Keep it! you can't just get rid of something because you think it's "not-notable." as an encyclopedia you are supposed to be nutral and to label something like that is obviously giving it a bias. this article should be kept, and who do you think you are to decide whether or not something is notable anyway? <small>‚ÄîThis <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Beatrixcastle (<a href="../../../b/e/a/User_talk%7EBeatrixcastle_b974.html" title="User talk:Beatrixcastle">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beatrixcastle_54ce.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beatrixcastle">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I just went thru and identified some unsigned posts and commented on users without significant contribution histories.

<li>Three years old, does carry an audience on the net, and I haven't heard any grounds for deletion that appear reasonable other than the per nom which I assume has to do with the policy. The newest post on Newgrounds is a social commentary that I find pretty good, similar to the battle between "Cyanide and Happiness" with "Top Web Comics". Give the artist time and I'm sure he'll battle this deletion to the bitter end. <small>‚ÄîThis <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.195.78.102 (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.195.78.102_8fe0.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.195.78.102">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>Comment</b>. To justify my deletion vote I just want to say that even if it will become notable it doesn't mean it is now. Joseph Blanchette aka Legendary Frog had his entry removed despite being several times more famous than "Fred the monkey". My comment is, the creator of Fred the monkey has started a campaign to make sure his entry doesn't get deleted, through a flash movie submitted to newgrounds.com and probably elsewehere as well where he tells people to go to Wikipedia and "tell them to shut their stupid faces" (and a clickable link that leads to the Fred the Monkey entry). This surely explains the many recent unsigned "Keep" votes. I am appaled by the creator of "fred the monkey"'s lack of understanding for what wikipedia stands for (it's an encyclopedia and not a showcase for up and coming artists) and I think this move makes it much harder to hold a fair vote, which I think in the end will only weigh FOR the deletion of this article. Here's the animation on Newgrounds: <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/302151" class="external text" title="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/302151" rel="nofollow">Fred the notable monkey</a><a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 11:44, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yet another <b>Comment</b>: There is not only a single (1) google hit on "fredthemonkey.com", search for any page name and you'll only get one result. From there you click "Find web pages that contain the term "fredthemonkey.com"". This gives 243 hits (note, by looking on the first page of results I get the impression that many of them are created by the maker himself). This does however, in my opionion, doesn't change anything. I'd vote "delete" if it had 10 000 hits. In fact, my own flash game "Shotgun Orc" comes up with 30,000-65,000 hits on google (currently 65,000), but I wouldn't dream of suggesting an entry to be made for it and if somebody did make one I would definately nominate it for deletion myself. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 12:12, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Pab123 has less than 50 edits, almost all of which deal with these articles and their votes for deletion. Also, to respond to the issue raised by this voter, I'd like to point out that Google is an accurate gauge of how much people are talking about the subject in question. Failing that, Adherents.com fails to list this "religion". Wikipedia is not made to be used to get word out about or advertise about your religion. It can go in here when it is sufficiently notable on its own to merit inclusion in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a> 14:33, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s><b>Delete unless moved back to "Fuck Truck"</b>&#160;: renominated because of the move from "fuck truck" to "Wellesley College Senate Bus". I voted againt deletion in the last debate because the term "fuck truck", used at colleges across America, is a genuine piece of American collegiate folklore; I thought this article had potential to grow beyond its discussion of the Wellesley bus and, in so doing, become notable on this cultural basis. However, with this move, the article focuses on this one shuttle bus between a amall liberal arts college outside of Boston and larger nearby colleges...Can you imagine if wikipedia had an article for every specific college shuttle and its campus lore? Simply put, this article in its new, more specic form, simply does not deal with a notable topic.</s> <b>Keep</b>: I am changing my vote for the sake of consistency.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. The name change is irrelevant and this nom is in bad faith. The article move followed a discussion and vote on the article talk page. Everything was above board. This nom argued extremely hard in the last AfD, which closed less than a month ago, to save the article based on its encyclopedic content <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Fuck_Truck" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Fuck_Truck" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, calling it in one of his 12 posts "<i>a quite well written and well researched article</i>". Speaking about the article , he wrote: <i>"the term 'fuck truck' and the sexual connotations of this service needs to be a part of that final form"</i>. Well <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck_Truck_44c0.html" title="Fuck Truck">Fuck Truck</a> still redirects to the article and the term is prominently mentioned in the first paragraph. However, it now seems that all this nom was interested in was having some kind of joke based on the lewd nickname for the bus. I say that while wikipedia is not for schoolyard jokes, it is for encyclopedic material and this bus was encyclopedic last month as the nom so passionately argued. That he is now changing his tune out of spite is no reason to slam the door on the bus or participate in a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">WP:Point</a>-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:53, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>::::<b>comment</b>: it is clear that you have not actually read my comments. I have repeatedly said that "fuck truck" should be retained because I believed it would grow to include information about other shuttles. I myself intended to get to work on this project when I became less busy. I have repeatedly said that it is this widespread usage, which, as I said, I hoped would be incorporated into this article, that created notability. A Wellesley-specific name seems to preclude the addition of information relevant to other schools. Thus, based on rationale for notability, the move to "Wellesley College Senate Bus" made this article non-notable. I have repeatedly stated this good faith rationale for nominating for deletion upon the name change and you have been part of the discussions in which I have said this. So, given that you have had this rationale for my behavior in front of you the whole time and have still made these accusations against me, I feel that I am justified in accusing you of making <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 04:03, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</s><a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 04:01, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article seems fine, and it does look like a bad faith nom ("my way or nothing").

When there is more evidence of notability at other colleges (especially notabilty that extends beyond the students into the community) then consider moving the page back. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 23:08, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article might need some tweaking, but an article about a transportation service is certainly relevant (see <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humphrey_Go-Bart_548d.html" title="Humphrey Go-Bart">Humphrey Go-Bart</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitrans.html" title="Unitrans">Unitrans</a>, or even <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Buses_route_1_9a78.html" title="London Buses route 1">London Buses route 1</a>), particularly as this seems to have had media coverage. <a href="../../../r/x/u/User%7ERXUYDC_0144.html" title="User:RXUYDC">RXUYDC</a> 23:18, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>*<b>Allow me to defend myself</b>: Please do not accuse me of bad faith. This is an unsubstiantiated <b>personal attack</b>. If you read my arguments throughout this process, you will see that I have consistently argued for inclusion on the basis that "fuck truck" is a general, non Wellesley-Harvard-MIT specific term (along, I admit, with other complementary rationales). I sincerely believe that an article about a general concept in collegiate humor (fuck truck) is notable while an article about a specific shuttle bus connecting three campuses is not. I have come to hold this view more strongly over the last couple of months, which explains my greater focus on this perspective and increased unwillingness (in my mind) to compromise. Please see my numerous good faith edits (including reverting vandalism) and stop hurling unfounded accusations at me. Thanks. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 00:15, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</s><a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 04:01, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I apologize for using the term "bad faith" given that you are sincere in your belief that this service is non-notable. From my point of view, "Fuck Truck" as a college neologism is not interesting <i>unless</i> it is attached to specifically notable examples. At the present time a generic article would be 98% about Wellesley and 2% about Byrn Mawr. Wellesley's transport service attracted considerable undesirable notariety that spilled over into the public eye; Byrn Mawr's use is (so far) only documented in a student web newsletter. If there are more examples, add them to the article, in detail if you like, and when the "other use" section outgrows the rest of the article it can be moved back. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 00:30, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, the game exists at BoardGameGeek (USA)... and if the majority of German users voted to keep it, this proves that in Germany the game is seen as relevant (except perhaps by a few who never heard of Mancala before, but have the rather dictatorial power to delete articles) which should be important for the English Wiki as well... also I believe that lots of information is only verified in other special wikis or even only in books, magazines and so on (but not the web). btw, I am one of the contributors of the "Encyclopedia of Community" (Berkshire Publishing Group) and they asked me to write an article on my own research work. So what's the problem?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Actually, that just proves that 8 wikipedia users in Germany, who happen to watch the AfD pages, see the game as relevant as opposed to 3 who saw it as not relevant. It can't really be applied to indicate any sort of more general popularity... though with that consensus of opinions, a deletion seems highly irregular. The problem here is that Wikis are not a good form of verification because anyone can add info and, depending on the policies of the specific wiki, sourcing of that info may not be required. BoardGameGeek is the same situation; anyone can register and add a new game. From the profice at BoardGameGeek it doesn't appear to have generated any interest whatsoever (1 comment). Books &amp; Magazines are a good verification source however. Can you cite any sources for 55Stones that come from books/magazines? Also, writing an article based on your own research work is a problem. It violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, which is a Wikipedia policy.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:33, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You say "highly irregular"? Well, it's not irregular, it's typical in the German wiki, because it's not consensus based. Hundreds of users were banned, because they are "democrats" (called in German "Demokratietrolle"), that is, they wanted democratic decision-making. Decision-making is only by admins and they don't permit any questioning which could endanger their power. Furthermore, your comment "happen to watch the AfD pages" can be equally made about this very discussion. It's a very destructive argument. 11 votes (and a few neutral ones) are a lot. Can you show me many articles which got more votes??? Whether it's a wiki or not, obviously several different people in many different countries have added 55Stones to their wiki, claiming that this game IS important. Adding to a special wiki about Mancala games, could even mean that the game is considered of bein important by those who have a profound knowledge of Mancala games, not just for the casual gamer. It's true that the BGG article hasn't generated much interest, but that's because it's a new article. BUT it's NOT true that anybody can add a game. Anybody can suggest a game, but the decision is made by several admins and it's made teamwise. I suppose, most unpublished games are rejected by BGG, there are just a few. It's a privelege.
<dl>
<dd>I'm speaking in context of English wiki... If that is how German language AfD is run then it is rather unfortunate... but it's not really relevant here (and on a side note I could show you dozens of en.wiki AfD's that exceed 11 opinions rendered). Indeed, that argument could be made about this discussion, which is why it is so important to provide some <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources on which to base a decision about 55Stones. In my opinion, Wikis don't cut it. I've added information on cross-class skill strategies to the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guild_Wars_01f9.html" title="Guild Wars">Guild Wars</a> wiki because it is important and interesting to me and possibly anyone who plays GW, but that doesn't mean that information is suitable for Wikipedia. Information added here needs to meet the guidelines and policies of Wikipedia. If you can provide independent, 3rd party sources pertaining to this variation of Mancala I will reconsider. Right now though I'm just not seeing anything that makes me reconsider my opinion.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:48, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mancala ist ein Gattungsbegriff, deswegen werden einzelne Spiele (egal von wem) dort nicht eingebaut. Die Wiki-Manqala ist eine eigenst√§ndige katalanische Website und hat nichts mit dem Erfinder des Spiels zu tun. Unabh√§ngig von der deutschen Wikipedia gibt es in der italienischen W. einen Eintrag √ºber 55Stones. Der L√∂schantrag von Tobias Schmidbauer ist nichts anderes als eine Retourkutsche, da ich seine Sperrung beantragt habe. Schmidbauer vandaliert im Lemma Guantanamo-Bucht seit Januar 2006. √úbrigens erschien eben beim Aufrufen dieser Seite ein Wichsbild (wurde inzwischen offenbar wieder entfernt), deswegen habe ich den L√∂schantrag entfernt.

<dd>Man sollte vielleicht noch hinzuf√ºgen, dass ich insgesamt 20 Artikel der Kategorie "Mancala" in den letzten Monaten verfasst habe (neben zahlreichen wissenschaftlichen Aufs√§tzen √ºber diese Spielefamilie in Fachzeitschriften). Von den drei anderen Artikeln, die schon existierten, habe ich zwei komplett √ºberarbeitet, da sie sich in einem miserablen Zustand befanden. Ich habe immer konstruktiv mitgearbeitet und versucht, Artikel objektiv und "neutral" zu gestalten, selbst wenn ich eine emotionale N√§he zum Thema besitze. Moderne Mancala-Spiele sind nicht unbedingt sehr bekannt (au√üer in bestimmten Kreisen), das gilt jedoch auch f√ºr andere Spiele, die in der deutschen Wikipedia beschrieben werden. Wichtig sind jedoch auch noch andere Kriterien, dazu geh√∂ren bei modernen Mancala-Spielen innovative Spielmechanismen, die sie von traditionellen Mancala-Spielen deutlich abgrenzen. Dies f√ºhrt dazu, dass die Definition von Mancala-Spielen heute st√§ndig im Fluss ist. Au√üerdem wird nur ein Bruchteil von Mancalaspielen, die ich erfunden habe, in der deutschen Wikipedia beschrieben. Betrachtet man den Gesamtzusammenhang innerhalb der deutschen Wikipedia (moderne Mancala-Spiele) stellen sie auch wieder nur einen kleinen Teil dar. Allerdings bin ich der Meinung, dass nun auch mehr traditionelle Spiele hinzugef√ºgt werden sollten. Im √ºbrigen habe ich diese beanstandeten Artikel durchaus mit einem gewissen Unbehagen verfasst. Es w√§re mir sehr viel lieber gewesen, wenn jemand anderes dies geschrieben h√§tte. Ich wei√ü, dass Spieleautoren ihre Spiele oft √ºberbewerten, denke jedoch, dass eine √úbersicht √ºber moderne Mancala-Spiele g√§nzlich ohne meine Varianten genauso ein unangemessenes Extrem darstellen w√ºrde, als h√§tte ich es gewagt, s√§mtliche Spiele, die ich je erfunden habe, hier einzubauen. -- Mr. Mancala 19:38, 6.

<dd>Laut History wurde der italienische Artikel am 24. August 2005 vom User Moongateclimber angelegt. Ich kann √ºberhaupt kein Italienisch. Wer ein Spiel f√ºr BGG vorschl√§gt, ist v√∂llig unwichtig. Ob ein Vorschlag angenommen wird, pr√ºfen und entscheiden die BGG Admins (ein Team), ich bin kein Admin. Nicht-kommerzielle Spiele werden meist abgelehnt. Dass 55Stones akzeptiert wurde, ist daher eine Auszeichnung. Noch ein Nachtrag zur WikiManqala: Die Seite wurde von V√≠ktor Bautista i Roca ins Leben gerufen, dem st√§rksten nicht-indigenen Oware-Meister Europas, der Begr√ºnder der katalanischen Aual√©-Liga, dem Organisator zahlloser internationaler Oware-Turniere, international renommiert f√ºr seine Studien √ºber Mancala in der Dominikanischen Republik. Ich glaube kaum, dass er es sch√§tzen w√ºrde, mit jemand anderem verwechselt zu werden. V√≠ktor und ich sind Mitglied eines Mancala-Forums bei Yahoo!, welches von Paul Smith, dem st√§rksten britischen Oware-Meister 2001 gegr√ºndet wurde. In diesem Forum habe ich 55Stones und auch Afrika erstmals ver√∂ffentlicht. V√≠ktor hat dann, ohne mich zu fragen, diese Beitr√§ge genommen und in die WikiManqala gestellt. Er hat es also f√ºr "relevant" gehalten. Im √ºbrigen bin ich erst durch ihn auf die Wikipedia gesto√üen. --Mr. Mancala 10:57, 14. M√§r 2006 (CET)</dd>

<dd>Just a quick note: I am the author who added 55 Stones to it.wiki, based on information taken from the <a href="http://www.manqala.org/wiki/index.php/MancalaGames/55Stones" class="external text" title="http://www.manqala.org/wiki/index.php/MancalaGames/55Stones" rel="nofollow">Manqala.org wiki</a>. I am usually against <i>deleting</i> from wikipedias, and the game (if you are interested in mancala theory or classification) <i>looks</i> interesting; on the other hand, I would agree that the looks are against its right to be on wikipedias, as it seemingly exists *per* wikipedias alone. I'll think about it for the italian version. Meanwhile, being a mancala lover, I have copied the rules from manqala.org in case the game suddendly disappears from everywhere as a result of it being "fake". Thanks to the anonymous who pointed me to this discussion. -- Moongateclimber (@it.wiki)</dd>

<p>An unreferenced dict-def which freely admits the term is itself a neologism. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, Wikipedia should strive to <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">avoid self-reference</a>, which is what this article is; the word appears almost exclusively in Wikipedia pages and mirrors, with very little use indeed outside this. What is on the Wiktionary page is sufficient, and this stub has no reason to be. In short, self reference + unverifiable + neologism = <b>delete</b>. For the purposes of full disclosure, I'd tagged this article earlier today with prod, this was then supported with a prod2, but subsequently the prod tags were removed. No complaints about this, but I do feel this article is misplaced, however, and so bringing it for discussion on AfD is probably the best way to decide this. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">Proto</font></span></span></a><font color="#555555"><b>||</b></font><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">type</font></span></span></a></small> 16:21, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>We generally avoid unadulterated cross-namespace redirects, especially those emerging from article space, since it is unnecessary and makes life harder for those who reuse our content to know which articlespace pages they should/not include.

<p>I don't see how this violates the policy. Ballasy is well known on his campus and in the state of Jersey and his shows are all over the internet and he has his own official web site.

<p>The source is listed at the bottom of the article, which is www.calyr.org. The Calyr religion is an actual religion practiced for the past 4 years by members in the US and Canada. The website calyr.org serves as their online reference. I can understand why members of other religions may be upset at the addition, but I believe that deleting this article entirely would cause legal problems with discrimination, since many other religions, even obscure ones, are referenced on wikipedia. However, if you can think of how it could be edited to standardize it for wikipedia, I am open to suggestion.&#160;:) --70.162.19.183 17:18, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind comments. I will take your advice to heart and check out the other pages. Thanks again. Freedomelf</p>
<p>I wanted to add one more thing, if I may, before I close. I'm afraid that my fellow Calyr and I were quite clueless as to google hits, etc. for a web site. We had been working on putting our books of faith on the web for months, but had not gotten it finished until this week. The site was only actually published day before yesterday, and we had a party to celebrate with all of our members (except the one who lives in Canada). One of our members suggested putting an entry in wikipedia and I volunteered to do so for the group. I realize now that we were much too hasty, and should have built up a web presence. I am very grateful for your instruction, Isotope and Starblind. I hope that as we grow in knowledge, we will be able to resubmit the entry at a future date, if it is taken down now. In the meantime, I think I will study other entries on the site to gain some experience. Thanks again and good night. - -Freedomelf 06:46, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - But rewrite as historical device rather than feasible relevant technology.
<ul>
<li>As an engineer (and a Tufts Alum &lt;g&gt;), I read the article carefully, and purused the Talk as well. I certainly don't see much about credible scientific studies supporting the claim that it actually does pass intellegence directly into the brain (presumably by electromagnetic induction acting upon electrical charges involved in neuron discharge). However, that mechanism (i.e. affecting brain currents) is certainly concievable as CAT/NMRI scan technologies have some similarities, and it is accepted knowledge (shrug) that cell phones, walkie-talkies, etc. (and other EMI fields) do cause some brain damage given LONG TERM and EXCESSIVE use by adverse effects on said current flow, so I surmise that the technology is premature, may just be in it's infant stage (Like semiconductors back in 1910-1920 period‚Äî&#160; No one could figure out what to do with them yet. We all own thousands of transistors these days!) But bottom line, the device was given a patent in modern times. That's notable enough to deserve space as an historical article. Lastly, I remember the term back from when I was but a wee Lad. Perhaps the article should be modeled more on <a href="../../../p/h/r/Phrenology.html" title="Phrenology">phrenology</a>, i.e. a theory about the device.</li>

<p>Non Existant genre. After researching, only 3 of the bands on the list actually exist. The genre directly copies the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrash_Metal_163e.html" title="Thrash Metal">Thrash Metal</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grindcore.html" title="Grindcore">Grindcore</a> articles, except for picking and choosing aspects to remove from each, something like a childs game of Mix And Match.

<li><b>KEEP</b> per nom. A poorly made article, but not completely wrong. But this genre is not often referred to as "Noise metal", usually either being called Noisecore or just lumping it in with Noise music. It is a new, emerging genre which doesn't have many bands. The creator does seem to toot the mastodon horn quite a bit in this article, but thats because mastodon is a band plently of people have heard of. After searching for the mentioned bands I found that most of these bands DO exist, they are just very obscure and underground. "real" bands that creator mentioned: Mastodon, Sielwolf, Anal Pope, Pterodactyls, Alchemy/Manifest, Humanzee, Plastic Dragon, Amentia, Halaka, and Faizan Qamar are ALL real bands. as for the others, I am not sure. look through MySpace, and <a href="http://www.dmusic.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.dmusic.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dmusic.com/</a>. You will find the bands i have mentioned above. It is wrong to delete</li>
</ul>
<p>Information that is correct, if not well known!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Leave</b> It should be noted that most bands of this type are Inde bands, that don't hold many elements of genres with noise and Rock/metal as the two main genres.</li>

<p>The connection between Commonwealth of Nations and Banknotes is too remote to justify an article. If we need a list of banknote-issuing institutions, why not have a world one?

<li><b>Redirect</b> to Christian Metal. The term Unblack Metal is used by Black Metal fans to insult Christian Metal bands.

<li>I Disagree. In the many sources that have been cited here, 'Unblack' is used as a term that refers to bands with a Black metal musical style except that their lyrics are against Satanism. Articles such as <a href="../../../u/n/-/Un-American_0423.html" title="Un-American">Un-American</a> exist but they don't necessary mean 'anything that isnt American' but 'anything that is against America'.--‚Äì <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESampi_ffb9.html" title="User:Sampi">sampi</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESampi_4230.html" title="User talk:Sampi"><font color="blue" size="1">talk</font></a>‚Ä¢<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sampi_db87.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sampi"><font color="red" size="1">contrib</font></a>‚Ä¢<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Sampi_78bc.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Sampi"><font color="green" size="1">email</font></a>) 22:20, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Sampi, as much as i respect yew, im also against many sites about Christian Metal. Ive found several that have stated that bands such as Mortiis, Behemoth and Burzum are Christian Black Metal, and ones that have claimed that 'Goth Metal' is another name for Christian Metal bands that wear black. Ive also only ever known the term to be used as 'non black metal bands'. But thats just me. I still vote delete and redirect to Christian Metal, however. Oh, and Sampi, please check your talk page, i posted something there that needs immediate attention. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Ley Shade</a> 22:48, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Podcasting is not a mature field and there is extreme difficulty in trying to ascertain what's notable and what's not in the field. The metrics for measuring such a thing simply aren't there, and since podcasting is something that can be done by anyone with a copy of Audacity and a fast net connection there is a presumption that most podcasts simply don't reach a reasonable bar of notability. Based on what I found on Google and Yahoo, I honestly couldn't decide whether it was a keep or not, so I more or less abstained. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 04:18, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> . It's notable enough to have been mentioned in Newtype magazine, and has been linked by both Scott Ramsoomair of VG Cats and R. K. Milholland of Something Positive following their interviews on the show - only three examples of mention off the top of my head, but still. The article is intended to be informative, and could for example prove useful to someone trying to find out about the show after having listened to an episode and finding themselves confused on a point, though it could use a bit of a cleanup. Just my opinion on the matter, however. 72.67.19.75 17:42, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I'd think that the mentions of the show on well-known <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webcomics.html" title="Webcomics">webcomics</a> sites and their invitation to do a show at a major <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_convention.html" title="Anime convention">anime convention</a> would put them over the bar. However, it's true that it's tough to make these sorts of decisions with the sorts of metrics these days. They do link to some metrics off of their site (e.g. maps derived from numbers and locations of recent visitors), but I'm not an expert in that, so I'm not entirely sure how reliable they are. Since it's entirely possible for a podcast to have a significant listenership without a very active web presence, like any other radio show, doesn't that argue that we should be lenient in deciding exactly how popular a given podcast is, until more reliable, public metrics exist? As a side note: I do agree that it could use some cleanup and perhaps not all of the material on the page is suitable for Wikipedia. Teki D 18:33, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

That isn't exactly a large fanbase. The Frappr map has been mentioned on the show at least once. No Alexa rating and a low number of google hits(most of which seem to be podcast directories) also. This isn't about popularity though so none of that matters much. kotepho 23:33, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Otaku Generation would definatly qualify as notable, not simply for its production quality but its recognision by other notables and established institusions, such as New Type USA. The show has run uninterupted scince it's inception and continues to draw new listeners increasing it's noteriety with every passing week. To contest that Otaku Generation is not notable would be akin to dismissing the original Hitchicker's Guide to the Galaxy as being 'just another radio novel' While OG has yet to achive the mamouth proportions of HHGTTG it's fan base is ever expanding, making a virtual guarantee of it's place in the internet lore.

In addition the entry is also helpful for many a newcomer that has heard the Otaku Generation podcast for the first time because it helps them to understand the many in jokes that are rampant throughout. Such as the infamous flaming duckhole or Tuesday nights. Or my personal favorite the Kyle Dragonash song by Apocalypse Dowell. Saggy Z</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I'll admit that the current article for Otaku Generation could due with some "spring cleaning" but I think it's a decent start at a page which covers the show. The initial deletion request seems to have been made due to the supposed "non-notability" of the Otaku Generation website. Internet culture and media do not always have a high cross-over rate with print culture and media so the fact that the show was mentioned in Newtype USA is already a good first step showing its popularity. The <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> notability guidelines referrenced relate to websites only and although Otaku Generation has a web presense, the Otaku Generation wiki article is primarily in reference to the show itself and not the website www.OtakuGeneration.net. If the Otaku Generation article were to be deleted for non-notability it must first be shown to be non-notable as an entertainment broadcast. I'm using the term "entertainment broadcast" to encompass any audio or video media regardless of delivery method be it internet, over the air broadcast, satelite, cable, or local public access. Not all podcasts will be as popular as <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_week_in_tech.html" title="This week in tech">This Week in Tech</a> or <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocketboom.html" title="Rocketboom">Rocketboom</a> but that does not mean they are undeserving of a wikipedia article outlining the show. As long as Otaku Generation continues to produce shows on a consistant basis and has an evergrowing viewership, I see no reason that their article should be deleted. In looking over the wiki article standards, I do feel that the article for the show should be re-arranged/edited. It should focus more on the cast of the show, the history of the show, and how the show is produced as opposed to being primarily a list of in-jokes and nicknames. In-jokes are good for helping new listeners understand what the cast is referrencing in various segments of the show. The nicknames portion of the article isn't as informative since the bulk of nicknamed listeners are only mentioned when their nickname is created -- with the exception of frequent "callers" such as Johny Two-Times, Kitty, Jefferson, and Mega. ojenkins 2:13, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Articles must prove their notability, not the other way around. Just existing is certainly not a good determination of whether an article is warranted on a podcast or not. I urge you to reread <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> as it specifically mentions podcasts twice. <i>Web content includes, but is not limited to, web comics, <b>podcasts</b>, blogs, message boards, online magazines and other media, web portals and web hosts. Any content which is distributed solely on the internet is considered, for the purposes of this guideline, as web content.[1]</i> How exactly do you think that it does not apply?

<dd>Thank you Kotepho for the constructive correction. I went back and reread <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and saw the mention about podcasts. After rereading the notability article I have come up with what I believe validates the show Otaku Generation as notable web content. Criteria 1b of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> states that <i>The content itself has been the subject of non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself. This criterion includes reliable published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations.</i> I would propose that Otaku Generation meets this requirement due to it's [<a href="http://mondays.pwop.com/default.aspx?showID=42" class="external text" title="http://mondays.pwop.com/default.aspx?showID=42" rel="nofollow">October 24, 2005 appearance</a>] on [<a href="http://mondays.pwop.com/" class="external text" title="http://mondays.pwop.com/" rel="nofollow">Mondays</a>], the sister-show of .Net Rocks produced by PWOP Productions. PWOP Productions already holds an important place in the world of podcasting by being the [<a href="http://www.podcastingnews.com/archives/2005/02/new_podcast_pro.html/" class="external text" title="http://www.podcastingnews.com/archives/2005/02/new_podcast_pro.html/" rel="nofollow">first official podcast production company</a>] with high profile clients such as Microsoft. I have been unable to find any stats for the Mondays podcast, but .NET Rocks -- produced and staring the same cast of people -- has a [<a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/stats.aspx" class="external text" title="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/stats.aspx" rel="nofollow">subscription base of around 500,000</a>]. Given that Otaku Generation was an active guest for the bulk of the October 24, 2005 Mondays show, I believe that the Otaku Generation show has therefore <i>been the subject of non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.</i> ojenkins 15:38, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>At this point in the discussion I think I'm more curious as to how this circle of validation, notability and reliability works without any sort of system to begin the first levels of the validation chain. Even the Wiki's reliable source guidelines you mentioned earlier state that <i>Wikipedia itself does not currently meet the reliability guidelines</i>. Generally trust is gained through government, a person/entity of authority, positive personal interactions, or "having a good feeling about something." Those who are trusted then grant trust to others. As far as I can tell, the Wiki's trust model is more based on the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_of_trust.html" title="Web of trust">decentralized trust model</a> with those who have exhibited longevity and good decision making being more trustworthy than new users or the "sockpuppets" that Ifnord mentioned below. How, if at all, does this trust model factor in those who are new but knowledgable of the subject matter vs those who have longevity but are not as well versed in the field. Take this scenario: Person A is a mechanic who has been working on cars for thirty years. Person B is an electrical engineer who has just finished their master's degree in DC power distribution. Person A and Person B both work at a repair company doing fixes and diagnostics on vehicles. A driver brings in a hybrid gas-electric car that has been suffering from horsepower problems when in electric mode. Who would be more suited to decide the final course of action. The mechanic who has plenty of experience with traditional gas-powered cars, or the eletrical engineer who has plenty of experience with power distribution systems? Each person is good at what they do but the one who has the most longevity may not be the one with the best perspective on the situation. As I mentioned before I'm interested in how the trust and reliabilty model for the wiki system handles this sort of thing. If you think the resultant discussion would clutter this page, feel free to contact me directly to continue so that I can get a better idea of policy. ojenkins 14:18, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It really is not about trust and is not about longevity either. New users and anonymous users are normally discounted in the 'vote' (AFD is not a vote, we try to build <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> as <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolls_are_evil_b7b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Polls are evil">polls are evil</a>) portion but they certainly have a voice. This is out of necessity and somewhat common sense. However, none of the comments have been deleted thus they all still have a voice. No one is going to discount verifiable evidence just because of the source, although they might scruntinize it more. We need to disenfranchise those that are new as they are likely to be invested in the article unduely, they are not always aware of policy, and the ease with which anyone can flood an AFD with <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meatpuppet.html" title="Meatpuppet">meat</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppets.html" title="Sockpuppets">sockpuppets</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Yes, it's Jefferson here. While I'm sure that my opinion can be more or less discounted due to my status as an oblique participant in the show, I'd like to throw in my support for this entry. No attempt is being made to advertise this podcast's presence on the web and I find this to be a very resourceful font of information to introduce any new listener to the show. Even the professional quality of the podcast itself merits a notable mention as it goes beyond just the typical nature of most others that mostly consist of "one guy and his microphone". Granted, the podcast contains mostly niche topics (and in-jokes, but then even radio broadcasts have them) and the main discussion is limited to a particular genre of fandom, but it is a very popular and fast growing segment of fandom. If all podcasts were this good, I'd probably never stop listening to my mp3 player. JeffersonLeeEng 14:53, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Even if there are as many as three delete opinions and the keep opinions are from those you think should be discounted anyway, then surely the notability factor is a moot point anyway.

<dd>Even if consensus is unclear, the call for deletion is going to continue to rankle a large amount of the fanbase especially those that appreciated the time and effort put into such a page as this. It seems to be clear the opinions of those that seem to be pro-deletion are not going to be swayed by influential mentions in a widely available periodical publication that is Newtype USA and another more or less high profile review site in the form of Ain't It Cool News (AICN). So, what recourse is there for those against this decision for deletion if and when the inevitable does happen? Obviously, you seem to be making this to be a losing battle for the others that want to keep the article and as such, I want to play the Devil's Advocate on my part to understand more fully what moral I should from learn from this endeavour? Somewhere, there has to be a loophole... --JeffersonLeeEng 02:28, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Frankly, it isn't our problem if OG's fanbase is offended by the deletion of this article. There are many, many articles that have been deleted that raised the ire of their fanbases. Since that obviously would not be a constructive way to decide whether a topic is worthy of an article, guidelines were set forth by our community (like <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. If you have evidence that it does meet those criteria I would be glad to see it. Even if I were to qualify the Newtype USA mention as non-trivial that is not 'multiple'. The same goes for the Ain't It Cool News mention; it is the epitome of trivial--even if it were non-trivial, it is not from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. <span class="user-sig user-Kotepho"><i>‚Äîkotepho <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_21.html" title="March 21">03-21</a> 10:44Z</small></i></span></dd>
<dd>I just want to echo what kotepho said with all due respect. There are hundreds of articles that have been deleted and in the process fans of the subjects of these articles have been angered or offended. That is not a strong argument for including a subject in Wikipedia. It is nothing personal against your podcast, it is just the fact that you have not, in my opinion, demonstrated that Otaku generation meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> (per kotepho above). As a good faith gesture I've recommended keeping this discussion open and relisting it to allow further opinions from Wikipedia users to be gathered. If Otaku generation's article does get deleted at the end of this process and you are looking at a moral to learn from this endevor I think I can provide one for you... or at least a suggestion. If your goal is to get a Wikipedia article, read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and work towards meeting that criteria, rather than looking for a loophole. I would suggest that you go out and shamelessly promote Otaku generation on messageboards, blogs, etc. Try and get some major web and print publications to do a writeup on your podcast. Get your fanbase to do some viral marketing... submit stories on digg.com etc. Is your podcast listed on iTunes? You've gotten 2 small cites by external sources so far... but you need to get more substantial citations and greater number.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Otaku Generation has been featured in Newtype magazine. I realize that many people in this thread are new Wikipedians, but why should we be discounted? Just because of Ballot stuffing that has happened in the past on other articles doesn't mean that thier opinion should be discounted. Also, I may add that Otaku Generation is listed on iTunes, Odeo and many other podcast directories. Would these not qualify as a brodcast medium?? Also, I think it would serve the internet in general better to have ONE Online Encyclopedia for everything...Wikipedia is already this for many. Since MediaWiki is open source, I have seen many deletions create new Wiki's. Maybe that's more appropriate. I personaly don't think so.Gorkon 13:59, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I've turned it into the beginnings of an actual article.

<ul>
<li>Never mind. I found the actual folk festival article (I must have had the wrong capitalization when I tried before). It's actually a redirect to List of music festivals. So, I'll vote <b>Delete</b> on this "Folk Fest" article, per the nom. ‚Äî<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrantNeufeld_99cc.html" title="User:GrantNeufeld">GrantNeufeld</a> 04:03, 15 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If folk festival is just a redirect to List of music festivals, I'd suggest that maybe folk festival should be its own article, with Folk Fest redirecting there. Alternatively, Folk Fest could also be redirected to the same title that folk festival redirects to. Either way, I think <b>redirect</b> would be a better idea than deletion at this point. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:51, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
