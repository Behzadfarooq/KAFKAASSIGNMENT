<p>Every MMORPG have different jobs, graphics, quests, that is cannot be compared. KaiFei 15:39, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree, some aspects cannot be compared, but some can. Some arbitrary parameters of interest were selected and the result was this article.

This article has been speedied once then reposted. It was tagged for speedy once again on the grounds that it does not assert notability. It does ("sold 300 jillion [sic] albums worldwide, generated hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars of concert revenues" for example) so I prod tagged it with the following concern<br />
<b>Nonexistent "band". No confirmation of any of the albums, band members, producers, etc, on allmusic or elsewhere. This is a hoax from start to finish</b><br />
The author has contested the prod with the following comment on my talkpage:
<blockquote>
<p>While this page has been deleted before, it is NOT a hoax. This is a comedy trio from Chicago's Second City. The page in question is the back story of the characters created by the three. There is verifiable proof/evidence the group exists toward the bottom labeled "The Weathermen Tapes". It is a direct link to a few of the groups comedy clips. They also have a Myspace account at www.myspace.com/the_weathermen I assure you it is not a hoax and it is not fake. I hope this straightens things out. Having to repost is a bitch</p>
</blockquote>
I remain unconvinced. None of these alleged "created characters" seem to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, unless I'm looking in all the wrong places. The link is to a youtube site. If it is indeed a fictional creation à la <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinal_Tap_%28band%29_1c20.html" title="Spinal Tap (band)">Spinal Tap</a> then the article does not appear to state this anywhere at all.

<li><b>Skeptical</b> It looks elaborate, but seems suspect. I'd ask the author to give us some better referecne material.

<li><b>Extremely strong delete and salt unless the author demonstrates verifiable notability.</b> The article's author writes "it is NOT a hoax," the entire article is a fictional history of a comedy group- thus, it <i>is</i> a hoax. If an article can be written from a true (as opposed to fictional) perspective asserting notability as judged by reliable sources, then by all means, write it.

He's published by a real (non-vanity) press. He's a young author with several published books to his credit. I see no basis at all for deletion.

<li><b>Definite keep</b> - has books from a large commercial publisher. Rightly or wrongly, we count an author as notable if he or she has even a single book that has sold 5000 copies.

<dd>This is an article about an <i>author</i> not about a <i>book</i> - obviously we have to be tougher about what individual books get articles. If you are saying that the policy on authors has tightened up recently without my becoming aware of it, that's a different matter. I'm relying on my memory of what it used to be, so I'm happy to be corrected if something has changed. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 03:19, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Interesting. I've now checked: the policy always used to say: "Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more." That wording seems to have been deleted recently, and replaced by ""Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work." I can't quickly see what the circumstances were. This is surprising because such a change could render <i>a lot of people</i> with articles retrospectively non-notable. I don't necessarily disagree with the change, actually, despite that. Oh well ... Multiple independent reviews is not that much harder - any book published by HarperCollins will almost certainly meet it. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 03:29, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - it's not really a neologism per se (I'm familiar with the concept) but is not encyclopaedic. Low google hits would simply point to it being a trade-specific term rather than one in general use. It belongs in a trade or university textbook, or <i>maybe</i> on Wiktionary once independent verifiable sources emerge.

<li>This is an emerging subject that bridges the well known area of ROI - from economics; and information security - from computer science. Hence the terms ROSI and ROISI which attempt to define methodologies that are tailored to the Information Security domain. Given that Information security deals with intangibles such methodologies are useful for the information security practitioner. I am the author of the papers cited in this article.

<p>I believe the topic of the article is not sufficiently notable to have its own article. The lack of notability also means no one has taken the theory seriously enough to criticize it, resulting in a very unbalanced presentation of the theory. I have looked into doing research on each aspect of the theory and citing sources presenting opposing viewpoints, but am afraid applying such citations to this novel theory in a piecemeal way would be OR. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/y/r/User_talk%7ELyrl_8f39.html" title="User talk:Lyrl">Talk</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lyrl_0a73.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lyrl">Contribs</a></sub> 03:11, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

This discourse is actually highly contested.

<li><s><b>Provisory Delete</b></s> The two cited main contributions to the theory (Knight 1991) and (Power/Watts 1997) get ~40 and 3 cites on ISI, respectively.

<dd>I don't know if I would be this skeptical about the number of citations. I mean for the humanities or human sciences such as anthropology you will find a much smaller number of articles than for scientific fields, and considering how obscure this topic is, I don't think that 40 cites is that low. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">TSO1D</a> 04:15, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well anthropology may be a modest field in size (but certainly not as small as I dunno, Anglo-Saxon, Norse &amp; Celtic studies, say), but within that field, the question of the origins/construction of culture/society in relation to understanding human drives and functions (such as menstruation) is the central theme <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:22, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But look at the impact factor for anthropology journals: <a href="http://www.in-cites.com/research/2005/november_7_2005-1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.in-cites.com/research/2005/november_7_2005-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.in-cites.com/research/2005/november_7_2005-1.html</a>. Even the 3 citations for one of the papers is above the average, and 40 citations is certainly more than the average, even for something like Nature or Science and that says a lot. So I actually think the number of citations should be taken as proof of the importance of the papers on this topic rather than the opposite. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">TSO1D</a> 04:33, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In the general criteria, this article does not at all meet #4-8. The first three criteria it <i>might</i> meet, but I think unlikely:
<ul>
<li>#1 "generally accepted scientific knowledge" - I'm not familiar enough with the relevant field to tell for sure. But from my familiarity with fertility and the menstrual cycle, their theory seems biologically implausible. From <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a>'s reaction, above, I would tend to think that people more familiar with this field also do not find it to have been "generally accepted".</li>
<li>#2 is kind of vague, requiring "a number" of peer-reviewed papers, but I can only find two possibilities in the article's reference list ("The human symbolic revolution: A Darwinian account" in Cambridge Archaeological Journal, and "The woman with the zebra's penis. Gender, mutability and performance" in Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute.) All their other publications appear to <i>not</i> be peer-reviewed. I don't believe two papers qualifies as "a number".</li>
<li>#3 - supported by major scientific institutions. There is one issue of an <a href="http://www.metaformia.org/articles.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.metaformia.org/articles.cfm" rel="nofollow">online journal</a> published by the <a href="http://www.newcollege.edu/" class="external text" title="http://www.newcollege.edu/" rel="nofollow">New College of California</a> supposedly related to this theory, though most of the articles actually appear to have only tangentially related topics. I have not previously heard of the New College of California, and don't believe it is a major scientific institution.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>In the theories criteria, this article does not at all meet #1 or #3-5.
<ul>
<li>As for #2 ("widely cited in its research area relative to other publications in the same area"), the debate above is not one I feel qualified to participate in. I'm not convinced, however, that possibly meeting this one criterion means it has sufficient notability to be its own article.</li>

<li>It's tough to decide when a scientific theory itself is notable enough for an encyclopedia entry. this answer is going make it obvious that I'm in law school, but here it goes. I think any <i><a href="../../../f/r/y/Frye_Standard_66e4.html" title="Frye Standard">Frye</a></i>-type general acceptance standard would be too stringent. Instead I'd prefer something closer to the <a href="../../../d/a/u/Daubert_standard.html" title="Daubert standard"><i>Daubert</i> standard</a>. Of course, here we are not judging the reliability expert witnesses but evaluating the notability of a scientific notion. Nonetheless, some of the same criteria that are used to evaluate reliability are illuminating for notability: is the theory peer reviewed?, is it <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falsifiable.html" title="Falsifiable">falsifiable</a>?, is it testable?, is it generally accepted?, etc. This theory is obviously not generally accepted. Only two proven peer reviewed articles for the whole theory does not indicate, absent any additional indicia, that the theory is sufficiently reliable or notable in the scientific community to warrant an encyclopedia article at this time. Thus, <b>Delete.</b>-- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanntm_9b62.html" title="User:Danntm">danntm</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanntm_6305.html" title="User talk:Danntm">T</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danntm_aafb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danntm">C</a></sub> 06:10, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The tone of this article is now heavily influenced by hostile editing. The fact that the theory is published in reputable journals and a reputable book publishers (e.g. Yale U.P, Edinburgh U. P.) might not make it 'generally accepted', but it does indicate that the content of the theory clears the threshold of academic respectibility. As various 'Keep' proponents have suggested above, being a minor theory does not necessarily qualify it for merger or deletion. Merger with articles which are in no way focused on the origins of human culture (which is the specific focus of this article) makes no academic sense and deprives readers of a coherent theory on the subject. Right from the start, this article has been threatened with merger or deletion, and - significantly - none of the critics seem to be professional anthropologists. Much of the criticism is vague and unsubstatiated ('non notable to my eyes' etc.), and, in my view, suffers from the very symptom it accuses the article of: point of view. A little more neutrality and democracy would be appreciated. Who exactly is harmed by this being a separate article? Why so hostile? I cannot but think that this is a more or less personal vendetta by a few editors, and has nothing at all to do with the science in this article.86.132.127.124 18:02, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> (Rm duplicate) I would like to remind readers of the 'abuse of the deletion policy' comments on this website: Abuse of deletion process</li>
</ul>
<p>The deletion processes all focus on whether an article meets the criteria for existence on Wikipedia; that is, they are to determine whether it is not original research, its central information is verifiable, and it is capable of achieving a neutral point of view with good editorship. XfD (deletion) processes are not a way to complain or remove material that is personally disliked, whose perspective is against ones beliefs, or which is not yet presented neutrally. Using XfD as a "protest strategy" in an editorial or Neutral Point of View (NPOV) debate is generally an abuse of process and the article will usually be speedy kept. Many of the comments above fall, I believe, into this category. The article is clearly NOT original research (it is published); the information contained in this article is heavily referenced; there is reference to the theory in other publications (e.g. Watts, I. 2005. ‘Time, too, grows on the Moon’: Some evidence for Knight’s theory of a human universal. In W. James &amp; D. Mills (eds), The Qualities of Time: Anthropological Approaches. New York: Berg, pp. 95-118.); and the style is capable of being made more neutral. On this basis, I propose to remove the deletion tag and engage with the content of this article, instead of threatening deletion.86.132.127.124 18:16, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>I agree with the anonymous .124, and add that in the social sciences such as cultural anthropology, the distinction between notable theories and those that are not is not quite as marked as in the natural sciences. It depends a good deal on how other subsequently make use of it. Since the concept has found its way into mainstream literature, that's as much as we need. If the article needs improvement, improve it. It sometimes seems that we resort to Afd in order to get improvements made, which is not exactly the intent. It should get deleted only if they can be demonstrated to be be improvable enought to meet our standards.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 09:06, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>The originator of the theory published a book. Later, years after the book, he and his two partners seem to have published two peer-reviewed papers, amoung other (non-peer reviewed) publications. No one other than these three people seems to have worked on the theory.</dd>
<dd>Others have commented that the book publisher (<a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_Press_15d0.html" title="Yale University Press">Yale University Press</a>) is highly regarded. Not being familiar with them, does that mean that all 3,000 books in print from YUP are notable enough to deserve a Wikipedia article?</dd>
<dd>My main concern is that it is <i>not possible</i> to present this theory as a stand-alone article in an NPOV way, because there is no criticism of it. If someone could find a critique of this theory, or explain to me that piecemealing together other people's comments that contradict specific bits of this theory into a critique is somehow not OR#SYNTHESIS, then I would happily withdraw my nomination. ] <sup><a href="../../../l/y/r/User_talk%7ELyrl_8f39.html" title="User talk:Lyrl">Talk</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lyrl_0a73.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lyrl">C</a></sub> 13:41, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Like <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> I feel uncomfortable with "academic colonisation". Feelings, however, are not what I use here. Here I support deletion because there is clear COI from at least one editor ( <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAPBOX_345c.html" title="WP:SOAPBOX">WP:SOAPBOX</a> ). In addition, I have in mind the various comments of Jimbo Wales on original research. The <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> guidelines seem to me to be slightly biased towards the physical sciences ( dealing with perpetual motion machines and so on ), so in areas which are at best "soft" sciences I think we have to tread with a little extra care. In the soft disciplines people can advance all sorts of ideas in journals, and have them discussed, without these ideas forming part of the mainstream, or even a significant part of the broader dialectic. It seems to me, on the basis of reading the article and some googling, that the case for counting this idea as one sufficiently significant to have its own article has not been made coherently enough. For now I suggest the a brief paragraph be added to the article on <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbolic_Culture_69c1.html" title="Symbolic Culture">Symbolic Culture</a> noting this topic, but that we delete this article. In addition I'd like to encourage the authors of this article to expand the <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbolic_Culture_69c1.html" title="Symbolic Culture">Symbolic Culture</a> article, if they can resist theory-pushing, with more general information on this subject. Finally, as an entirely personal comment: I found at least six logical flaws and lacunae whilst reading the article before I stopped counting, which doesn't inspire much confidence in the subject of the article as a whole. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 15:55, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Oh, I almost forgot: per <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> I also suggest slightly more in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concealed_Ovulation_2965.html" title="Concealed Ovulation">Concealed Ovulation</a> than the current single sentence - not a whole paragraph more, just a couple more sentences on the main points. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 15:59, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Given that there are only slightly fewer 'Keep' than 'Delete' votes, can someone please explain how a decision is ultimately arrived at? The fact that this is clearly not a clear-cut case suggests that at the very least that there are genuine differences of view which cannot simply be settled by carrying on this kind of dialogue at infinitum. I therefore suggest that this article should be kept, that the content should be improved where it merits improvement, and that as the encyclopedia content for cultural anthropology grows the situation is reassessed in the future. (Merger with Symbolic Culture is a future possibility, but that article is currently a stub, and merger should only be considered when it actually improves the content). The main problem with 'merger' or reducing the article to a paragraph is that the theory itself is then all but lost. With regard to the point raised above about Yale Univ. Press, I can only surmise that the comment was made by someone who has no clue about social science publishing. Yale, Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Oxord, Cambridge and Chicago university presses are among the most respected English language academic publishers whose content is rigorously peer reviewed. While this clearly does not mean that all their publications merit inclusion in Wikipedia as articles, it does mean that this article is not some kind of crackpot theory that should be deleted just because attempts to find references to it on Google failed. A reference to the theory in the literature was given above. Can we make a decision and concentrate on improving the content rather than spending all this time on debating deletion?<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinklopstock_385e.html" title="User:Martinklopstock">Martinklopstock</a> 17:59, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Martin, perhaps the first thing to understand is that this is not a "vote". Although most of us tend to express an opinion in AfD discussions, what we are looking for is some kind of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> on what should be done about an article, working as closely as possible within the guidelines we use to decide what constitutes a suitable article for Wikipedia. You can understand why this article has been nominated for deletion by looking at the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">guide to deletion</a>. It's very clear from the article's "talk" page that <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> ( the person who nominated this article for deletion ) has tried to engage you and the other major contributors to the article over the past several months, to get the article up to what he would feel is encyclopedic standard, and I can certainly understand why he has eventually, and presumably with some reluctance, decided to put the article up for deletion. ( Although I haven't checked with <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a>, most people hate nominating articles for deletion after they've spent a while trying to get them improved, as deletion means all their work has been in vain. ) Nominating the article for deletion is not an attack on you, and in general it's useful to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> on the part of editors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, there's the question of "the facts". I'm here "assuming good faith", because I don't have access to the offline references cited in the article, but I'm quite prepared to take the existence of suitable academic references to this theory on trust. I'm sure that the theory has been written up in a paper in an academic journal, and cited in a few other papers. Are the references there&#160;? Yes, I trust you when you say they are. As I noted earlier, it seems to me to be a poorly reasoned and logically weak theory, but that's because I'm from the hard sciences, and we don't expect the same kind of rigorous thinking in the softer disciplines. A similarly presented theory in physics or chemistry would not be treated seriously, but that isn't the point here. There are plenty of other articles about weakly reasoned theories in Wikipedia, ( Freudianism and astrology, for example ), but we keep them.</dd>
<dd>So, that the theory exists is true, and its logical quality is of no relevance. So why are we having this discussion&#160;? Because we also need to establish a couple of other things: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a>, and absence of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>. In this case it seems to me that the two things are closely inter-linked.</dd>
<dd>A notable theory is one that is widely discussed and cited in its field. Now, Chris Knight's theory is certainly discussed, but what worries me is the people who are discussing it. In particular, the two main people who have worked on this theory other than Knight were both PhD students of his, who would have had a clear vested interest in supporting their supervisor's work. The other people who seem to mention Knight and this theory are very often linked to something called the "Radical Anthropology Group" ( <a href="http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/class_lecturers.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/class_lecturers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/class_lecturers.htm</a> ), which seems to be largely run by Chris Knight himself, or share its fairly overt political stance. So whilst the theory may be, in some sense, "notable", it seems to be notable only in a kind of "walled garden" in which people are mostly talking to themselves. You can now see why I think there's a kind of conflict of interest going on: much of the google-hittage about this article ( once we ignore the mirrors of Wikipedia ) seems to have some kind of personal connection to the theory's originator. If you check my contributions to Wikipedia you'll see that I spend a lot of time looking at deletion debates: one thing that we see a lot is people putting in articles about themselves to somehow try to make themselves seem more significant, for a whole variety of reasons. As it stands, this article gives me that feeling: it gives the impression of trying to "big up" a particular theory, which is why I think it should go, at least for the moment. What would make me change my mind is this: a couple of good solid references to academic articles taking this theory seriously, not written by people close to Knight and his colleagues. Ideally, they should link this theory into broader currents in anthropological thinking, and show why this theory is different from, and should be taken more seriously than, any of the dozens of other theories that emerge from the minds of academics every day. If this theory is notable, it will be widely debated, not simply taken on board by its originator's students. So far, despite the efforts of <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a>, <a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_already_forgot_0fa6.html" title="User:I already forgot">I already forgot</a> and others, it hasn't been shown clearly enough that this is the case.</dd>

<p>I think judgments based on personal impressions about what theories are important are irrelevant. On the other hand, I think judgements based on discussions such as you've just given are OR. It is not our role to give our impressions of whether a topic is important, nor is it our role to evaluate the true scientific significance. It is our role to judge whether the evidence supplied about notability is sufficient. Numbers help--and 40 cites for a book in the social sciences in ISI is way above the average. Just check some other books. There is a certain tendency in these debates to be particularly strict aboutthe more recondite academic topics, or about topics that seem unusual. These sort of topics is what an encyclopedia is for--especially WP. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 02:12, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>DGG: I think you may have posted this comment in the wrong place, but if it is directed at me, here is a response:
<dl>
<dd>(1) I'm certainly not saying that "menstruation isn't worth much coverage in WP". A careful reading of my comments will reveal that I don't use the word once, and, so far as I can tell, haven't referenced it implicitly - I've tried to keep to the topic of this debate, which is a theory about possible cultural phenomena arising from or related to menstruation, and not about menstruation per se.</dd>
<dd>(2) I agree that my personal impression of the theory is irrelevant, and explicitly say so ( "its logical quality is of no relevance" ). I have in the past participated in many deletion debates in which I have supported retention of an article despite poor logical content. I believe I understand the general principles applicable in this and other cases.</dd>
<dd>(3) So far as I can tell, I haven't done any OR in making my posting, I've simply stated my opinion. I have been careful to "own" my comments by using phrases like "I think" and "my feeling".</dd>
<dd>(4) I've tried to express clearly why I feel it would be better to delete this article, at least for now. To repeat and paraphrase a bit: my worry is that when I try to find evidence of a broad discussion of this theory I always end up with the same small circle of people. I believe a notable theory is one that is broadly debated or understood in its discipline, and at present I see no evidence to support this contention. I explicitly state what I feel would help ( "a couple of good solid references to academic articles taking this theory seriously, not written by people close to Knight and his colleagues" ). The problem is that despite the efforts of several people to improve this article over the past few months, there is still no evidence that this is anything more than an idea circulating among a small group, and that's why I think it's on balance not suitable for inclusion here.</dd>
<dd>I hope this is clear and helpful. If not, please get in touch with me.

<li><b><s>Strong</s> delete</b> The CNN report (Reuters story) mentions him in passing, he's not remotely the primary subject of that article, and it's even hard to say that the article itself is nontrivial (it's just a couple paragraphs about the video game). If six instances of the same Reuters story is multiple independent works, then JK Rowling is the author of hundreds of different books (by counting separately all the UK, US, hardcover, paperback editions, etc. of the Harry Potter series, to say nothing of the foreign translations. The criterion is <i>independent of each other</i> which means they can't all stem from the same origin). Subject is also not the primary subject of the Gamasutra article either: that article is about several different games, and he gets some mention the section about the game that he worked on. George Lucas is similarly not the primary subject of an article about the Star Wars movie that mentions him, but he <i>is</i> the primary subject of something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0822596849/" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0822596849/" rel="nofollow">this</a>.<br />
Wikipedia is not a publicity agency, we are not here to plug anybody's games, this biography subject absolutely fails to meet the consensus-developed WP:BIO guideline based on the documentation presented, and people should stop looking for ways to to pretend that he is. Either come up with better documentation per WP:BIO or justify a departure from the guideline on some reasonable grounds. Otherwise delete. <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.117.130.181.html" title="User:67.117.130.181">67.117.130.181</a> 14:57, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps I'm just not looking at it in the correct light, but if seperate news agencies/publications choose to run the same article, doesn't that still make the subject noteworthy? Talk radio, for example, frequently uses AP wires as a base for the stories they air, does that the coverage (for example) of a forrest fire originally covered by one agency mean that other agency coverage doesn't exist? Or does an organization such as CNN have to take the time to re-write the Reuters article for it to count as coverage? JN322 15:34, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>According to WP guidelines, since all of these (including CNN) are reprints of the same Reuters article, they are considered one source. However, this is all irrelavent since there are additional, totally unrelated sources that easily push this subject over the minimum bar. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/r/User_talk%7ETarinth_bf5d.html" title="User talk:Tarinth">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tarinth_d0cd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tarinth">contribs</a>) 16:44, 31 December 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<dd><i>All of these criteria are in fact simply special cases of the general primary criterion of multiple non-trivial published works from independent sources. A person who is "part of the enduring historical record" will have been written about, in depth, independently in multiple history books on that field, by historians. A politician who has received "significant press coverage" has been written about, in depth, independently in multiple news feature articles, by journalists. An actor who has been featured in magazines has been written about, in depth, independently in multiple magazine feature articles, by magazine article writers. An actor or TV personality who has "an independent biography" has been written about, in depth, in a book, by an independent biographer.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In short we're looking for enough published documentation to support a real biography. There is no <i>depth</i> in the biographical coverage of those articles.<br />
Looking at WP:BIO again though, I can see a case for the Gamasutra and Reuters' pieces counting as multiple reviews of an author's work (I had remembered a requirement that the author have multiple published works that had been reviewed, but either it's changed or I was confused. It does seem lame to me that someone writing one published/reviewed book results in two WP articles (one about the book and another about the author)). I'll back off on "strong delete" to just normal delete. I'll confess to still being in reaction mode over the against-consensus "keep" closing of this article's first AfD. <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.117.130.181.html" title="User:67.117.130.181">67.117.130.181</a> 17:14, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The Gamasutra article spends 3 out of 5 pages either discussing his work, as well as an interview with him. If the article had ended at that point, we'd still consider it to be a good source; the fact that it continues on to some other subjects does not detract from it. And I don't regard the Reuters coverage non-trivial. As for comparisons of J. K. Rowling or George Lucas, I'm not sure what point you are making with that. The fact that they are notable does not mean that other individuals needs to reach their level of notoriety to be considered for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> sets a relatively low bar for notability, one which the individual described in this article easily reaches. If you think <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> should be a lot more stringent so that you have to be Lucas or Rowling to get included, that's not a debate for this AfD discussion. Of the 1.5M articles on Wikipedia, surely this one is more notable than most? Isn't there a better way we can spend our time? <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 16:41, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The point of JK Rowling is we don't count multiple editions of the same novel as multiple works, and we don't count multiple publications of the same Reuters' article as multiple works. The point of mentioning that book about Lucas is that he's the primary subject and it says so right in the title. If you show either the Reuters or Gamasutra piece to someone and then ask them what the piece is about, they won't say "it's about someone named Dave Gilbert", so Dave Gilbert is not the primary subject of those pieces. And spending 3 of 5 pages discussing Dave Gilbert's <i>work</i> is not the same as spending those pages discussing <i>Dave Gilbert</i>. We already have a separate article about his work--why do we need 2 articles? If really are additional, totally unrelated sources as you say, then great, let's see the cites (and no, that web forum discussion linked from the article does <i>not</i> count). As for why this matters, see <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2006-September/010610.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2006-September/010610.html" rel="nofollow">this email</a> about the amount of publicity seekers trying to wiggle their way into Wikipedia and <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> for why having external influences warp our article selection isn't good. We already have enough unavoidable bias from our editors' demographics, we should definitely resist more bias resulting from people with financial incentives to get documented here. <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.117.130.181.html" title="User:67.117.130.181">67.117.130.181</a> 17:14, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Refer to my point above: the inventor/creator of a notable work is essentially indistinguishable from the work itself. Just as we have articles on musicians who are primarily known only for having created a notable song, or entries for videogame <i>companies</i> that are effectively unknown aside from their notable games--I don't see any difference here. As for bias or an individual's desire (or lack thereof) in being listed, again, that's a discussion regarding overall policy that really has nothing to do with this specific case. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 17:30, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If the inventor/creator of a notable work is essentially indistinguishable from the work itself, then we should not have separate articles about the work and the creator. I'd be ok with inserting a biographical paragraph about Dave Gilbert into the article about his computer game. It just boggles my mind that <i>one</i> Reuters article is supposed to generate <i>two</i> Wikipedia articles (and therefore two separate sets of extlinks generating pagerank: ka-ching!). I don't know how you get this concept of indistinguishability though. If someone seriously told me I was indistinguishable from my works, I'd be pretty annoyed.<br />
Yes, the same thing happens all the time with musician articles and I don't like that either. We have ridiculously weak coverage of the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelmshaven_mutiny.html" title="Wilhelmshaven mutiny">Wilhelmshaven mutiny</a>, a genuinely important historical topic, while we fill the encylopedia with music-industry marketing junk. I usually just roll my eyes and keep quiet by now. As mentioned above, I made an exception for this afd because of the bad closure of the first one. <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.117.130.181.html" title="User:67.117.130.181">67.117.130.181</a> 17:41, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That part only says we're spending our time on the wrong things. Why we should not have so much marketing is explained at WP:NOT, WP:COI, the Brad Patrick letter I linked to, and elsewhere. Any article topic whose notability results from somebody's marketing efforts (whether on-wiki or off) and whose inclusion in Wikipedia is likely to result in someone selling more of some product (video game, music CD's, or whatever) should be assessed with rigor and skepticism and held to a high standard. Wikipedia is not a shopping guide. <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.117.130.181.html" title="User:67.117.130.181">67.117.130.181</a> 19:41, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't see what difference being PPV or straight to DVD makes, what's notable is the content of the show, in context of the history of the company, storylines, title changes, debuts, departures etc. Obviously regarding Ring of Honor, these events are considered more notable than regular 'house shows', because they are the only type of show the company promotes and also exist as DVD releases. If cards like <i>Showdown at Shea</i>, all the <i>Clash of the Champions</i>, <i>Royal Rumble '88</i> and all the ECW non-PPV cards, none of which were PPV, and in some cases weren't released on home video and/or televised, are worthy of pages, then so are the ROH cards. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustjoe4life_7e10.html" title="User:Justjoe4life">JustJoe4Life</a> 17:35, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Comparing these to other articles is a strawman argument. It does not make these any more notable, and if the other articles aren't notable they may well be deleted as well. <i>Clash of the Champions</i> were live TV specials, Showdown at Shea was a huge stadium show in the days before PPV attended by over 35,000 people, how many people attended the Ring of Honor shows? Having checked through the Wiki pro wrestling project, several ECW shows (including ones released on home video) have been deleted, so there is a clear precedent. If you believe the articles to be notable, please improve them. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 23:40, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep the Lot</b> First of all, <i>The Era of Honor Begins</i> was a live recording in certain area's. Lots of people have brought that one just for the match of Super Crazy v Eddy Guerrero! They are all on DVDs, are for sale on RoH's main website. This is wrestling history. If this was a library and these where books. You would be book burning! The way I see it, if you delete all of these you might as well do the same for WWE and TNA's. So you wont be doing that to them. So I say keep them. <a href="../../../g/o/v/User%7EGovvy_b92c.html" title="User:Govvy">Govvy</a> 11:19, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>ROH is still just an indy fed, and these are just indy shows. Being released on DVD doesn't make that much of a difference. Also, the comment that "lots" of people bought a DVD just for that one match is unsourced and a weasel statement. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 02:24, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Only "The Era of Honor Begins" was shown live as far as I know. It was on WGTW TV 48 first in Philadelphia 2002. Other shows where aired on the same channel. This obviously was shown in the UK and US on TV! As well as being on DVD. These arn't just DVDs they are shows on TV! You consider them a small promotion, maybe yes, but you have stars who have performed here. Eddie, Super Crazy, Paul London, Brian Kendrick, Full Blooded Italians, Samoa Joe, That fallen Angel Guy even got Mick Foley in the lata eps. This is all history to me, this is evidence of where they where, what they where doing. Awards they earned in Ring of Honor. Remove these and all those belts suddenly mean nothing. Remove these and then all other Ring of Honor pages become less, remove these and you're taking away half of what is Ring of Honor. Removing these is removing wrestling history and I don't like lost history. If you remove these you leave the same question for everyone! "Ye I know he was in Ring of Honor, but what did he do?" So in final, Don't remove this history. These in my view shouldn't of even been considered for deleting. <b>Keep Please</b> <a href="../../../g/o/v/User%7EGovvy_b92c.html" title="User:Govvy">Govvy</a> 10:54, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Can you provide ANY proof that have been on TV? I haven't heard anything about it, at most it might be in some local markets. Also, many WWE wrestlers compete in indy feds (which ROH is, it's not a major promotion yet). Just saying you lke ROH is not a reason to keep an article, especill events that were only on DVD (not TV). On ROH's own website they admit they don't have a TV deal (with a discussion about would they be willing to give up TNA wrestlers if it meant getting a TV deal for ROH). <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 02:39, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> ROH did have a Philadelphia area TV show in 2002, called High Impact TV. However it was never shown live, and was an hour long show. The debut show DVD release is approximately 3 hours long, and factoring in intermissions and suchlike, it's reasonable to say the whole show would have lasted somewhere in the vicinity of 4 hours. A TV station would not give a brand new independent promotion running their first show 4 hours of live coverage on a Saturday night. If Govvy can prove otherwise, please do so. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 03:32, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That doesn't really help his case of keeping it though.

<li>Not sure what's the problem with a blog entry from Wired. It's not a blog entry from an unknown source. About Digg, the point is that it has been Dugg and has been given attention and no longer an unknown site. About Music 2.0, it's the fact they creators added WikiMusicGuide to the list. WikiMusicGuide editors can edit the content if they want and not under the same restrictions as Wikipedia. eHub is a very popular tech blog site. And what about the TechDigest and Glide magazine mentions? I still see we have enough references. About COI, yes, I am an editor of WikiMusicGuide as well. However, I did not create or edit the WikiMusicGuide page. I'm here point out that the site meets your guidelines.

<li>That "it has been Dugg" does not mean that the source meets <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. As you'll see at <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, sources with editorial oversight and recognition by other reliable sources are far preferrable.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I began this article and would like to chime in as to why it was begun and why it is so important. A year ago I was performing research into some history of telephone systems. Once I discovered the Bell System Technical Journals' existence, I scoured both the internet and libraries searching for a listing of articles and papers included in the Journal over the years. None was to be found without seeking out a major technical library, and not even usually then. I contacted the San Francisco Public Library and the had the collection, but could not produce an index of the articles or subjects contained within. I could request papers, but could not discover which papers to request! I contacted several other major libraries and discovered that the University of California at Berkeley had the collection in the stacks of their engineering library. However, they also did not have an index available without being physically on-site. I journeyed to the Cal engineering library and an idea came that perhaps an index of the papers would be useful to those performing research. I realize that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, but as such it is also a reference system and a listing of other reference materials can be extraordinarily useful. Additionally, there is no other method, short of physical presence, of obtaining something as simple as a list of journal paper titles from any location on the internet. Google Scholar, contrary to others assertions, does NOT have this information available in any manner. Additionally, listing the titles of journal papers from a publication would not constitute a copyright violation, or all library systems would be inherently in violation of the law. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJory_49f7.html" title="User:Jory">Jory</a> 20:07, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

However, you will notice that a vast majority of Google Scholar hits in regards to BSTJ papers are citations, rather than the papers themselves.

However, I can understand the concerns of those discussion the deletion proposal. I am happy to provide a website where the journal papers are indexed if no other public location is available. I had just felt that this information was of vital importance to the research community and was unsuitably unavailable. It should also be noted that since beginning this article on WP, 68 additional journal paper titles were added by WP users other than myself. I provided the initial 386 paper titles. So it is clear that there is some desire from users for this information to be available, whether it be here or someplace else.. ~ <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJory_49f7.html" title="User:Jory">Jory</a> 04:26, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>Response to <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaiken_deb8.html" title="User:Chaiken">Alison Chaiken</a></i> - It's not the same thing. Citations may help you discover previously-referenced papers, but will not help in identifying a paper that has not been previously cited, but is still useful to new research. My idea was to provide the titles of these papers so researchers could locate papers they were seeking and then be able to request the appropriate volumes from libraries that store the collection in off-site storage. I agree that citing some oft-used articles in the main BSTJ article would enhance that article, but it wouldn't provide additional reference for those seeking more information. I am guessing you have never perused the BSTJ itself, as I hadn't prior to December 2005. It is an amazing wealth of discovery and knowledge that is still very pertinent to current research, but is nearly forgotten, except where already cited. This tome of information contains not only the history of technology used for telephone systems, but also the initial understanding of sound perception (Fletcher &amp; Munson's research into hearing), the initial discussion of how to refer to amplitude (a 1931 paper essentially creating the decibel), the development history behind the UNIX operating system, the creation of the transistor, and much much more. Just the number of actual papers available in the 5-year period I previously mentioned should illustrate how inadequate Google Scholar's contents are. 47 citations out of a possible 386 papers. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJory_49f7.html" title="User:Jory">Jory</a> 05:32, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Many of these were before 2000, and GS coverage is very weak before that. And it is unsystematic in any case--just look at the reviews cited of the GS page in WP. The question is how to deal with this material, because WP is not really a scientific indexing service--and if we included them all the page would be somewhat large and unwieldy. But we do in practice justify many of our articles on the grounds that there is no systematic coverage elsewhere--and this has been the case since the start.</li>

<dd>However, I think it highly likely that they are all indexed in the standard engineering indexes, which are available in major libraries. I think Jory's index is a much better way of handling this, and the list should be whittled down a good deal and kept. I think that including highlights from a journal is a good use of WP, but I am not sure whether they should simply go at the bottom of the article on the journal. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 09:17, 2 January 2007 (UTC).

<li><i>Reply to <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></i> - Yes, the papers are all available via an engineering index, but that index itself must be physically accessed in order to discover any information. I have only found that index available at the UC Berkeley Engineering Library, but again, one must actually visit the library and locate the printed index for it to be of any use. No online index of any form exists, other than that which I have begun.

<li><b>Keep &amp; provide sources</b> I think that the Kennedy/Goldwater connection lends some ironic notability. Coupled with his other exploits this seems to creep into notability. There is one source given (poorly formatted) which is credible and non-trivial (per Wiki standards).

<li>According to the article, Kennedy and Goldwater were associated with the Jay Six Ranch, not to Speiden personally. They might make the ranch notable enough for an article but that doesn't necessarily make Jack Speiden notable (and, interestingly, whoever created the Speiden article has not gotten around to writing an article about the ranch).

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> Generally I would say delete most blogs - but with 116,000 Google hits, including several newspaper articles, this seems one of the more infulential blogs. Source, reference and verifiability for a blog is surely the blog itself? The only issue is notabilty and I'd say it has that.

<li><b>Comment</b> If you are familiar with some newspaper references, then if you add them that should easily mollify those calling for deletion.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Neither existence, nor a moderate readership, nor moderate googlehittage, is an indicator of notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> as per Anjouli. I too am not particularly fond of the blog in question but it has been written about in newspapers and if that's one of the basis of notability here then you have to live with it, RWR8189. Personally I don't think it should be a litmus test since newspapers aren't blog directories either (and they do a crap job of keeping their articles online, thus many blogs have to archive those mentions on their own blogs), but if you don't like it, then we should create new tests for determining blog notability. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelPlaya_f9ad.html" title="User:DelPlaya">DelPlaya</a> 10:37, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Redundant; wholesale replication of material from <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspect_ratio_%28image%29.html" title="Aspect ratio (image)">aspect ratio (image)</a>. Most likely stems from original editor's discontent with his reverted edits; see <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspect_ratio_%28image%29.html" title="Aspect ratio (image)">aspect ratio (image)</a> history for further reference.

<p>This is short zombie/music film made by low notability rock band <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_International_Playboys_2ed5.html" title="The International Playboys">The International Playboys</a>. As well as being the stars of the film, The International Playboys are also listed as the 'distributors'. Despite the claim of an 'international premiere' in <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabul.html" title="Kabul">Kabul</a>, I have been unable to find any evidence that this film has ever graced the silver screen. It is listed on IMDB, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478804/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478804/" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, but this is not a cast-iron indicator of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>.</p>
<p>The article itself is <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">unsourced</a> (and probably unsourceable), and reads like a first-hand account. <strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas"><font color="blue">Nydas</font></a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> 10:05, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Conditional delete</b>, I think the movie <i>would</i> be notable <i>enough</i> if the band itself is notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia, just as their albums would be, but the need for <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> is non-negotiable.

<li><b>Keep</b> Since the last nominations the story of Matt Harding's video has been the topic of several newspaper articles (La times, wash post, guardian). This meets the threshold for notability- that tag should be removed. If the travel editors of those newspapers found this story to be of interest to their readership I think this should be left up for wikipedia readers. Sidestepping the philosophical issues about whether having this entry will feed egos (see comments in afd1) there should be a central depot at wikipedia where people can find information on this story. Better to err on the side of providing more information than less.Sourcesleuth 11:19, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Speedy delete</b>. Poorly written (no prose) article with terrible inaccuracies and totally unverified:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is just a list if "Kurdish Kingdoms" with no intro, explanation, description of why are these Kurdish kingdoms. And to which historical period do they refer?</li>
<li>There are no sources or citations verifying that these are indeed Kurdish kingdoms.</li>
<li>Of the 20 unsourced "Kurdish Kingdoms" that are mentioned, only 5 of them have blue links. All the other 15 are unverifiable (because of the lack of sources) red links. So, 75% of the article is red and unverified - while the rest 25% is only unverified!</li>
<li>Let's see the 5 blue links: <a href="../../../l/u/l/Lullubi.html" title="Lullubi">Lullubi</a> links to an ancient tribe (not kingdom). In Lullubi's article there is no reference that this tribe is at least Kurdish or linked to the Kurds. <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manna.html" title="Manna">Manna</a> links to the Biblical food "manna"! No Kurdish kingdom here of course! Let's continue our effort to save the article! <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mardi.html" title="Mardi">Mardi</a> links to Herman Melville's third book (1849)!! My amazement flares up! Where are these Kurdish kingdoms?! But I continue: it is <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mittani.html" title="Mittani">Mittani</a>'s turn now. I learn that this was a <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurrian.html" title="Hurrian">Hurrian</a> kingdom in northern Mesopotamia from ca. 1500 BC. Nothing about Kurds in this article and in <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurrians.html" title="Hurrians">Hurrians</a> as well. My hopes are not yet dead. I still have one more link: <a href="../../../n/a/i/Nairi.html" title="Nairi">Nairi</a>. But I go to a disambiguation page! Does the editor want me to go to <a href="../../../n/a/i/Nairi_people.html" title="Nairi people">Nairi people</a>? But in this article I learn about this nation's links with the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenians.html" title="Armenians">Armenians</a> and nothing about the Kurds!</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up: This is a terrible, completely uncyclopedic article.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 15:32, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I agree, the article seems OR and has little content. Even most of the blue links don't redirect to an actual kingdom, but to disambig pages or even a random novel. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">TSO1D</a> 16:04, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral/Comment</b> May be notable enough, though needs more sources. Also, I have a real problem with using the 'Google-Test' for subjects that aren't going to be prominent in English language publications. Google may be a decent means of gauging notability for bands, people and such that are English speaking but when dealing with politicians and such from non-English speaking countries this simply is not the case. A lot of these countries don't utilize the internet nearly as much as English-speaking countries and such topics aren't going to be well represented on-line though this does not indicate a lack of notability. Also, the above statement that if he is notable he'll be in English publications sounds, and I don't mean any offense, rather arrogant and a symptom of Wikipedia's systemic bias as it indicates that if something is written about a lot on English websites then it is automatically non-notable which is simply ridiculous. The vast majority of the world's population is NOT English speaking. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 21:33, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We are talking about <i>Greece</i> here - internet use is as prevalent there as it would be anywhere, I'd imagine. Greece is not a third world country, pal! My point is that there are lots of English language Greek newspapers etc throughout the world and in Greece itself and the net doesn't produce a single article from any of them mentioning this guy - I think that says something about his notability, personally. And it certainly means we can't very easily improve the article with reliable sources - because there aren't any. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 21:37, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I never insinuated that Greek was a developing country, I am perfectly aware of it's status in the international community. No need to be hostile towards me. I am simply saying that we can't hold individuals who are not English speakers to the same exact standards given to native English speakers. Someone who may be notable in Greece isn't exactly likely to get proper attention in major English publications like the Washington Post, New York Times or The Economist, for example. Now, I do recognize that there are English papers in Greece and a source from those would be nice though I'd be perfectly receptive to a few sources written in Greek, though we should require more than one or two when using sources written in other languages. If you'll notice, I did not vote for keeping the article and actually am leaning towards a delete as nothing is provided in Greek either. My point was simply that a google search is NOT a valid reason for deletion, even when dealing with topics that are English in origin. This is standard policy. Google may be used as a secondary reason for deletion, but not as a primary reason. If valid sources can be provided separate from Google then we should keep the article, if not then we should delete it. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 21:57, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Regarding this statement <i>If he was notable enough for an article on English Wikipedia, he would have been mentioned at least a</i> few times <i>by English language publications</i>, there is no such thing as "notable in Greek but not notable in English". Also <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>: "Notability is not subjective". He's either notable or he's not, period, notability being primarily determined by multiple instances of non-trivial coverage. I'm not qualified to judge non-trivial coverage since I read absolutely no Greek, but the Google hits on his name look like passing mentions (based on the fact that his name appears only about halfway down in the articles, instead of in one of the lead sentences), which would make me lean towards a delete vote. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 02:26, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>After several weeks, I believe that this article has amounted nothing more than to <a href="../../../f/a/n/WP%7EFAN_8957.html" title="WP:FAN">fancruft</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">original research</a>, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">an in-universe plot</a>, and - furthermore - too many unknowns. Being a HL2 player and contributor myself, I find this article to be an embarrassing attempt at defining a non-notable event.

<p>This seems very much like a fan page and gives biased information , one sided information and irrelevant information. Most of the information on this page is wrong. NOT doom metal , NOT heavy metal. Who say's The Swords music is original? Who say's Nebula are stoner rock icons? This is not supposed to be an ad for video games. What gear they use is irrelevant. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHuseregrav_d1a7.html" title="User:Huseregrav">Huseregrav</a> (<a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHuseregrav_c0f8.html" title="User talk:Huseregrav">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Huseregrav_5279.html" title="Special:Contributions/Huseregrav">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— <a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHuseregrav_d1a7.html" title="User:Huseregrav">Huseregrav</a> (<a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHuseregrav_c0f8.html" title="User talk:Huseregrav">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Huseregrav_5279.html" title="Special:Contributions/Huseregrav">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<li>Well I removed and modified some of the content in the Wiki page. I left the genres alone due to sources I have found in Rockdetector and Metal Archives (now offline). I also don't find gear they use irrelevent to the group; but what was mentioned was just unescessary. <a href="../../../a/k/n/User%7EAKnot_a568.html" title="User:AKnot">AKnot</a> 02:52, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Maybe you are correct about the touring (unless a biography is made). But look at some Wiki pages (like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfmother_%28album%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfmother_%28album%29" rel="nofollow">Wolfmother album</a> for example) they have information on their video game contributions, specifically from that album. Those notes before I believe weren't really intened to advertise but to release some extra information and to let people (who are unfamiliar with the game[s]) what were their contributions. <a href="../../../a/k/n/User%7EAKnot_a568.html" title="User:AKnot">AKnot</a> 03:33, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I deleted the prod. I'm not the original author in disguise, but I also made a significant number of changes unmentioned by AAgtbdfoua before removing it. I made no comments only b/c (like many) I'm new to editing Wikipedia and have limited time and access to someone else's computer while on vacation to sit around registering, learning all the protocols, and otherwise trying to learn what amounts to a new language for a non-techie. (So much for a truly "democratic" knowledge base.) In any case, I just made some additional edits, adding external links to non-Stanford-"associated" publications discussing SLE, clearly demonstrating that the topic is NOTABLE. (Furthurmore, AAgtbdfoua's apparent definition of "independent of the subject" leaves much to be desired. Just because a journal or magazine is "associated" with a university "associated" with the topic, doesn't mean that the sources are not independent. We're not talking about a Microsoft newsletter about Windows.) I also added a paragraph about SLE's beginnings containing an internal link to the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hannah_Arendt_0a8a.html" title="Hannah Arendt">Hannah Arendt</a> wiki, which already mentions her involvement with SLE &amp; contains an internal link to the SLE wiki. Furthurmore, SLE is much more than just a course at Stanford. It is a veritable and long-standing part of Stanford tradition/culture (and there is an entire wiki category on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Stanford_culture" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Stanford_culture" rel="nofollow">Stanford Culture</a> alone), as well as a well-known, highly unique, innovative, and somewhat controversial program that has served as a model for other such programs worldwide (see external links). I have also added internal links to the independent wikis on <a href="../../../d/i/r/Directed_Studies_at_Yale_University_b43e.html" title="Directed Studies at Yale University">Directed Studies</a> at Yale and the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Core_Curriculum_5bea.html" title="Core Curriculum">Core Curriculum</a> at Columbia, which are comparable. There are tons of other less significant things on Wikipedia to delete if Aagtbdfoua is hell-bent on deleting things. More writing; less deleting.</li>

<li>The subject exists, it can be substantiated with numerous games in this area. Arguing over what to call it is a subject that has nothing to do with deletion, but the closest comparison would be the recent discussion on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ghost_ramp_%28second_nomination%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ghost_ramp_%28second_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ghost_ramp_%28second_nomination%29</a> where there was widespread agreement that the subject of the article existed, but there was a lot of disagreement on the particular wording of the article's title--ultimately resolving in calling them "Unused highway" as a vague and generic term.

<dd>Notability is a somewhat more slippery concept than verifiability. In any case, I don't know how it is notable, just like I don't know if it is verifiable. That's why I put the {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tags all over the article; to prompt people to supply the citations which will allow me to verify. I suspect that if they do that, they will also show that it is notable. Or not.

<li><b>Comment:</b> It is indeed self-evident that it exists. So is my existence, but there's no Jobjörn Folkesson. The question is, is it notable? And verifiable? <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 19:20, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Verifiability should be a no-brainer given the large number of computer game magazine articles that we should be able to come up with, and notability is merely a reflection of such articles existance. I'd say give the article time to improve, and if there's no useful sources in a few months we could revisit this. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 19:46, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Right. Find ONE article published in a reputable computer game magazine and I'll change my mind.

<li>This article isn't about a neologism, it is simply a generic term for a reasonably obvious category of videogame that has existed for about as long as computers have existed. While the thing to call this category might be up for debate, the content itself and fact of its existance isn't. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 19:46, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Yes. Clearly the article can be improved (see <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balance_of_Power_5e19.html" title="Balance of Power">Balance of Power</a>, an 80's game, as I mentioned above; and we can find earlier examples amongst Mainframe-based games). I have no doubt that the category may have originally been created by someone who wanted to promote their own less-notable titles, but it's a real category. When the Sword of AfDocles isn't hanging over the article anymore I'll see about bringing those subjects in, or just make a new and better article if it does get deleted. But I think it should just stay for now. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 21:02, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Additional findings: here are a couple more articles on the genre:</li>
</ul>
<p>This article uses the term "international relations simulations" <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-0027%28198706%2931%3A2%3C333%3AAEOT%22O%3E2.0.CO%3B2-5&amp;size=LARGE" class="external free" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-0027%28198706%2931%3A2%3C333%3AAEOT%22O%3E2.0.CO%3B2-5&amp;size=LARGE" rel="nofollow">http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-0027%28198706%2931%3A2%3C333%3AAEOT%22O%3E2.0.CO%3B2-5&amp;size=LARGE</a></p>
<p>IGN called "Balance of Power" a "Cold War simulation" <a href="http://pc.ign.com/articles/090/090970p1.html" class="external free" title="http://pc.ign.com/articles/090/090970p1.html" rel="nofollow">http://pc.ign.com/articles/090/090970p1.html</a></p>
<p>I know I'm using this one particular game a bunch, because it is probably one of the earliest (and most notable) within the genre, but I don't think it will be hard to expand it with further examples once the article is given an opportunity to grow. Here's another more recent example that has gotten a number of reviews: "Democracy", a political simulation: <a href="http://jaguarusf.blogspot.com/2005/12/democracy-review.html" class="external free" title="http://jaguarusf.blogspot.com/2005/12/democracy-review.html" rel="nofollow">http://jaguarusf.blogspot.com/2005/12/democracy-review.html</a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The article needs work, but there's plenty of reliable sources that talk about this type of game. Even though they don't use the term, I've found articles from the San Fracisco Chronicle and New York Times that talk about them (but if this is a neologism debate, I suppose that's irrelevant). If you want (admittedly less reliable) sources that use the term "political sim", you can look to IGN (<a href="http://xbox.ign.com/articles/083/083729p1.html" class="external free" title="http://xbox.ign.com/articles/083/083729p1.html" rel="nofollow">http://xbox.ign.com/articles/083/083729p1.html</a>).

<p>(One of the most politely contested PRODs I've run across) This appears to be a made-up celebration that's been observed exactly once.

Only there's the happening/nerd rights march/star wars queue or whatever in Spain but the phrase used to describe this is <i><a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%ADa_del_orgullo_friki" class="external text" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%ADa_del_orgullo_friki" rel="nofollow">Día del orgullo friki</a></i> which translates as "<i><b>Geek</b> Pride Day</i>". A <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geek.html" title="Geek">geek</a> is <i>not</i> the same as a nerd. And a Spanish <i><a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friki" class="external text" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friki" rel="nofollow">Friki</a></i> may be similar to a US geek but not exactly (do US geeks lie prone on moving walkways?), especially as they've seem to derived their word from freak, which means something else in the US. I wonder how they translate <i><a href="../../../f/r/e/Freaks_and_Geeks_8dc2.html" title="Freaks and Geeks">Freaks and Geeks</a></i>? Oh, and don't move this to Geek Pride Day unless there's far more references than a few news reports plus evidence this is not a regular event/ongoing movement. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 19:21, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I agree that all things are made up one day. Moreover, if you take some time to read the official web page you will see that the event will surely be celebrated again in 2007. If an event is created, even if it only happens once, I think it's wikipedia's mission to collect all information about it, just in case someone should ever need this information again. I will also admit the change to Geek Pride Day, if that translation seems to be more accurate. Dear RHaworth, I think that this English Wikipedia has broader looks that English-speaking countries (don't we live at an English-speaking world?) And dear Bwith, try typing "Día del orgullo friki" in google and (surprise!) you'll find <a href="http://www.google.es/search?hl=es&amp;q=%22D%C3%ADa+del+orgullo+friki%22&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.es/search?hl=es&amp;q=%22D%C3%ADa+del+orgullo+friki%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">109.000 entries!</a> Truly irrelevant, isn't it?

<li><b>KEEP</b>. I am strongly opposed to the idea of deleting or heavily censoring this new entry. I testify that the nerd pride day is completely true and there are a lot of witnesses who would testify for the defence of keeping the item if necessary. Why don't we patiently wait for the highly controversial date in 2007 to check that the information given is as plain as the nose on your face? Don't forget: nerds have also rights!

<li><b>Keep</b> Fair Ground is an active group formed by two very popular and influential Canadian musicians. Though they may be passively mentioned in each members' respective articles, there's no reason to limit it to that, as the numerous followers of both Pete Lesperance and Mike Turner would be glad to have more detailed information about Fair Ground itself.--Axtech 04:43, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>non notable crash survivor; a tragedy, but I don't think this boy became notable just by living a short while after the crash. Prod removed (see talk page.) <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 18:31, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Evidently I disagree with Brian: surviving such a crash, even for a short time, makes for notability. Certainly I would expect anyone else who survived such a crash, especially if the only one, to become notable. <a href="../../../r/i/n/User%7ERingbark_23e5.html" title="User:Ringbark">Ringbark</a> 18:56, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> What's notable isn't our subjective opinion of what seems "important," but whether the subject of the article was considered notable by other sources. The source included in the article appears credible and verifiable. In addition, I'm concerned that deleting this article smacks of recentism--if this was a more current event, we could easily produce a lot of newspaper sources for something like this. It seems to be on the order of common-sense that there would have been additional newspaper articles on the subject dating to the time of the event; so given that there's already one solid source for it, I'd say leave it as-is and perhaps add additional sources when they can be found. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 19:01, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What is all this HATE against Miltos Manetas and Neen? These people are valuable artists, they make exhibitions all over the World and they create remarkable concepts.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to keep the Articles about them at the Wikipedia. I am not experienced, I just started my account today because I noticed that the Neen Article disappeared and I was using it for my University Thesis (I study Art in Italy) . Would you please explain me how to contest you decision to delete the articles?</p>

<p><i>If the individual is more well known and more published than an average college professor (based on the U.S. practice of calling all full-time academics professors), they can and should be included.</i> This argument fails straight away, since I can't name one single US college professor. I find <i>fails WP:BIO</i> to be a rather silly POV statement - who says it fails it?</p>
<p>There are 1.6 million articles on wikipedia and I tend to think one factual article with sources to back it up is not worth deleting. Let's not forget the player didn't just appear on the game show, he won 15 shows in a row and was champion and champion of champions of the show. I just don't see in what way this is not a genuine article. <a href="../../../m/g/l/User%7EMglovesfun_36a7.html" title="User:Mglovesfun">Mglovesfun</a> 23:24, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Second citation: <i>Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable, including college sports in the United States.</i></p>
<p>This article seems to fit directly into this category. So it passes WP:BIO with flying colours. <a href="../../../m/g/l/User%7EMglovesfun_36a7.html" title="User:Mglovesfun">Mglovesfun</a> 23:27, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I can see why this was nominated. I've read the article and I still don't have a clue who he is or what sport he plays. I have never in my life heard of a sport called "countdown". What country is he from? Where does he live? The article is completely, totally senseless. It's well-written but it's as if I would have to have some massive amount of pre-knowledge of the subject in order to figure out who he is.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, now I see in the <i>category listing</i> that he was a contestant in a British game show. Could it have hurt to <i>say that</i> in the article? 99% of the readers of Wikipedia won't know what Countdown is or where it's from. It isn't shown outside the UK as far as I know, and I'm guessing 2/3 of the UK population don't pay attention to TV game shows (well, if they're anything like Canadians, it would be more than that). This article needs to be rewritten so that it at least says who he is, where he is from, and how being a Countdown champion is notable. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 23:50, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> First shopping mall in a major city - Chatanooga. Interesting article as it stands - I enjoyed reading it, and I'm in Australia. As for the criteria, none of these are particularly applicable - Wikipedia is an encyclopedia which includes a numerous amount of articles on shopping malls (including many this size), I can't see this content (which includes interesting information about its history) fitting in any directory (but can in an encyclopedia), and if the problem was referencing, why was this never tagged as unreferenced (thus giving people time to actually check offline (non-Google) sources, such as books about the city's history) before being nominated for deletion? <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 21:44, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>A town directory or a directory of shopping malls. The reason <i>is</i> sensible. Has this been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial coverage in reliable sources? Mere existence is not sufficient, after all. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:15, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A town directory or a directory of shopping malls might mention this place, but this article would in no way fit in either of them, so that's still bunk. It has a decent claim to notability to begin with (first in a major city), and if this actually was about referencing, why was it nominated for deletion less than 24 hours after being tagged as unreferenced? There has been absolutely no time for anyone to check references apart from those on Google, such as books about the history of Chatanooga (where this would likely make an appearance). <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 22:21, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It was not given an unreferenced tag during that time, so it would have been very easy for it to slip by unnoticed. Five days is ample time if the sources are on Google, or somewhere else online. It is <i>not</i> if they're offline, since this would either mean finding in Tennessee willing to do so, or finding someone with access to an excellent library collection in the States (something of the equivalent of the National Library here in Australia). I do not have this access. So please don't pretend that sources don't exist - I've already pointed out that it's fairly likely that books on Chatanooga history would have information on the city's first mall - rather, it's just that you're not giving anyone time to actually get hold of those resources. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 23:22, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> No sources on Factiva, either, apparently. If no sources exist, there is no way to expand this article; since "the mall is presently (as of 2006) almost completely vacant," I presume no new non-trivial sources are likely to be generated. This leaves the possibility of offline sources, as mentioned; therefore, delete without prejudice against recreation when and if such sources are found. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 19:55, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What is with this bias against offline sources? For something like this, Google and Factiva are lousy means of finding useful material. I've pointed out that there is a good prospect that offline sources could be found by anyone with the right resources - what is the benefit in killing the article before giving anyone a chance to fix it, rather than leaving the unreferenced tag on for a couple of months and giving someone who can the right opportunity to do so? <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 04:38, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No bias at all. Offline sources are great. Produce them, and then there's a basis for the article. Keeping an unsourced article around for months on the chance that "someone" might have an offline source and be inclined to edit the article? Um... no, thanks. That hypothetical editor could just as easily use that hypothetical source to write a new article, however many months in the future he or she should get around to doing so. And if he feels the old article would be useful, there's always DRV -- I imagine it'd be easy to get undeleted, since the concern is sources and he'd be producing them. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 00:15, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> The article is <i>not</i> spam, as the language is not promotional and there is absolutely no evidence of any commercial intent in its posting. It is also a potentially interesting stub on a shopping centre which appears as if it could make for a useful topic.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Your argument with Richard Sinclair appears to be that the article should be kept based on the fact that he plays for Queen's Park. However this player plays for East Stirling - a club which pays players £10 per week! Keeping this article goes against the criteria set by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> which states that "Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league".

<li><b>Delete</b>. Graffiti artists, while they have their own fame, also have infamy: while they certainly have notability in their own circle, most people tend to see graffiti as an eyesore.

<li><b>Keep.</b> This is not in any way a directory entry - it contains absolutely nothing about trading hours, addresses, or for that matter, really anything else that one would expect to find in a directory entry. What it does include is some really information about the mall's history and unusual demographics, including that at one point one of its flagship chain stores was the most profitable of theirs in the entire US. If an article is requested for deletion, surely the nominator should be able to come up with a sensible reason for wanting it deleted. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 22:17, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete without prejucide to re-creation</b> By directory, what I believe Guy means is that the article doesn't really present any useful information other than the fact that this mall exists, i.e., it is another mall like tens of thousands of others in the world. Nothing in the article asserts notability, unless there's some media sources that can be produced that discuss the dubious racial claims made in the article. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 22:30, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It doesn't just point out that the mall exists - it gives some quite interesting information about it. A much more sensible course would be to put an unreferenced tag on it and give people the chance to actually find some book sources, rather than just assuming that the only source of proving notability is Google. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 23:25, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Assuming good faith on Rebecca's part, it seems she's familiar with things about this shopping mall that might make it notable. I'm now qualifying my delete to "without prejudice to re-creation." If/when this article gets deleted, if you can make a new one that has some sources to support the notability you've found, then I don't think there's any problem with this article. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 14:15, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article makes explicit claims of notability for its role in demographic and sociological changes in the community, as reflected in the mall. Unfortunately, this is another in a long line of AfDs created by an admin who has persistently abused his powers and privileges in his longstanding battle to keep Wikipedia free of mall articles. In no way, shape or form does this article meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as a directory entry. The nominator, who should know far better, insists that this is a "directroy entry" when <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> explicitly include "Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as quotations, aphorisms, or persons (real or fictional), Genealogical entries or phonebook entries and Directories, directory entries, TV/Radio Guides, or a resource for conducting business." As usual, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is is used to mean "anything I have arbitrarily decided does not belong in Wikipedia" by people who refuse to reference any existing Wikipedia policy or guideline that would require deletion of the article. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 08:11, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Further, I wish to point out that "existence is not notability", and the article is inadequately referenced. In particular, the "claims of notability for its role in demographic and sociological changes in the community" are nowhere referenced. I would encourage <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> to "assume good faith". <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 17:44, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is quite the hodge-podge article. No less than five different subjects in the same article, only one of which (the song by <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rainbow_%28band%29.html" title="Rainbow (band)">Rainbow</a>) appears to be notable, but not so notable as to require its own article. So, what to do with the space? 1) Disambiguate, adding a note for <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophet_Five_e414.html" title="Prophet Five">Prophet Five</a> from <i>Alias</i>. 2) Merge the song information to the Rainbow article and delete the rest. 3) Redirect somewhere, with my preference being to Prophet Five. 4) Some other solution. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 23:01, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It appears to be the nebulous form of a disambiguation article, but it's a disambig for things that don't seem to actually appear here on Wikipedia, making a disambig unneeded at this time. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 02:15, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li>And I didn't actually express an opinion in making the nomination, did I? <b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophet_Five_e414.html" title="Prophet Five">Prophet Five</a>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:57, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The radio station only covers a small section of northwestern Melbourne, which is almost entirely non-Aboriginal. Other refs appear non-notable. Agree with Dennisthe2's comments. I would go with: 2) merge song info to Rainbow article and delete the rest, and 3) redirect to Prophet Five. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 04:01, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Aboriginal radio?? Northwest Melbourne?? The Shed Magazine is made by unemployed people from Northwest Melbourne and has a worldwide distribution. Where you think it has anything to do with aboriginals is as clueless as your reasons for wanting to delete it.</p>
