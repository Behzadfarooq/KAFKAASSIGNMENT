However, I would have used "0", "1", and "*" instead of his "1", "2", and "0".). The <i>name</i> and pizza sections are almost certainly neologisms. Ah, yes, the Logical Conditions section is also verifiable, although "Addition" is usually "multiplication" (and) and "Multiplication" is a strange combination which I haven't seen before, but probably <i>should</i> have some explanation in papers related to <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boolean_Logic_ad0d.html" title="Boolean Logic">Boolean Logic</a>. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 16:03, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

As you said on Talk:Ordinal fraction, Wikipedia "looked like a good place for me to tell the world about ordinal fractions", and admitted that "the concept of ordinal fractions is new and might be controversial" and "to my knowledge it is not taught anywhere."

<dd>The main question here, I think, is not whether it is original research but whether it is notable enough to meet the bar for an encyclopedia article.

<dd>Well, now we have heard five arguments for deletion. 1: Vanity; 2: 1<sup>1/2</sup>; 3: Originality; 4: Notability; 5: Not all published articles deserve a WP article. Let's look at them one by one. Argument 1 was withdrawn. Argument 2 has nothing to do with the case but merely documents that Steven is motivated by personal reasons. Argument 3 was withdrawn by Steven himself in the note above. Argument 4 seems to be refuted by the comments on the talk page; some people did read the article with interest. Argument 5 tells nothing about whether this very article deserves a WP article. Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, my learned friend may be angry, but his case is weak. <a href="../../../b/o/_/User%7EBo_Jacoby_56d6.html" title="User:Bo Jacoby">Bo Jacoby</a> 06:41, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, I can assess the source: it's an uncited talk, and it doesn't avoid original research. It's also non-notable, because only one person has ever written about the concept; furthermore, I see no actual interest on Talk:Ordinal fraction, and even if there were, that wouldn't establish notability. Finally, since that one person is you, yes, it's vanity. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 07:05, 23 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Refutation to <a href="../../../b/o/_/User%7EBo_Jacoby_56d6.html" title="User:Bo Jacoby">Bo Jacoby</a>. As far as I can tell, argument 1 has not been withdrawn; Steven Johnson's comment suggests to me that he thinks the article <i>does</i> meet the vanity criteria. My reading of Steven's comment on argument 3 is that the question of originality (whether the article violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>) is still open (not yet established). Argument 4 is also not refuted - interest does not equal notability, no matter what notation you use. Arguments 2 and 5 appears to me to be the only one you have got correct. Finally, Steven speaks only for himself, not for any of the other commenters (except where they say "per Steven Johnson"). Are you able to give <i>any</i> references for papers (in peer-reviewed journals) that cite your 1990 conference paper? These would lend more weight to your arguments for notability than anything else so far. To date I have seen no reason to change my delete vote. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddles_deb2.html" title="User:Paddles">Paddles</a> 12:25, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Bo, you don't help your case by making personal attacks and <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> arguments that anyone can see through. My consistent point has been that a concept/neologism published only in a single never-cited conference paper from 16 years ago is non-notable, and that this is a <i>sufficient</i> criterion for deletion. You have yet to address this. The fact that it is apparently a vanity article (which I never conceded) is additional motivation for deletion, but is not <i>necessary</i> and so I don't emphasize it. I, myself, never used the original-research argument—it may be true, but I think it's not worth arguing when the notability argument is so strong. I pointed out your repeated original-notation offenses simply to provide background and to speak to your credibility, and not as an argument <i>per se</i> about this particular article. The comment about not even all refereed journal papers being notable enough for WP was simply to pre-emptively address the specious argument that being published <i>anywhere</i> somehow qualifies a thing as notable. From above, I can tell that all of this was clear to everyone else, but I wanted to answer for myself. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenj_40e5.html" title="User:Stevenj">—Steven G.

<p>Dear Steven. I am not making personal attacks or <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> arguments. I think you are. I am merely reading what you wrote: "This appears to be a non-notable <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Vanity page</a> created by <a href="../../../b/o/_/User%7EBo_Jacoby_56d6.html" title="User:Bo Jacoby">User:Bo Jacoby</a> to promote a nonstandard notation of his own invention". In extention to 'non-notable', which is by now your only remaining argument, you called it vanity, and you argued ad hominem ("I came across this article" &amp;c). Now taking up your sole remaining argument: "a concept/neologism published only in a single never-cited conference paper from 16 years ago is non-notable". What is the WP definition of 'non-notable'? I know that there must be a reference, and so there is. I did not know the requirement that the reference had to be cited; where in the WP policy do I read that? Nor did I know that the reference cannot be 16 years old; where do I read that? I suppose that this piece of information ("from 16 years ago") is not really relevant to your argument. If it is, please document it; if it is not, please omit it. Then you have this subtle distinction between saying and not saying something: "not <i>necessary</i> and so I don't emphasize it". It is not clear to me what you mean by writing something without emphasizing it. I suppose it means that it should have been omitted. So all that remains of your argument is that the 1990-paper has not been cited. That, I think, is true: I know of no citation in a peer-reviewed paper. It was reviewed and accepted prior to the conference by the conference committee. It has been discussed in not peer-reviewed papers, and I have talked to people who have read it, and I have mailed with people who have read my WP article. When you show me the WP policy that un-cited papers do not count, then you are free to delete the article. I think that you are mad at me, for reasons that has nothing to do with the ordinal fraction article, and you act accordingly. You are not checking every WP article for uncited references, which would otherwise be the case. <a href="../../../b/o/_/User%7EBo_Jacoby_56d6.html" title="User:Bo Jacoby">Bo Jacoby</a> 10:11, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now: peer-reviewed sources are considered reliable, but non-peer-reviewed sources generally have less credibility/reliability, just as prominent news websites have more credibility/reliability than myspace pages. Given that the article in question was written by a person (a) about a concept they created themselves that (b) has not been cited in others' peer-reviewed research or (c) generated discussion outside what appears to be a small group of people, it seems obvious that the article qualifies for deletion as both vanity and non-notability. If you can't see that, then I don't know what else to say. This is not your article being singled out for extraordinary attention; hundreds of articles a day are marked for deletion, either through the "prod" tag or the AfD process. In any case, even if Stephen Johnson <i>is</i> engaged in some sort of conflict with you, each person participating in the AfD discussion makes their own judgement on the merits; the nominator's opinion doesn't carry any extra strength. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddles_deb2.html" title="User:Paddles">Paddles</a> 11:37, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bo, I'm not "mad at you", I simply have learned to mistrust your ability to follow Wikipedia guidelines. In exactly the same way that when I see a user upload one copyvio image I look to see if they have uploaded other copyvios, when I saw that you cannot resist inserting nonstandard personal notations it seemed reasonable to spot-check some of your other contributions. And as Paddles said, I don't control the other participants in this forum...doesn't their unanimous opposition tell you something? I admit that it is tiring to debate with you when you resort to sophistry, however. (e.g. I didn't say the reference was not notable because it was old, I said it was not notable because it was old <i>and never cited.</i>) <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenj_40e5.html" title="User:Stevenj">—Steven G.

<dd>"No original research" does not mean that experts on a specific topic cannot contribute to Wikipedia. On the contrary, Wikipedia welcomes experts. We assume, however, that someone is an expert not only because of their personal and direct knowledge of a topic, but also because of their knowledge of published sources on a topic. This policy prohibits expert editors from drawing on their personal and direct knowledge if such knowledge is unverifiable. If an expert editor has published the results of his or her research elsewhere, in a reputable publication, the editor can cite that source while writing in the third person and complying with our NPOV policy. They must cite reliable, third-party publications and may not use their unpublished knowledge, which would be impossible to verify.

<p>Ordinal fraction technology is notable, not for the first reason, but for the second: its particular importance or impact. Ordinal fraction notation has the same potential impact on database technology as the Arabic positional notation for numerals had on arithmetic.
