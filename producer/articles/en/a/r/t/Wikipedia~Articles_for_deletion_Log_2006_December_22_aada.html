<dd>In addition, Bernard Eastlund is one of the patent holders (US Patent #4,686,605) that led to the development of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program <a href="../../../h/a/a/HAARP_bb53.html" title="HAARP">HAARP</a> which has been sensationalized in many books as a weapon with the potential to destroy the world by creating a <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_ray.html" title="Death ray">death ray</a> <a href="http://www.viewzone.com/haarp11.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.viewzone.com/haarp11.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and altering weather patterns.</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Though not as strong as Jamira. only two of those books are non-vanity press, and in both of them he is a mention on a single page, or just in an index. But there are other possible sources all around. Send back for sourcing. It is sourceable. Going back to Akihabara, the patent and the article are the necessary two sources to keep the article , though more should be done. This time, I am not offering to do it.

<li><b>Delete</b> My understanding of "subject of a book" would be that the majority of the book was about him, not an arbitrary mention on a page here and there. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 07:26, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">User:One Night In Hackney</a>, thank you for your comment. This is where the term <i>non-triviality</i> comes into use. According to the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7Enotability_75cc.html#The_primary_notability_criterion" title="WP:notability">primary notability criterion</a> which explains the depth of content needed in the published work, the subject (Bernard Eklund, in this case)needs to be more than "mere directory entry information" and the publication needs to directly address the subject. That is all it requires. "A page here and there," if non-trivial, is all that is needed. It does not require that the majority of the published work be about the subject, only that it is <b>non-trivial</b> and more than a "directory entry" such as a list. In any case, I only used these books as an example of how widespread references to Bernard Eklund are in published books found at Amazon.com.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In addition to books at Amazon.com, searching Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-30,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22bernard+eastlund%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-30,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22bernard+eastlund%22" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> yields an incredible number of hits (about 9,280). This is because Bernard Eastlund is so notable in the popular press. As explained above, many authors are writing about the potential of <a href="../../../h/a/a/HAARP_bb53.html" title="HAARP">HAARP</a> as a weapon. I am not saying they are right, only that these publications exist, thereby satisfying the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7Enotability_75cc.html#The_primary_notability_criterion" title="WP:notability">primary notability criterion</a>. For example --</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Dan Eden published an article about Bernard Eastlund <a href="http://www.viewzone.com/haarp00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.viewzone.com/haarp00.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and states, "Eventually everyone will know about Bernard Eastlund and his work. It will someday be taught in schools. His technology will impact every living thing. But this will have to wait for the military, who own his valuable patents, to release Eastlund's work for humane applications."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another published article sensationalizing Bernard Eastlund's inventions <a href="http://www.rense.com/general45/ital.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rense.com/general45/ital.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> states, "Hoping to cash in on climate change, Eastlund now says that his company ESEC recently signed a contract with the European Space Agency to review the weather modification potential of the HAARP facility in Alaska. Eastlund is also looking to abort tornadoes using HAARP to turn off these whirling dervishes before wind speeds reach destructive force."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, the Google search yields another article about Bernard Eastlund and the "HAARP Geophysical Weapon" <a href="http://www.bariumblues.com/haarp_geophysical_weapon.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bariumblues.com/haarp_geophysical_weapon.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> stating, "American scientist Bernard Eastlund is considered to be the godfather of this program. He received the patent for the method and for the device to measure the layers of the Earth atmosphere, the ionosphere and/or the magnetosphere."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My point is that there are literally hundreds of published reports like these about Bernard Eastlund. You only need "multiple non-trivial published reports" (<i>i.e.</i> more than one) to satisfy the primary notability criterion. I am not saying that Bernard Eastlund is a good scientist or even a famous one, only that he is notable by the definition of the Wikipedia primary notability criterion and as such should be included in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamirabastos_078f.html" title="User:Jamirabastos">Jamira</a> 19:35, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

I'm still not convinced about our subject here, but in any case the list of books used as references does not provide much context on what coverage he received in those sources.

<dd><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">User:One Night In Hackney</a>, thank you for your comment. To answer your question, the guidelines on <i>non-triviality</i> seem quite clear. If a subject is mentioned merely as part of a list or a directory reference (<i>e.g.</i> a phone book directory), it is trivial. If there is some discussion of the subject (more than it just being listed) it is non-trivial. But I think you will agree that it is not necessary for several books to be written about someone before they are considered notable. Please note that being notable is not the same thing as being famous. One can be notable without being famous. For more discussion on the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7Enotability_75cc.html#The_primary_notability_criterion" title="WP:notability">primary notability criterion</a>, it is best to go directly to the <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#fn_2" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">source</a> which is <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">User:Uncle_G</a>. I hope this explains the term <i>non-triviality</i> as used for WP notability.

<dd>Jamira, I see a lot of <i>your interpretation</i> of the notability / published coverage guidelines, but your tone is that of someone patiently explaining absolute facts to a questioning child. There is no accepted bar for triviality (that's why we have so many of these fun debates down at AfD), hence your assertion that one exists is wrong - <i>"Is the bar low for establishing non-triviality and notability? Yes."</i> Really? I missed that meeting. Given the evidence presented thus far, I think the bar is higher than Mr. Eastlund, and others appear to agree. I notice you have a total of 17 edits, with more than half of them related to Mr. Eastlund, and can't help but wonder if you perhaps lack experience in deletion and policy matters? <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 00:03, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Non-notable website awards. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtVandelay13_daad.html" title="User:ArtVandelay13">ArtVandelay13</a> 00:36, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>No to deletion</b> - the website is very well known in UK comedy circles and the awards, while sometimes too ranting for my tastes, offer an important counterpoint to both Chortle and the 'real' UK comedy awards. as has been mentioned, they *have* received some press attention, and the precedent has been set by other comedy websites having their awards included. i feel it's always going to be a contentious point on wikipedia because most UK comedy entries are seemingly 99% maintained by big fans of the show/comedian in question (i myself have had to battle long and hard to prevent, for example, the inclusion of an award on the Mighty Boosh page that was invented by their own management, or a marcus brigstocke 'joke' that he stole from someone else - his denial was being quoted as fact on wiki!)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Not only is it notable (as it has had some UK press attention) but it's at least as notable as websites such as Chortle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chortle" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chortle" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> whose comedy awards have been included in the entries on comedians such as Josie Long <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josie_Long" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josie_Long" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'd fully support the deletion of this entry so long as Chortle's entry and all mentions of their comedy awards also get deleted.--Mr. Analytical 00:50, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No to deletion</b> - The Chortle Website lacks endorsements. In fact, there isn't even an entry for the Chortle awards, but they're still included on different entries.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Perhaps someone <i>from</i> Ireland could take a look at this and advise whether a) hurling is a major sport in Ireland (in which case, as a prominent university athlete in a major sport, he could very well be notable - just because a sport isn't popular in North America doesn't mean it or its practitioners are non-notable), and b) whether Hyland is really an elite university athlete.

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't think it's right that it should be decided by people who don't know or understand Gaelic Games to decided whether or not Michael Hyland is notable. In Ireland, and especially in GAA circles he is certainly a notable person. He has competed in All-Ireland intervarsity championships, although not at intercounty level. As I have argued on the discussion page, the relationship between College and intercounty hurling is similar to the relationship between the NFL and College Football. That he does not appear on the GAA website is more a comment on the poor quality of the GAA website than on Hyland's notability. Now that all offensive material has been removed from the article, I hope it will be recreated on a more encyclopedic basis, and I will help. I can assure you that I am not Michael Hyland, and that it was only written by one person (me) is because it was proposed for deletion within hours of its writing, before anyone else had a chance to contribute. I take particular exception to the comment that he is uninteresting. To people who know hurling, he is an interesting and important character, and that the article appears uninteresting is due to edits. I hope the article will be kept, with a view to making wikipedia relevant to people outside North America. Conboys 00:38, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I would like to note that the IMDB page on this person has extensive credits listed on major film productions. Do you not feel that the photography for X-Men: Last Stand or Poseidon is enough to warrant leaving this person on this site? I believe urther research into the motivations that this articles was recommended for deletion would find that it is based on a personal dispute rather than on professional integrity. Mr. Steve Magruder aka steveietheman erroneously brought attention to himself in 2004 when he conducted an interview citing Mr. O'Daugherty former business partner as a conclusive candidate for The Piano Man in Great Britain. Mr. O'Daugherty corrected the information and raised question concerning the manner which Mr. Magruder handled the public disclosures on WikiNews. The created a great deal of embarrassment for both Mr. O'Daugherty and Mr. Betts. Although Mr. Gorman publicly apologized for posting erroneous material, Mr. Magruder never once offered any public apology. Since Mr. Magruder was Mr. O'Daugherty's former domestiv partner (registered in California) their break up wasn't on the best of terms. Now suddenly, any article that relates to Mr. O'Daugherty's professional work and career is coming under attack by Mr. Magruder. I think it's fair that based on the fact that the article was suggested for deletion by Mr. Magruder, this is simply a retalitory act on his part for being publicly corrected in 2004, and out or personal issues stemming from their 2004 breakup. I would advise reconsidering deletion at this time to avoid possible Wikipedia becoming caught up in what is obviously a personal domestic dispute, otherwise it may be concluded that Wikipedia isn't as objective as it promotes itself being. There could be legal ramifications if this matter isn't handled in the most appropriate manner.</p>
<p>The entire interview from stevietheman regarding the Piano Man can be found under the discussion for article "Piano Man" is not British actor, search down to three leads which supports Mr. Magruder's unscrupulous motivations. --Ilsonlakosky 08:59, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Whether or not this had anything to do with O'Daugherty is unknown. In any case, the nom made arguments based on Wikipedia policies and O'Daugherty does not seem notable according to guidelines.

<dd>I'm unclear why this is arousing so much emotional rhetoric; anyone would think that it was about Stormfront or Intelligent Design. Nor am I clear what standard of notability this entry is being held to, as none of the "voters" have explained their "votes" beyond throwing slogans around. This is supposed to be a discussion of an article, not a string of votes under the slogan "it's vanispamcruftadvertising".</dd>
<dd>So far as I can tell from IMDb, and the facts in the article which no-one here has disputed, O'Daugherty meets the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> crterion: "The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field."

<dd>I'm sorry, but how does this record constitution a "widely recognized contribution":
<ul>
<li>two uncredited acting roles</li>
<li>three gigs as production assistant (which implies anything from gofer to typist to set security)</li>
<li>three gigs as still photographer</li>
<li>one gig as a camera operator</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>He's received no awards for any of these accomplishments. Who has widely recognized them? Also, IMDB is not an "enduring historical record".

<dd>This is not the forum for me to respond to all the matters (some true, some untrue) expressed by Ilsonlakosky, but I would ask everyone to evaluate these twin articles the same way they evaluate others, hopefully objectively. I don't believe IMDb supports the directorial assertions, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Also, it would seem odd that we are to create articles for individuals who are just beginning to get cinematic work for still photography. I'm open to convincing on this article, but I don't see anything that's notable for an encyclopedia article. However, I'm 100% certain that Symbiosis System of Acting must go as clear "vanispamcruftadvertising". <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><font color="green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 14:55, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Another nugget for consideration: The article currently says "O'Daugherty won recognition with his documentary, <i>New Madrid: Tears of a Princess</i>".

<p>Based on stevietheman's arguments, I still disagree, however, I will delete the O'Daugherty article myself, since I did contribute it. Although on the "Other Works" page of the IMDB page in question, there are several listings which outline his accomplishments. Still, there is a double standard being used for Symbiosis System. If that article is deleted, then Wikipedia would have to delete the entire catagory of Acting Methods, since Symbiosis is an established acting method. Recommendation to clean it up might be taken as more reasonable, but not deletion. The article does outline and detail an acting method that isn't a copy from other methods and is original. How do you gage the criteria for adding or deleting an "acting method?"</p>
<p>It stands to reason that stevietheman's credibility in this matter would come into question since it's been cited that serious errors have been made within the Wikinews, which should be held to higher standards of reporting. I still believe this to be an abuse of position, however that will be resolved with the deletion.</p>
<p>However, if Symbiosis System is deleted, then every article under Acting Methods should be scrutinized and deleted under the same grounds. --Ilsonlakosky 16:47, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps you should visit www.jaykofilms.com and review the Acting 101 page that is online. There is an expansive discussion of Symbiosis including the history etc. However, a third party resource... would inclusion in IMDB not serve to indicate that O'Daugherty is a notable person considering that the criteria for inclusion on IMDB is recognizable credentials? IMDB doesn't just post information on their website without a long process of verification, etc? They also have very strict guidelines on what is acceptable, even on their "Other Works" pages. --Ilsonlakosky 18:11, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>RE: "Legal Threats": The statement made was not a direct threat of legal action. It was stating a fact. Were I in O'Daugherty's shoes, I am sure that I'd be exploring my options, as anyone would, especially considering prior abuse and misinformation posted on WikiNews by Magruder that did in fact cause a great deal of embarrassment for O'Daugherty organization. But a "threat of legal action" would be if I stated "I will look into legal option if this isn't handled appropriately". I do believe the exact wording of my previous statement would fail to pass the legal definition of a "legal threat". --Ilsonlakosky 16:56, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I believe this dispute needs to be mediated by experts who understand IMDB, the film industry, acting, acting methods, acting schools, etc. It's becoming obvious that few in this dispute have any real knowledge of the business and what establishes a "notable" career. This has become a pissing contest with no end in site. I request that this matter be decided by a panel with expertise in this particular field. I'm sure that isn't an unreasonable request. Mediation by knowlegable parties would be the ONLY acceptable resolution to this dispute. Additionally, since pursuant to Dhartung argument in my Talk, I must also request that stevietheman's coments and participation in this discussion be striken as he is O'Daugherty former domestic partner (as previously raised) and therefore by the definition Dhartung has provided me, would be a conflict of interest. --Ilsonlakosky 01:38, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is not a "pissing match" or a "dispute". This is a standard discussion of notability, which by Wikipedia procedures may be initiated by any editor. The result is based on the consensus opinion of all editors, any of whom may participate. If you feel that procedurs have not been properly followed, and the article is deleted, you may initiate a <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> which will determine whether there was any flaw in the process. The result of a DRV is usually a procedural AFD, leading to another discussion like this one.--<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 19:04, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Notability</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Notability is not judged by Wikipedia editors directly. <b>The inclusion of topics on Wikipedia is a reflection of whether those topics have been included in reliable published works. Other authors, scholars, or journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it.</b> Thus, the primary notability criterion is a way to determine whether "the world" has judged a topic to be notable. This is unrelated to whether a Wikipedia editor personally finds the subject remarkable or worthy.</i></p>
<p><i><b>January 19, 2003 Courier-Journal Article ID: lou2003012007205388: Director hopes film lures bit of Hollywood to Louisville</b></i></p>
<p>Included in that article are references to my work on several major films, and supports my status as a professional and NOTABLE filmmaker. The article written by Nancy Rodriguez was supported by interviews and research by the journalist.</p>
<p>Contrary to stevietheman and Dhartung's claims, I have read the article and the definition of "Notability" as provided by Wikipedia. The inclusion of this article is supported the article mentioned above as my reputation as a filmmaker within the Louisville businss community was sufficient to provide me support during my productions, including from major business leaders based entirely on my name recognition. By the very definition of "Notability" whether on a local, national or international level, my contributions to the film communities in Louisville, Florida, London, Los Angeles, NYC have provided me respect based on name recognition within the communities. International recognition will come as a result of the upcoming release of Midnight Snow. However, I have become aware that there is an effort to promote regional and locally related articles. If nothing else, the article would qualify for a Louisville based circulation based on local notability resulting from the article in the Louisville Courier-Journal (which is an internationally recognized publication).</p>
<p>Regarding Symbiosis System of Acting, this is an "Acting Method" no different than any method taught to actors, such as the Meisner Method. Since I have already qualified by argument for inclusion of this article, Symbiosis System of Acting would qualify by default, just as the articles relatd to Meisner's techniques. However, the category is called "Acting Methods". An acting method by itself doesn't become notable. It is notable through a grassroots effort through teaching. 183 students of acting have been taught this method since 2004. That isn't necessarily a small number considering that it was only developed into a formatted program during the past decade. That doesn't make it any less important than Meisner or Strausberg which has been taught for several decades with an established following. But the definition of Acting Method would qualify Sysbiosis System's inclusion as an article about Acting Methods because it is exactly that... an Acting Method. Exclusion of more contemporary techniques such as Symbiosis System, Dawn Wells Film Acting Boot Camp or Bob Fraser's "You Must Act" programs would make the category on Wikipedia's Acting Methods incomplete since most of the Meisner, Stanislavsky and Strausberg techniques are relevent to stage acting only and are mostly outdated. There are too many qualifying techniques being used today in film acting that under the guidelines you are addressing would be disqualified and would thereby render Wikipedia as an out-dated resource.</p>
<p>Qualification of an article is not left for interpretation by Editors. However, I do feel that the Editors, who are not attorneys, should consider that by interpreting written policy, they are setting a precedence that would have to be followed very carefully on all future articles. As courts are careful about "interpretating" law, Editors and Administrators need to be careful about interpreting policy, otherwise Wikipedia could quickly become an outdated and unreliable source of information based on unnecessary exclusion of so many relevent articles.</p>
<p><b>Vanispamcruftisement</b></p>
<p><i>Vanispamcruftisement (IPA: /væ.nə.spæm.kɹəf.ʼtaɪz.mənt/; sometimes abbreviated as vanispamcruft or VSCA) is a portmanteau term comprising several editorial faults which some Wikipedians see as cardinal sins: conflict of interest, spam, cruft, and advertisement. The term was coined by Freakofnurture to describe an article nominated for deletion which exhibited all the above properties, being an article apparently created by the owner of a small company, about that company, name-checking the owner of the firm with a brief resume of his skills, and in respect of a company whose products appeared on the face of it to be of strictly limited appeal outside the world of geekdom.</i></p>
<p>Contrary to steveietheman or Dhartung's claims, neither article qualifies under the above definition. The J. Kristian O'Daugherty article was written by Ilson Lakosky about a film director. There are no services... no company... no advrtisements anywhere, including on my website at www.jaykofilms.com. What any reader is directed to through external links, are pages discussing the film industry, still photography, an extensive resource on acting under the Symbiosis System of Acting, and ten galleries of original, and obviously professional quality photographic work. Everything that any serious artist's website might contain. The reference to JayKO would be no different than referencing Askew in an article about Kevin Smith. They go hand in hand.</p>
<p>The Symbiosis System article doesn't promote any service which payment is expected. In fact, I've noticed that Ilson provided most of the structure of the system in the article, although somewhat incomplete. All information provided to the public about Symbiosis System of Acting allows the reader to apply the system without having to attend classes or purchase any services, books or materials. In otherwords... Free Use of the acting system by the reader without obligation.</p>
<p>As to my position on the threats of Legal Action, I do find Ilson's remarks somewhat inappropriate. Any legal action would have to be made by me alone and that is not my objective. I'd prefer this matter be resolved without further disruption and in a professional and respectful manner. If it cannot be resolved through these debates, then Wikipedia's adminstrators were wise enough to provide Dispute Resolution when conflicts arise. Hopefully we can all come to a fair agreement on how this should be handled without having to engage futher procedures.</p>
<p>I will stand by my opinion that the Editors need to apply reasonable standards when reviewing articles and submitting them for deletion. What may be appropriate for one category may not be for another. You should consider each topic carefully and apply standards that relate directly to the subject matter being adressed in the article.</p>

<li>Perhaps a reasonable compromise would be for me to directly cooperate with one of the editors to rewrite the articles to comply with the standards being adressed here. Perhaps the Symbiosis System of Acting article could be rewritten with a focus on contemporary film acting methods covering many of the programs currently available. Just a suggestion... --Jkris97 18:36, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Jkris97 (assuming you are the subject of the article), while your cooperation would be appreciated if the article is kept, keeping our <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> policies in mind, the question being discussed here is whether your articles meet our notability standards. If you could supply reliable third-party sources which discuss your film contributions or the "Symbiosis System", that would help us make a decision. Your own defense of your personal view of your own notability is not sufficient, no matter how hard you've worked or how proud you are of those accomplishments. Many people do good work without becoming notable by our guidelines.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, we need objective sources, not claims. The Courier-Journal article (registration only) seems to be primarily about the featurette <i>Where the River Ends</i>, which does not have an IMDB entry. (available text: "A murder. A dream. A sense of deja vu. And the bobbing and weaving of a man trying to alter his destiny. It was all captured on film in Louisville last week, as ArtzMo Productions LLC did its first short feature film, <i>Where the River Ends.</i> Yesterday, cast and crew hustled around Primizie Pizza Pasta &amp; Philly Steaks at Theater Square, preparing to") Googling "where.the.river.ends louisville" brings up only your site and somebody's guestbook. There is no "daugherty" or "o'daugherty" anywhere on the Kentucky Film Office website. I'm going the extra mile here and I'm just not finding anything significant that has been written about you or the productions you say you've been involved with, which suggests they are independent efforts that have not achieved notability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>I'm not sure if the Kentucky Film Office would be a reliable source either, since according to information on the internet O'Daugherty lives and works in Burbank and West Hollywood.</i> --Ilsonlakosky 20:16, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The Kentucky Film Office does not provide specific information about productions past. Since WTRE was produced in January 2003, the KFO would have no interest in maintaining information on that. The most reliable source of information available to the public for the film industry would be the IMDB. The public, including yourself would not be privy to many of the databases resources that a working professional would be. However, my IMDB page, although not complete in its updating yet, provides clear support that my work isn't simply on a "local" level. The work I've accomplished can be seen by typing in ANY of the titles listed on my IMDB page. As to the documentaries etc, IMDB includes the "Other Works" page where projects that either didn't get aired/released (such as Pilot Episodes) or stage work can be added. Their criteria for submission is very strict (more so than Wikipedia) and can take weeks, months, sometimes years before they can verify and add those credits. Anyone with extensive knowledge of or who works in the film industry would understand this. So the most reliable source that Editors could use would be the IMDB for film related articles. This would be more reliable than Google or Yahoo, since I've done searches myself on my name, and depending on how I spell it, or type it, will come back with different results. But typing my name in IMDB comes back immediately with a one page result. --Jkris97 20:35, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Dhartung, if you actually read the article in the Courier-Journal, although the article is about Where the River Ends, it references other work that the journalist discovered that I worked on, including Script editing on Thelma &amp; Louise, Con Air, and working in production management for Stuart Little and Selena. The work you see currently on my IMDB page reflects work since that article so she would not have had access at the timke the article was published. Perhaps in some ways, Ilson may have miscategorized the article and maybe it should be moved to Photography or Film Photography, since work as a still photographer on Superman Returns, X-Men: The Last Stand, Poseidon, Entourage etc would be considered as notable on such blockbuster films, as confirmed by information on IMDB itself. You don't get hired to do still photography on a $100 million PLUS film unless your accomplishments and your talents qualify you. Still Photographers produce the material that is used for the marketing of a film such as in Billboards, cover-art, Posters, websites, print publications etc. There's too much at stake for a studio to hire anyone in that position without the qualifications and outstanding credentials that would justify risking millions of dollars invested in the production on that person. This is where "reasonable application" of the guildelines needs to be applied. Under these circumstances, this discussion should not be about deletion of an article, but perhaps reclassifying the article appropriately. However, my statement above stands when it comes to the Symbiosis System article. --Jkris97 19:26, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As to whether I am the "subject" of the article, that is one area that stevietheman would be able to confirm since I have used this user ID even back when he and I were still partners. So that should not be a question needing to be addressed extensively. --Jkris97 19:26, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In reviewing Wikipedia's category of Acting Techniques, there are just 5 entries (including Symbiosis System of Acting). In reality, there are many more techniques and programs than those 5. Based on the arguments of Dhartung and others, I can understand why there are so few. If these same guidelines are being applied to other entries, then Wikipedia will never become a reliable resource of information on this particular subject. Just the Dawn Wells Film Actors Boot Camp or the Bob Fraser programs would be disqualified as "spam", yet both of those programs are valuable to the CONTEMPORARY film acting community and information about these programs should be available under any datebase or informational resource that includes Acting Techniques or Methods as a category. Each are different, just as Symbiosis System is. But just like Symbiosis System, they lack the history, but that doesn't make them less important than Meisner or Stanislavsky. In fact, for film acting, Symbiosis, Wells and Fraser's programs are more important because they are part of the evolution of acting itself and a part of the history of modern film acting. The arguments being applied to this debate is based on "opinions" rather than an understanding of film or theatre. Just like you wouldn't go to a Psychiatrist if you need brain surgery, you also wouldn't go to a computer tech if you want to understand filmmaking, theatre or photography. When making decisions about film, theatre or artistic articles and categories, Wikipedia needs to use editors and adminstrators who are competent in this fields to make those decisions rather than rely upon editors who lack any true knowledge (or interest) in these areas. Would Britannica hire computer experts to draft, edit or make decisions regarding Film Editing? No, they would hire someone with direct experience and knowledge of film editing. Sorry Dhartung, but your computer experience doesn't make you an expert in this particular category. --Jkris97 20:54, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dhartung, I regret that you have made this personal with your debates in the associated forum. It's clear that your objective is the deletion of both of these articles with prejudice. Based on your arguments, there's no question of that. You keep referring to "notibility" and yet in the other forum (J. Kristian O'Daugherty) you fail to recognize the reliability of a source such as IMDB which was purchased by Amazon.com but operated as as an independent entity. Read their guidelines, Dhartung. As I made clear in the other forum, if the articles need to be rewritten or reclassified then so be it. But you can not accurately claim that my career hasn't been notable under the definitions you have offered. I would love to see you try and get a job as a still photographer with Warner Brothers shooting stills for any $100 million PLUS film production. You wouldn't even make it past the front gate. I have five of those productions under my belt. So please consider what your motivation is in this, and look a little closer at the source of my credits on the internet (IMDB) and demonstrate to me the reason why IMDb should not be taken as a serious nor reliable source. My work is deplayed on any website that includes <b>X-Men: The Last Stand</b>, <b>Superman Returns</b>, <b>Poseidon</b>, <b>The Queen</b> and <b>Babel</b>. Could you make such a claim?--Jkris97 22:55, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It pains me to come to this decision, but I personally prefer not to have Symbiosis System of Acting nor my name associated with these discussions further. I appreciate that Ilson Lakosky considered me accomplished enough to draft an article documenting my film work and my development of the Symbiosis System of Acting. However, based on these discussions, I am request that all traces of my name and my acting program be immediately removed from Wikipedia, including all discussions in these forums. I will also expand that to include future articles that may include my name or my work, even if it passes Dhartung and Stevietheman's definition of "Notable".</p>

<li><b>Delete all</b>. One of the biggest reasons that I have begun spending quite a bit of time editing Wikipedia is I have seen its potential place as a great asset for retaining the knowledge of humanity for years to come. However, it will fail to be anything more than a large collection of words, if the articles it contains are not weeded out carefully for important, or useful knowledge. I do not see how the inclusion of articles such as these advances the mission of Wikipedia in any way, unless that mission can be understood to include "encapsulating all facts in the world," in which case Wikipedia will be a perpetually incomplete, and increasingly useless and pedantic project. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 11:44, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>PROD was contested (probably properly, insofar as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_300_passing_touchdown_club&amp;diff=85795880&amp;oldid=72482043" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_300_passing_touchdown_club&amp;diff=85795880&amp;oldid=72482043" rel="nofollow">reason</a> I provided was likely not the most persuasive). This was listified in view of a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_August_17_d97c.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 August 17">17 August CfD</a> (the disposition of which was, IMHO, quite wrong), but is not particularly useful qua list. In contradistinction from, for example, <a href="../../../5/0/0/500_home_run_club.html" title="500 home run club">500 home run club</a>, this is not a <i>club</i> to which a single appellative is often ascribed (and not itself notable; each of "300 touchdown club", "300 touchdowns club", and "300 passing touchdowns club" returns fewer than 35 non-WP <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOGLE_1973.html" title="WP:GOOGLE">Ghits</a>) and the article ought properly to be constitued as, e.g., List of National Football League passing touchdown leaders and List of Canadian Football League passing touchdown leaders. What is here, though, need not to be <a href="../../../m/e/r/WP%7EMERGE_94d1.html" title="WP:MERGE">merged</a>—these are plain statistics, a recitation of which does not require <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">GFDL attribution</a>, and this content is readily available—and this would make a particularly worthless <a href="../../../r/e/d/WP%7EREDIR_1870.html" title="WP:REDIR">redirect</a>.</p>
<p>For the same reasons, I am nominating:</p>
<ul>
<li>List of 400 passing touchdown club</li>
<li>List of 50,000 passing yards club,</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I suppose it should be observed that this information need not to be merged, insofar as any <i>passing records</i> article will not need to incorporate any of it.

<p>The page refers to an invective neologism created and used by only one author. While people can consider themselves secular and progressive, there are no political or social organizations or commentators that use the term "secular progressive" to refer to themselves. As such, this term is similar to femi-nazi, in that the only current use and discussion of it is from a biased source.</p>
<p>Until such time as a political or social origination or commentator takes up this label or, like the term femi-nazi, it becomes widespread enough that commentators other than Bill O'Riley can use it, I suggest this term cannot meet Wikipedia's standards.

<li><b>delete</b> not to mention that it's horribly POV without any real response included from the other side, the use of direct quotations tells me that this probably wasn't meant as an attack at all by the author, but including only one side of a definition tends to carry a strong negative connotation. That, and it's a neologism used by one author (apparently), until it's reported on in it's own right, it's just not notable. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 08:01, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep, but cite cultural/political effect</b> Quick google search of the exact phrase has ~82,000 hit, most of them from political blogs, but some from verifiable news agencies. The problem with the argument of "neoligism" in this case is that a) it passes notability and b) the two words are both weighted ones in politics so will be put together at least occasionally, whether by Bill O'Reilly or not. In this case, as much as it personally pains me, O'Reilly's use of the term has been a part of the political discourse of the last several years. I'd like this article cleaned up, given minimal POV, and focus on the effect of the term on the political culture than on strict "definition", but it IS a term currently in play and I don't feel we can hide our heads in the sand about it. Regarding the two previous delete arguments that refer to POV: Remember that NPOV is NOT an argument for deletion in AfD debates, since POV issues should be taken care of by editing an article, not deleting it. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 13:19, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've added some opposing POV to the article, but seeing how most of the 82,00 hits were blogs, that's where the opposing POV came from.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> As the primary author of this article, I am disappointed with the arguments in favor of its deletion. I support the existence of this article NOT because I wrote it, but for two, very sound reasons:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</b> As stated above, the perceived POV of the article does not add to its "deletability." The term "secular-progressive" highlights a viewpoint of a particular political group: of course the article will be one-sided.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, if we were to extend the arguments presented on this page, ANY article on Wikipedia could be deleted just for having a point of view! What kind of intellectual climate does this create?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>2.</b> The Wikipedia guidelines on neologisms state that such articles "should be edited to ensure they conform with the core Wikipedia policies: no original research and verifiability." This article uses no original research, and has been verified to an extensive degree. Having a CBS news article talk specifically about the term surely indicates that this is not a "school-child" phrase.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Remember, also, that the guidelines on neologisms are, by definition, guidelines. Official Wikipedia POLICY states that subjects must only be verifiable to have a page on Wikipedia. As previously demonstrated, this article is verifiable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As such, I support the keeping of this article on two grounds: one, that perceived "point-of-view" discrepancies are not grounds for deletion, and two, that this particular neologism is verifiable and notable.</dd>

<dd>A Spanish-language Class-A TV station which, as it states in the article, is seen both over the air and on cable systems, and which serves the 5th-largest city in the U.S., which is 34% Hispanic, seems notable to me. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 07:59, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't mean to imply that a low powered station cannot be notable, but given that they have limited broadcast range, it would seem more likely.

<dd>In Phoenix, a Class A station with a 40-mi signal radius, reaches nearly the same number of households as a full-service, full-power station with an 80-mi signal radius. And yes, I do intend to meet the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> guideline, although I question its relevance to a television station. Since reports by public agencies are part of the criteria for <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, each <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Communications_Commission_26fd.html" title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</a> application and notice concerning the station contributes to that station's notability. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> 07:53, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Contributes to notability, not creates it. I still debate how applicable <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is to television stations, and for that matter, to all print and broadcast media outlets. They generally do not provide in-depth coverage of their competitors. You may find many passing references, but the only time a media outlet gets attention from other media is when one does something extraordinary, such as changing affiliations, or something controversial. For example, you'd be hard pressed to find anything significant written about <a href="../../../c/i/i/CIII-TV_b33a.html" title="CIII-TV">CIII-TV</a> — it's a full-power station (actually, network of stations) but unless they're writing about themselves, or <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Television_Network_3e1a.html" title="Global Television Network">Global Television Network</a> is writing about them, or the <a href="../../../c/r/t/CRTC_0c5d.html" title="CRTC">CRTC</a> has business with them, you don't hear much about them. On the other hand, because of Jan Pachul's antics with the CRTC, you might find several independent articles about <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Ray_TV_87f8.html" title="Star Ray TV">Star Ray TV</a>. Which is the more notable station? I submit it's CIII-TV. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> 09:32, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Interesting thoughts there. You may want to start a discussion on one of the policy or guideline talk pages. According to policy <a href="../../../v/_/_/Wp%7Ev.html" title="Wp:v">wp:v</a>, no third party sources, no article, how else do we verify the statements? If it's just a simple reprint of FCC info, why do we need an article? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 09:40, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. I've been putting together secondary sources to complete the Class A stations in the western US, but there have been several stations for which I can find nothing else but the FCC info. I will not author those articles for just that reason. However, television stations often get third-party mention as part of a larger article. See, for example, <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/ent/tv/articles/1111novelas.html" class="external text" title="http://www.azcentral.com/ent/tv/articles/1111novelas.html" rel="nofollow"><i>World staying tuned to Mexican telenovelas</i></a>, an article which makes mention of KPDF in a couple of paragraphs, but the article is not about the station itself. The same is true for <a href="http://phoenix.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2006/07/17/story7.html?page=3" class="external text" title="http://phoenix.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2006/07/17/story7.html?page=3" rel="nofollow"><i>Spanish-language TV outlets boost power, viewers</i></a>, which devotes the last few paragraphs to KPDF and <a href="../../../a/z/t/Azteca_America_d8fa.html" title="Azteca America">Azteca America</a>. You'll not likely find more than this kind of reference. The question is: is it enough coverage to satisfy the "non-triviality" part of the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability guideline</a>? I contend that it is, due to the reasons I stated in my previous response. However, I would judge the one-sentence reference to KPDF in <a href="http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/current/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001435016" class="external text" title="http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/current/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001435016" rel="nofollow"><i>MediaWeek Market Profile: Phoenix</i></a> as trivial, and would not cite it. Note — I am adding the first two references to the KPDF-CA article, as external links now, but will refine the article later. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> 10:35, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Only significant independent coverage appears to be in the FCC license, which is routine and does not show notability. Apparently the current revision of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> disagrees with me on the point that routine reports <i>never</i> show notability, but WP:N does exclude trivial coverage, and I would call the FCC license trivial because it's nothing we can use to write an encyclopedia article. Dhett (who is to be commended for finding the sources that he did) raises the interesting suggestion that (at least some) media outlets should be considered "<a href="../../../p/l/a/Platonic_idealism.html" title="Platonic idealism">platonically</a>" notable even without significant independent coverage.

<li>Are you saying official records are "trivial"? They're VERY reliable, especially for companies that go by the book, like KPDF's owners. They give the technical information: FCC data never will list affiliations unless it's an O&amp;O, and still so indirectly. Websites will mention programming, not technical aspects like FCC records do. We need both in a Wikipedia television station article. Right now, I'm going at <a href="../../../w/x/s/WXSP-CA_3fbe.html" title="WXSP-CA">WXSP-CA</a>: I want to get at least one WP:TVS article to GA before the end of January, and for GA, we need references. There are secondary-source-relying projects and primary-source-relying projects. We happen to be the latter, because there are no reliable secondary sources on most stations, but reliable primary sources exist. Same with <a href="../../../p/c/p/WP%7EPCP_c57f.html" title="WP:PCP">WP:PCP</a>: secondary sources do not exist, as anything close to one just repeats the information in the game, and most of the description and other parts are from the games themselves.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Watching the AfDs for the mast articles I believe that, faced with a huge number of articles, the submitter has organised them by height as a way to break down the task. This is likely because they are sorted that way on the list of masts page. I doubt the submitter is intending it be taken as a primary reason for deletion, other than low-height masts do not have their height as a reason for notability. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a> 13:54, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It isn't covered there in those guidelines, so a mere unadorned reference to them is not sufficient. At a minimum, there would need to be a showing of what the rule is and how this fits under that rule, and there have been no coherent arguments along those lines.

<dd>There are fewer manmade structures over 400 m tall than there are episodes of one long-running soap opera.

There are fewer manmade structures over 400 m tall than there are links in the "What links here" of some one sentence articles about no-name villages with three page navigation boxes linking to all their neighboring no-name villages.

<li>All of the things you say are true, and none of them represents a reason why Wikipedia needs these particular articles.

<dd>Agreed. These arguments don’t establish notability, which is the nominators main argument for deletion. And there are more fish in the sea than manmade structures over 400 m tall.

<dd>Gene, the list of masts, if I counted right, details 132 masts over 500m in the US <i>alone</i>. I don't think that makes them notable. I do believe that (say) the top 10 in the US may be notable, perhaps the top 20 at a push. Once you take into account masts in other countries, those nominated for deletion certainly become non-notable based on their height alone. Of course something else may make them notable. I do accept that we're getting close to a point where they cease being "just another mast", when it needs to be considered more carefully. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a> 23:46, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's easy to count up all the masts in other countries that are over 500 m tall: there are <b>exactly zero</b> of them. The one in Poland that was once the tallest in the world collapsed.</dd>
<dd>It's pretty easy to count the other structures of any other type anywhere in the world that are taller than 500 meters: <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taipei_101.html" title="Taipei 101">Taipei 101</a>, <a href="../../../c/n/_/CN_Tower_50ef.html" title="CN Tower">CN Tower</a>, <a href="../../../o/s/t/Ostankino_Tower_b385.html" title="Ostankino Tower">Ostankino Tower</a>, and <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sears_Tower_1d9d.html" title="Sears Tower">Sears Tower</a> when you include its antenna. Even if I hadn't had good mathematics teachers, I'd probably be able to figure it out: that's <b>four</b>. The only difficulty is in deciding whether or not to count the mostly undersea drilling rig <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petronius_Platform_ffe7.html" title="Petronius Platform">Petronius Platform</a>, which would take you all the way up to <b>five</b>.

<dd>It is indeed <b>four</b> (also <b>zero</b>) as I say (I don't count Petronius Platform).

<dd>I'm not sure what the issue is here in any case?

<dd>What? Comparisons against any other type of structure mean nothing! Notable amongst other masts is what we are looking for. If you again, actually look at the list, all the 600 m + structures that are listed are in the US- hence that’s what i said. And you haven’t addressed Seraphimblade’s point: Only non-trivial press coverage or other third-party sourcing makes a thing notable! Height is not the only reason unless it is in the top 10 or so. Just because its tall doesn’t mean it meets the criteria.<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFledgeling_731d.html" title="User:Fledgeling">Fledgeling</a> 17:17, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Gene, I would like to ask you to step back for a moment, and look at this from a different angle. Forget the exact heights of various masts, or whether the nominator has all of his facts straight. You certainly seem to be adamant that these articles be kept, despite the number of those who disagree. This is <i>admirable,</i> and I would hate to think we are bullying you, or any others in a (seemingly) minority view. Therefore, I would like to ask: Why exactly do you think that these articles about various masts should remain in WP? If you think they add to WP's mission, I would really like to hear your reasons. I want to see WP cleaned up, but not at the expense of articles that support the mission, and I make no pretenses to omnicience. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 10:01, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The biggest problems with this nomination include:</dd>
<dd>The <i>bogus concern</i> about "Once you take into account masts in other countries" (Akihabara). There are <b>zero</b> masts in other countries taller than the tallest one here; there once was at least one that was in fact the tallest in the world, but it fell down. There are only three structures of any kind whatsoever outside the United States which extend more than 500 meters above ground, and one more that tall that is mostly underwater.</dd>
<dd>The fact that all of these masts are in the United States, yet the only numbers that have been mentioned are the maximum height in meters (and as I pointed out, one may exceed that), without any mention of the height in feet. Most Americans are not as comfortable working with metric units as I am. A very significant number of Americans won't even try to figure out what this means.
<ul>
<li><b>Every one</b> of these masts is <b>over 1,500 feet tall</b>.</li>
<li><b>23 of 24</b> masts in 23 articles are <b>over 1,550 feet tall</b>. One is 1549 ft. The Empire State Building remains the tallest in the U.S. at 1250 feet to its roof, and 1454 feet to the top of its antenna. The shortest of those nominated here <b>reaches 95 feet higher</b> than the antenna on the Empire State Building. All of these are at least 98 ft taller than the roof of the Sears Tower at 1451 ft, but all are shorter than the Sears Tower with antenna which adds another 279 feet.</li>
<li><b>10 of 24</b> nominated here are <b>over 1,600 feet tall</b>, with the tallest at 1661 ft.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Even in meters, the nominator just vaguely said that "all are below 500 meters", without saying that "all are over 470 meters".</dd>
<dd>Seraphimblade expressed concern about sources, but that is the one thing that could be lost in deleting these articles, is the additional source information other than the FCC certifications that is contained in some of these articles.</dd>
<dd>I'd suggest that for now, you leave the ones over 1,600 feet, and revisit it later if necessary. A hundred articles isn't going to overwhelm "Wikipedia"; it isn't going to make it likely that these will show up frequently for anybody pressing the "Random article" link. There are <b>no legitimate concerns about proliferation;</b> there are none missing over the shortest one listed in this AfD. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 15:23, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We arnt looking for Statistics on how these match up on other types of structures. When compared to other masts, all these listed fall short. I even think we don’t need all of the masts in the 600 m + range, unless they are in the top 10 or otherwise notable. You don’t cite some of your evidence about heights in other countries, as well.<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFledgeling_731d.html" title="User:Fledgeling">Fledgeling</a> 17:30, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>*<b>Comment</b> - I think that there is some concern about proliferation: though not specifically articles about masts. Look back over the AFD's for just the last week, and see how many times the author of an article about a non-notable subject says something like "well, I only wrote the article because I saw this <i>other</i> article about an even <i>less</i> notable subject." <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 06:26, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Note my comment isn't part of the nomination, it's part of the discussion. I'll take your word for it that masts this high are unique to the US, I have no idea. However you haven't addressed my basic point, which I think is similar to the concerns others have: there are over a hundred of these left, so their height alone doesn't make them notable. I see little reason to keep any other than the highest ten or twenty, and your discussion only refers to their notability on the basis of their height. As someone else mentioned, I also do not intend to single out masts here. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a> 14:51, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Let me reply to Gene about his concern arguments: I stand accused of the mass murder of over two hundred articles about masts, and also attempting to "slip one in" by deliberately misstating the mast height in one article. The misstatement about the height was unintentional in that yes, the nomination did include ONE article containing one of two masts which was within the height range specified in the nomination. Those editors who have been participating in the debates over the last 2 weeks will know that the deletions are taking place in a systematic manner, and it should be obvious that the AfDs are grouped and are progressing according to ascending order of mast height. Masts in excess of 500m will be put under the spotlight in due course, so please don't wet yourself about just one which apparently falls outside. None of the articles being proposed for deletion are in any way special or encyclopaedic. If anyone has volumes to write about any special mast in compliance with wiki policies, an article can be created. I am not wantonly destroying, but quite the opposite. Please refer to edit history of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a> article for the efforts I have put into the subject.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - bias and lack of Wikification is not grounds for deletion, and the nominator admits the subject is notable. An article shouldn't be nuked just because it's "too much work". ~<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatticus78_82c5.html" title="User talk:Matticus78">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matticus78_2dbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matticus78">C</a></sub> 10:21, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well just to explain the "low ghits"; any article or information written on the subject is in Arabic and not available online. His biography book is also in Arabic. I will have to take the time to translate some things but it is all available (including meeting transcripts, newspaper clippings, pictures and voice recordings) <a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJinanez_5477.html" title="User:Jinanez">Jinanez</a> 11:05, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - a notable historical figure deserves his place in Wikipedia. However, the article is not entirely written from a neutral point of view (NPOV) and therefore needs some rewriting. Some more independent references would be advisable. <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJoJan_2b10.html" title="User:JoJan">JoJan</a> 13:28, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I have tried to read this article several times and I still have no idea what this person is supposed to be notable for. He is supposedly the 'Former chief of the Kataeb Security Council', but as far as I can tell, the <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kataeb_Party_4e37.html" title="Kataeb Party">Kataeb Party</a> is only one political party of many in Lebanon. (Is he even Lebanese? The article doesn't specify.) I wouldn't normally vote no because of poor article quality, but together with the fact that his notability is questionable, and I am doubtful that this article will be improved to something readable, I shall&#160;!vote delete. --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFang_Aili_a8ed.html" title="User:Fang Aili">Fang Aili</a> <sup><a href="../../../f/a/n/User_talk%7EFang_Aili_6d94.html" title="User talk:Fang Aili"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 15:23, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Maybe you do not know much about the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Lebanon_a9de.html" title="History of Lebanon">history of Lebanon</a> user:Fang Aili but in a nutshell in addition to his contribution in the Palestino-Lebanese conflict in the 1970s, Hawi created the <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kataeb.html" title="Kataeb">Kataeb</a> Military Council which was took over by former President <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bashir_Gemayel_8a17.html" title="Bashir Gemayel">Bashir Gemayel</a> upon his death. Without Hawi, the <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanese_Forces_67f7.html" title="Lebanese Forces">Lebanese Forces</a> would not have existed and this party in addition to the <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kataeb.html" title="Kataeb">Kataeb</a> party (which he helped in the creation and organization) are major forces in the <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanese.html" title="Lebanese">Lebanese</a> March 14th Forces coalition currently at the heart of the present <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon_conflict.html" title="Lebanon conflict">Lebanon conflict</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafic_Hariri_4e86.html" title="Rafic Hariri">Rafic Hariri</a> UN probe / tribunal, and the on-going protests in down-town Beirut. And in answer to your question, it is clearly written in the 'poor quality article' that Hawi was born in New York USA in 1908 to Lebanese parents but lived since 1910 in Lebanon, which would make him Lebanese.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article states that he held multiple senior positions in a notable political party. However, the article needs to be improved with better references. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 18:00, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I came by to close this debate, but I decided to&#160;!vote instead. It looks to me like we have notability, especially with the about.com mention, and I don't see any other argument for deletion other than an allegation that it's not notable. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 18:04, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The about.com "article" is actually a gallery of images, with a one-sentence caption: "Soothing, relaxing, and quiet, the Falling Sand Game is a great way to be creative and relax at the same time." If that's not a trivial mention, I don't know what is.

<li>A mention on about.com is more than sufficient to establish notability. Your zeal to delete this article is noted, but it's time to accept that other users may disagree, rather than trying to argue with everyone who is&#160;!voting to keep. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 23:24, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't think I really need to point it out, but it's a discussion, not a vote. In most discussions, there's a natural back-and-forth of exchanging ideas and arguments. I do accept that others disagree, but I don't see what's wrong with pointing out flaws in their reasoning or details they've overlooked. Most especially, I'd rather not have new users come into the discussion and see these weak claims go unchallenged as truth. Claiming that the game has been mentioned on About.com does <i>seem</i> like an indication of notability as long as you don't explain what that mention was.</li>
<li>Additionally, a lot of the keep votes are coming from SPAs or rarely used accounts using spurious reasoning related to <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. This is undoubtably due to <a href="http://chir.ag/stuff/sand/" class="external text" title="http://chir.ag/stuff/sand/" rel="nofollow">at least one version</a> linking directly to the Wikipedia article <i>as directions</i> for how to play the game.

<li>Anþony, please watch your language and tone. As to this AfD, your complaints about verifiability are unfounded; we have no doubt that the game itself exists, as we can verify this by pointing directly to a site that hosts it. If some of the information in the article is itself unverified, it can be removed, or it can be tagged with {{citation needed}}, but deletion is not appropriate. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 16:41, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Gone from a merge to a delete eh? You guys just don't quit do you? As I recall, there was once a proposal to delete an article regarding another super plane from Ace Combat 4, the <a href="../../../x/-/0/X-02_Wyvern_925e.html" title="X-02 Wyvern">X-02</a> Many things were proposed including adding it to a list of all Ace Combat fictional aircraft, merging it with AC4, and just Keeping it. The result was a "Keep, no consensus".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Now perhaps you people don't care but I know when I was a new fan I looked everywhere for information regarding this Fictional plane becasue I thought it was real and wanted to learn more about it, and I know I'm not the only one, had there been a Wikipedia article about it at the time it would have made things a LOT easier. They used to have indevidual articles for these aircraft but people argued there wasnt enough info to make one article so they combined them all into one, the one that is now being proposed to be deleted entirely.</dd>

<dd>It doesn't matter if we own the game or not. We're discussing the article about the game and not the game itself. Some have suggested that this article goes into so much minute detail that it violates core <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia content policies</a>. Since you asked: "Fancruft is a term sometimes used in Wikipedia to imply that a selection of content is of importance only to a small population of enthusiastic fans of the subject in question. While "fancruft" is often a succinct and frank description of such accumulations, it also implies that the content is unimportant and the contributor's judgement of notability is lacking." (See:<a href="../../../f/a/n/WP%7EFANCRUFT_101a.html" title="WP:FANCRUFT">WP:FANCRUFT</a> for more info. There are several guidelines and policies which relate to the term. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">General Notability</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">Fiction Notability</a>, and <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">Writing about fiction</a>. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 00:54, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(If the entire series or articles on fictional airplanes was put up for deletion, I'd vote <b>transwiki/delete</b> because of the previously mentioned precendent.

<dd>Have any of your "pretty long articles" gone over the <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">size limits?</a> The merge point article that I suggested is rather small in size. There is no reason not to merge it per the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">Fiction guidelines</a>. In fact, those guidelines say that an article on this should not be split up unless an <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">encyclopedic</a> treatment of the article is made. That means citing sources outside of the primary.</dd>
<dd>Anyway: <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">In-universe statement</a>: "It is believed that the XR-45 Cariburn may be a very early prototype of what will one day evolve into Neucom Inc's Radical- series aircraft, the R-101, R-102, and R-103." <i>It is believed</i> is a weasel statement. Just who believes this? Why do we care jets follow its design path? What impact does it have outside of the plotline of the game? This is very much like "cruft" ... it's the gunk that builds up in atticles. It's very much centered to fans of the game. People who don't know what the game is should be able to read the sentece and understand the context and the reasoning for things.</dd>
<dd>"The materials which it is created out of and how it is structured make it very cost effective, reliable and easy to maintain on the frontlines." Why do we care that it is cost effective and easy to maintain? Is it part of the game play? You walk a fine line here, though... you could easily go into gameplay.</dd>
<dd>"The YR-302 is the first aircraft of it's size to use a <b>pheonominal</b> four jet engine system, rather than the typical one or two. The Fregata is the <b>first</b> Fighter <b>jet in history</b> to use this four engine system. It's role is said to be ground attack, though it is capable of operating at ultra-high altitudes." Again, this is totally in-universe. It's got a lot of <b><a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperbole.html" title="Hyperbole">hyperbole</a></b> in it too. Who says its role is in ground attack? Actually, the more I analyze these, the more I lean toward outright deletion.

And the design concept is plot related showing that each of the games interlink within each other to make a story line. I have no clue how <b>pheonominal</b> got in there but it will be removed. And the rest is in the games and is plot related. I rest my case.

The previous AfD is at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mathematics_and_God_3b0c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mathematics and God">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mathematics and God</a>. It was argued there that "Mathematics and God" (more properly, "Mathematics and religion") is a proper subject for an article. The article is not only a collection of quotations, though I agree that there are too many citations and that there is little coherence. It has been in a bad state since the previous AfD, more than a year ago, so I think it's better for Wikipedia to delete the article. However, I also think that would be against the deletion policy: bad articles on a encyclopaedic subject should be sent to cleanup. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 11:45, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I voted strong delete the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mathematics_and_God_3b0c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mathematics and God">first time</a> this came up for deletion. I'm still not happy with its contents, though I tried to improve it once it was kept (for lack of consensus). It is not <i>just</i> quotations, but it is little more than that; there has never been any attempt to add context and discussion, which it still needs. If, say, Plato, Newton, Euler, and Erdős all used the word "God", they had rather different ideas in mind. (Plato was a pre-Christian, Newton was an idiosyncratic alchemist, Euler was Christian Protestant, and Erdős was agnostic.) You'd never know it from the article. Worse, it seems that fans of believing in God (presumably in the Judeo-Christian tradition) stop by from time to time and delete the section with dissenting voices ("God as human invention"). I like history and human interest; I do not think this article has enough of either to justify its persistence. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 11:59, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There is apparently a list of quotes on the same theme at the Wikiquote site, so there is no reason to host the same thing here, especially since the article, such as it is, pretty much is just a list of quotes.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The topic of the article is rather broad and ill-defined. We have references on everything from ontological proofs of God's existence to philosophical references to Platonic mystical remarks. This article seems to be a collection of any kind of semi-spiritual-philosophical quotes about mathematics. This in itself is a problem, but a more serious one is that I get a feeling that NOR is being violated. This may be one of those cases when it is an unpublished synthesis of an assortment of topics. An article like Mathematical proofs of God's existence would be clearly defined and easily writable without violating any policies.

A simple observation: After three years of existence, the article has many religion-related quotes from different mathematicians (and interestingly no mathematics-related quotes of theologians), but no one single non-trivial sentence about its subject, the relation of mathematics and God. "What we cannot speak of, we must pass over in silence." (<a href="../../../t/r/a/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus_29f9.html" title="Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</a>).

<li><b>Comment</b> Apparently Milivoje <i>was</i> a Yugoslav <i>rally</i> driver (he's listed as participating in a 1958 hillclimb), but reports of his fame may be otherwise exaggerated.

<p>This <i>would</i> be a neologism, if terms coined over 23 years ago can comfortably be called such a thing. But given that in 23 years Google has barely heard of it (most of the hits are for the music album by the same name — buy it from Amazon, download mp3s, read lyrics, etc.), I really don't think we need an article about what, to all intents and purposes, amounts to Ms Randle's original research which never really caught on. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenkreuz_8bdd.html" title="User:Rosenkreuz">Rosenkreuz</a> 12:00, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> – I fail to see why this particular bus route is being picked out, considering that we have many articles on bus routes from all over the world. See, for example, <a href="../../../l/o/n/Category%7ELondon_bus_routes_d2ba.html" title="Category:London bus routes">Category:London bus routes</a>. As an inclusionist, I believe that the bus route articles can be very useful, and not only for "travel guide" style information, but also by providing things like technical information, what vehicles are used on a route, the vehicle history, and stuff like that, which can actually be very useful when seeking a comprehensive source of information about a city's public transit system (i.e. this type of use is <i>not</i> travel-oriented, but rather research-based/informative). As to sources: what sources are you exactly looking for? Sources confirming that such a route exists? Sources confirming the termini and stops? This was taken from <a href="http://transportbucuresti.trei.ro/autobuze/Trasee_autobuze.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://transportbucuresti.trei.ro/autobuze/Trasee_autobuze.htm" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> The point is to try and consolidate the long lists of stub articles, that often aren't updated properly. The <i>general precedent</i> is that only the transit authority that operates city buses, , such as the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Transit_Authority_2a08.html" title="Chicago Transit Authority">Chicago Transit Authority</a>, should be listed, unless there's something notable about a route. London is an <i>exception</i>, not a rule. Also, the British bus nuts probably ain't going to be happy that you brought attention to their London bus route articles, it'll give the deleitionists <i>ideas</i>. I wouldn't have a problem with having this and the London buscruft <b>transwikied</b> to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitravel.html" title="Wikitravel">Wikitravel</a>, which is really where it belongs, IMHO. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 15:52, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But there is very little to do with travelling in these articles. Most of the information relates to technical aspects of the route, particularly what vehicles were used, etc. In this way, the information is encyclopedic, and would be rather irrelevant at Wikitravel (i.e. why would travellers be interested that RATB route 104 used DAF SB220 buses before Mercedes Citaro, and that they are based at Pipera bus depot?) <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 03:05, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I suppose I could change my opinion if <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bus_routes_in_Bucharest_85f9.html" title="List of bus routes in Bucharest">this</a> list were made more comprehensive, along <a href="../../../b/a/i/Baisley_Park_Bus_Depot_dab9.html" title="Baisley Park Bus Depot">these</a> lines, or if London were also targeted for deletion. Do get back to me when that happens. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBiruitorul_cab6.html" title="User:Biruitorul">Biruitorul</a> 00:05, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I think this comes down to a classic deletionist vs inclusionist debate. Tubezone: you're saying that just because <i>other</i> bus routes aren't included, these shouldn't be either. As a person who sees Wikipedia as constantly-expanding and gradually including more and more particular and detailed information, I believe that it would be bloody great to see articles on as many bus routes as possible. To me, Wikipedia is about two things: depth of information and quality. How exactly will deleting this article enhance any of those aims? <a href="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/6d/European_flag.svg/20px-European_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../e/u/r/Image%7EEuropean_flag.svg_aebc.html" /></a><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/20px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Romania.svg_c447.html" /></a> <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonline_b297.html" title="User:Ronline">Ronline</a></b> <a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonline_969f.html" title="User talk:Ronline">✉</a> 03:05, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>It passes the Primary Notability Criterion "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself". Notability is generally permanent, as you say - that is the reason that it <i>doesn't need</i> any frequent coverage, it was once notable so it still is. I still think you're looking at notability as somehow associated with importance, which it isn't. The reason to keep is that there is sufficient verifiable information to write an article that doesn't conflict with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> - which is pretty much what notability is. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 23:03, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Being notable as you define it is necessary for being included in Wikipedia, but not sufficient. For relatively-unknown persons and companies, it is enough to include them in a list (in this case, "List of clothing companies" or something similar). For example, all the schools in some area deserve to be listed in "List of schools in X" but not individually, unless a school is exceptional in some way. And I guess that most activities in schools are covered by the local press, so there you have "multiple independent sources", yet they don't qualify for individual articles. Maybe you mixed notability and verifiability. --<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 08:18, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Where are you getting this from (and you now seem to be arguing it <i>is</i> notable, which is a turn around)?

<li>"I don't see any reason to keep it" - horribly subjective, can't possibly be used as an argument</li>
<li>"Being notable as you define it is necessary for being included in Wikipedia, but not sufficient" - a reversal in argument (now you say it <i>is</i> notable) for a start, and I question what <i>is</i> sufficient for inclusion</li>

<li>Hi Trebor. First of all, I didn't say it is now notable. I said that if you use your suggested definition of notability, you end up listing on Wikipedia every company, every school, every TV show, every album and every song on Earth, as well as most non-anonymous people. And now I'll answer your question about subjectivity. You <i>must</i> use some judgment when deciding what articles should exist in an encyclopedia and which should be left out or minimized, e.g. by including them in lists. I know that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>, but still some subjective criterions should be applied. The policies that you mentioned are usually used the other way. For example, a person or company that was not mentioned in multiple independent sources is clearly non-notable, and thus it's a clear-cut delete decision. <b>But</b> even if a person or company <i>was</i> mentioned in multiple independent sources, it may still be non-notable and thus deleted, because, yes, <i>from a subjective point of view it makes sense</i>. This is the reason for the AfD process. If there is a "technical" reason for deletion ("clear-cut"), then the decision is obvious. Otherwise, it is open for debate, and in this specific case, I think it should be deleted. --<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 12:04, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, no, no - deletion should <i>not</i> be subjective. That's what causes <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">systemic bias</a>, that's what makes it dependent on what people <i>feel</i> and on which people decide to vote. There is no subjectivity anywhere in the policies or deletion guidelines (to the best of my knowledge). AfD is a place to ask for and be shown sources, to argue the reliability of sources, to discuss whether an article belongs in an encyclopaedia (whether it violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>), etc. You say I'm using my "suggested definition of notability", but it is the consensual one on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> - it should be used. Subjectivity undermines the whole deletion process. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 12:10, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Deletion must be little subjective. You are not a machine, just think about this company and think why it is notable and why it is in encyclopedia - because there were three articles in the newspapers. That's pretty bad reason. <b><a href="../../../t/u/l/User%7ETulkolahten_ac82.html" title="User:Tulkolahten"><span style="background:#CCFFFF;color:#FF0033">≈Tulkolahten≈</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/u/l/User_talk%7ETulkolahten_1a96.html" title="User talk:Tulkolahten">≈talk≈</a></sup></b> 13:14, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That directly contradicts <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:N">this</a> though - notability is not judged by Wikipedia editors directly. Our personal opinions are irrelevant. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 14:48, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>What exactly is your argument? You've changed and changed and changed, and every time I ask for an explanation you seem to go off on a tangent into a different point. If I may, can I ask a few straight questions and get a few straight answers? Do you think deletion should be a subjective decision? Do you think this article qualifies as notable using the consensual definition at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>? Do you think notability (as defined by that guideline) is sufficient for an article and, if not, what else must there be? <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 20:05, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll tell you <i>my</i> argument. It's simple. You need notability plus common sense. Unfortunately, common sense is not so common in Wikipedia. For example, the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rick_Ufford-Chase_84e7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rick Ufford-Chase">other non-notable article</a> that I nominated for deletion was kept. --<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 07:19, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This suggests you have no argument. Common sense is obviously subjective (as we don't agree here), so cannot be used as a deletion criterion. And aside from that, you seem to have nothing. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 08:13, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What you say is not accurate. The deletion criterion was clearly stated in the first place, and it is non-notability. The handful of independent sources that mention this company are not "multiple" as the notability criterion suggests. Using also common sense for deletion decisions doesn't hurt. --<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 09:46, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And what more, these articles are more about the political party members who estabilished that company. Not about company itself. We can't take it as a multiple non-trivial works about subject, simply cannot. <b><a href="../../../t/u/l/User%7ETulkolahten_ac82.html" title="User:Tulkolahten"><span style="background:#CCFFFF;color:#FF0033">≈Tulkolahten≈</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/u/l/User_talk%7ETulkolahten_1a96.html" title="User talk:Tulkolahten">≈talk≈</a></sup></b> 10:20, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Why I think it should be deleted</i>. I've read through <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and this person fails most notability tests. The few sources that wrote about him might be enough for verifiability, but are not enough to make him notable. The articles do not amount to significant press coverage. No other authors, scholars, or journalists gave him any attention. Notability is generally permanent - this person does not have any frequent coverage. He didn't make any widely recognized contribution that is part of any historical record, and clearly fails the 100-year tests. I don't see any reason to keep it. --<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 23:02, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Similarly to the other article, I think you're misunderstanding notability. Notabiliy means "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person". This person has. What is "significant press coverage" - significant is a subjective word which is why it is not included in notability. Notability is generally permanent means there is <i>no need</i> for frequent coverage - once notable, always notable. The 100-year test is not an established guideline for inclusion. The reason to keep is sufficient verifiable information to construct an article which is not in contradiction with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> - essentially the meaning of notability. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 23:08, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Significant press coverage</i> is definitely a criterion for notability, see <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The 100-year tests are widely used in Wikipedia when deciding if articles about a person should be deleted or not, although it's not an official policy because there is no complete concensus about it. And most importantly, notability <i>should equal</i> importance in some way. Non-notable persons and companies have to be listed under "List of whatever", without an individual article. --<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 09:29, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Directly from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>: "It is not synomyous with fame or importance". I'm sorry, but the guideline disagrees with you - unless, of course, you count "importance" as being noted in multiple non-trivial independent sources. In relation to "significant press coverage", it says "All of these criteria are in fact simply special cases of the general primary criterion". Thus if it passes the primary criterion (which it does), it is notable. Explain to me how the person has not "been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person". <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 13:05, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Being notable as you define it is necessary for being included in Wikipedia, but not sufficient. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Fighters_%2B_Lovers_c1df.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Fighters + Lovers">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Fighters + Lovers</a>. --<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 08:19, 25 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>See my other reply. What else does there need to be to make it sufficient (because you seem to think it is a subjective measurement of "importance" or being "well-known")? <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 08:57, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm nominating Iddo Choi for deletion because I think it's at best a misrepresentation of something fictional as real and most likely simply a hoax or a violation of <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>. "Iddo Choi" returns 0 Google hits, the page uses a picture of a Pokemon for the image of this supposed martial artist, and Captain Planet and Ms. Frizzle are listed as his relatives. I'm going to add some more articles as well that were created yesteday and are intertwined with this one -- all of them describe as real supposed martial artists or techniques and then link those with anime characters or Pokemon. Most of the users that have edited these pages have edited nothing outside this set of pages; those that have edited other pages have gotten vandalism warnings for their changes. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 14:25, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You must allow the sources to be discussed in the AfD process. That is its purpose, not to just have an administrator judge the worthiness of an article and close discussions. As it happens, I contend that your sources support the notability of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shivah_9cb3.html" title="The Shivah">The Shivah</a>, not of Mr. Gilbert.

<dd>I don't really understand what you mean by "*professionals*". I'm an administrator just like you or them, and I can close deletions same as you or them. Wikipedia does not have "*professionals*" or special users with added judgmental power. At any rate, regarding your argument (which, being as you are <i>participating</i> in the argument, should really exempt you from <i>closing</i> the argument), Mr. Gilbert himself is not the <i>primary</i> subject of any of the sources you cited (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shivah_9cb3.html" title="The Shivah">The Shivah</a> was, and Gilbert was merely mentioned in connection with that), and WP:BIO states that "The person has been the <b>primary</b> subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person" is a requirement. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 17:01, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>99% of comedy is timing, and this is really not a very amusing time for a joke. Anyway, a relisting of this deletion would benefit the process, and there's really no reason why we shouldn't just run the AfD again. WP:DRV exists to serve certain purposes that may be similar to this, but it is not unusual or inappropriate to just relist a deletion to build a consensus or remedy an out-of-order closing. Why, it just happened recently with another deletion of mine, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Adventures_of_Fatman_2c61.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Adventures of Fatman">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Adventures of Fatman</a>. At any rate, I'm going to have to leave my computer now, so no more of this instant communication -- but please accept that your unconventional AfD closing has led to a confusing situation and the best fix would be to let this AfD run its course. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 17:08, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to me, this article must be deleted:</p>
<ol>
<li>The main topic of the article is unclear.</li>
<li>The article talks about too many topics to be in only one article (about six different topics).</li>
<li>Also, these topics are too different to be in only one article, even if the article is improved in the future, sooner or later, it must be split in many articles.</li>
<li>That is the point, more accurate articles already exist about all the topics in this article (see <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cable.html" title="Cable">Cable</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_network.html" title="Computer network">Computer network</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Frequency_Interference_45ca.html" title="Radio Frequency Interference">Radio Frequency Interference</a>, <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optical_fibers.html" title="Optical fibers">optical fibers</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wireless.html" title="Wireless">Wireless</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrical_conductivity.html" title="Electrical conductivity">Electrical conductivity</a> and more) So this is like a list of few different topics a bit related together.</li>
<li>Of course this article could be improved but it seems like nobody works on this article. The only significative edit is the first one (look at the History) which is also the only one edit by its editor (see User:Bensrob). According to me, if a list of these topics is really useful, wikipedians who used to work on articles related to cabling or connections should work on it.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - lots of coverage because she was a contestant but nothing notable, so delete per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I don't know anything about the show, and I might be mistaken about her notability, so if anyone with more knowledge about the show says she's notable I'll happily change my vote. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayden54_117a.html" title="User:Jayden54">Jayden54</a> 17:29, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The page is poorly written and very NPOV, which I'll freely admit to having wrote it. I didn't make this article with a lot of seriousness, but I still think there is a strong case for a keep. In terms of notability per WP:BIO, I'd place her under <b>Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions.</b> Apart from the records that she broke within the show, she also was the instigator behind key moments this season. Most obvious is her decision to mutiny, which I think is arguably most important moment of the season. And it's not the only one she instigated. The bizarreness surrounding Billy Garcia's exit has to be seen to be fully appreciated. Her role in fish-gate, her breakdowns on exile island, her romance with Adam Gentry, and other moments brought a lot of drama to the show. She was a core member of the major alliances on both opposing tribes. Also, there are already less notable contestants with bigger articles.--Isocyanide 18:06, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ah, remember, <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">"I like it"</a> isn't a good reason to keep an article.

<dd>A lot of what I wrote in the article was just plain mucking around. However, the reasons I have listed for keeping the article can be supported by any website covering Survivor. Heck, if you really want to, you can watch the episodes on CBS' website. And I think I've made more of a case than just "I like it". --Isocyanide 18:56, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - Chortle is far and away the most important and comprehensive UK website for stand-up comedy. Many of these acts may be "obscure" to an American audience or those whose only awareness of stand-up is TV. Chortle is the first choice for finding objective reviews and comment on UK circuit live stand-up comedians and comedy. It has been running for several years and is updated daily. Of course, there is some advertising, but how else would it be commercially viable? <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardx_a8ae.html" title="User:Edwardx">Edwardx</a> 10:43, 22 December 2006 (BST)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I know I'm the one who mentioned the non-notable status of Chortle in discussing the deletion of the Tumbleweed Awards page, but the problem is with the policy that requires us to defer to mainstream media for notability. If this goes on we'll start losing huge chunks of our online culture and, while it may be fuelled by press releases and froth, Chortle is an important part of the British online comedy landscape.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Well, that part of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> usually means the the sources are notable and reputable. All I see are two articles to a regional alternative newsletter. That does not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Also, in the past afd, the above user claims that he is a regular on this message board, which creates much bias and this argument should be discounted. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 00:51, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Nowhere on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does it say "This criterion includes published works in all forms, except for regional alternative newsletters". The <i>Phoenix New Times</i> is both <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>. The article references those articles. Therefore, the article passes.</dd>
<dd>I should also mention that notability of bands, spam, and Alexa are not criteria of AfD for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. I know that you're trying to clean up Wikipedia, but mentioning them only serves to confuse the issue.</dd>
<dd>As for my participation in this AfD, you can look at my contributions and see that I am a consistent editor here and have been so <i>long before</i> the original AfD. This article happens to be on my watch list, and I would participate in the AfD for any of those articles. Besides, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> bars <i>no one</i> from the process, and it seems unfair that you want to render my opinion invalid simply because I also happen to post at The Shizz. <a href="../../../w/y/a/User%7EWyatt_Riot_62dd.html" title="User:Wyatt Riot">Wyatt Riot</a> 02:00, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, posting on that site creates a pretty strong bias which (as afd procedure goes) will affect how much weight your opinion has when the nomination is closed. And the Phoenix New Times is not a notable source at all, it's just a minor regional publication. WP:WEB says that this site/message board is not notable. And that's just how it goes, and if you don't like it, that's too bad. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 02:38, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It seems to me that posting on the site might show evidence of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> for the <i>author</i> of the article, but it seems unfair to discount someone's opinion in an AFD because of their connection with the subject. That just seems like an <i>ad hominem</i> attack, rather than actually dealing with the logical content of their arguments. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 09:45, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>But it does say in afd etiquette: "Please disclose whether you are an article's primary author or if you otherwise have a vested interest in the article." And the above user and showing WP:WEB in an embarrassing level, that's like saying your website got published in a high school newspaper and a zine, and that meets WP:WEB, that isn't true, this page is spammy, has a pitiful alexa rating, and it needs to go. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 15:54, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't disagree. Even if you consider the Phoenix New Times a notable, independent source per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, only one of the articles is <i>about</i> The Shizz, the other only <i>mentions</i> it, and then there is not another source.

<li><b>Redirect</b> to main article and do a <i>complete rewrite</i> of the alleged criticisms. This article rambles, repeats and talks of common MMORPG scams that are hardly unique to MapleStory (Yeah, people know how to rip people off, but is there anything <i>unique</i> about it? "Hey, Wikipedia has a severe bug! You can hit Alt+F4 (⌘W on Mac) to get admin priviledges!" is the oldest trick in the book!) People who cry lack of sources are, in my opinion, understating the problem: This is not well researched anyway (random collection of Stuff without clear view of the big picture), and it's more like a collection of random anecdotes that may or may not be relevant, real, or even interesting. I usually don't think content issues warrant deletion, but this material doesn't appear to be salvageable - it can be left as a redirect though. For now, I believe <a href="../../../m/a/p/MapleStory_f8e7.html#Criticism" title="MapleStory">MapleStory#Criticism</a> is sufficient and beautifully succinct. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 23:55, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Coverted from speedy deletion, it does assert notability (I think lead creative developer on several notable games counts). However, the only source on the talk page which is not directory-style information is an interview. There are no sources in the article itself.

<p>The article belongs in the database for obvious reasons.

<dd>So you are saying that the guy, that we know for certain designed half a dozen arcade games sold all over the world, should not be part of this entry because the article may incorrectly attribute some minor sound sampling on anime movies to him? That's great that you did research. But rather than just exclaiming that you have done research, and therefor you believe you are right, it would really be better if you actually <i>shared</i> the research and then explained why you <i>think</i> you are right. <b>The references to anime movies can be deleted without the entire article being deleted.</b> There is no doubt that Uchida conceived top grossing Sega arcade games.</dd>

<dd>There <i>are</i> concrete sources in the discussion page in regard to the man's history with Sega. Uchida is well known to former and current employees of Sega. He is not exactly a phantom. He deserves his credit for his creations.

<p>Wikipedia is not a game walkthrough guide. This is just a list of non-notable characters in an otherwise-notable game. Nothing in the article asserts the notability of even a single character, let alone the hundreds mentioned. Furthermore, the article has been tagged as OR and unsourced for months yet has never been fixed. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 19:33, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is notable because it gives the background and history of the characters in the game. It is definitely of interest to those who play the game, and it's hardly a "list" - there is a lot of information in there. I've played the game for years, and it's got a lot of background info in there that I didn't know about, although I will definitely agree that citing sources would be most helpful.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, there's nothing that asserts the notability of the characters in the game. Certain characters in a game definitely are notable because they have become known beyond the game itself, have been mentioned in stories or other fiction, etc. If a character from this premade list is notable, then there needs to be a reference to a source indepdent of the publisher of the game that discusses or treats with the character in a non-trivial way; and these sources need to be primarily about the character, not simply a passing reference to their existance in the game. Thus, it isn't that game characters can't be notable (I would agree that many are; <a href="../../../h/k/-/HK-47_1c7d.html" title="HK-47">HK-47</a> from KOTOR or <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minsc.html" title="Minsc">Minsc</a> from Baldur's Gate are good examples of game characters that have achieved notability on their own, because they've become widely recognized as strong characters that have influenced game development. But this article is nothing more than a laundry list of names that would be better served in a gaming wiki, where comprehensive game guids are accepted. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 02:43, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The game is as notable as can be; the pre-made characters (nor any characters in the series, user-created or developer-created) are not even the least bit notable.

<li><b>Delete</b> Because the game is notable does not mean that every character in the game is notable. This is essentially a gameguide.

<li><b>Delete</b> I've played the game for years, but there isn't anything notable about these characters outside of the fandom itself.

<li><b>Comment</b> Now, why are we even looking at this. This article has been looked over before, and was unanimously kept. Isn't there some kind of Double Jeopardy policy in Wikipedia? And if there isn't, there should be. One can just keep nominating an article until they get enough people along to vote for a deletion, even rallying a group of people they know to do such. I'm not saying this is happening, but I find the nominating of an article twice as being very unfair and unprofessional.</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> but remove the material about the church in England to a separate article. The article started with a church in Massachusetts. Then on Nov 7 someone added a church in England unrelated the the original subject, which happened to have the same name of "Emmanuel," which is likely shared by thousands of other churches. As for the Massachusetts church, it has a "Leslie Lindsey Memorial Chapel," which is a memorial to a Lusitania victim, and which may be architecturally notable.<a href="http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/05/07645737/0764573705.pdf" class="external text" title="http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/05/07645737/0764573705.pdf" rel="nofollow">page 93</a> If the architectural notability can be confirmed by independent sources in addition to the cuurch and the guidebook, it should be a keeper.

<dd><b>Comment</b> As I've said in the past <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burnt_Church_First_Nation_d6b6.html" title="Burnt Church First Nation">Burnt Church First Nation</a> was a pure mistake, and I changed my vote to speedy keep immediately after realising this. I'm sorry, but a church where the only source is the church website, and there is not one thing about the notability of the church...I feel that is to be deleted. I'm going to say this again (as I have several times in the past)...I'm not on a <i>crusade</i> as you put it. I feel these churches (which all but one were found from [Category:Church stubs]] are not notable or verifiable enough for a Wikipedia article. This has absolutely nothing to do with my own religious views (as you can see I left several churches that I felt were notable/verifiable), and I would appreciate if you stopped making it seem that way.

<dd>It was clearly written there that it is both a Cathedral and a Basilica. Only few churches in Asia have both these distinctions, and any single of these distinctions makes a church clearly notable. If you do not undestand religion, then please do not touch articles about religion and edit articles about things which you know better. Is this advice hard to understand?

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I'm the main (well, only) creator for this article and should note that it's unlikely that any further sources will be found. It's fairly large, but that's not that great a selling point as we all know. It's pretty much only selling point for notability will be it's record-setting attendance for the local city council, which I can fully attest to its truth, but cannot find a source. I understand notability guidelines and only created the article after seeing other churchs' had entries with even less notability. Can I assume that if I can find an eventual source for the record, I may recreate the article? And I know its a longshot, but would a sermon recounting the record count? --<a href="../../../y/b/b/User%7EYbbor_df13.html" title="User:Ybbor">Ybbor</a><sup><a href="../../../y/b/b/User_talk%7EYbbor_dde6.html" title="User talk:Ybbor"><font color="green">T</font></a></sup> 03:03, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>nonsense and even if you read it carefully, it does not provide any context</li>
<li>non-notable artists, not even if we consider neen notable</li>
<li>they are writing their own bios on wikipedia (users Angeloplessas, Angelo Plessas, Dona tracy, etc; articles Angelo Plessas, Larry Carlson)</li>
<li>far from encyclopedic, despite those sources; the article does not reflect anything from them, so please don't say "But there are sourceeeeeees..."</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>neen is based on a hoax</li>
<li>neen is basically a buzzword with no meaningful art behind it, it is "a still undefined generation of visual artists"</li>
<li>neen, according to the article, "uses or abuses technology", it is a good magical thingy that use computer screens and domains and such, produces art that is "transformative and magical"</li>
<li>neen is, according to Wired, a collection of animations and screenshots stolen from video games</li>
<li>neen is, according to Salon, a virtual exhibition - we got TONS of those on the net, with better quality works!</li>
<li>neen is, in reality, a bunch of poorly made flash animations.</li>
<li>neen basically consist of some men with an enormous appetite for attention (autobio, anyone?); Wikipedia is not the place to achieve this</li>
<li>neensters are speaking bold about open source and filesharing, but they arguing over "stolen techniques"</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's okay and proper for the Art to defy explanation. Regrettably, nebulous topics make lousy articles. Art movements are also difficult things to write articles about; Art movement is as important as its works, and if the works are virtually unknown, well...

Especially if it's Wired (Just call them that you spent $7.50 to found an art movement <i>online</i>, and you get the front page).

<li><b>Delete</b> — what, just because it has a fucking ISBN number it should be kept?!? That is one of the most stupefyingly specious arguments I have ever encountered in my life. Between arguments of that calibre (and I lump the denigration of MONGO's character into the same category) and the idea that just because Griffin is a famous person (in certain highly dubious circles) we must help him promote his book, there is absolutely no good reason offered here as to why this trash should be kept. We need articles on the <i>classics</i>, on books which have made an impact on culture over the centuries and will probably continue to do so in centuries to come. That's what an encyclopaedia is for, not elevating the status of the scribblings of a fringe-confined hack, which, in two year's time, will only be dispersed upon the tides of entropy.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Has one independent ref, seems like an important part of the community. Saying "It seems like any other church and not notable is just saying "I DON'T LIKE CHURCHES" and not a compelling argument for deletion of an article with content and at least one independent reference. Most Wikipedia articles don't even have one independent reference. With one, this is automatically in the top half. There is no reason that churches should be held to a higher standard than episodes of TV shows or most of the other unreferenced articles.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 05:41, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> after some improvements. That church produced a music video for the band Everlife, and two months later Everlife was signed to Disney Records. That's pretty notable. If that information was added, I think it should be kept. Keeponplayin27 13:01, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Since there seems to be no common reason like "Mt. Olive Church of God is a ungodly church" or "There is nothing 'godly' about that church" there really should be nothing to worry about.

<dd><b>Comment</b> But this is a major-label band. FULLY PRODUCING the band's first music video is something notable. If this was an argument about keeping or deleting the organization who produced, for example, Green Day's first music video, or the Rolling Stones' first music video, everyone would be saying 'Keep it! It's part of the band's history!' If Everlife was an indie band that only a handful of people have heard of, it would be different. But they're not. Keep it.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> contra nomination --User:DBD22 23 December 2006 (UTC)- article should be revised and expanded. This Church is a historical site located in the historic centre of the second largest city in Ontario. The congregation was organized on August 29, 1854 - before the founding of the Government of Canada in Ottawa in 1867. The congregation maintains a historical exhibit of artifacts, pictures and mementos of the past. This article could be reworked in a very interesting and informative way - encompasing the history of Southern Ontario and the role played by the this congregation and the witness of faith in Early Canada. At some time, I might be interested in doing this revision, or assisting in some way.</li>

<li><b>Question for Mongo</b> I'm not following you. Which editors do you contend are making a profit? Did the author or publisher edit the article? Is there one of those Amazon links where 5% goes to the referrer? To claim that editors have a profit motive is a serious allegation and the opposite of AGF. What do you base it on? I'm sure you would never smear and besmirch your fellow editors without concrete proof.

<dd>I agree... note that I labeled my note as a "comment"; I'm not arguing for or against deletion. Also, I did not question the word "journalist", just that in my first read of the article, the introduction does not give a sense of the issues raised concerning the book, which are key reasons used in asserting its notability above, e.g. U.S. Government response, NYT mention, book written to refute it, etc. — <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/c/User_talk%7EERcheck_91c5.html" title="User talk:ERcheck">talk</a>) 16:54, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> There are nearly 150 podcast directories on the web, but only two that matter - and this is one of them. And the directory is only part of what the Pickle offers to both podcasters and listeners. If you're going to include podcasting, you need to include ways to find podcasts, as well as resources for podcasters. This site provides an abundance of both, including a very active community of podcasters. Time Magazine picked this out of literally billons of web sites as one of the 50 coolest - that's not trivial. <a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHittman6_222d.html" title="User:Hittman6">Hittman6</a> 23:02, 23 December 2006 (UTC) Hittman6</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> There are references and there are references: meaning, not all references are the same. Time is one of the three or four most important print publications in the world. In my view, a citation as one of the "coolest" sites by Time Magazine is more than enough, in itself, to warrant inclusion in Wikipedia. I'm going to do a little cleanup now.<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulLev_4e67.html" title="User:PaulLev">PaulLev</a> 15:53, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

One of them just listed its position on the best-seller list, which is what it was cited for. All of the references I checked, with exception to the best-seller reference, were critical of the views expressed in the book. While the references seem to push the pov that 9/11 conspiracy theories are part of a "Panoply of the Absurd", the article does not seem to follow either that pov or a pov promoting the contents of the book. <a href="../../../u/m/e/User%7EUmeboshi_5534.html" title="User:Umeboshi">Umeboshi</a> 04:38, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> And quote: <i>"…it has faced allegations ranging from absurdity and fostering anti-Americanism, to anti-Semitism, while the quality of its sourcing and the timing of its publication have given rise to debate within the German publishing industry."</i> So, to have an article in Wikipedia, fringe absurdity opinions on paper qualify for such? No, delete it. Wikipedia is not a tabloid or a platform to propel such propaganda. Lately, it seems anyone can put lies on paper and get it published. This project is not about spreading un-truths. If people keep telling me we are not in the <i>truth</i> business, then why is it some are constantly searching for the <i>truth</i> behind 9/11? For some, the effort to keep articles in Wikipedia about these "made-up-in-school-one-day-subjects" sounds like an agenda against what is fact, and seems as an agenda to spread a hatred of the American govt, and most likely against the American Nation itself.

<li>Why do you think that simply writing about the book (and <i>specifically including criticism of the book</i>) is evidence of promotion of the book?. This book was written by a former German cabinet minister and was a bestseller published by a reputable publishing house.

<p>Rumor Mill: Conspiracy Theories About Sept. 11 Get Hearing in Germany --- Distrust of U.S. Fuels Stories About Source of Attacks; Videos, Hot-Selling Books --- Ex-Cabinet Minister's Tale</p>

<p>MUNICH, Germany -- Andreas von Bulow's book has climbed the German bestseller list, his lectures are jammed and, after two years of mounting frustration, his ideas are gaining traction.</p>
<p>His thesis: The U.S. government staged the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington to justify wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is a tentative theory, he admits, based mostly on his doubt that Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist group launched the attacks. "That's something that is simply 99% false," he said at a reading of his book on the second anniversary of the attacks.</p>
<p>A crackpot? A conspiracy theorist who believes that Elvis lives and the CIA murdered Kennedy? Not exactly. Mr. von Bulow, 66 years old, is a former German cabinet minister, a trim, silver-haired man whose book comes from one of the country's most prestigious publishing houses and who lectures at well-known public institutions. He's not alone: In recent months, Germany's leading broadcaster, ARD, ran a purported documentary making similar claims, while half a dozen other German authors have published like-minded books.</p>

<p>This article is like a school book report. To me this is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. I have read the guidelines and talk pages of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a> and have concluded that there is no real way to clean up an article like this. Is any book from a notable author (i.e. one who has written 2 books selling 5000 copies each ) notable enough to deserve a page? I think not. Also, I conclude that if a page is nothing other than a plot summary, that deleting is the best solution. <a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObina_7738.html" title="User:Obina">Obina</a> 22:51, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> Per nomination. There's nothing in this but the plot summary and nothing to indicate that it has any notability at all.

He would not fall under the above category as he was never a competitor he was always an instructor and promoter of TKD who was instemental in the creation and development of what is TKD. when you ask for third party non-trivial publications he has had articles written about him in every major martial arts magazine I can think of including Black Belt, Budo, TKD &amp; Korean Martial Arts, TKD Times and FightSport. And as far as the links being to this indiduals schools they are not. They are to the Tae Kwon Do Hall of fame and the World Chun Kuhn Do websites.

As to the TKD Hall of Fame the Bio is what they took from his website yes but they also are in the process of scanning and uploading newspaper articles to support their info, here are some they have up now <a href="http://www.lacancha.com/brunei1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lacancha.com/brunei1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacancha.com/brunei1.html</a> <a href="http://www.lacancha.com/brunei2.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lacancha.com/brunei2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacancha.com/brunei2.html</a> <a href="http://www.lacancha.com/brunei3.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lacancha.com/brunei3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacancha.com/brunei3.html</a> the first article is in english the second and third well I am not sure what is the official language of Brunei, more are suppossed to be posted during the next month or so.

<li>Please don't take this personally, as it is not meant as such, but <b>none of the sources you have provided fit the WP:Bio standards</b> as "Third-party verification from a non-trivial publication outside of publications by sponsors of the sport or activity." Here's why:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Http://www.chunkuhndo.com/ - Does not count b/c the site is an advertisement for his book. (See <a href="http://www.chunkuhndo.com/book.html" class="external free" title="http://www.chunkuhndo.com/book.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chunkuhndo.com/book.html</a>)</li>
<li>The Taekwando Hall of Fame (<a href="http://www.lacancha.com/kimbokman.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lacancha.com/kimbokman.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacancha.com/kimbokman.html</a>) - Also does not qualify as a 3rd party source b/c it is a) An advertisement (see <a href="http://www.lacancha.com/tkdbanquet2006.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lacancha.com/tkdbanquet2006.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacancha.com/tkdbanquet2006.html</a>) and b) Published by sponsors of the sport or activity.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.martialartsinprint.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.martialartsinprint.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.martialartsinprint.com/</a> - There is no information about Bok Man Kim on this site. Merely pointing to a "Site under Construction" page and saying that Bok Man Kim is in there is unsufficient.</li>
<li>The newspaper article on Taekwando Hall of Fame - Comes close to a 3rd party site. However: a) We need more information about the source (WP:Bio requirement for non-trivial sources, I have no idea what the "Daily Star" is) and b) The provided article does not state why Bok Man Kim is NOTABLE. It merely states that he went to Brunei.</li>
<li>Also of note, I don't think newspaper articles posted on a site classified as an advertisement or a sponsor of the sport count as 3rd Party Verification.</li>
<li>The Taekwando in Singapore Website (<a href="http://www.taekwondo.sg/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=1" class="external free" title="http://www.taekwondo.sg/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.taekwondo.sg/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=1</a>) - Is this even a real website? Sure, the article on Bok Man Kim works, but every other link returns a database error. It's as if the page was created for displaying one or two pages. 66.251.16.100 14:06, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I would venture to say no" just like noone outside of EPAK schools don't know Ed Parker is, GM kim made 4 Hong Kong films in the 70's if you can read Chinese you can find them I have copys of one of the movies all titles are in Chinese so I am having trouble finding what studio produced.

<p><i>ONE of the founders of a Korean martial art is to visit Bristol to pass on his knowledge at an action-packed seminar. Grandmaster Kim Bok Man will conduct a series of classes for martial arts enthusiasts from around the country and beyond. The Tae Kwon Do expert, who is credited with founding the Korean sport, is one of the most important living names in martial arts circles. And organisers of the seminar believe Grandmaster Kim will attract people from as far afield as Romania, India, Nepal and the USA.</i></p>

<p><b>Littleton is a place, a village</b></p>
<p>What requirement an inhabited village has to make it 'notable' is beyond me! Could you not check my list of CONTRIBUTIONS before chopping???? This is tiresome. Happy Christmas regardless!!

<li>What has your list of contributions got to do with anything? If you look, you'll see that debate is leaning towards keep, as is understandable for an inhabited place. Shouting won't help one way or the other.

<p>Shouting? Come again please? And "What has your list of contributions got to do with anything?". Please try to remain civil yourself, sir. What do you think they might have to do with anything?
