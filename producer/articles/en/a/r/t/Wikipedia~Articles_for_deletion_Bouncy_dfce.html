<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. Even ignoring the sock puppets, there are only 7 more delete votes than merge votes. However, I can't find any article to merge to, as neither Interdictor Webcam or DirectNIC exists. And the concept is too specific to merge to a generic webcam article. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 10:32, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Clarification: I don't mean to say that DirectNIC is not notable, or that using something like "Bouncy" to let you know that a stream is live isn't a good idea, just that "Bouncy" itself is not notable. I would have said merge, but the article (at the time that I listed it for deletion) didn't have hardly anything worth merging. The content there now could be a start for an article on DirectNIC (or similar.) By the way, 500 people knowing about it isn't really a phenomenon (and I'm one of those 500).

<li><b>Keep</b> but move to <i>New Orleans webcam</i> or something. The fact that someone is broadcasting live 24x7 on the internet from the Big Easy, and has been all week, is surely notable. If you haven't seen their <a href="http://www.mgno.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.mgno.com/" rel="nofollow">blog</a>, you should check it out. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 04:39, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> where it is, and maybe rephrase as a general concept that can be applied to any webcam, citing the Interdictor webcam as an example. — <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoredzo_4403.html" title="User:Boredzo">boredzo</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBoredzo_e30b.html" title="User talk:Boredzo">✍</a>) 04:51, <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_7.html" title="September 7">September 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Has the phenomenon of 'bouncy' really taken off _that_ much? I can't say i'd ever heard of it until today. Bouncy could be perhaps mentioned in an article somewhere on wikipedia, but I don't think it needs it's own entry. Also, I don't really think 'bouncy' can possibly be applied as a general term to webcams, seeing as the article mentions it refers instead directly to the No Signal message on the monitor at the back of the webcam image. <a href="../../../k/y/e/User%7EKyelewis_5db9.html" title="User:Kyelewis">Kyelewis</a> 06:22, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To clarify that, I would be more than happy to see an article about the specific webcam, but not the 'bouncy' phenomenon on it's own. <a href="../../../k/y/e/User%7EKyelewis_5db9.html" title="User:Kyelewis">Kyelewis</a> 06:23, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Move</b> to an InterdictorWebcam, OutpostCrystal, or DirectNIC page. I'm another of the folks who've been distantly watching this whole ordeal they've been going through, and can attest that it's notable. A handful of determined folks are managing to keep a large swath of the Internet viable while literally camped out on the 10th floor of a dead office building in a dead city. That's worth a page. I just now did my best to flesh out the page some more, but it really needs more work from more people who have been closer to the story. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevegt_b569.html" title="User:Stevegt">stevegt</a> 08:56, 7 September 2005 (UTC) <small>Vote actually by anonymous user User:66.166.78.130.

<p>I'm that "anonoymous user", now logged in from same IP. And I'm going to modify my vote again, to clarify: keep the content, move it to another page (I take it Wikipedia doesn't support page renames?). While the page title is wrong, the topic is encyclopedic; very few <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disaster_recovery.html" title="Disaster recovery">disaster recovery</a> events are captured in public sources at this level of detail, and Wikipedia's current base of material is painfully thin on this topic. Enterprises consider this proprietary information, leaving practitioners (myself included) in the lurch when it comes to third-party reference material. For example, I worked on a WTC-related recovery, learned a great deal, but can't publish. Grab this material while it's there, put it on another page, encourage more editors (that "to be deleted" banner is a stigma right now) and do it soon, while the sources are still available. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevegt_b569.html" title="User:Stevegt">Stevegt</a> 01:03, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>Move</b> to an InterdictorWebcam, OutpostCrystal, or DirectNIC page. Bouncy did not just serve as entertainment for webcam viewers, but also provided a source of comic relief and exchange between viewers and the OutpostCrystal team. snaxxy <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_7.html" title="September 7">September 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> <small>Vote actually by anonymous User:67.64.73.78</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Bouncy is not just a screensaver or a random collection of pixels. Rather, Bouncy refers to the ideology of normalacy in a time of extreme duress. As NOLA fell into lawlessness, as basic rules of civility werestripped away as quickly as were basic utilities, as the city was besieged by both water and fire while its residents fell over the breaking-point, the bold professionals at DirectNIC succeeded in keeping at least a little corner of the city connected to the world. Bouncy may refer to the screen saver that was the team's mascot, but for those thousands of us who were glued to the news and video feeds that came out of that small office, Bouncy was a symbol of the need to "do as we are doing" and stay the course. The article must stay. User:Blackrobe:Blackrobe <small>Vote actually by anonymous user at User:66.91.152.125</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's an article about a clever little graphic on a web feed. Yes, a web feed from NOLA, but it takes a drastic stretch of plausibility to go from hurricane stricken area (very notable) to web feed about area (perhaps notable because few exist) to animated mascot of web feed (shockingly not notable). Oh, and no merge. I really would hate to see the word "Bouncy" be a redirect to a webcam page. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcelight_76ef.html" title="User:Icelight">Icelight</a> 17:27, September 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I would possibly support inclusion of an article on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interdictor.html" title="Interdictor">Interdictor</a>, DirectNIC, or Outpost Crystal, as part of the history of a major disaster (and specifically the effect of the Internet on public response to disasters); however "Bouncy" itself is not notable as an article subject, and surely is no more than a short mention, if at all, in an article on one of the subjects above. -- <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 22:45, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Move</b> or <b>merge</b>. Subject is very notable. The name is not; I'm an avid reader of the blog but have never been able to see the webcam. Article should be about the DirectNIC post-Katrina experience, not just the webcam. Given comments above perhaps a good name for the article would be Operation Crystal, which would reference the event as a whole rather than just the webcam. Perhaps needs to be cleaned up to a higher standard of quality. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> 22:17, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Move</b> to another page, editing to keep to new name/topic. I would suggest Outpost Crystal or <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interdictor.html" title="Interdictor">Interdictor</a>, possibly DirectNIC though that might smack of advertising (or even create a redirect from each, directing to a central page), as these are perhaps the most recognizable names associated with this notable, direct, and extremely up-close source of Katrina NOLA relief efforts.
