<p>Appears to be a joke. There are two references to establish this entry. The first gives the definition, not of <i>tryanny</i>, but of "<i>tryanny <b>of numbers</b></i>", which is almost certainly a typo for <i>tyranny of numbers</i>. In fact, the link to the glossary page shows <i>tyranny</i>, not <i>tryanny</i>.</p>
<p>The second reference is to the title of an article by Henry Kissinger, where the body of the article refers to tyranny.</p>
<p>There is nothing to support it is anything but a typo for <i>tyranny</i>.</p>

<dd><b>Keep</b>. For two reasons. (1) - (less important) - the London wikiProject is busily going through all these at the moment expanding them into reasonable articles. (2) - (more important) - the inner London areas are called by these names in common speech. If you go to London you'll hear people using these terms in much the same way that they'd use the names of suburbs in other cities.

<p>Hi Kevin. I like your demonstration. In fact, I've done one too on the same topic. <b>Delete</b> - no encyclopedic content and probably vanity. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolGuy_a681.html" title="User:CoolGuy">CoolGuy</a> 05:17, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yup, I'm for the <b>deletion</b> of this. I have a feeling this article sprung up because I kept removing this same info from the <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcasting.html" title="Podcasting">podcasting</a> article, it's just too much irrelevant niche information. <a href="../../../a/d/m/User%7EAdm58_3a04.html" title="User:Adm58">Adm58</a> 05:44, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I didn't write this; someone who knows me and my work on Podcasting did. I'm in a quandary, as it seems I'm not supposed to make it more useful myself (by, say, listing the other mass-adoption technologies I have built ) but instead to rely on the kindness of strangers to do so. Have I got this straight? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Marks_8699.html" title="User:Kevin Marks">Kevin Marks</a> 07:54, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm against the deletion of this, which I also didn't write.</p>
<p>There are two separate issues here: 1) Is the original entry encyclopedic? No. 2) Would a useful entry about Kevin Marks be appropriate to Wikipedia? Yes.</p>
<p>Kevin Marks (Principal Engineer at Technorati) is a very well-known and influential person in blog circles, both for his technological savvy and for his interesting comments. At Bloggercon 1, he was the undisputed hero of the gathering--see this blog entry for details: <a href="http://betsydevine.weblogger.com/2003/10/05#a651" class="external free" title="http://betsydevine.weblogger.com/2003/10/05#a651" rel="nofollow">http://betsydevine.weblogger.com/2003/10/05#a651</a></p>
<p>I have tried to make the entry more encyclopedic , because I do think it would be useful to many people. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">Betsythedevine</a></p>

<dd>A suggestion which might get around the letter of the Wiki-law (well, it bends it a little, perhaps...) Kevin - write an article about yourself as your user page, and tell us when you've done it. Another Wikipedian can then use that as reference material for writing an improved <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Marks_2bd8.html" title="Kevin Marks">Kevin Marks</a> article. (You can always blank the user page again once it's done, or ask a friendly admin to do it for you&#160;:) <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>|<sup><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">hello?</a></sup> <a href="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c8/Grutness.jpg/25px-Grutness.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="10" longdesc="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" /></a> 13:50, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Criteria for inclusion of biographies seems strongly biased against those of us who work in non-traditional media. I have produced CD-ROMs that sold in excess of 2 million copies, and museum installations viewed by hundreds of thousands, yet as these aren't Audio CDs or books, they are not discussed there. Again, this is not autobiography: I am attempting to avoid that. Grutness's suggestion seems a good one. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Marks_8699.html" title="User:Kevin Marks">Kevin Marks</a> 08:30, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> reasonable stub, but Grutness suggestion is perfect. The best article would be about Kevin - what he's done and how he contributed to podcasting, rather than a verbatim record of a speach he gave. I got to this page whilst researching Podcasting and it really doesn't give me much information about Kevin - but there should be some there so I say keep the page and improve it. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamphlett_a30c.html" title="User:Damphlett">Damphlett</a> 08:00, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Ain't meant as a policy page - it's just meant as a list. I keep seeing examples where a band doesn't meet criteria for inclusion, but seems notable enough to go on a list of local bands. Like I say on the article's talk page, I am not in a band myself and don't have a horse in this race.

<li><b>Delete</b>, if the band is not notable it shouldnt be on wikipedia period. Having a list like this could be seen as a way to circumvent the music notability guidelines so I dont agree with it on principle. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If it doesn't meet the guidelines, it's out. We could argue how many of these guidelines are needed for inclusion, but listing local non-notable bands only serves to circumvent established guidelines. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:12, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Fine, delete, delete - but if a <i>list</i> of small-time bands is beyond the pale, then actual <i>articles</i> about small-time bands should be, too. These don't seem to be dealt with as stringently. That's why I created this page in the first place: as a soft landing place for those vanity band pages that seem to hang around forever - a place that would allow Wikipedia's band coverage to be de-cluttered, but <b>gently</b> so. After all, there are a lot of band pages hanging around that don't meet criteria, but which no one actually has the heart to <b>delete</b>. This was supposed to help fix that. <a href="../../../m/c/s/User%7EMcsweet_0b85.html" title="User:Mcsweet">Mcsweet</a> 09:34, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you are aware of any bands that don't meet the inclusion criteria laid out at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, go ahead and list them on VfD (or let me know on <a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">my talk page</a>). There is usually little argument against deletion unless someone discovers verifiable information that shows the band in question is notable.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I think that local music subcultures have a place within Wikipedia..not exactly as a list, however. I think it could be very useful if such a thing could be done with the local bands of major cities.

<li>In its current form it's unencyclopaedic, but I think it could be improved if given context. A female vice chancellor at an Indian university might be notable enough to merit inclusion; I know absolutely nothing about Indian gender politics or higher education (whether or not this is a significant university) and therefore don't feel I can vote, but I ask for input from anyone who <i>does</i> know. <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinabik80_d67b.html" title="User:Binabik80">Binabik80</a> 16:17, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The fountain of inspiration part is probably overblown, and being a <i>female</i> university administrator per se (in the country of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indira_Gandhi_d446.html" title="Indira Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a>) probably doesn't do it, but there's a good chance Vice Chancellor is an important position. I know in other countries the Vice Chancellor is commonly also the university's President and chief executive officer while the Chancellor is a titular head. Verifiability is iffy as the only hit for +vinodini +tarway is a Wikipedia mirror, but I see no reason not to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>.

<li>My comments - In India Vice Chancellor is the highest authority of an University and a Vice Chancellor reports directly to the Governor of an Indian state. Governor acts as Chancellor for all the Universities located within a state. As regards the verifiability of the facts, a call to the present Vice Chancellor of that University would be sufficient. I donot know his name or tele number. There will be hundreds of documentary evidences to prove that there was a Vinodini Tarway who became a Vice Chancellor. Actually, I can expand the article with a lot of inputs. Anyway ... life is like that ... By the way, she was also the first woman vice chancellor of any University in Bihar, very few among Indian women vice chancellors, postgraduate with a PhD etc. etc.--<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 16:15, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I also thank you for your insight. I myself searched hard on several search engines, could not get her name, except some info on Vinobha Bhave University and the present Vice Chancellor's name, etc. with a remarks: list of former vice chancellors will be updated or something like that, tele-no of the university was there, may be old, I am not sure, as during last one/two years several telephone numbers have changed. But, if one is really interested, one can surely get the correct telephone number. I have updated certain information.

<p>(And the redir to it, Holly Ivoska--zero hits.) Apparently they run the Daddy Zero and have little other notability. Joseph supposedly is associated with Toosquare magazine (next), but <i>toosquare "joseph w murphy"</i> gets zero hits. Another from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=12.10.248.51" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=12.10.248.51" rel="nofollow">User:12.10.248.51</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 06:20, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>While hits might be at zero all the information listed is true and factual. Toosquare Magazine is/was an important cultural entity in the tampa area. The Joseph W Murphy and Holly Ivoska pages are being expanded to include important local cultural references to large concert events, death metal bands, and other items of 'note' that these two are/were involved in. (Note from Binabik80: posted by 12.10.248.51)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'll copy-and-paste my comments from the Brian Collins VFD discussion. I fully own up to not being a Wikipedia regular but from what I know of the site's policies, this is certainly notable. Search for "boom goes the dynamite" on Google. His inept bumbling has spread all over the world; they've even appropriated the phrase on SportsCenter. <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Kornheiser_59c4.html" title="Tony Kornheiser">Tony Kornheiser</a> did an entire radio segment on the lad (see <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/arash_markazi/04/22/college.blog/index.html" class="external text" title="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/arash_markazi/04/22/college.blog/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>), and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Van_Pelt_9c51.html" title="Scott Van Pelt">Scott Van Pelt</a> said "It has cult status at this point.

I think if you're mentioned on the sportsillustrated.cnn.com website (the former link), you're definitely notable. It's Internet lore, like the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_kid_473a.html" title="Star Wars kid">Star Wars kid</a>. If Wikipedia has room for that, it would be hypocritical to delete this. (By the way, Google is 1000 hits now, evincing the phrase's rapid rise in popularity. It's been sampled for radio promos all over <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>, the clip was shown in <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, the phrase was used on <a href="../../../s/p/o/SportsCenter_52cb.html" title="SportsCenter">SportsCenter</a>..."boom goes the dynamite" has entered our collective consciousness. Anyway if you want to dismiss my comments simply because I'm a non-regular go ahead, but I'll note that I ventured here specifically to look for Brian Collins and boom goes the dynamite!.)</li>

<p>Neologism. The only google web hit for +Neototalitarism +Rendón (or Rendon) is a Wikipedia mirror. About 65 web hits for this term, 55 for Neototalitarian and 24 for Neototalitarianism; they don't seem to show a common meaning for the terms, just a bunch of people recreating the neologism. Redirecting to <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a> would suggest a troublesome precedent that obscure neologisms should just redirect to a related word, which would validate those neologisms before demonstration they even had commonly accepted meanings. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 18:48, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Delete, and many kudos to Samaritan for his informative and useful nomination style. A lot of noms (sometimes my own, I confess) make it hard to tell what the article is about, and thus whether or not people might be interested in the topic being discussed. This, on the other hand, is crystal clear. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 19:32, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Comment'</i> (no vote) Well all VfDs have a link to the article, which you should always click before discussing. Sometimes it's a good idea to look at the article history too, before commenting. I also think Samaritan is being a good guy, but let's not do anything to encourage people to vote without actually looking at the article. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:28, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think what Meelar means is that people skim VfD looking to decide which articles to look at/vote on based on their areas of interest, and the nomination text can help. —<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 00:32, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep as is</b> This is not vanity. It's about a piece of internet lore, similar to the "Star Wars kid," although less known. Wikipedia is a good place for finding out about these little pieces of internet legend, so I think we should keep the article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I fully own up to not being a Wikipedia regular but from what I know of the site's policies, this is certainly notable. Search for "boom goes the dynamite" on Google.

<li>It's a school. All schools are more notable than tens of thousands of things that have an article. This is not a mere academic encyclopedia, but a complete reference library.

<li>I'm sorry if Oliver Chettle appears a little impatient, he seems to be forgetting that some people are new to the whole school notability <s>battle</s> controversy. My perspective is that schools are important, but there are great numbers of them and they are somewhat generic, so it might be best to merge some of the weaker articles.

<li><b>Keep</b>; the rewrite, and the comments of those voters not concerned with making snide remarks but with improving Wikipedia, have convinced me that I was over-hasty.

<p>Article looks a lot like another essay that is not <i>quite</i> encyclopedic material. Several definite statements are made which are everything but uncontested or uncontestable. For example, the first four sentences contain four statements which would provide enough questions for about 40 books; they can under no circumstances be left like this.

<li>Frankly, even though I welcome collaborative efforts and everything, there is a difference between articles and essays, and this is not an article. Weaseling around with the definitions will not help, either - for WP purpose one does not re-define a term, although of course one can concentrate on a particular usage. Then there is the title, which is extremely useless for this article. "Gender construction" could be a much wider topic, after all, the world does not consist of Europe in the Renaissance only. And "why gender" is a question (which is not even remotely answered in the article/essay, either), and a question is usually not exactly a good article title. Not to mention that WP lives from the linking between articles, and who is ever going to link to an article with that title in a text link? Same, BTW, goes for some of the other titles of other articles you choose. Making tons of redirects which, should articles be written which fit those redirect titles much better than this one, will not lead to it any more, and are therefore not exactly helpful, either. Seriously, you missed the point of the Wikipedia with this article (but also with at least parts of the other articles). Articles are articles, and essays are essays. If you want to put essays somewhere, try Wikibook. If you want to edit Wikipedia, you will have to write articles. Oh, and kindly stop that renaming, doubling, and making of redirects. Somebody will have to clean up after you, and the admins have better things to do. Lastly: I did not write this to discourage you from participating in Wikipedia, but to help you become better contributors. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 19:54, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Userfy</b> It's a draft page in a subspace of Why Gender. And redirected from there? What's this? Oh hmm, well anyway, right idea, wrong spot. Move it to the relevant user space, and users can stick it back on the wiki when done. Essays are okay, we can wikify them better later, especially from user space.

<li><b>Userfy</b> is OK with me; presumably, under these circumstances, it would be understood that a subsequent re-creation of the article, in proper form, would not be a candidate for speedy deletion. To the authors: I've looked at this article and a few of the others, not the whole set, but your main problem is that we don't publish original research. A scholarly paper would try to add something new to further the discussion, but an encyclopedia article merely reports on the discussion. I assume some passages in these articles are intended to summarize the thoughts and arguments that have already been presented by experts in the field. In those instances, you should step back one pace from the discussion, and describe the different views or schools of thought, with proper attribution. For an example from a completely different field, see our article on <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steady_state_theory.html" title="Steady state theory">Steady state theory</a>. It tells the reader about a group of physicists, summarizes their beliefs, names the most prominent proponents of the theory, presents its strengths and weaknesses, and assesses its current status among experts in the field. You should be especially careful to avoid stating a conclusion or an interpretation as if it were an observed fact. (A prime example in this article is the beginning of the second paragraph. These statements may be considered self-evidently true in some circles, but Wikipedia articles are written for the general reader, and statements like these should be attributed to the scholars who've propounded them.) <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 08:41, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>If this article is really causing anyone distress, then why not help by posting your own research. This would be much more productive than merely throwing around juvenile put-downs. It is important to realize that regardless if you agree with someone's work, it doesn't discount the effort and time that went into writing it.</p>

<dd>Well, sorry to have to say that, but Wikipedia is <i>not</i> the place to publish original research, no matter how much work went into it. Wikipedia is for articles, not essays. So if people do not want to write articles, then deleting the results of that is not a "juvenile put-down" but simply household cleaning. As I have told you before, if you want to publish essays, or course efforts that are not articles, or the like, do it on Wikibooks (or get a webpage). Oh yes, and sign your comments with -- ~~~~ ; otherwise somebody has to do it for you, as Eric119 had to.

<p>I do not think the article should be deleted. However, neither should it be a whitewash. While a new edition of F.A.T.A.L. may remove many of the things which were criticized in the 'Atrocities Review', there can be no doubt that the initial verison did contain such items, and such criticism was warranted, if not embraced by the game's designers. I have just edited the page to be more neutral, and hopefully this neutral text will not be removed by anyone who wishes to erase history. Lest anyone doubt the veracity of the Atrocities Review, there are many copies of the original version of F.A.T.A.L. in circulation, and anyone can see for themselves that accusations of misogyny and rape, whether true or untrue, were entirely warranted taking into account the game's initial meaning and its content (both art and text). <small>Comment made by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.88.223.126_9e03.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.88.223.126">66.88.223.126</a></small></p>
<p>F.A.T.A.L. is little more than some guy's home made roleplaying game. As other such amateur project are not deserving of an encyclopedia article, I fail to see why F.A.T.A.L. does. Currently, the article reads like a press release. Unless Wikipedia has become free space for advertisement, it should be deleted. <small>Comment made by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.201.34.195_256b.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.201.34.195">69.201.34.195</a></small></p>
<p>Response to previous comment: It is worthy of an entry not because it is someone's homemade RPG, but because it created a firestorm of debate in the RPG community. The entry should be less about the game and more about the phenomenon, perhaps, but it should not be erased from history. Edit (and if necessary, prevent it from being re-edited to read like a press release), but do not delete.-aeon <small>Comment made by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.88.223.126_9e03.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.88.223.126">66.88.223.126</a></small></p>

<p>Either it should be deleted - because other folks' homebrews don't usually get their own pages - or it should document the controversy, which is noteworthy. The page as it stands is a wholly one-sided account of that controversy that glosses over the serious accusations that have been made against it. If you look at the page's talk page, you will see that I have provided a laundry list of things I see as incredibly non-NPOV about the page as it stands. It was also asserted on said talk page that the review I added the link to was full of lies and statements taken out of context; if you read the author's own rebuttal you will see that in fact only two things are described as out of context, and no clarifying context is provided.</p>
<p>Thus, the current article needs a thorough rewrite or to be deleted. <a href="../../../t/e/u/User%7ETeucer_4752.html" title="User:Teucer">teucer</a> 00:14, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Delete</b>Firestorm of debate? Lots of things cause a firestorm of debate within a spoecific community. If this were an RPG-specific encyclopedia, there might *might* be merit to it. But to the world at large, it is not even a worthwhile footnote. Someone wrote something offensive. People took offense. That guy and a few supporters and sock puppets fanned the flames. This is just business as usual on an internet forum. <small>Comment made by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.201.34.195_256b.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.201.34.195">69.201.34.195</a></small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b> One might say that entries such as <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scree-Fice_42d5.html" title="Scree-Fice">Scree-Fice</a> are also not worthwhile footnotes to the community at large. Like F.A.T.A.L., that originated on RPG.net, and apparently warrants an entry. If that's worth keeping then I'd wager this is too. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeonite_09dc.html" title="User:Aeonite">aeonite</a></p>
<p><b>Delete</b> It is obvious to me that FATAL's developers are going to remain determined to corrupt any attempts at a neutral article. Given that the game itself is largely insignificant to the RPG community as a whole, but for a spat of flame wars it developed, I see no reason why it even needs an article. Especially since keeping it NPOV seems to require a constant 24 hour campaign to ensure that users like <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_9414.html" title="User:Almafeta">Almafeta</a> don't persist in using the article, and Wikipedia, as their own personal advertising venue.</p>
<p>Too much effort, for too little value. JArcane</p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. Executive summary for vfd types: So it's an excerable 900 page self-published PDF <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">role-playing game</a> full of rape and misogyny that attracted much understandable derision, and little to no following I can track down. Sample sentence: "Should any anus be stretched beyond the limit as determined by the table below, which differs from anus to anus, the orifice will rip to accommodate the incoming object. First, consider all relevant modifiers, then roll percentile dice and proceed to the following table." I'm still an inclusionist, but I couldn't in good conscience support keeping this without saying we should have articles on any given post on <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alt.sex.stories.html" title="Alt.sex.stories">alt.sex.stories</a>. <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=fatalgames.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=fatalgames.com" rel="nofollow">No Alexa rank</a> for fatalgames.com. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 03:38, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Delete</b> This is Oddsod and I agree with JArcane. It is clear that any attempt at presenting FATAL's history on a freely editable Wikipedia article will be rewritten by employees of that development group. It is difficult to seem neutral on the topic, I agree - but then it is difficult to discuss the content of FATAL (such as recurring references to excrement, the excretory and reproductive systems of men and women, frequent misogyny and rape) without seeming biased. I do not believe Wikipedia should serve as advertising space. <small>Comment made by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.176.81.196_68fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.176.81.196">24.176.81.196</a></small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Heaven knows we cover harder things on Wikipedia, so potential bias shouldn't be a reason. But a self-published online shock game with no real following is not remotely encyclopedic. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 04:54, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is not that the game itself is anything noteworthy in terms of shock value - humanity is endlessly inventive at this sort of thing and history is full of it. It is more that the people who wrote the original game, or their current employees, are actively trying to suppress the facts about their creation's subject matter. At the same time they are shamelessly lying and accusing everyone who presents a factually neutral opinion on that game while trying to turn the Wikipedia article into free advertising space. I do not believe that Wikipedia really needs articles that cause this much needless trouble. - Oddsod.</dd>

<li>Response to previous message. Whether <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scree-Fice_42d5.html" title="Scree-Fice">Scree-Fice</a> should have an entry is not important to the issue at hand. (and may be the logical fallacy <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_wrongs_make_a_right.html" title="Two wrongs make a right">Two wrongs make a right</a>) But if it would make you happy, by all means, put <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scree-Fice_42d5.html" title="Scree-Fice">Scree-Fice</a> up for deletion, too. And any other entry you can think of to avoid this kind of ground shifting.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I don't think the article should be deleted. I think it should be rewritten so that it is more objective. I was the original writer of this article, and I attempted to report it in such a way that would briefly describe the system, and explain why it had such infamous animosity in the RPG community. I'm thankful for the people who were more informed on the system and who could provide more information, but I feel people should try and leave value judgements out of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, we may feel strongly about the game. But let's keep that to the forums, and provide an impartial description here, okay?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable. Controversy about the wikipedia article doesn't make the game inherently notable, especially when there appears to be essentially zero interest in the game aside from the controversy which the game creators clearly courted. Just because something is really ugly, that alone doesn't make it encyclopedic. If someone wants to write an article about misogyny in gaming and use F.A.T.A.L. as an example, go ahead, but F.A.T.A.L. itself is non-notable. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 21:20, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Further comment on the notability of this article. Investigation of the FATAL_Creations Yahoo Group reveals a whopping 11 members, only 2 of which are regularly active, with another three or so contributing periodically, among them <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_9414.html" title="User:Almafeta">Almafeta</a>. Whether Almafeta was indeed an official employee remains unclear, however her contributions were responsible for a number of major changes to both the game mechanics, and the game's marketing. As such I would suggest that said user remains of questionable NPOV in respects to authoring the article. JArcane</li>
