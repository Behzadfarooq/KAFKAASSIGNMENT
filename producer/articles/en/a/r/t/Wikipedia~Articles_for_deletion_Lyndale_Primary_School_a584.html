<li><b>Keep</b>. Can someone please explain the logic behind the argument 'high/secondary schools are notable, but primary/elementary are not'?

<li>I suppose to me at least it's the maturity level of the students. High Schools are often a place where strong memories are formed; where the beginnings of a trade are learned, and they are typically larger institutions than primary/elementary schools—often graduating tens of thousands of students while they are in service. So I think there's a weak case for High Schools being called notable. I don't see one for primary/elementary schools, unless they're unique in some respect. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 15:59, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't buy the notion that any schools, high schools included, have automatic, inherited "notability" or worthiness for an article. One could make a reasonably logical argument though for the cultural importance of high schools in American/Canadian culture as pointed out by RJH. 30 years from now, people will still be attending High School Reunions... nobody formally gets together with the people they attended middle/jr high with. Also consider that HS is the first level of schooling that gives students some sort of usable certification of learning (i.e. a diploma). Of course IMO, having a hard cutoff for HS leads into the possibility of systemic/cultural bias as pointed out by Markb above. Of course to me, it is preferable to judge each article on it's actual merits rather than blanket "school = keep" or "school = delete".--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:01, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I don't see any "long established precedent" for keeping this article.

<li>This does not appear to be setting any kind of precedent.

<li>This was not "hashed" out. A discussion happened, and no decision was reached. This is very different from you running around making claims that precendents were set, and that schools are somehow inherently notable. The reason there is often no consensus on these votes is because you have an organised project to show up and block vote them into stalemate. However, I do appreciate your sincere concern over how I use my time though. I like to make a suggestion of my own. Maybe you should spend your time more productively, say, by not making false assertions about past discussions in order to mislead people planning to vote here?
