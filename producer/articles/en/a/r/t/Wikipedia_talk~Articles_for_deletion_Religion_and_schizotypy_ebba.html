<ul>
<li>This is such a small amount of information that it should be merged into another article. Forcing everyone to wait around a week, and to VOTE on it is stupid and anti-wiki.</li>
<li>People should simply make suggestions on the talk page <b>as usual</b> and make edits and merges <b>as usual</b></li>
<li>It is asinine to generate 5 times more discussion than the amount of text involved here.</li>
</ul>

<p>Someone asked me on my talk page about the result I called here. This is a copy of my reply. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:32, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for asking. We can compare and discuss the votes and see if it would have changed the result.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the interests of transparency, this is the method I use for counting a vote:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Firstly I look at the article history. During this phase I don't read the article or the VfD, I just look at the editing history of everybody who has participated in the discussion.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I have pretty strict standards. I expect someone to have edited for one month and to have done at least 100 edits before showing an interest in VfD. At this stage, I also often reject votes from people who haven't done much editing in articles, or those who wouldn't qualify by the standards above if one ignored a small number of edits many months ago. People who appeared recently and made a bee-line for VfD are regarded with particular suspicion.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Then when I've decided whose opinions matter and whose are to be discounted, I step through the edit history of the VfD, recording each vote that I find.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Sorry, I don't take any notice of strike-outs by persons other than the person who placed the original edit. Deciding who can and cannot vote is something that <i>I</i> do and the on-page bickering about who can and cannot vote is completely ignored, because by the time I've seen it I already know at least as much about the editing history of the participants as they know about one another.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>

<li>In my original count, I placed Robchurch in the "keep" column by accident. But it doesn't make any difference to the result. I'll explain.</li>

<ul>
<li>When the votes are in, I look to see if the numbers match my standard for a clear consensus (80%+ for any option). There wasn't.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Then I look for the possibility of my establishing a rough consensus (anything in the range 70-80%). On this range I use my discretion and may be swayed by the arguments one way or another. 72% and convincing arguments beats 71% and a lot of handwaving. There wasn't such a possibility. The numbers were wrong.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If there isn't a rough consensus, the policy is to default to keep the article. So I kept. This doesn't preclude redirecting, merging, etc, but anyone can do that.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I made an error in counting Robchurch's keep vote. If I counted it, the vote was 12 votes to delete, 7 votes to keep and two others (12 out of 21 to delete, 57%). If I discounted it as I should have, the vote was 12 votes to delete, 6 votes to keep and 2 others (12 out of 20 to delete, 60%). It doesn't come close to 70%, where I would start thinking of calling a consensus, or 80%, where I would call an unquestionable consensus.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I didn't get to the point of looking at the article. I don't know or care what it's about. I would have read it if the vote had been closer.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Note that with 6 keep votes and 16 delete votes, and 2 others, I would have been calculating 16 out of 24 to delete, about 67%. Still not enough to make me start thinking about rough consensus. There are some sysops who would call that a rough consensus, but I'm not one of those.</li>

<p>In later discussion, it emerged that User:Khuhly (one of those excluded) was an admitted sock puppet of <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielsimon_92ed.html" title="User:Gabrielsimon">User:Gabrielsimon</a>. Some of the other excluded voters asked me to consider excluding Gabrielsimon's vote; I consulted two other administrators who are familiar with Gabrielsimon's case, and our conclusion was that his vote should be counted. I was also asked to consider counting the excluded voters. While I don't intend to do this, I thought it would be a good idea to run an impact analysis to see if incorporating those votes would have changed the result.</p>
<p>The excluded votes were as follows:</p>

<p>User:Khuhly's vote was still eliminated because it's a proven sock puppet, and Gabrielsimon himself has said that he thinks it would be fair to exclude it.</p>
<p>So the excluded votes worked out as 4 delete, 1 merge and 1 keep.</p>
<p>The revised result would be as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I would have 16 votes to delete, 7 votes to keep, and 3 others. We'd have a delete vote of 16 out of 26, or 61%. I'd still default to keep.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Some people asked me to exclude Gabrielsimon. I consulted with Ed Poor and SlimVirgin and they both opposed this. My vote was in favor of exclusion but was outweighed by theirs.</p>
<p>But if I <i>had</i> excluded his keep vote, what would have happened?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I would have 16 votes to delete, 6 votes to keep, and 3 others. We'd have a delete vote of 16 out of 25, or 64%. Still a default to keep.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that some administrators adopt the relatively generous "2/3" standard for consensus. Even by this standard, and even excluding Gabrielsimon's vote and including all other excluded votes that were not from admitted sock puppets, we don't make 2/3, or 66.7%.</p>
<p>I am thus confident that nothing in my tallying of votes affected the outcome. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 15:12, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
