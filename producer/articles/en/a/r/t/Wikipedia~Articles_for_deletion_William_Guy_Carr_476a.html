<p><b>Nomination</b>: Back in October of last year, I prodded this article on the grounds of lack of notability. The prod was disputed with the edit summary "remove {PROD}: conspiracy nut or not, notable". The resulting discussion stated that Carr's notability was due his impact on other conspiracy theorists, and conspiracy theory in general. I commented (see <a href="../../../w/i/l/Talk%7EWilliam_Guy_Carr_755c.html#Why_is_this_person_notable.3F" title="Talk:William Guy Carr">Talk:William Guy Carr#Why is this person notable?</a>) that while this might be a valid reason to keep the article, the article did not, in fact, discuss this aspect of his life ... it barely mentions his impact on conspiracy theories (the article cites only one conspiracy theorist influenced by Carr, and that in passing). I asked that this information be added to the article. I recieved no reply, nor was the article edited to include this information. Now, after waiting several months, I re-submit the article for deletion based on several grounds: Notability (Dispite the reasons for opposing the prod, no evidence has been presented that he has had any great impact on onther conspiracy theories), <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a> (his claims are definitely on the loonier side and do not meet the criteria for inclusion), as well as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (the only references are to Carr's own books; other statements are completely unsourced). <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 17:01, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>weak delete</b> there is some reference to effect on conspiracy theorists inside the article, but that should have been sourced much better in the last few months <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoutf_9ee7.html" title="User:Arnoutf">Arnoutf</a> 20:15, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Keep</b>. I de-PRODded because my Gsearch turned up points like these:
<ul>
<li><i>Pawns in the Game</i> has a reasonably good sales rank and number of reviews at Amazon, and it is impressive in itself that the book is still in print after more than 50 years, especially since there is no shortage of fresher conspiracy books to choose from.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pawns-Game-William-Guy-Carr/dp/0911038299" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Pawns-Game-William-Guy-Carr/dp/0911038299" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
<li>References to his influence on Ted Gunderson like this one: "Ted Gunderson told me that he too, was totally unaware of the NWO agenda-even though he worked for the FBI for 28 years(retired in 1979)- until someone gave him the book Pawns in the Game by William Guy Carr."<a href="http://educate-yourself.org/lte/towhomicanhelp28oct04.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://educate-yourself.org/lte/towhomicanhelp28oct04.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, lacking sources and citations don't make me usually vote keep. The subject of the article is definitely notable for his (believed) conspiracy theories that get quoted over and over again. The article fails to show that, and lacks neutral references. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 00:42, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The absence of any independently verifiable sources which indicate the importance of the theories and attribute them to the author undermines the majority of content in the article. Tracing the history of the article those who assert notability have been unwilling, or unable, to provide substantiation for this notability. There has been plenty of opporunity to demonstrate it and there has been plenty of opportunity to avoid the need for AfD.ALR 15:32, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete:</b> After reading the article, it seems the only notability is his WWIII claim; he was alive during the actual two wars and served, so those statements are undeniably accurate. However, the WWIII claim sounds just like Nostradamus or any of a hundred other predictors of doom (Revelations, even), and therefore, there's no assertion of notability. A lot of people don't know things until they read books; that alone does notr assert notability. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 17:45, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Also, take a closer look at his non-conspiracy book on his submarine experiences in World War I, <i>By Guess and By God</i>. It is prefaced by his superior, Admiral SS Hall who commanded the British Submarine Service, and published in 1930 by Hutchinson &amp; Co. (a "real" publisher).

<dd>Only if you add it to the article. It does us no good here. FYI... I have no problem withdrawing this AfD nomination if the article actually <i>is</i> edited to include discussion of his notability and impact on conspiracy theory.

<dd>I'd question who the reprints are by, the Amazon link up above is to a 28 year old version printed by a niche, almost private, press. One non conspiracy theory book does not constitute notability.ALR 18:48, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, the copies of <i>BGBG</i> are not reprints, but subsequent printings by the original publisher. Nor was Hutchinson some dinky basement press (e.g., they were the UK publisher for <i>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</i>), before they were swallowed up by Random House in 1989. In the US, an edition was published by Doubleday. And while I'd contend that one book can establish notability if it sells well enough, in fact that was not his only book. He wrote more naval books, also published by Hutchinson. His <i>Checkmate in the North</i> was published by Macmillan. Only later in his writing career did he become a full-time conspiracist.</dd>
<dd>I've also added a quote from a University of Kentucky Press author describing Carr as "the most influential source of the American Illuminati demonology," providing the mainstream validation of his importance that has been clamored for. With Berlet and Pipes and the others I cited above, one had to infer that they believed Carr was "influential" from the fact that they were writing about him; Ellis calls him so explicitly. Some may still not be satisfied, but frankly, I think it's already been demonstrated that he is more notable than many entries. To me, it seems like the skepticism about his notability boils down to the following logic: "His theories are plainly too loony for any person in their right mind to believe. The vast majority of people are in their right mind. Therefore, it's impossible that enough people take him seriously to make him notable." However, the human capacity to believe has allowed many "loony" beliefs to find millions of adherents (sometimes even a society's majority). Carr authored a meme that has lasted fifty years, and looks more prescient than ever to his believers with what is going on in Iraq; how many of the internet memes and the bands that survive AfD by having two measly albums on a middling indie label can say the same? --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice"><span style="color:indigo; border:thin solid cyan; background:aliceblue">Groggy Dice</span></a> <span style="border:thin solid gold;"><a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGroggy_Dice_aa9f.html" title="User talk:Groggy Dice">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Groggy_Dice_610a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Groggy Dice">C</a></span> 01:19, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've just added two links to the article, about two pieces I've found on how Iraq fits into World War Three, by Henry Makow (designer of the Scruples game)<a href="http://www.rense.com/general30/strat.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rense.com/general30/strat.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> and Abid Ullah Jan<a href="http://world.mediamonitors.net/content/view/full/3942/" class="external autonumber" title="http://world.mediamonitors.net/content/view/full/3942/" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>.

<dd>You may have misunderstood me. While I'm sure <i>Pawns</i> has also gone through many reprintings, I was referring to <i>By Guess and By God</i> going through (at least) sixteen printings. <i>By Guess</i> is the hare, that sold widely at the time but is now obscure; <i>Pawns</i> is the tortoise, that had a smaller initial readership, but has seen continued interest for half a century. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice"><span style="color:indigo; border:thin solid cyan; background:aliceblue">Groggy Dice</span></a> <span style="border:thin solid gold;"><a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGroggy_Dice_aa9f.html" title="User talk:Groggy Dice">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Groggy_Dice_610a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Groggy Dice">C</a></span> 00:34, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
