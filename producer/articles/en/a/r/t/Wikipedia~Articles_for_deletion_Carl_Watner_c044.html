<p>Also, I asked on the talk page about his notability in October 2006, and there was no response — which I think further confirms that this person is, in fact, not notable at all, and that the article is merely a promotional blurb. <a href="../../../b/i/_/User%7EBi_fef5.html" title="User:Bi">Bi</a> 04:43, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, they are lists of works described by the list compilers as being important works in the realms of discourse about which the compilers are noted as experts. According to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28academics%29_2568.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">Wikipedia:Notability (academics)</a>, an academic is notable if "The person is regarded as a significant expert in his or her area by independent sources," or if "The person is regarded as an important figure by independent academics in the same field." The fact that notable, recognized authorities on libertarianism/anarchocapitalism have cited Watner's works as "essential" or "recommended" seems to clearly meet these conditions. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">DickClarkMises</a> 16:30, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Watner has been published in peer-reviewed academic journals. If you want to argue that he can't be called an "academic" unless he works at a school, I think think you are using an overly narrow definition of the word. The editor (Long) and the editorial board of the <i><a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_of_Libertarian_Studies_79d4.html" title="Journal of Libertarian Studies">JLS</a></i> are all academics and Watner's submitted articles have apparently passed muster with them. The same is true with other journals. To your second point, I don't think it is trivial for six recognized authorities (<a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans-Hermann_Hoppe_f071.html" title="Hans-Hermann Hoppe">HHH</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cato_Institute_745b.html" title="Cato Institute">Cato</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Rothbard_a505.html" title="Murray Rothbard">MNR</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Institute_1391.html" title="Independent Institute">II</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/d/Roderick_Long_4e23.html" title="Roderick Long">Long</a>, and Gordon) in Watner's realm of discouse to say that his writings are "recommended" or "essential." To me that means that he is a reasonable subject to cover in an encylopedia that is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">not paper</a>. And just to add to those above, here is a <a href="http://libertariannation.org/a/f24l3.html" class="external text" title="http://libertariannation.org/a/f24l3.html" rel="nofollow">quotation of Watner</a> by Long in a paper presented in 1995. <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Martin_%28professor%29_9dce.html" title="Brian Martin (professor)">This academic</a> has notably <a href="http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/01nvc/nvc05.html" class="external text" title="http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/01nvc/nvc05.html" rel="nofollow">criticized</a> Watner's theoretical work. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">DickClarkMises</a> 05:15, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I would additionally note that Watner's article in the <a href="http://www.mises.org/journals/lf/1975/1975_03.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.mises.org/journals/lf/1975/1975_03.pdf" rel="nofollow">March 1973 <i>Libertarian Forum</i></a> was seemingly written as a response to some history of thought writing that Rothbard did. This is noteworthy for our purposes here because Rothbard was arguably both the foremost libertarian thinker (for a while anyway) <i>and</i> the editor of <i>LF</i>. This means that Rothbard more or less thought Watner's response to his own work was valuable and notable. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">DickClarkMises</a> 17:49, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I looked through the "citations" offered by DickClarkMises above. Long's reference to Watner is merely in the context of a summary of a magazine issue — if that counts as a "citation", then by jove, one may as well say that a journal's table of contents counts as a "citation"! Also, it's the <i>references</i> to Watner which need to be peer reviewed; and as far as I can see, Rothbard's and Gordon's essays haven't undergone any rigorous peer review process. (Well, Rothbard seems to be some sort of authority on libertarianism, but he mentions Watner only very briefly, as someone who discovered another work by someone else.) I don't think any of these add up to notability for Watner. <a href="../../../b/i/_/User%7EBi_fef5.html" title="User:Bi">Bi</a> 18:10, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

Dark accusations of bias such as yours are <a href="../../../u/n/c/WP%7EUNCIVIL_ed2c.html" title="WP:UNCIVIL">WP:UNCIVIL</a> and bogus, and have no place in reasoned debate. Don't attack the person; attack the issue. <a href="../../../b/i/_/User%7EBi_fef5.html" title="User:Bi">Bi</a> 06:18, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I do note my political affinities on my userpage, but what I was objecting to <i>as a Wikipedian</i> is that you are applying what I consider to be an unusual standard to this case. I wasn't quite sure why you would persist in favoring this AfD after the verifiable sources above were known, so I looked at your userpage, where—to your credit—you disclose that you are the proprietor of the site I linked above. I may be a libertarian, but I hadn't read anything of Watner's before, met him, or heard him speak, although I had seen him cited in the literature during my time working as librarian at the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mises_Institute_a2c6.html" title="Mises Institute">Mises Institute</a>. This is the reason that my first sources were from there, because I already knew the guy was mentioned in a few places at mises.org since I recalled having seen his name on the front cover of the Institute's quarterly <i><a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_of_Libertarian_Studies_79d4.html" title="Journal of Libertarian Studies">JLS</a></i> and elsewhere. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">DickClarkMises</a> 14:24, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> So we are all biased. I think that is an important factor to take into consideration of the administrators when they decide the outcome of this nomination for deletion. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordmetroid_b969.html" title="User:Lordmetroid">Lord Metroid</a> 10:18, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Noteable for all the above reasons. Another attempt by "Bi" to delete anything that has to do with Neo-Tech. He recently tried to get <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_R._Wallace_ae51.html" title="Frank R. Wallace">Frank R. Wallace</a> deleted but was unsuccessful. Now he's trying his hardest to keep information out of that article by making frivolous arguments against the sources. He managed to get the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Tech_71c3.html" title="Neo-Tech">Neo-Tech</a> article deleted but it was voted to merge with the Wallace article. From the talk page of <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasuhiko_Kimura_6e55.html" title="Yasuhiko Kimura">Yasuhiko Kimura</a> it looks like he may be going after that one next. And yes as DickClarkMises pointed out Bi runs an anti Neo-Tech web site. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> 02:59, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well, seeing that Brian Martin devoted an entire chapter to discussing Watner's voluntaryism, I think I'm gravitating towards a Weak Keep. Or maybe a <b>merge with Voluntaryism</b>, since I'm still not convinced that there's much else to Watner's notability other than his involvement in voluntaryism and <i>The Voluntaryist</i>. <a href="../../../b/i/_/User%7EBi_fef5.html" title="User:Bi">Bi</a> 08:37, 9 March 2007 (UTC) <i>(nominator)</i></li>

<dd>I think merging <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voluntaryism.html" title="Voluntaryism">Voluntaryism</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Watner_97a7.html" title="Carl Watner">Carl Watner</a> would be a mistake. Watner is a notable scholar/writer who is not the first or most notable voluntaryist. There is no compelling reason why his article, a biography, should be merged with an article about a political philosophy that he supports. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">DickClarkMises</a> 15:39, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Somewhat notable as a libertarian theorist per collaboration with <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendy_McElroy_2268.html" title="Wendy McElroy">Wendy McElroy</a> and citation by <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Rothbard_a505.html" title="Murray Rothbard">Murray Rothbard</a>. Published in <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reason_magazine.html" title="Reason magazine">Reason magazine</a> and at least two of his books (the one with McElroy and the one published by Fox &amp; Wilkes) published by non-vanity presses. However - lack of other independent sources on him may be a problem. I'm open to being convinced either way on whether to keep. Seems notable enough but we do have a <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> requirement to meet if the article is kept. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragomiloff_1fd6.html" title="User:Dragomiloff">Dragomiloff</a> 23:29, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
