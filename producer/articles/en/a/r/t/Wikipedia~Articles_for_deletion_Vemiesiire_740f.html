<dd>I should note that "Kokopelli" generates a lot of ghits, most of them apparently related to some kind of flute. A google for "kokopelli+heidewald" gives only three hits, obviously not related to the language either. —<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 17:37, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Keep</b> Just because it isn't interesting to you doesn't mean it doesn't matter to the people that speak it. It seems like a useful article, has an example of the language and everything. IJzeren Jan seems a bit of a hypocrite to me, seeing he has his own constructed language and he fought so bitterly over that site not being deleted. It's a language some people obviously speak, if this one goes then many others need to be cleaned out, including IJzeren Jan's language, where the outside link attached is <i>his</i> website! Wikipedia is all about have people use their specialized knowledge to inform other people! --Menner8 19:53, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It may be verifiable, just not published all over the internet. Looks fine to me, doesn't hurt you any. <b>Keep.</b></p>

<dd>Getting personal, Menner8? Well then, let me explain a few things:
<ol>
<li>Indeed, I dó have a constructed language. Several even. What's the difference? I'm very interested in conlangs and I do care for them. If you don't believe me, just look at the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Portal%7EConstructed_languages_dc7f.html" title="Portal:Constructed languages">Portal:Constructed languages</a> that I've co-created.</li>
<li>I didn't start the article about Wenedyk myself. It was started by someone else. What I did do was making a few edits later on. Besides, I have never claimed my language is notable, but others apparently do. And honestly, I don't care much if the article is there or not; it is not supposed to be learned by anybody anyway.</li>
<li>I didn't fight bitterly over that article in particular. At the time, there was a massive attack against a whole series of conlangs, mine included, and the reason for these attacks was pretty moot. So I stood up for all of them. If the vote had been about Wenedyk only, I would have abstained from voting.</li>
<li>The outside link points to my website. So what? At least, there is something on that website!</li>
<li>I know that Google hits are not the only measure for significance, but for fairly recent phenomena like young conlangs it is about the only source we have. The problem with V. is simply that there's nothing that would even confirm that the language exists at all. No grammar, no dictionary, no info about its creator, nothing! If there's a book about it, then please mention the title and the ISBN number. It the press has been writing about it, ditto. But the way it looks now, the whole thing might very well be a hoax. My point is: there's nothing to substantiate the article.</li>
<li>Saying that there are several people who speak it is easy. So, where are these people? Who are they? Can you prove it?</li>
</ol>

<p>Keep. I think the language is not only a beautiful sounding language, it also is a well-constructed language with simplified grammar. I am glad to hear that it has some speakers already and hope to read more words in Vemiesiire when the dictionary goes on-line. From Wikipedia user, Jeanette Neher</p>
<ul>
<li>Here I am, author of the article. I am here, I suppose, to defend what I wrote and explain a simple yet beautiful concept. It doesn't matter as much to you as it does to other people. I want the article to be included because I think it has information interesting to a specific audience. This is a real language, and all information I included is drawn right from its dictionary, comprised of thousands of words. I don't feel the need to verify its authenticity or provide you with names of speakers willing to write e-mails flexing their skills (although I easily could, if you would like). I don't feel the need because I don't think this discussion is even really about Vemiesiire, and I think a more general stance on conlags should be defined for Wikipedia, so we can have order and reason and not just personal vendettas and unnecessary hurt feelings.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the meanwhile, I stand by its authenticity and will always delight to share my specific knowledge with the world, and hope others feel the same determination. <b>Keep.</b> --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErika00177_5abb.html" title="User:Erika00177">Erika00177</a> 21:46, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A discussion regarding policy regarding conlangs has been, and in a way still is, going on. See <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONLANG_91ba.html" title="WP:CONLANG">WP:CONLANG</a>. Look, this is not about constructed languages in general, not even about yours. And this has <i>nothing</i> to do with any personal vendettas. To be frank, I even like your language, and I would certainly like to hear the soundbytes. It's about the question whether or not an article here in WP is warranted. And the arguments I used (lack of verifiability, original research, vanity, no sign of notability) would make one suspect that it isn't for now. You saying that it's all true doesn't change those facts. I agree with you this information is interesting to a specific audience, but that's really not enough for inclusion! Like I told you on your user page, there are several more specialised places for that. I even took the liberty to transwiki your article to the Conlang Wiki (<a href="http://conlang.wikicities.com/wiki/Vemiesiire" class="external text" title="http://conlang.wikicities.com/wiki/Vemiesiire" rel="nofollow">here</a> it is; feel free to do with it as you please). —<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 22:09, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Conditional Weak Delete</b> The author does raise a point that conlangs should not be deleted a priori, but the fact remains that conlangs must be NOTABLE to be included on WP. I could make up a very poor conlang in 10 minutes, but that wouldn't make it article-worthy. Alternately, I could make a very good one over several years, but if no one spoke it and it was generally irrelevant, it still wouldn't be a WP article. Author/article must show that this conlang is significant in some way (are there institutes that teach this language? are there provably a large number of people who speak the language? etc.) If this is done, I would be strongly in favor of keeping this article. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrazyCaley_d294.html" title="User:KrazyCaley">KrazyCaley</a> 23:51, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
