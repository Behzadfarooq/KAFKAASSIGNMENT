<p>Advertising/Vanity, I wish they directed their efforts on improving the TF articles on Wikipedia instead. <b>Delete</b> --<a href="../../../s/l/u/User%7ESlux_093e.html" title="User:Slux">Slux</a> 17:31, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is explaining two long running servers and their history (in progress). Not only is it explaining the uniqueness of the servers and how it is democratic, but the way the users have gathered together to form a group of people that interact outside of an online game through the use of the forums mentioned. If you think showing the IPs is that we are trying to "advertise" then we will take them off. What we are trying to show is a history of the group not try push ourselves on the masses. Also, you say "I wish they directed their efforts on improving the TF articles". Users that are editting this have and will continue working on those. You may want to check the history of both and compare users before making statements like that, which are false. <b>Keep</b> --Cassius 17:47, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It might be necessary to remove the IP addresses and IRC channels. However, this article is not meant to be an advertising tool, or one of vanity. Axl's TFC is a developed community with a unique history, and this article is intended to articulate that history and how it has affected the game on which it is based. <b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 18:03, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think this is a great arcticle which purpose does not fit advertising nor vanity. It merely shows what Axl's TFC is about, its history, its uniqueness. I wouldn't mind missing the IP addresses, but a link to the official website seems in place. I say we keep this topic, for the critisism is not accurate. <b>Keep</b> Shino 19:38, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, this is Shino's first and, so far, only edit.

<li>Well, at least <i>someone</i> over on those forums has good enough sense to discourage sockpuppets, although I see we've already got two. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 19:30, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>According to Wikipedia's <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">sockpuppet</a> policy, a sockpuppet is defined as "an additional username used by a Wikipedian who edits under more than one name." Everyone who has voted is each a separate person, and therefore no aliases or sockpuppets have been used. — <i>unsigned comment by <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a></i>
<ul>
<li>We also use the term <i>sockpuppet</i> here on VfD to refer to those low-edit or new users that show up solely to defend one article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 19:54, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>#1 So you are making policies yourself now? Shouldn't you go by the policy of the site that you are on, not things you make up? #2 - You are basing this off the posts they have made using a username, I have made changes without a username up until this point, but I decided to start using a username, which do not show other contributions I have made. --Cassius
<ul>
<li>I'm not making anything up, just describing standard practice around here. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 20:09, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So I can break policy, as long as it's standard practice? --Cassius
<ul>
<li>What are you talking about? Who's "breaking policy?" <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 20:15, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)

<li>According to Wikipedia's <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">sockpuppet</a> policy, a sockpuppet is defined as "an additional username used by a Wikipedian who edits under more than one name." Everyone who has voted is each a separate person, and therefore no aliases or sockpuppets have been used. - That's the policy, changing the definition to the "standard practice" versus what the policy says is breaking policy. --Cassius
<ul>
<li>As I've already mentioned, we use a <i>slightly</i> different definition of sockpuppet on VfD than does Wikipedia at large. I fail to see how this is "breaking policy," but your point is a minor quibble, at best. The meaning of my initial point doesn't change whether I say "sockpuppets" or "low-edit or new users." <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 20:28, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I fail to see how this forum thread that notifies the community of the article constitutes evidence of vanity. — <i>unsigned comment by <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a></i>
<ul>
<li>A member of said community created the article. That's pretty much the definition of vanity. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 19:54, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The whole purpose of the forum thread was to get community members to help in the process of editing the article so that it would be as professional and noteworthy as possible.</li>
<li>You may want to read the definition of Vanity again. Wikipedia Policy Quote: "Furthermore, it should be noted that an article is not a "vanity" page simply because it was written by its subject." --Cassius
<ul>
<li>I'm using the definition of vanity from <a href="../../../g/v/f/WP%7EGVFD_9ddb.html" title="WP:GVFD">WP:GVFD</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 20:14, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Search the page for the word <i>vanity</i>; fourth instance. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 20:28, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak delete</b>, gamecruft, not yet persuaded that this game community forum is more notable than dozens or hundreds of others. The Radio KoL stuff referenced in a few of today's other VfD's shows more evidence of pioneering extra-game interaction related to a game than anything I see in the article or the forum.

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't see myself as a sock puppet. I just never had to sign up for anything on Wikipedia. My first comment has to start somewhere! I think there is nothing wrong with this article. I don't see why people are making a big fuss out of this. Shino 10:47, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, non-notable. Dave, VfD's not about a vote "count," it's about the <a href="../../../g/v/f/WP%7EGVFD_9ddb.html#Discussion" title="WP:GVFD">discussion</a> and attempt to reach a consensus.
