<p>As a Californian, I can say first-hand that this is not notable. Maybe it's notable enough for Wikinews, but not here. The outage lasted only a few hours; this kind of thing happens every day somewhere in the developed world. The only reason it's a news story is because it happened in LA. How long would "2005 Bakersfield power outage" last? <font color="green"><a href="../../../s/z/y/User%7ESzyslak_7117.html" title="User:Szyslak"><font color="green"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">sɪzlæk</span></font></a> [ <a href="../../../s/z/y/User_talk%7ESzyslak_c549.html" title="User talk:Szyslak">+t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Szyslak_7616.html" title="Special:Contributions/Szyslak">+c</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Szyslak_1b31.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Szyslak">+m</a> ]</font> 04:09, September 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Expand</b>: The event is significant, because it shows the vulnerabilities in the current power grid infrastructure.

<li><b>Delete</b>. California's energy management belongs in an article on California's energy management. A short blackout is not encyclopaedic. Congratulations, your power went out. Mine went out a couple of weeks ago too, and for longer.

<li>If any article appears on Wikipedia, it's because somebody gave the faintest damn about it, so much so that they were willing to use up their time to surf on over here and create a page that said "steve duschainme is a butttfac!!!!" or whatever. Nobody ever created a Wikipedia article by apathy. It's distinguishing the articles that are encyclopaedic and those that aren't that's the trick, and the purpose of AfD. In my opinion, despite the fact that people care about it (just like people care about Mr. Duschainme's butt for a face), this article is not what Wikipedia needs. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 18:15, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>My equation of vandalism went only so far as to say "people care about vandalism, and people care about this too." People care about <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, people care about every article on this wiki, that's why they wrote the article. People care about the fact that the keyboard on one of the library iMacs is broken, for crying out loud. The fact that people, as I said above, "give the faintest damn" about something does not in of itself make that something encyclopaedic. It may make it <i>newsworthy</i> (and I doubt anybody will argue against this blackout being newsworthy on some level), but Wikipedia is not a newspaper. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 17:53, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>An article on that subject would be more wikiworthy for sure, but this is about one particular blackout, and doesn't really touch on wider problems of electricity supply in Los Angeles. It reads like a news story and tells the reader nothing but the what, where and when of an event that is not notable in itself. If someone wants to write an article about the wider issue they can go ahead, but this is not that article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Firstly, the comments of some other people, with things like "there are articles with less notability than this that are not on VfD, so keep" are ridiculous. Maybe those artciles should be. Maybe you people should go and find them, and VfD nominate them. But the status of "other aticles" does not in any way influence what happens to this article. We have a clear Deletion policy, which is the sole determinant of whether or not to delete this article. The fact is that this article fails the "ten year test". In ten year's time, people will not remember, care about or even want to know about a 30 minute power outage in LA. As such, Wikipedia is not the place for stuff like LA Power Outage 2005. Thanks to whoever created this article for their enterprise and effort; unluckily this is not the place for it. And remember, if it becomes a big issue (eg someone famous died because their life support got turned off or whatever), we can always recreate the article. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> 15:15, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
