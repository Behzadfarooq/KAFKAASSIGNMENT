<p>The result was <b>delete</b>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Rationale: If we were headcounting, it's 7 keeps, 6 deletes, 1 merge.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of the 7 keeps, the 1st (and hence the 3rd), the 4th and 5th 'keep's are based on it winning an award that fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. The 2nd 'keep' vote (from Vsion) makes no sense and I've discounted it. The 6th keep (Audiobooks) gives no reason to keep based on policy, just states the school is notable and that's it. 7th (Catbag) is another 'per above).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The school is not the subject of multiple non-trivial sources that show notability, which is the reason given to keep by 5 of the 7 keep voters. The argument to keep is not based on policy. The argument to keep is, therefore, weak.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The argument to delete is based on the fact that the school is not the primary subject of multiple (or any) non-trivial sources that show notability. This is based on a policy of Wikipedia. This is, therefore, a strong argument to delete.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The argument to delete is stronger than that to keep. Therefore, delete. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 12:32, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thousands of schools have been awarded by the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ribbon_Schools_Program_4a5b.html" title="Blue Ribbon Schools Program">Blue Ribbon Schools Program</a>, and <i>the schools nominate themselves</i>. Therefore, it's not exactly a highly distinctive award of recognition. Various government agencies hand out blue ribbons like sticks of gum, to various entities for various reasons. I don't think it automatically imparts notability. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 20:31, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agree with Wikipediatrix. But we don't even have to argue the point in the abstract of whether being a Blue Ribbon school confers notability. We can just check to see whether multiple non-trivial sources independent of this school have taken note of its being a Blue Ribbon school. The answer is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;gfns=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLJ,GGLJ:2006-32,GGLJ:en&amp;q=%22fairmont+preparatory+academy%22+%22blue+ribbon%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;gfns=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLJ,GGLJ:2006-32,GGLJ:en&amp;q=%22fairmont+preparatory+academy%22+%22blue+ribbon%22" rel="nofollow">no</a> (also checked Lexis-Nexis). So at least in this school's case, being a Blue Ribbon school doesn't help its case for notability. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 20:58, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Like most schools, this one does not appear to be the primary subject of multiple (or any) non-trivial sources that show notability. Oddly enough, zero results in a Lexis-Nexis search even of <i>local</i> papers. The attributes listed by <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> can be argued to be claims to notability only if, at a minimum, they are noted by sources independent of the school.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The school has been recognized by the Blue Ribbons School Program, the highest award granted by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Education_de27.html" title="United States Department of Education">United States Department of Education</a>. It may not be the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medal_of_Honor_1efa.html" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honor</a>, but I'd rank it a notch below. For all those deletionist extremists who would like to claim that this award is no more valuable than a "stick of gum" or that the fact that "schools nominate themselves" diminishes its value in any way, here's <a href="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf" rel="nofollow">the official description</a> of the process: <b>How Are Schools Chosen? The Department convenes the National Review Panel to evaluate the nominations. The panel consists of approximately 100 outstanding public and private school educators from the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary levels. Based on the quality of the application, the most promising schools are recommended for site visits. The purpose of a visit is to verify the accuracy of the information the school has provided in its nomination form and to gather any additional information the panel has requested. Experienced educators, including principals of previously recognized schools, visit and observe the schools for two days and submit written site visit reports. The National Review Panel considers the reports in its final review of applicants and makes to the U.S. Secretary of Education, who then announces the names of the schools selected for recognition.</b> Deletionism depends on ignorance and denial, and we see it here in action. Given the rigorous selection criteria for the program, I think it's clear that any school that has been awarded a Blue Ribbon has the strongest possible claim of notability. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 02:08, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Its hard to see something as a claim of notability when the school hasn't recieved in the least press coverage over it. Also, the claim that it is the "strongest possible claim of notability" seems to be hyperbole at best. <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hopkins_School_a1a7.html" title="Hopkins School">Hopkins School</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton_College_8864.html" title="Eton College">Eton</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuyvesant.html" title="Stuyvesant">Stuyvesant</a> and others have far stronger claims of notabilty. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:15, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Reword for the benefit of those in denial of the explicit claim of notability: <b>Recognition by the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ribbon_Schools_Program_4a5b.html" title="Blue Ribbon Schools Program">Blue Ribbon Schools Program</a> grants the recipient a claim that is among the strongest possible claims of notability for a school.</b> Do you deny that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Education_de27.html" title="United States Department of Education">United States Department of Education</a> thoroughly researches and verifies all applications and that the winners have demonstrated a clear level of achievement? In the continuum, is a school that has been so recognized no more notable than a stick of gum? Your claim re press coverage is entirely worthless. Do you believe that every 15-year-old newspaper article is available online, and that your fruitless efforts to find such an article prove anything? Is a source from the United States Department of Education not reliable and verifiable? This is deletionism at its worst. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 02:23, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not claiming that the statement is false but simply that we cannot find any sources. And if a source did exist it would likely turn up on Lexis-Nexis even if it were 15 years old. The bottom line is that we have no evidence whatsoever that this school's Blue Ribbon is all that notable, and if not a single news source saw fit to even mention it, it is difficult to see it as a claim of notability. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:31, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> I don't trust the government for a lot of things, but do you think that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Education_de27.html" title="United States Department of Education">United States Department of Education</a> is not a valid and reliable source for this information in full compliance with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I think the selection criteria listed above and the fact that it is the nation's highest award for a school makes it one of the strongest possible claims of notability that an American school can possibly make? Besides, as the late, great <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Sagan_68dc.html" title="Carl Sagan">Carl Sagan</a> has been quoted, "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 15:54, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> re: <i>do you think that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Education_de27.html" title="United States Department of Education">United States Department of Education</a> is not a valid and reliable source for this information in full compliance with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a></i>: You misunderstand the issue here. The problem with the Blue Ribbon thing is notability, not just whether it's true. There has to be non-trivial coverage, independent of both the giver of the award and the recipient of the award, before you can begin to argue that the receiving of the award is notable. Of course, the giver and the recipient will both issue press releases, but that's not independent coverage, obviously. Also, the recipient may be included on lists of recipients of the award, or in wire service blurbs, but those aren't non-trivial. Now, re: "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." Please. We need evidence of appropriate sources to establish notability. We don't assume notability by default. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 17:19, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Notability is not established. If the award were truly distinguishing, the school's receiving of the award would garner non-trivial attention from independent sources.

<dd><b>Reply</b>: I expressed myself incorrectly: I meant that receiving that award (Blue Ribbon) and being a member of the organization (IBO) not mean that you are notable (both events have not received much media coverage, it appears), but I erroneously said that the award and the organization in itself are not notable, which is of course something completely different and not true. 07:51, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
