<p>Apparently non-notable supposed director. Parsing through the relatively few Ghits (340 on name -wikipedia) reveals no apparent <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. No apparent released projects, no real assertion of notability; website is on a free host, and contact address is via Gmail. Strong flavor of possible hoaxiness. Also nominating related articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_Raiders_6ccc.html" title="Sky Raiders">Sky Raiders</a> - with director's surname, 46 Ghits, none from reliable sources.</li>
<li>Last Evil of the SS - with director's surname, 40 Ghits, none from reliable sources.</li>

<li><b>Delete All</b> per nom. IMDB lists a James Dingsdale, but his sole contribution there is to have contributed to the bio section of the director of <a href="../../../g/y/m/Gymkata.html" title="Gymkata">Gymkata</a>. Not precisely how I would like to be remembered by the film industry. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:27, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>He is a real director - I have met him. His projects are also very real. Just because films are not released internationally or commercially, it does not mean that they don't exist. IMDB rejected Dingsdale's page because none of his projects have been released theatrically (to general audiences) or on general home video release. Deleting his page would be pointless.

<p>Found a source for you to take a look at <a href="http://www.famouswelsh.com/cgibin/getmoreinf.cgi?pers_id=1415&amp;media_pers=James%20Dingsdale" class="external free" title="http://www.famouswelsh.com/cgibin/getmoreinf.cgi?pers_id=1415&amp;media_pers=James%20Dingsdale" rel="nofollow">http://www.famouswelsh.com/cgibin/getmoreinf.cgi?pers_id=1415&amp;media_pers=James%20Dingsdale</a>. They are a website based in Dingsdale's home country and do thorough fact checking when users request articles to be posted on Welsh personalities. I appreciate what you guys do with the deletion process, but you're barking up the wrong tree here. He is real. Jamezcd 19:44, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I'm reasonably satisfied the bloke is real. I just see nothing to suggest he's <i>notable</i>. If his films have never been released to the public, then he's the moral equivalent of a fellow with a camcorder smiling at the latest family holiday party. I've also just followed that link, and see just an anonymous site with handles. It certainly doesn't strike me as a reliable secondary source. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:53, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Indeed, no one is saying he's not real; we're seeking consensus on whether or not he and the associated works meet WP standards on <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notability</a> as indicated by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Having googled him, I figured the famouswelsh listing might come up; it's in fact a free-membership apparently open-posting site (I came perilously close to adding a very non-real, non-famous "Welsh" person while finding that out -- do you suppose anyone would have eventually caught on that Bryffyn False-Gomez might not be all she seemed?). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 20:00, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete <s>or Merge &amp; Redirect</s></b> The author's assertion of personal knowledge is primary research not pertinent to Wikipedia articles. I don't see a hoax here per web information, and 300 Ghits woudld not bother me if some of these established notabiltiy. <s>I think that this goes beyond a vanity a page and a video camera. Why not merge him into a list of independent film makers?

<dd><b>Comment</b>. On the chance that in fact this might not be a case of a man-and-a-camera, I did some further checking on some of the details contained in both the two film articles and the main Dingsdale one. Here are some results: Ghits on "PBGA Film Syndicate," production company for <i>Last Evil</i> = 0. Second production company named, "UO Film Investors," Ghits = 0 (fuller name, "United Orme Film Investors"; Ghits = WP only). Of the <i>Evil</i> cast listed (the first two are the listed cast of <i>Sky Raiders</i>, as well), actor Andrew Etches appears to be a teenager in <a href="../../../l/l/a/Llandudno.html" title="Llandudno">Llandudno</a>, Dan Galston has Ghits only to the WP article and mirrors, and, while there is a UK musician named James Wilde (and an actor of the name had an uncredited role in a UK comedy and with it an IMDb page), there's also at least one online profile that hints that the person here may, too, be a Llandudno-based teen. In short, I don't think there's even enough here for a merge/redirect. Jamezcd, the originating editor of all three articles has himself said above that none of the director's projects have been released to general audiences, which about sums it up. Students having fun with a camera is great, but it's not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 03:36, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<p>The picture Ghits on Andrew Etches and Dan Galston are very old photos which were included on a bio page on Global International's old website. When I say that the projects are unreleased, I meant that they were not in cinemas. They have been shown in screenings. Also, projects which Dingsdale worked on during his time as a professional editor have been released commercially. I just don't see the point in deleting an article just because you guys haven't heard of him! 81.5.170.21 09:44, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>(The above is user's first edit) I recommend you review Wikipedia policies and guidelines regarding the notability of subjects; <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> in particular. Dingsdale does not come close to meeting them. If, after you review them, you both believe that in fact he does and have verifiable evidence to that effect, we'll be happy to look it over. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:26, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is hard to place credibilty in a unidentified "User:81.5.170.21" --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 19:23, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually that was me but I forgot to sign in. I've dealt with Wikipedians several times before, and if I've learnt one thing from this site it is that <b>everyone</b> thinks that they are in the right. If you must delete Dingsdale's article, go ahead. However, in the process, you will be robbing the internet of just a few kilobytes of information about a genuine film maker.

<li>No, we'll be deleting an article from Wikipedia that does not meet Wikipedia's rules for inclusion. As far as I figure, Wikipedia cannot prevent so much as a single other website on the Internet from publishing as much about Dingsdale as anyone would like to see. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 20:12, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
