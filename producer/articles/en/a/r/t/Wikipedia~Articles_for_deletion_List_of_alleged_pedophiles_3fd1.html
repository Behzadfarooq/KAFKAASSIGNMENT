That list needs to be deleted or extremely cleaned up (you were perhaps joking, but I am serious). I looked at some of the articles linked from that list, and they do not have any explanation for why the person is listed there. Others are dubious "debates", i.e. tabloids. Wikipedia is not a tabloid. The entire article (like List of alleged pedophiles) is one giant weasel word (see <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words</a>). --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> 00:11, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

I would not want the wiki community to suffer any harm as a result of what should originally have appeared in the sandbox. Since wikipedia articles already contain information about people associated with pedophilia I propose the following:
<dl>
<dd><b>Title</b>: Change to "People associated with pedophilia"</dd>
<dd><b>Rewrite</b>: Include a discussion on listing of pedophiles</dd>
<dd><b>Rules for inclusion</b>: Restrict names on the list to people who:
<dl>
<dd><b>a)</b> Are subjects or are named in existing wikipedia articles (pls follow the links to check),</dd>
<dd><b>b)</b> included in which are discussions of their association with pedophilia</dd>

<dd>If you put an accused murderer, a convicted shoplifter, a convicted serial killer, and a person accused but never formally charged, all in one article entitled List of alleged criminals I would AFD that too. If you renamed it to People associated with criminality and added a defense lawyer, I would definately AFD that. Meanwhile, I would still keep all those individual bio articles.

<dd>Robert, I struggle to understand your logic. For each of the names on the list there is a wikipedia article providing all the details that the list summarizes. Why is it that the facts are fine in an article, but as sooon as one lists them this constitutes a blacklist? Same information, different format. I generally consider myself fairly PC but the blacklist logic is PC elevated to the status of faith.--<a href="../../../s/u/i/User%7ESuidafrikaan_86b3.html" title="User:Suidafrikaan">Suidafrikaan</a> 07:24, 27 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Context effects meaning. As an example, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Glitter_8713.html" title="Gary Glitter">one of the first people added (later removed)</a> has an article that provides meaningful context of exactly what he was convicted of and what he wasn't convicted of. This list provides little context. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_alleged_pedophiles&amp;oldid=32752122" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_alleged_pedophiles&amp;oldid=32752122" rel="nofollow">pre-AFD</a> list provided no context whatsoever. Right now, there's a lot of scrutiny, and effort to "clean-up" this thing due only to the AFD. Once the AFD is over, attention will fade, and people will be free to add whatever names they wish. Allegations are closely scrutinized in bio articles, as people familiar with the person review them. But most lists in Wikipedia go largely unnoticed (except by people adding to them), and frequently contain dubeious info, that goes unchallenged. On the pre-AFD article, while it's common to start an article in a low-quality draft stage for its first version, surely something this serious warranted something a little better (there is a "Preview" button, next to the "Save" button after all). If this is kept, we can expect future poorly thought out contributions to the list (as editors will know the article's immune from deletion). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 08:26, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The term 'alleged' makes the article, by its very nature, POV. By grouping those 'alleged' by a few crack-pots with those convicted or sex crimes in a court of law, one clearly enters the region of implying guilt. That, in any jurisdiction, is defamation of character. Besides, even if it weren't, it seems like a pointless article in the first place.

Both are illegal in just about any jurisdiction that I could ever imagine, including, for the record, Florida, where Wikimedia is based. I don't care what <i>your</i> personal opinion of paedophilia is, because the only opinion that matters is that of the law, which makes this page defamation, hence illegal. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 19:20, 28 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>o rly, Bastin..? Hmmm...</dd>
<dd>"Pedophilia" is not a legal term. It is a medical term used to describe the sexual attraction to children. Child sexual abuse and et cetera are described in a court of law as child sexual abuse, <i>not</i> pedophilia (for obvious reasons). Tabloids love to use nonsensical phrases like "convicted of pedophilia," though, but uhm, they're <i>tabloids</i> (QED). Pedophilia is not an act, and hence, you can not be convicted of it. Perhaps reading our very own <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">article</a> on pedophilia would be beneficial to you, hmm..&#160;?</dd>
<dd>So in the end, I agree, the law is all that matters, and the law doesn't give a damn about pedophilia. You can freely admit you're a pedophile in front of a cop and all he can do is gasp and call you a sicko. <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteen_Eighty-Four_808a.html" title="Nineteen Eighty-Four">Thankfully</a>. <code>// <b><a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParoxysm_2155.html" title="User:Paroxysm">paroxysm</a></b> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParoxysm_da02.html" title="User talk:Paroxysm">(n)</a></code> 01:57, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you want to argue the toss about the differences between paedophilia and actually raping a child, it's best not to do it when arguing to retain this article. After all, most of the people in the list aren't there for reasons of <i><a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteen_Eighty-Four_808a.html" title="Nineteen Eighty-Four">thought</a></i>, but for the reason that someone believes them each to have <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">gone through with the act</a>. If that is the justification for inclusion, your argument that the list <i>actually</i> concerns a psychological condition is flawed.</dd>
<dd>Then, the rectification of that 'flaw' (as you see it) leads to further problems. If we keep the list, and it is used to reflect 'paedophiles' in the more esoteric sense, we would be publishing a list of people's thoughts that are inferred from their behaviour. That is far more Orwellian than the alternative.</dd>
<dd>Moreover, use of the term 'paedophile' is understood by the public to imply that the paedophile actually <i>practises</i> it, just as is <i>homosexual</i>. Since that is the understanding, it is the definition for purposes of establishing whether the article is defamation. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 12:57, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm having second thoughts about this. This sort of list is very easy to abuse, but clearly efforts have been made to minimise the risk here. The list is still abusable in certain respects:
<dl>
<dd>1. Two of the sections have rather fluid criteria for inclusion, namely <i>Historical figures alleged to have been pedophiles</i> - what constitutes an allegation? - and <i>People associated with pedophile organizations</i> - what constitutes an association?</dd>
<dd>2. The list has four rather different sorts of sections, and there is no clear reason why other sections might not be added. What looks to be a policeable list might easily become unpoliceable in time.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>So my second thoughts are that the page might not be so unpoliceable in time.

<li><b>For the record</b>, <i>Shreshth91</i>, slander is oral defamation. I think the word you're looking for is libel which is written defamation. If libel is anyone's sincere concern then I trust that you will all be calling for deletion of the articles on Michael Jackson, Gary Glitter, and any number of biographical wikiworks that contain rumours, allegations, and sourced opinions.--<a href="../../../s/u/i/User%7ESuidafrikaan_86b3.html" title="User:Suidafrikaan">Suidafrikaan</a> 05:01, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
