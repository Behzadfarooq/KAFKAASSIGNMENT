<p>!-- Follow these three steps to fill out this form: --&gt; Magnant is an <a href="../../../r/t/s/RTS_2436.html" title="RTS">RTS</a> which features the military expansion of a colony of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Ants.html" title="Ants">ants</a>; since the main objective of the game is to destroy all enemy colonies.</p>
<p><b>Card System</b></p>
<p>There is a card system which permits the player to draw cards during the game which can bring diverse bonuses to the colony; to obtain these cards, the player can exchange points gained during matches for 3 copies of one type of card. The player can also trade these cards with other Magnant players at the Magnant official website and also ‘’steal’’ or ‘’gain’’ a card from the defeated opponent’s deck, as well as loose a card when having been defeated.</p>
<p><b>Corresponding Category</b></p>
<p>Magnant enters properly in the <a href="../../../r/t/s/RTS_2436.html" title="RTS">RTS</a> category and is somehow considered as an Ant Simulation Video Game; it is not considered completely an ant simulation game because it concentrates on many unrealistic ant features, such as: Ants carrying modern weapons, ants employing siege machinery such as <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catapults.html" title="Catapults">catapults</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballistics.html" title="Ballistics">ballistics</a>, etc. which were common in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> and in <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Times_59f9.html" title="Ancient Times">Ancient Times</a>.</p>
<p><b>Trial Version</b></p>
<p>A free trial version of Magnant is available at the game’s official website.</p>

<p>DeviceNet is a communication protocol used in automation industry to interconnect devices such as sensors and actuators. It uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controller_area_network" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controller_area_network" rel="nofollow">Controller Area Network (CAN)</a> as the backbone technology, and defines strong application layer to cover a vast range of device profiles.</p>

<p>DeviceNet was originally developed by an American company called Allen-Bradley (now known as Rockwell Automation). It was adapted from its another protocol called ControlNet, a more complex, higher performance, and more expensive protocol for obvious reason - CAN silicon is much cheaper than the ControlNet ASIC silicon.</p>
<p>In order to promote the use of DeviceNet worldwide, Rockwell Automation decided to share the technology with the third party vendors. Hence, it is now managed by the <a href="http://www.odva.org" class="external text" title="http://www.odva.org" rel="nofollow">Open DeviceNet Vendors Association (ODVA)</a> located in the North America.</p>

<p>A "Comprehensive Annual Financial Report" or "CAFR" as a government book keeping practice started in the post WWII economic boom and replaced what was regularly a "off-the-books" practice called the "general fixed asset account group" . The various levels of government "general government" or the federal United States, individual state governments and government agencies each began producing a CAFR in the late 1940's to early 1950's to catalog an accurate picture of institutional funds, or financial holdings, assets and total investment incomes for those government and nongovernmental entities using the report, which is above and beyond the budget process. In 1945, the Government Corporation Control Act, began the auditing of wholly owned government corporations and mixed ownership corporations,( those that government may have controlling holdings in but operate as private corporations) all of which may come under the term "enterprise funds". Accounting principles for government entities are set by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB)</p>

<p>The CAFR shows accounting entries the basic budget reports do not, and should not be confused with "rainy day funds" that are included in government budgetary reports and process. A budget is for a select grouping ("general fund") of accounts showing only the more commonly known revenue income from taxes, fees, licenses, fines and a select few revenue sources not gennerally profit generating. The common government budget report also includes, expenses such as salaries, police, and entitlements will be shown along with required holdings to fund pensions, insurance and bonds.</p>
<p>The CAFR shows not only selectively presented budget items, but also government "enterprise operations" or "enterprise funds", investments, and the return on them (or loss).

<p>While a budget might indicate that the government or agency has financial trouble and debt, (because of excess spending within the select grouping of "general fund" accounts presented), the CAFR will normally indicate that government possesses extra holdings considerably over what is shown in a budget report or "general fund" alone. Examples from recient history include, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessie_Ventura_1847.html" title="Jessie Ventura">Jessie Ventura</a>'s career, puncuated by his returning some of the government surplusses to voters as govenor of Minnesota. Other rare news events have highlighted the off-the-budget holdings of government. In one widely reported example in the late 1990's (Los Angeles) Orange County California lost $1-Billion on investments in the <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derivatives.html" title="Derivatives">derivatives</a> market.</p>
<p>A former US Air Force Accountant, Gerald R. Klatt and a former commodities broker Walter Burien, have made contoversial claims, since at least 1996, about the CAFR or "2nd set of books", with their assesments of government assets holdings and investment supporting globalism and free trade. In recient years (1999) changes have been made to the <a href="../../../g/a/s/GASB_ee3a.html" title="GASB">GASB</a> rules and claims have been made that such changes are some of the attempts to hide assets and "enterprise funds" from the general public after some sporatic media attention on these issues.</p>

<p>In his childhood Bimal faced extreme poverty as his parents passed away when he was very young.His family was run by his elder brother.They lived in Ichapur a small town adjacent to the northern outskirts of Kolkata and situated besides the river <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganges.html" title="Ganges">Ganges</a>.Bimal was a born traveller by nature and combined with unbearable hardship in life it inspired Bimal to break free from family and set out for the unknown a number of times.He travelled accross many shrines in India and met with several spiritual gurus.When he was only 16,he suddenly dissapeared from home and went to <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathmandu.html" title="Kathmandu">Kathmandu</a>,the capital of <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nepal.html" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>.From there with a group of monks he crossed the Himalayas and traversed the Tibetian platue by foot to finally reach the forbidden city <a href="../../../l/a/s/Lasa.html" title="Lasa">Lasa</a>.Soon after this adventure <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> took control over <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tibet.html" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> and the route from Kathmandu to Lasa got closed and abandoned.An account of this fabulous adventure was later written by him in the book called Mahatirther Shesh Yatri (The final traveller to the great shrine).This feat showed what bigger achievement was waiting for him and what he is capable of.</p>

<p>Finally in the summer of 68 he decided to leave home and plunge into the uncertainities of the unknown as he set out for a globetrotting adventure on his bicycle literally being penniless.He started from Kolkata in front of a small gathering beside Rajbhaban and rode his bicycle all the way to to the coastal city <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay.html" title="Bombay">Bombay</a>(now Mumbai).There he had work for a month as a part- time teacher in Palm Beach school to raise money for the ticket in a ship bound for Iran.He reached Khoramshaher,a coastal town in southern <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a> and started cycling through the plains of <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tigris.html" title="Tigris">Tigris</a>.He crossed <a href="../../../e/s/f/Esfahan.html" title="Esfahan">Esfahan</a> enroute to <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehran.html" title="Tehran">Tehran</a> and after staying there for some days rode to traverse the Iranian desert and finally reach <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabul.html" title="Kabul">Kabul</a> after crossing the Afgan border.From Kabul he sought for the visa to enter <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>.But Soviet government only gave him permission to enter the country if he agrees to stick to an official guide who'll show him a few major cities of western Russia.He flew to Moscow according to the schedule planned but soon came back to Kabul as he wasn't intereseted in a restricted visit under the watch of government.However he came bavk to Tehran and through Iraq and Turkey finally landed in the European soil of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>.He travelled in and out through Greece and stayed there for a couple of months being a part of a fimly of a Greek professor in Athens.while staying there he got an oppurtunity to travell accross the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean_sea.html" title="Mediterranean sea">Mediterranean sea</a> in a yatch and visit some of the port cities in northern Africa.It was all arranged by the professor,whose family had a great affection for him.In europe he rode across a lot of countries but spent most of his time in Switzerland,where he reached after leaving Greece followed by crossing the <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alps.html" title="Alps">Alps</a>.From <a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxemburg.html" title="Luxemburg">Luxemburg</a> he was given a free ticket to Reykjavik in Icelandic Airways as a complement to his outstanding adventure.Needless to say,by that time he was famous in many countries of Europe,appeared in several newspapers in several languages,which all described his enormously courageous feat in different stories.He also made a huge number of aquintances in different countries,who helped and inspired him to continue.while staying in Iceland he went to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenland.html" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> in an Army Helicopter and stayed there with a <a href="../../../e/s/k/Eskimo.html" title="Eskimo">Eskimo</a> family for nearly a month.He returned to Reykjavik and from there he took the trans-atlantic flight to finally land in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>.He was initially blocked while he tried to check because he had only 7 bucks in his pocket,but he had to show old paper-cuttings of his interviews in European newspapers to convince the officer that he will be able to continue on his his and money is not a hindrance for him.Thereafter a long struggle followed to survive and continue his journey.Not only he managed to do that;America remained the country besides Switzerland to recognise his extraordinary achievements most and contributed much to his success.He even had a short meeting with president <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> who wished him a successful journey.He stayed nearly a year in America and travelled extensively.Then he moved on to Mexico and through rode across the Middle-American countries.In the meantime he went <a href="../../../t/a/h/Tahiti.html" title="Tahiti">Tahiti</a> with a french team in their yatch.He stayed there for a few months,worked and raised money for a trans-pacific cruise to Aucland in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>.Thereafter he went to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> and finally returned to <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madras.html" title="Madras">Madras</a>(now Chennai).From there he rode his cycle way to Kolkata again.</p>

<p><br />
[[All Nations 1 AFC Poppies 2]] Kev Meikle (2)</p>
<p>New signing, Kevin Meikle made the perfect start to his AFC Poppies career, by grabbing a brace as The Poppies beat an aggressive All Nations side.</p>
<p>The opening goal came 10 minutes into the game, a long ball found Meikle in space and he turned on a six pence before unleashing a top banana of a strike to give The Poppies the lead.</p>
<p>On 20 minutes, All Nations equalised when a cross was converted by the left wing back, Marcus.</p>
<p>With 10 minutes left, Darren Young introduced Ross Patrick and he made an immediate impact. A cross by All Nations was headed out by the consisitent debutant, Russell Gillett and inside his own half, Patrick ran at the All Nations defence, skipping past 5 players before sliding the ball across the six yard box to a sliding Meikle who poked the Poppies back into the lead.</p>
<p>The midfield of Mark Knight and Simon Colson kept the ball well and captain, Matt Knight marshalled the defence along side a solid Gillett and Carl Russell.</p>
<p>All Nations had a couple more chances but the defence was excellent and keeper, Young made several top drawer saves.</p>
<p>All Nations started to get agitated with a couple of minutes left, Patrick was the victim of an elbow but it didnt stop The Poppies taking all three points. Final Score&#160;: POPPIES 2 ALL NATIONS 1</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Rowell Charter (Div 3) 1 AFC Poppies 2 Matt Knight (1) Mark Knight (1)</p>
<p>AFC Poppies 2 - 1 Rowell Charter</p>
<p>A goal each for the Knight brothers was enough to see off a strong Rowell Charter, that played far better than there bottom of the table status suggested. The game started quite poorly for AFC who failed to really get going in the first fifteen minutes, with only one creditable shot on goal. Ben, making a comeback after a brief spell out, used his height well but was man marked for the whole half and couldn't get through a tight Rowell defence. Rowell Charter had lots of possesion and should of been 3 or 4 goals up by half time if it wasn't for some top class saves from Darren Young and great defending from Russ and returning diFante. AFC seemed to be on the backfoot and were lucky to be going into halftime at 0-0......</p>
<p>Mark was moved from centre midfield to a forward position, replacing Ben, and Matt went to midfield with Wayne moving to right back. The changes were key to the second half success and within a few minutes, AFC spawned there first goal. A throw in by Mark was met with an excellent through ball to Matt from Rossy, who took a few steps to unleash a thunderbolt volley through the Charter defence, giving the 'keeper no chance. The relief and jubilation was felt by all players and AFC started to grow in confidence. Five minutes later a long ball from the 'keeper was well controlled by Mark, who passed to Matt on the edge of the box, and with a superb through ball back to his brother, fired past the keeper to put AFC 2 up. Rowell Charter were stunned after there first half onslaught and were now fired up to attack for the last quarter of the game. AFC were still high on there goal when Charter raced through what seemed like an empty half, to blast past a helpless Young. AFC still threatened but it would be Charter who ended the game with most possesion. Mark had a glorious chance to make it 3-1 but his lob over a starnded goalkeeper, was just off target. Matt then went off with blood all over his shirt from an open wound, replaced by Simon in midfield, who did well to keep the ball in Rowell's half. The last couple minutes were certainly 'edge of the seat' stuff, with Charter firing in from all angles, but the defence stood firm to give AFC an importnat and very creditbale win. Next weeks game against top boys, Krone, will be an even tougher test for AFC lads, but the team spirit is high after 2 wins in a row.</p>
<p>AFC will be bolstered in the attacking department next week, with returning top scorer Kevin Meikle looking to improve on his tally. --Footballfan07 14:48, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Cause marketing or cause-related marketing is a public relations strategy that forges a strategic alliance between a for-profit company and a non-profit organization (or “cause”). A cause partnership is symbiotic: The non-profit organization benefits from heightened awareness, increased donations, and improved recognition and volunteerism, while its corporate partner improves customer loyalty, employee morale and retention and increases sales without sending too transparent a commercial message. A cause marketing program can also preempt or quell a crisis. With this strategy, a company incorporates a philanthropic agenda as part of its marketing strategy, garnering media attention and visibility through cause-related events, internal communications, merchandising, advertising, package design, online marketing, etc. While many U.S. citizens view cause-marketing as a corporate responsibility, consumers reward brands and companies that embrace “giving back.”</p>
<p><b>Cause Marketing’s History and Examples:</b> “In today’s corporate culture, companies are not just encouraged but also expected to give back, to embrace a philosophy of corporate social responsibility,” cited cause-marketing pioneer John Rosica. In 2000, the management of Parade Magazine and several national charities (including Literacy Volunteers of America, Habitat for Humanity, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, and Birthing Project U.S.A.) recognized Rosica for his work in this field and proclaimed him to be the “father of cause marketing.” If Rosica is the father of cause marketing, his business competitor, Carol Cone of Cone, Inc., is the “mother of cause branding.” While Cone and Rosica have furthered awareness of the practice of cause-related marketing, corporate America has a long way to go as their donations, according to a July 10, 2006 Newsweek article, still only represent about five percent of all charitable giving. Seventy-seven percent of giving comes from individuals’ donations. The study was conducted by The Boston Foundation and Boston College’s Center on Wealth and Philanthropy.</p>
<p>In addition, Cone’s Corporate Citizenship Study has demonstrated the importance of cause-related marketing. In their individual cause-marketing practices, both Rosica and Cone have partnered countless corporations with non-profit entities. Some of these include Famous Amos Cookies with Literacy Volunteers of America; Revlon with the Birthing Project U.S.A.; and Whole Foods with Coffee and Farmer Equity.</p>

<p>124.157.142.51 15:22, 6 November 2006 (UTC) Birth</p>
<p>Born in 1934 at a place called Lak Marwat in District Bannu in present Pakistan, Giani Sant Singh Maskeen was the only son of his parents.</p>
<p>Parents</p>
<p>His parents were S. Kartar Singh and Mata Ram Kaur.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>He received his primary education from the Khalsa School but was unable to complete his higher education from Government High School due to the partition of India in 1947. After the partition, he and his family went and settled in Alwar in Rajasthan.</p>
<p>The demise of his father in 1952 created an adverse impact on him and he started feeling sad and isolated from worldly issues. Therefore he left home and started learning the basic tenets of Gurbani from various places and from different scholars. He became so engrossed in Gurbani that he himself soon became a learned narrator.</p>
<p>Marriage</p>
<p>He was married to Bibi Sunder Kaur in 1958 and thereafter made Alwar his permanent home.</p>
<p>Lifestyle</p>
<p>Maskeen Ji was a very simple person who advocated simplicity. Wearing simple white clothes with a black turban, he looked very distinguished. His associates and other people accompanying him also followed the same simplicity of dress. He was very down to earth and had a simple and frugal lifestyle. Where ever he went he always preferred to stay at the Gurudwara Sahib and partook his meals from the Langar.</p>
<p>Style of Narration and its Impact</p>
<p>His way of narration was uniquely different from all other scholars whether old or new. He began a particular topic and continued to elaborate on it giving different examples and thereby creating a style which the common person readily understood and could follow in their daily life. His concepts were quiet clear and his voice created a deep impact on all his listeners. Every person whether educated or not would be inspired by him.</p>
<p>Since he himself led the life he preached, and which was based on Gursikhi and Gurmat, people would relate to him easily. This had a tremendous impact on his audiences as he was the living example of what he advocated.</p>
<p>He didn't hesitate in speaking out the truth and could discourse with the best. Giani Sant Singh Maskeen even used to speak in the gathering of the people belonging to other communities and religions. And everybody was impressed by his persona.</p>
<p>His Foreign Trips</p>
<p>He visited different countries and places including Kabul, Kandhar, Kuwait, Singapore, Malaysia, England, Iran, Canada and America among others. Sikh communities in all these countries had great respect for him and always awaited his arrival with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Achievements</p>
<p>He also established a meditation center at his home town Alwar in Rajasthan, India where a Samagam (function) is held every year on the eve of "Hollah Mohallah" and which is attended by the scholars, preachers and learned people of the Sikh Community. The Khalsa School he established at Alwar has been a great success.</p>
<p>He authored more than a dozen books and innumerable audio cassettes and CDs, which have impacted the thinking and way of life of the Sikh Community. His daily discourses of Guru Granth Sahib on National TV network were beamed worldwide. His words provided guidance to many a wavering mind.</p>
<p>Giani Sant Singh Maskeen was a colossal striding across the contemporary Sikh Society for nearly five decades. His demise has created a vacuum, which would be very difficult to fill. The Sikh Community needed him at this crucial juncture when western influences are making inroads into the Sikh Culture. The loss of Giani Sant Singh Maskeen is indeed, a great loss to the worldwide Sikh Community</p>

Titan is a newly-rediscovered cave in Derbyshire, England. Recently uncovered by Dave Nixon, from information pieced together from a paper written by James Plumtree in 1793, it described a network of caves which went beyond Leviathan, a well-known cave system near Castleton. Titan is estimated to be about 459ft (140m) from floor to ceiling.</p>
<p>The entrance to Titan had been hidden by a rockfall. Mr Nixon and a group of fellow Peak-district cavers spent in excess of 3 years excavating the rockfall to expose the long system leading to Titan.</p>

The Beginning.. Gerry Pack had been looking for an entrepreneurial alternative to his job of 14 years. He noticed that there was no easy way to book holiday travellers a night at an airport hotel, that there were no discounted rates available and, because of the climate of recession in 1983, there were empty hotel rooms that would have normally housed business clients.</p>
<p>Holiday Extras started out as the Apple Booking Company. Travel Agents - attracted to the idea - would call in and express an interest and then they were sent a booking pack which contained a 3 copy carbon book and freepost envelopes.</p>
<p>The Apple Booking Company offered a small amount of airport hotels at London Gatwick, London Heathrow and Luton airport - with a simple, uncomplicated range of three star hotels, doubles singles or twins. The prices were set at a discounted rate and the products were aimed at the holiday, leisure traveller. Initially hotels were unnamed, hence the really great discounts. Unnamed hotels are a popular product that Holiday Extras offer today and they are still booked for really low prices.</p>
<p>The travel agents and the hotels found the new booking arrangement both lucrative and convenient. British holiday makers benefited from the advantages of an easy all encompassing hotel booking system where there was plenty of choice and lower room rates.</p>
<p>The Apple Booking Company worked in a symbiotic partnership with travel agents. The travel agents embraced the opportunity, they could now earn commission in an area were they had struggled to before, and it offered them extra revenue in a difficult trading atmosphere.</p>
<p>Continued Growth.. In 1986 the company launched their Travel Insurance and in 1988 Airport Parking - More airports and more suppliers were added to the growing portfolio. The business continued to grow. In the early '90s the company re-branded as ABC Holiday Extras and the hub of the business was housed in a characterful barn conversion at Smeeth, Nr Ashford.</p>
<p>Holiday Extras had always tried to keep a dependable supply of airport parking but at some airports demand continually outstripped supply. Holiday Extras made a brave move into supply with the purchase of its first car parking company close to Birmingham airport. Holiday Extras branded this new business Airparks Ltd. The supply business offered very different logistic challenges to the booking and contractual side but the business continues to grow. The company now has 5 sites at different Airports with a total of 11,000 UK airport car parking spaces on offer.</p>
<p>Steve Lawrence joined Holiday Extras (then ABC) in 1994 as Marketing Director. Over the following two years he took on responsibility for the insurance business, then the Call Centre and in 1998 he became Managing Director.</p>
<p>The Website.. In April 2000 the website www.holidayextras.co.uk was launched and so with it was the sales to direct customers - The traditional way to run this sort of travel business was either to sell through travel agents or to direct customers- not usually with both - but agents soon realised that there was a great opportunity involved for their own businesses. Agents embraced the opportunities to expand their businesses to reach a larger audience and to build their own website businesses. The market place became a different one with the web allowing agents to reach previously untapped areas.</p>
<p>The cost of traditional advertising had made the route to the direct market prohibitive. Only display advertising gave anything like a reasonable cost per booking but the new websites gave many more opportunities. The company's website is now responsible for nearly 90% of bookings.</p>
<p>Holiday Extras new marketplaces..</p>
<p>Holiday Extras now operate in a wider and more diverse marketplace, with offices in Germany, a new travel insurance website soon to be launched and other product areas including Theme Park Breaks and Theatre Breaks. From the simplicity of the early beginnings the company continues to expand into areas of demand for the leisure traveller.</p>
<p>The aim of the company at the start point, as it is now, was to offer the Best. The success of the company has been built through forging strong relationships with agents and suppliers through continual investment in people and new products.</p>
<p>The team of workers at Holiday Extras are among the top one hundred in the UK most satisfied with their jobs, their prospects and their management (See Our Awards 2006 - THE SUNDAY TIMES TOP 100 COMPANIES TO WORK FOR).</p>
<p>Holiday Extras is now housed in a purpose designed building at Newingreen, between Hythe and Ashford in Kent UK.</p>
<p>Holiday Extras continues to offer Best Choice, Best Price, Best Service and is the UK Market Leader.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-07_34a2.html" title="Edit section: Emperor Kazuya">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Emperor Kazuya</span></h2>
<p>Emperor Kazuya, also known as Darth Shadow, is a Dark Lord of the Sith and Supreme Ruler of {TES}, The Emperor's Shadow. Before his rise to power, Emperor Kazuya used to be a Sith Assassin that would hunt anyone for not just the money, but also for the sheer pleasure of their death. His lair was on the Dark Planet of Vjun, few people went to this planet because of the dangers it held, including Acid Rain. Before learning of the Sith Academy, Kazuya was part of a small Clan in Jedi Knights II : Jedi Outcast called 'Legion of Sith' [LoS]. This was a small clan that included 4 members, but they were powerful indeed. After a tale of unfortunate events, a war broke out between the LoS and the LoJ (Legion of Jedi) and everyone was killed....except for two. Kazuya and Typhon (Leader of the LoJ). The two engaged in a epic duel that went all the way through the deathstar to the throne room. Eventually, with great speed, Kazuya cut off both of Typhon's arms from elbow down. Wanting to show no mercy, Kazuya lifted the body.....grinned at Typhon as he had his last breath...and dropped the body down the shaft into the Main Reactor of the Deathstar. The LoJ was no more... After that war Kazuya began to see himself as superior to the others and demanded he take over the LoS. The other members refused to co-operate with Kazuya's Dark Deeds. He then unleashed all his anger and attacked all 4 members. He stabbed the first one (Shya - Sith Knight), kicked the second one of the ledge (Leyoin - Sith Master), blew the third one away with lightning ( Miriant - Sith Lord), but when it came to Lord Dragon the fight continued. Lord Dragon wasn't willing to let Kazuya accomplish what he hoped to. The two battled for about 10 mins. Until Kazuya let out powerful bolts of lightning hoping to destroy Dragon once and for all. But with quick thinking Dragon reflected the lightning using his lightsaber! This made Kazuyas face all scarred and deformed. Thinking he had won, Dragon walked up to Kazuya when suddenly ,with all his energy he had, Kazuya jumped and sliced Dragons head off before he knew what hit him.That was it...the LoS was no more.</p>
<p>To hide his disfigured image, Kazuya then kept to his simple Sith Robes.</p>
<p>After this Kazuya then went looking about. He disguised himself as 'Raiden'. He came across a big organisation called {SOR} (Senate of Republicans). After a few months of high negotiations Raiden (Kazuya) was elected to become a Senator for the Queen of this organisation (Queen Gilliana). But what these people didn't know was that he was indeed the Dark Lord himself. Raiden then found out that this clan was part of a 3-clan organisation. The other two clans were {SOI} (Senate of Imperials) and {JO} (The Jedi Order). Now Kazuya wanted to become more than a senator so he came up with several disguises and began encouraging members from each clan to make a election for a new Supreme Ruler. After about 2-3 months they thought it out and held a election. Senator Banshab ({JO}), Senator Kirama ({SOI}), Senator Xioaha ({SOI}) and Senator Raiden {SOR} were elected to succeed the current ruler, who was Chancellor Kilbrino. This election was going on for months. Raiden was second and it was about to be concluded. But the day before the election, Senator Banshab who was first place mysteriously disappeared. Which made the Leader Raiden.Many people where happy with this choice...but others ,however, were not. The {JO} was the part that mostly disagreed with this choice. They believed that there was something mysterious about Raiden, they believed that the Dark Side of the Force surrounded him. Of course this was true...but nobody knew his true identy for the time being. The {SOI} was mostly agreeing with Raiden's ideas, he wanted to give the {SOI} more power. This eventually went through and the {SOI} became the leading group...rather than the {SOR}. The other clans were furious but since Raiden was now the leader they could do nothing about it. The {SOI} where the leading group and they were with Raiden, nothing could be done. One Jedi, a leading Jedi on the High Council, called Master Rhyeu decided it was time to act. He could see that there was something extremely wrong with Raiden, he was too aggressive. They sent 3 of their Jedi to make this Chancellor step down after his curious acts over the last 6 months.</p>
<p>Once they arrived at the senate they told the guards the Chancellor had wished to see them. So they contacted Raiden and told them. He replied "Heh...they must want to make me step down. Send them up". The three Jedi then went up to the Office. "Can I help you Master Jedi?" said the Chancellor. "Yes...you can Chancellor" said Master Banshab, "By stepping down and stopping this charade!". "Are you threatening me Master Jedi?" said the Chancellor with a cold voice. "The senate will decide your fate!" said Master Liona. The Chancellor grinned,"I am the senate!". "Not yet" came the calm but nervous voice of Master Banshab. The Chancellor then stood up. "I'm sorry to surprise you.....". He then pulled his mask off, nobody knew it was a mask of course, to reveal the Dark Lord Kazuya! "Its Kazuya!" shouted Banshab. Kazuya then put his hood up, laughed, and grinned "Its treason then...". He then ignited his lightsaber that was hidden up his sleeve and jumped at the Jedi.... Using is anger and hatred Kazuya pushed back the Jedi with a brutal force, he was too fast for the Jedi Knights and slaughtered Banshab and Liona with ease. All that was left was Master Rhyeu. The two battled their way through the Chancellors office until they eventually reached the other office under the Grand Convocation Chamber. They fought there until Rhyeu flipped back onto the Podium, activating it. Kazuya jumped at him and the two fought on the podium as it rose into the Grand Convocation Chamber. A few senators managed to see this battle between the two, the {SOI} saw this as a assassination attempt on the Chancellor by the jedi as they knew the {JO} had no respect for the Chancellor and where not happy at his leadership. Kazuya made for Rhyeus head but the small jedi flipped over and attempted to slay the Dark Lord. But calling on the Dark Side, Kazuya gained power and jumped from the podium to one of the pods. Rhyeu followed only to find other pods flying at him, he dodged them and managed to get to Kazuya. On sight Kazuya let out powerful bolts of lightning which sent Rhyeu flying down. Mysteriously, Rhyeu survived the fall and managed to escape. After this Kazuya ordered that the {JO} be wiped out after its attempt to overthrow him. The {JO} eventually had to disband and leave. This left Kazuya in complete control and he changed the whole thing into his very own Empire. Master Rhyeu has never came face to face with Kazuya since that battle, but one day the two will meet again.... After about 2 years in control this Empire began to become smaller and Kazuya was going to move on to the next place that he would then build his Empire again. This was Jedi Knight III : Jedi Academy. It eventually came to an end after Kazuya left and the Empire separated into separate clans all over Jedi Knight II : Jedi Outcast.</p>
<p>When Kazuya first came to Jedi Academy he went through the Clans searching for some link to get to power. He came across a Big Clan called the Society of the Force Knights (SotFK). He was going to join that...but then, about 3 months later, he found someone else. Darth*Sion. Darth*Sion had begun a small cult called the Sith Academy. Now Kazuya was really interested in joining the Sith Academy, so Darth*Sion accepted him. His name was now Darth*Kazuya. Darth*Sion went a short holiday about a week after Kazuya had joined. Not knowing this, Kazuya was curious about where Darth*Sion had gone. A week later Darth*Sion returned. He then made Kazuya co-leader of the Sith Academy, as he himself wouldn't be able to keep it going (at that time anyway). Kazuya was pleased at this. But after a few weeks Kazuya began to see something in Darth*Sion (by that time he changed his name to Anakin). He began to see that Sion was foolish, power-hungry and that he acted before thinking.</p>
<p>Today Kazuya is no longer in the Sith Academy. After seeing what the leader truly was like he decided to leave.Other members also left as they also saw that the leader was selfish and would never give anyone what they wanted, he called himself a 'true Sith'...which was incorrect as a true Sith would be fair and concentrate more on having his cult destroy the jedi and not itself. Once they had left they decided to make their own cult with Kazuya as Emperor.</p>
<p>He is now know as Emperor Kazuya, Dark Lord of the Sith and Supreme Ruler of The Emperor's Shadow.</p>

<p>Search Engine Image Protection (SEIP), also known as online reputation management, combines the expertise of <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine_marketing.html" title="Search engine marketing">Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</a> and PR, and is designed to protect a company or brand against incorrect negative publicity via the Internet.</p>
<p>By using SEIP strategies to push potentially damaging information out of the top search engine rankings, marketers hope to protect their brand image and make a good impression on Internet users who may be researching a future purchase.</p>

<p>SEIP draws on a combination of SEM and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_relations.html" title="Public relations">public relations</a> strategies to supplant unflattering online content with brand-friendly content. Typically this involves regular monitoring of search pages, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blogs</a>, news sites and discussion pages for negative, false or out-dated information on a company or brand.</p>
<p>Marketers produce web releases, blog entries, articles and other fresh content for online submission. If well designed and distributed, this content will be picked up by the search engines, pushing the older, less desirable information out of the top rankings on the search engine results pages (SERP) and out of the view of most search engine users.</p>
<p>This process takes advantage of the natural turnover of Internet content. If out-dated information is ranking highly on the search engines, it may not be replaced until newer content is introduced. In addition to protecting their brand, marketers are helping consumers by providing relevant product information and assisting Website administrators by offering fresh content.</p>

<p>Thank you for experimenting with Wikipedia. Your test worked, and it has been <a href="../../../r/e/v/Help%7EReverting_1fd5.html" title="Help:Reverting">reverted</a> or removed.

<p>Fractional Yacht Ownership is another form of evolution of the fractional ownership model used by Jet Manufacturers and Jet Charter Firms. Fractional Yacht Ownership Companies offer ownership or membership of/within a fleet of yachts of all shapes and sizes. Responding to the rise in multi-faceted lifestyles of the modern world, shrinking waterfront access and growing complexity of boat operation and ownership, Fractional Yacht Ownership provides a tenable alternative to traditional ownership. Fractional ownership is simple, enjoyable and painless - adjectives not normaly associated with traditional boat ownership.</p>
<p>Types of Membership</p>
<p>Fractional Ownership of yachts come in various forms. To begin with, the provider may only provide small sailboats, Mega Power Yachts, something in between, or all of the above. Types of ownership vary as well, one may sell a percentage of an individual yacht, another sells membership into a fleet. Some companies only operate the boats in a set location, others move the yachts around the globe.</p>
<p>Fractional Yacht Ownership business models are diverse in structure. A wholly-owned and operated club will own, operate and manage all the boats in the all the markets the boats serve. A Franchise firm will sell markets to franchisees to own and operate the boats within the market. A Boat Franchise Firm will seel individual boats as franchises, putting the responsibility of the boats' member sales and operation</p>
<p>Fractional Yacht Ownership providers have been in business for over 8 years, but a number of new contenders have joined the marketplace in recent years. Judged by the Jet, Car and Real Estate Fractional Markets, Yachts should fair well in coming years.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-07_34a2.html" title="Edit section: Book Building Process in Capital Market">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Book Building Process in Capital Market</span></h2>
<p>== BOOK BUILDING PROCESS Neetu Khanna' Lecturer in commerce KMV, Jalandhar==</p>
<p>Book- Building refers to process of building a book for bids received from intended investors. In technical language, it is a process used to ascertain and record the indicative subscription bids of interested investors to a planned issue of securities The purpose of obtaining advance feedback is to reach to :-  Optimal pricing  Benchmark for valuation of further funds to be raised through IPO.</p>
<p>“A process undertaken by which a demand for securities proposed to be issued by body corporate is elicited and built up and price for such securities is assessed for the determination of the quantum of such securities to be issued by means of notice, circular, advertisement, document or information memorandum or offer document SEBI guidelines, 1995 (quoted in saha, 2004, P. 198)</p>
<p>Thus Book Building acts as scientific method through which consensus price of IPO’s may be determined on basis of feed back received from most informed investors including institutional &amp; corporate (UTI, LIC, QIB’s, FII etc). In this way it helps to make a correct evaluation of company’s potential and price (worth) of it’s shares.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Features</p>
<p>1. Pricing: optimised, since price is discovered through a biding process 2. Target investors set: --Essentially wholesale (institutional corporate) but small investor too 3. Transaction cost: - in range of 2-5% of issues size 4. Time involved- 3-4 months 5. Regulations- SEBI guidelines &amp; stock exchange requirement 6. Suitability: - Company for which institutional interest is expected to substantial - Profit making companies with good intrinsic value and future prospects</p>
<p>Differece between Fixed Price and Book Building method Basis</p>
<p>Price Fixed price</p>
<p>Price at which securities are offered allotted is known in advance to investors Book-Building Issue price is not known rather just indicative price ranges known Demand Demand for securities offered is known only after closure of issue Demand can be known everyday as books is built Payment Payment is made at time of subscription where in refund is given after allocation in fixed price</p>
<p>Payment for application money is required to be made only after allocation (for institutional investors only)in book building Risk There is risk of failure of issue if co does not receive 90%as minimum subscription in fixed price Risk can be avoided because if feedback is dim, issue can be deferred</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Various parties involved in Book-Building process are  Issuer Company  Book-Runner Lead Manager (BRLM)  Syndicate Member BRLM&amp; Syndicate members are intermediaries in this process &amp; are both eligible to act as underwriters. Steps to be following in book- building process can be summarized as follows: - 1. The Issuer Company proposing an IPO appoints a lead Merchant banker as BRLM. 2. Initially, the issuer company consults with the BRLM in drawing up a draft prosecutes (known as the Red –herring prospectus). It does not mention the price of issue but includes other details about  Size of issue  Past history of company  Purpose for raising money  Price band- range between which intended buyers can quote for company’s share or the floor price  Many other details. 3. The draft prospectus is filed with SEBI which gives it legal standing. 4 .A definite period is fixed as the bid period and BRLM conducts awareness campaigns like advertisements , road shows etc 5. The BRLM appoints a syndicate member, a SEBI registered intermediary to underwriter the issues to the extent of “net offer to the public”. The BRLM is entitled to remuneration for conducting the Book-Building process. 6 The copy of draft prospectus may be circulated by the BRLM to the institutional investors as will as to syndicate members. 7. The syndicate members create demand and ask each investor for the number of shares and the offer price. 8. The BRLM receives the feedback about the investors bids through syndicate members. The investors can revise their bids at any time during the bid period 9. The BRLM on receipts of the feed back from the syndicate members about the bid price and the quantity of shares applied has to build up an order book showing the demand for shares of the company at various prices. However, separate record book should be maintained for orders received from institutional investors out of placement portion 10. On the receipts of above information the BRLM and the issuer company determine issue price which is also known as market clearing price 11. The BRLM then closes the book in consultation with the issuer company and determine the issue size of (a) Placement portions (institutional investors) (b) Public offer (offered to public other than institutional) 12. Once the final price is determined, allocation of securities should be made by BRLM based on prior commitment, investor’s quality, price aggression, earliness of bids etc. the bid of an institutional bidder, even if, full amount has been paid, may be rejected without assigning any cause. 13. The final prospectus is field with registrar of companies within 2 days of determination of issue price and receipts of acknowledgement card from SEBI. 14. Two different accounts for collection of application money, one for private placement portion and other for Issuer Company should be opened by issuer company . 15. The allotment for private placement portion shall be made on 2nd day from the closer of issue &amp; for public offer, allotment is made as per stationary requirements. Finally, SEBI inspect all records &amp; books maintained by BRIM &amp; allow securities to be listed &amp; traded on stock exchange.</p>

<p>"The R$B In Me" is an upcoming album from "new" R&amp;B crooner Don P. Ofcourse Don P is a creation from music mogul Paul Delgado which also happens to be Hit Rapper P-Gunna. In interviews when asked about the album P has been Quoted as saying " its just straight R&amp;B..." adding "ive always wanted to do this project, i think it shows that ive always leaned toward an R&amp;B beat then a regular hip hop beat... its not a puplicity stunt or none of that shit its just me doing me if u like it then cop it if not dont bash it (laughs) but in all honestly i think people will be surprised when they finally hear it and they'll be like WOW dudes done his homework but its not really doing homework when you've gone thru alot of the things you put on wax..." others who have herd cuts from the album say he is bringing back the R&amp;B feel ...</p>
<p>In a San Fernando Valley interview he had this to say "When i finally sat my ass down and started working on the album i had really finished about 10-13 songs and i was already done with it becauses i never really thought about a second album for Don P so when i was thinking i said to myself shit am i gonna do the Don p thing for awhile of is it just a one off thing... so i decided to pack the album with songs... not to say i just threw a shit load of jams in the album but i was happy with how it all came out so by the time the album hits shelves fans will be 17-21 songs and im thinking of adding a few bonus songs too"</p>

<p>Used widely in pharmaceutical research, LogD is the logarithm of the "true" partition coefficient of a compound between octanol and water. It is a physico-chemical parameter that has a high correlation with absorption of small molecules into physiological membranes. LogD considers all of the forms of the structure, including the ionized species, unlike logP - which corresponds only to the neutral form.</p>
<p>If you require calculations of octanol/water partition coefficients (P), often you must work under fixed pH conditions, because the compound you are working with is ionizable. The distribution coefficient (D) considers the partitioning of all ionic species of the compound.</p>
<p>In order to calculate logD values of the test compound, both the logarithms of the partition coefficient (logP) and of the dissociation constant(s) (pKa) are needed.</p>
<p>Market research has shown that predicted logD can significantly help experts interested in the fields of pharmaceutical discovery, medicinal chemistry, environmental management and analytical chemistry.</p>

<p>Yki Nummi (1925 - 1984)</p>
<p>designer</p>
<p>Yki Nummi was born in the province of Huan in China, where his parents worked as missionaries. After matriculating in 1945, Nummi first studied mathematics and physics, but later opted for a career in design, graduating from the department of decorative painting of the Institute of Applied Arts in Helsinki in the spring of 1950.</p>
<p>Nummi was a versatile designer, who played a part in making Finnish design world-renowned in the 1950s. Upon graduating, he was employed as a designer by the Stockmann-Orno lamp and light-fixture factory, serving in this capacity until 1975. One of his best-known lamp designs was Modern Art, produced by Orno in 1955. Yki Nummi also designed lighting and light fixtures for many schools, hospitals, restaurants and other public facilities.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, Yki Nummi designed light fixtures and various types of serving trays and containers for the Sanka company of Loviisa in acrylic, which was a new material at the time. His designs evolved in the factory’s Y Collection. Nummi is one of the pioneers of design in plastics in Finland.</p>
<p>Nummi himself regarded colour design as his most important professional contribution. He began to design for the Tikkurila paint factory of the Schildt &amp; Hallberg company in 1950, and was head of the factory’s design and planning department from 1958 until 1975. He established a paint and colour service office at the factory and developed a paint-mixing system known as the Joker colour chart. Nummi also designed colour schemes for schools, hospitals and factories and, among other works, the interior and exterior colour schemes of Helsinki Cathedral in connection with the renovation of the church in the mid-1960s. He also created municipal colour schemes for various localities, such as Kokemäki, Nokia and Karkkila.</p>
<p>Nummi began to design book covers as a student, making covers and illustrations for works by his brother Lassi Nummi and a number of other authors. He also designed wallpapers.</p>
<p>Yki Nummi participated in a large number of exhibitions and trade fairs. His works were awarded gold medals at the Milan Triennials of 1954 and 1957. He received the Pro Finlandia medal in 1971.</p>

<p>The Broctons Standard is a methodology used for compliance assurance in corporate organisations affiliated with regulatory bodies</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Broctons Standard standardises and benchmarks an approach to identify, document and test business and Information Technology (IT) specific processes.</p>
<p>The methodology outlines the steps to operational compliance by :</p>
<p>- allocating of all functions in a organistaion to a logical opeartional group,</p>
<p>- identifying and documenting the potential risks associated with these processes,</p>
<p>- documenting the as is state of the process</p>
<p>- identifying the operational controls</p>
<p>- identifying the issues in the as is state</p>
<p>- testing the operational controls</p>
<p><br />
The Broctons Standard uses BSI/ISO as a basis for all its associated processes</p>
<p>The Broctons Standard is published in the Broctons Guide</p>

Danny Delegato started playing muisc at the age 12. He is an up and coming musician from Portland, Oregon. He played in a band called VATARA for four years. Now, he is still living in the pacific Northwest of Portland, Oregon and plays guitar and sings in the critically acclaimed pop band D&amp;K</p>
<p>He likes to write about what he thinks is important and right now he says "the world we live and breathe and love in is dying...I believe the world is in negative state currently, and it's going down hill from here.. Fast!. 9 11 was the pretext."</p>
<p>"Each day is being lived out repetively. We are on the verge of a something new. We know something will come soon. Talk to friends, strangers, spread the word. Is it 2012?? It's in the leaves blowing in the wind, in the sun that's getting hotter, in the stillness of a busy city that's moving faster than ever."</p>
<p>W/ that said, it's highly unlikely this 17 year old pop rockin' teen will not become noticed, his band D&amp;K is releasing a new LP titled "Blue Days &amp; Black Nights" coming to storesin Spring of 2007.</p>
