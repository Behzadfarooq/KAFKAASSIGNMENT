<li><b>Possible Bias - Abstain</b> If you wish to research some of the public record about my role in the GNU Project and the FSF, one place to go are the GNU's Bulletins (which I helped start). They are probably on <a href="http://www.gnu.org|" class="external text" title="http://www.gnu.org|" rel="nofollow">http://www.gnu.org</a>, though they may have been moved to <a href="http://www.fsf.org|" class="external text" title="http://www.fsf.org|" rel="nofollow">http://www.fsf.org</a>.
<ul>
<li>I think an exception should be made to the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a> policy for this page, even though I started it, and it is about me. The reasons include:
<ul>
<li>My contributions are short. One fact. One preference. Two links to my web sites for those curious about me.</li>
<li>I don't plan to add to it. I'm not sure at this point what to do, if something false is added -- your feedback welcome on this.</li>
<li>I stood by and with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Stallman_a8be.html" title="Richard Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> and did much work on the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Project_c451.html" title="GNU Project">GNU Project</a> and helped him, gjs, hal, and rjc start the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Software_Foundation_6e41.html" title="Free Software Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a> (FSF) for over a dozen years. I was a founding member of the Board of Directors of FSF, and served on the Board for a dozen years.</li>
<li>I'm listed on the FSF page for that role. Yes, I added that entry as well.</li>
<li><b>I added that entry and filled out the rest of the Board's history and added the <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_H._Tower_Jr._0666.html" title="Leonard H. Tower Jr.">Leonard H. Tower Jr.</a> article, because a number of people sent me e-mail asking why that history wasn't in the Wikipedia FSF article.</b> I added the two links to my websites, because the articles for the other FSF Board Members had them, and it would help sastisfy people's curiousity about who I am. I didn't add the link to my bio.html, because I only wrote it to sastisfy requests from high school and college friends about what's life been like.</li>
<li>I be willing to see my preference changed into a quote, if that fits Wikipedia culture better.
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia culture is interesting. Be interesting to see what happens here. <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_H._Tower_Jr._0666.html" title="Leonard H. Tower Jr.">Leonard H. Tower Jr.</a> blasted to an empty stub, left as is, edited down or up/enhanced.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Actualy, I don't think that there would have been the FSF if it wasn't for Len Tower. He also has supported the Free Software Movement since almost it's very beginning. Len Tower is a notable person and should be included in the Wikipedia.Org site. The really nice thing about Wikipedia is that we can learn about the people who helped to get us to where we are today.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>Bias disclosure</i>: Len is a friend that I still see occassionally. I believe that his contribution to FSF (and the FSF's work) is significant enough to merit an article.

<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> should never be a problem with stubs.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have known Mr. Tower for decades and it is clear to me that he edited this page in order to make WP articles on FSF related maters, of which he was a major contributor, more complete and not for self aggrandizement. _HughDaniel 03:30, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I've known Len for nearly 20 years and if anything the entry is far too modest. In many ways, I do not believe the FSF would have gone as far as it has without him. While RMS had the vision, it takes smore than that to make an organization run, and that came from Len. Len never asked for limelight, even when RMS received a McCarther award. He just kept doing, and that says a lot. -- Eliot Lear. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Gargleblaster (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gargleblaster_51a7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gargleblaster">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Why is this even a question? Len has been a widely known "tower" of the free software community since the beginning, and is integral to any history of the movement. And the comment above about "no egotistical bone in his body" is 100% true. If Rich Stallman wrote his own stub, would we be having this conversation?

<li><b>Keep and Expand</b> Free Software wouldn't be where it is without Len. He's the unsung hero of the FSF, often bringing sanity and balance to the organization.

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. Doesn't like fame, but creates his own article? (see his website for similar evidence on modesty if you feel that to be a criterion).

<li>Whether or not he is modest or likes fame is irrelevant to whether or not we should have an article on him. He is clearly notable, and an important subject in his field.

<li><b>Weak delete.</b> I searched for sources on Leonard Tower, and couldn't find any reliable ones. I think we can source that he was a director of the FSF, but as it stands, that isn't enough of a reason to have an article. He has done so well at not promoting himself, I can't find any good sources about him. However, if anyone can produce a source that says anything beyond the basics about him, I would support keeping. I don't mind having a stub if it can grow, and I think he's notable, if sources can be found. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 17:14, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
