<ul>
<li>Looking at their webpage, they've formed and might get signed. But no music in the charts yet. <b>Delete</b> as non-notable (you never know they might be this time next year!). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 10:41, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>keep</b> - I understand your concerns with the article but they are not a student band; they worked full time throughout the past few months and are scheduled to release their debut EP in early 2006 and album in September 2006. The article has relevance to existing articles in the database (including <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menswear.html" title="Menswear">Menswear</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liam_Watson_5f7d.html" title="Liam Watson">Liam Watson</a> (which seems to have been already deleted), producer of number one 2003 album <i><a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant_%28album%29.html" title="Elephant (album)">Elephant</a></i> by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_White_Stripes_bfe2.html" title="The White Stripes">The White Stripes</a>). As such, I believe this article should not be considered for deletion. <a href="../../../j/d/w/User%7EJdwhite_37ab.html" title="User:Jdwhite">JDW</a> 10:53, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are guidelines on what is and isn't notable at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Music/Notability_and_Music_Guidelines</a>. While I have nothing against the band, they need to be more famous before they can be included in the Wikipedia. Thye may well be as notable as the White Stripes next year, but not now. Liam Watson was deleted because its sole content was an image; if what you say is true then there's scope for an article about him. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 11:03, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise extremely notable</i>. Their manager Chris Gentry was in Britpop band <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menswear.html" title="Menswear">Menswear</a> who were very famous in the mid-90s. The manager is most definitely a member of the band. Another member of the management team is Howard Gough, manager of <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hope_Of_The_States_d7d0.html" title="Hope Of The States">Hope Of The States</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/m/Komakino.html" title="Komakino">Komakino</a>. The stuff about Liam Watson is true and was already mentioned on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_White_Stripes_bfe2.html" title="The White Stripes">The White Stripes</a>' entry. <a href="../../../j/d/w/User%7EJdwhite_37ab.html" title="User:Jdwhite">JDW</a> 11:11, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case I'd definitely start a new <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liam_Watson_5f7d.html" title="Liam Watson">Liam Watson</a> entry, with more content than one photo. I'm personally unconvinced that Menswear count as 'extremely notable' and that they justify having The Rumours in. Howeve,r I'll now wait for the views of others. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 11:15, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Well I have that Menswear album (Nuisance) and as I remember, Menswear were very famous in 1995ish for being the architypal britpop band - they were signed because they simply looked the part! I'd say Gentry's link to this is enough to warrant this rumours article, but with those links to Watson and the White Stripes I personally don't think there's much doubt this band deserves an wiki-article. --Harlem4 11:59, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, that's a point of view, but one that would certainly carry more weight with me if you had edited wikipedia before other than to make that point. Please bear in mind that using sock-puppets on these pages is very much frowned upon. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 12:02, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think that's very fair. I read those guidelines you posted above and my interpretation is that there's a case for this. I suppose it is just a matter of interpretation. I have edited Wikipedia before but forgot my sign-in details and had to re-register. My main reason for suggesting the Menswear thing was grounds for it was that I do actually have that album! And I don't have <i>that</i> many albums...--Harlem4 12:14, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fair enough. There's a procedure somewhere for having previous edits attributed to you. I'm sure an administrator will be along in a minute who will let you know what it is. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 12:19, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Not convinced of notability or of import of link with Gentry/Menswear. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 13:27, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Notable producer aside, band still does not meet the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria, based on what is written here. When they meet that criteria I will support their right to have a wiki-article; until then though, delete.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:09, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The band doesn't meet the requirements, and Menswear didn't exactly bestride the UK musical scene like a colossus. Extremely notable is the requirement - which to me says <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blur_%28band%29.html" title="Blur (band)">Blur</a> levels of britpop standing, not Menswear. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 21:00, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh yes, I'd consider from the description of Q Sheet that a track on the cover is more likely to be promotional advertising than a sign of notability. We're not in the business of predicting which newly promoted bands will achieve wide airplay and commercial success and which ones won't. If we were good at it, we'd be in the music business... <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 21:05, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; conversely, the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept. These are merely rules of thumb which some editors choose to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to keep an article</i> - although you seem to feel that none of these criteria have been met, I'd say that firstly it's entirely one's opinion that estimates the level of notability (referring to <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menswear.html" title="Menswear">Menswear</a> at the moment). With this in mind, and coupled with the genuine level of integration with existing relevant articles, I feel this is reason enough for the article to remain. Besides which, it's only a matter of months before the <i>guidelines</i> will be <i>unequivocally</i> met. QSheet is not an advertising gimmick, it is simply an indication that the band in question have already had a release into the industry, and with their notable management and production team, there's little question they're going to make a big impression over the coming year. Further, I don't see how the comment concerning the prediction of of wide airplay and commercial success is relevant. If that were the case, I'd have sent in one of their tracks. It's not an audition, it's an encyclopedia article. --<a href="../../../j/d/w/User%7EJdwhite_37ab.html" title="User:Jdwhite">Jdwhite</a> 13:34, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
