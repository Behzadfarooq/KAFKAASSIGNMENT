<li><b>Strongest Possible Keep</b>. Sourced, can still be expanded with a little bit of effort, and, at this point, this nomination does not appear to be in good faith. Not a single effort has been made by "hardline deleitionist" Crawford to expand this. After THREE AfDs that failed to come to a deletion consensus, and after noting that the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES, along with a platinum-selling rock music act and various television shows have more than noted its existence, this shouldn't even be a question. Quit it, for the love of pete. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 10:58, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's an exaggeration of the provided source. The term was one of a multiple mentioned in a transcript, included in an exhibit, of a government report. No signficant government official (to my knowledge) has made special mention of the term. The radio personalities are the ones "validating" the term, not anybody in government. <s>I won't vote on this, due to my distaste for re-AFDs.</s> But let's not pretend the "FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES" is behind you. I don't think we want to be tossing in every term that's mentioned in a transcript, included in an appendix, of a federal government document. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 16:08, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Not really. It was noted as an obscene comment by the FCC, as referenced in the transcript. If it's good enough for government work, it's most certainly good enough for wikipedia. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 22:29, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>We must be looking at different places. The only source given in the article is <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/eb/Orders/2003/FCC-03-71A1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fcc.gov/eb/Orders/2003/FCC-03-71A1.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This is *not* a transcript of an FCC proceeding. This is a transcript of a radio show, included as an attachment to an FCC document. Nobody from the FCC make *specific* reference to a "Cleveland steamer". The people using the expression are labelled MV1, MV2, MC3, MC6 identified as "cast members" and callers of the radio show <i>Deminski &amp; Doyle Show</i>. So the *only* thing this proves is that the term was used *one* day on one radio show. The FCC discussed the transcript in *generall* but did nothing to "note" a specific term. Also, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cleveland_steamer&amp;oldid=53460091" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cleveland_steamer&amp;oldid=53460091" rel="nofollow">version before my edit</a>, implied the term was mentioned in a hearing, but there's no proof of that. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 00:43, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Alabama hot pocket, Blumpkin et. al.), I believe that notability is shown in this current incarnation of the article. I will not call this a bad faith nomination, but I do believe that if the article passes this AfD, there might not be much benefit in raising it again in the near future.

<li>That's actually a rather incorrect statement regarding the merge request. I reverted the merge for two reasons: 1) lack of discussion meaning lack of consensus, and 2) one of the worst merges I've ever seen where almost none of the information from the article being merged was inserted into Coprophilia. I still disagree with a merge, given the notability of this subject. Ask 100 people - more will know what a cleveland steamer is than what "coprophilia" is, let alone pronounced. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 22:29, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm generally opposed to re-AFDs. But it seems the *extreme* lack of reliable sources, has led to the blatant misuse and twisting sources to say things the facts don't support. Pretending this term has some sort of backing by the "FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES" is patently absurd. The only thing worse than not providing a reliable source, is trying pretend you have one, when you don't (or mischaracterizing it). There seems to be unwillingness to properly state what sources actually say. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 00:50, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

As a matter of fact, that source PROVES this shouldn't be on Wikipedia. If you look through it, you'll see that it's quite obvious that the "Cleveland steamer" term was made up by one of the "male cast members" on the spot as some kind of joke; they were having a silly discussion about gross, made up sexual practices.

<li>Let me put it this way: on that transcript, it looks like they're making up the definition, so I don't even think it's convincing evidence of the definition already having been in use. But remember, the burden of proof is on those wanting to include information, not the other way around. And while we're at it... check out <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms</a> (an official guideline) which reminds us that for something to be a reliable source about a neologism, it's got to <i>discuss</i> it, not <i>use</i> it. Assimilating many examples of use is specifically, and appropriately, described as <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">Wikipedia:original research</a>. This article fails that guideline very badly. Also, one last thing... I'm generally an eventualist, but I think that we've given this article enough of a chance to get real sources, and it hasn't, and it should be deleted until such sources can be found. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:42, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I generally object to repeat noms and we have already argued the merits/demerits of this article. However, there is never a reason to personalize a deletion nomination by labeling another user. The accususations concerning the noms motives here are troubling and obliterate any chance for a fair hearing for this article at this time. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:26, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
