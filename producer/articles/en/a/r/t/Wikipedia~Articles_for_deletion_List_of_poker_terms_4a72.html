<p><a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_usage_guide" title="WP:WINAD">"Wikpedia is not a usage or slang guide"</a>. Lists of words or dictionary definitions are not appropriate for Wikipedia, but are appropriate for Wiktionary. Per common practice, this word list of topic-related terminology is now transwikied to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Poker_terminology" class="extiw" title="wikt:Appendix:Poker_terminology">wikt:Appendix:Poker terminology</a> and is ready to be <b>deleted</b>.<br />

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This has been dealt with before. The article is not a slang guide. It covers in a topical way numerous subjects that are referenced throughout the encyclopedia. If this article was deleted dozens of stubs would have to be created otherwise many dozens of articles would make no sense. Please withdraw the nomination. The prior discussion was an overwhelming <b>keep</b> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Poker_jargon_8364.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Poker jargon">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Poker_jargon</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 10:11, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is a misconception often repeated by those who never took the time to get to know Wiktionary. Linking to Wiktionary is as easy as linking to Wikipedia; I did it above. If this article was deleted, all you would have to do is link to <i>the exact same entry</i> at Wiktionary. In addition, ease-of-use arguments don't argue for something being encyclopedic anyway. Wouldn't it be easier if how-tos, source material, galleries of images, and lists of quotes were articles here? Does that make them encyclopedic? Please offer a rationale as to <i>why</i> this is encyclopedic and not a dictionary definition list. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 20:27, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's self-evident. Did you even read it? It does not appear so. Some of the entries are definition sorts of things, but others are stubs explaining a practice or usage, not definitions. As for "Linking to Wiktionary is as easy as linking to Wikipedia" then lets not needlessly create work for people for absolutely zero benefit. There is no rationale for messing with a very useful and sensible article, and certainly none for why dozens of stubs should be created. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 22:16, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This doesn't make sense; you just replied by repeating the same fallacious arguments. 1) If linking to Wiktionary is as easy as linking to Wikipedia, which it is, then what needless work are you talking about? It's easy. 2) What do you mean by saying that it's not just a list of definitions, but some explain usage? That's what dictionaries are for. Please note the first sentence of <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>: "Wikipedia is not a dictionary, <i>or a jargon or usage guide</i>." If it is only about the word usage, it is not encyclopedic. 3) I have no idea what dozens of articles you think would need to be created. As I noted, a link to Wiktionary would suffice. You're acting like the projects are existing at cross purposes here, when really they are intended to enhance each other. 4) Please actually provide a rationale as to why this is encyclopedic beyond it being self-evident, accusing me of not reading it, or saying it's useful. In fact, I think you would benefit from reading <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">WP:USEFUL</a>. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 22:34, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would like to point out the list is not <i>only</i> dictionary definitions, but also clarifies several smaller concepts that would not merit an article. It's not just about the word usage. I also have a question: How, exactly, are we going to have a link to Wictionary if the article is deleted? --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 22:49, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article is <i>already</i> at Wiktionary. I linked it in the nomination; it's at <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Poker_terminology" class="extiw" title="wikt:Appendix:Poker_terminology">Appendix:Poker terminology</a>. There is absolutely no difference in difficulty in linking to the Wiktionary article. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 23:04, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But the article <i>already</i> at Wiktionary is months out of date, unindexed, and a virtual solid mass of redlinks. Also no one looking for anything from it will find it if they search here (which is the more likely scenario)--Invisifan 23:42, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I said the first time you said that, what's your point? <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a> is a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a> too. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Appendix:Poker_terminology&amp;diff=2089927&amp;oldid=2087142" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Appendix:Poker_terminology&amp;diff=2089927&amp;oldid=2087142" rel="nofollow">It's "up to date" now</a>. You could ave done that yourself instead of complaining here. I fail to see how that has any bearing on whether the article is encyclopedic or not; you're bringing up red herrings. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 01:01, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My point is that even if this list is better as an Appendix in Wiktionary than a list here moving it is not as simple as copying the article from here to there -- it would need to be completely overhauled to have the appropriate links point back here (a huge job in itself if done correctly since many should really point to Wiktionary entries which may not exist r be the exact spelling/capitalization), and worse everything in Wikipedia that "links here" needs to be fixed (a simple redirect won't work even if you could properly redirect transwiki since many of the references are to anchor which can't even work as a secondary redirect in the same wiki). So a massive amount of work needs to be done '<i>during</i> the move, and you seem utterly uninterested in making that effort (personally <i><b>I</b></i> have no interest in poker per se, and better things to do). if/when the WT appendix is fully functional as well as up to date &amp; all the relevant links to this article are pointing there. <i>then</i> I'd support deleting <i>this</i> article. --Invisifan 21:19, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is one of those lists of terms that is needed. It's much like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_baseball_jargon.html" title="List of baseball jargon">List of baseball jargon</a>. Very complex activity that cannot be handled with just one article. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">Woohoo!</a></sup> 10:16, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.

<ul>
<li>Wiktionary is a wiki that anyone can edit; I'm not sure what your point is. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 20:27, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Useful list. For the record, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Poker_jargon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Poker_jargon" rel="nofollow">here's the old AFD</a>. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 16:02, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">User:2005</a> and User:Invisifan -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:43, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - WP:NOT a dictionary. This is pretty clearly a list of word definitions. Not one person here has argued why this entry is encyclopedic and should be kept. Instead the argument seems to be "but we need to access the material." Well, you <b>can</b> access the material because it is already on wikitionary, and linking to this list of definitions takes all of one template, {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWiktionary_73a4.html" title="Template:Wiktionary">wiktionary</a>}}. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 20:56, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> no valid reason to delete it.
