<p>This was a disputed prod. The editor who removed the prod without comment doesn't seem willing to engage in discussion. I've given my reasons on the talk page in hopes of getting the article to improve, but there's been no response. Anyway, the reason I suggest deleting is that there are no sources and no indication of significance for this website, and the alexa ranking shows no data whatsoever. This seems to fall far short of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and if no reputable third-party sources are talking about this, we can't do much with it either. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:39, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as NN; a mighty twelve unique Google hits and no Alexa ranking. (That aside, I wasted three minutes of my life going through some of the strips, and it's bloody lame. I need to go wash my eyes out with Diet Coke now or something.) By contrast, I follow two semi-daily webcomics. <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Positive_c5aa.html" title="Something Positive">Something Positive</a> is a reasonably popular strip, and has 27,000 Google hits, an Alexa ranking of 12,761, and its edit history on Wikipedia is several hundred deep. <a href="../../../q/u/e/Questionable_Content_a910.html" title="Questionable Content">Questionable Content</a> has 72,000 Google hits, an Alexa ranking of 8,243, and likewise edit history on Wikipedia is several hundred deep. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 15:04, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> While I appreciate the NN suggestion, the above suggests to me that an important criterion is that the proposer simply didn't find the comic funny and hence not worth propagating. This is possibly the only difference between the aCaaL comic and other, Wikipedia-featured, web comics. There is a following for the web comic, albeit not a huge one. Also, it is clear that Google does not find all related webpages, as the missing link to <a href="http://www.harpingchipmunk.me.uk/chipmunk-lizard.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.harpingchipmunk.me.uk/chipmunk-lizard.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.harpingchipmunk.me.uk/chipmunk-lizard.shtml</a> exemplifies.

<dl>
<dd>I commend to you the words "That aside." There are a lot of painfully unfunny comics out there (anyone laughed at Family Circus this decade?) that are notable by way of circulation and verifiability. This one fails; if Google didn't find all the related webpages of one webcomic, it would logically not find those of ones far more notable. Traffic a thousandth of Something Positive still sucks. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 20:01, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - And, as much to the point, a lot of (usually insignificant) webcomics get written up as articles, a lot get AfDed in return, and no one wants to see any deserving ones fall through the cracks; I remember <i><a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabrina_Online_4e48.html" title="Sabrina Online">Sabrina Online</a></i>, which was legitimately one of the earliest known ongoing web comics, getting AfDed a month or so back. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 16:33, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, but for the record, the Sabrina AfD was an obvious case of bad faith. Someone was irritated that his furry comic of choice had been nominated, so naturally he plopped an AfD notice on the most popular furry comic. I killed that AfD before it went anywhere. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 16:40, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Generally, a comic strip with only 330 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22A+Chipmunk+and+a+Lizard%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22A+Chipmunk+and+a+Lizard%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google hits</a> is considered not notable enough for a Wikipedia article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, I'm Jonathan, one of the creators of the strip. I understand the grounds cited for deletion (except that the strip isn't <i>always</i> lame). But if it counts for anything, my partner and I have been posting the strip every weekday for four years now, we have a readership, and we are committed to keeping the strip going. If you need to delete it now, I'm hopeful that one day a Wikipedia entry will be warranted (i.e., the strip will be more widely known). When we stumbled upon the entry last night, we just thought it was nice that <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWack%27d_About_Wiki_b3f0.html" title="User:Wack'd About Wiki">Wack'd About Wiki</a> had written up something about the strip. (I see now that some additional notes were added by another attentive reader for us to thank.) (Sorry about the "ballot-stuffing" scare. We thought it was neat that someone put us on Wikipedia and wanted to tell our readers. When we saw there was a little controversy this morning about it, we amended the note to tell them that it might not be here forever.) JTh 20:01, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Jonathan here again. Obviously, we hope the article might be allowed to remain to stay, though we realize this is looking unlikely. Watching this discussion has been a little rough and there are a few things I wanted to get across:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>--I want to make sure it is understood that my partner and I are not the Authors of the Article.</dd>
<dd>--I want also to apologize for having edited the Article, as a related party. I did feel a little funny about it after I saved my changes. (I went in to fix some spellings and clarify the identification of the masks two of the characters wear.)</dd>
<dd>--It was a coincidence that I found the Article in the first place, a few days after it was posted. I was at <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achewood.html" title="Achewood">Achewood</a> for the first time in a while and clicked their link into Wikipedia. While I was in Wikipedia, I thought I'd check to see if anyone had done anything about our humble strip. It was a lot of fun to find out someone had, but in light of what has followed, I might rather it had come and gone without my knowing about it.</dd>
<dd>--Sorry the Author hasn't been back to defend his putting it up; 11-year-olds are pretty busy people, I guess. 8^)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Sorry, Jon, it's not that I'm busy, Wikipedia has been down at my house and as we speak I'm using recess time to defend the article from AfD. This is my favorite strip, it has a following, and I didn't know about Google, try Yahoo and you might find it's more...acurate. I'm find a way to keep the article. Heck, I've already came up with a solution! --<a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWack%27d_About_Wiki_b3f0.html" title="User:Wack'd About Wiki">Wack'd About Wiki</a> 15:50, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>--We get the most visitors on our page on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and I would have been curious to see what contributions may have been made to the article if it were still there by then. Maybe none, but it would have been fun to see how a Chipmunk and a Lizard article might have evolved in the community environment of Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>--We don't have the hugest readership, but we do have a following. It's not the worst-looking strip, either, and it's in for the long haul. So it just seemed to us like the kind of cultural artifact that would be included in the world's largest encyclopedia. That's why I feel a little confused and a little chagrined by the discussion. But as I said before, if the Article is dropped now, I'm hopeful its return will be warranted sometime in the future.</dd>
<dd>Anyhow, thanks for reading.. JTh 02:03, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't really understand what reason there could be for deleting this article. It describes a current work of fiction in a clear and straightforward way. The work it describes is an honest and sincere human expression. Neither the article nor the work it describes is self-serving or vainglorious in any way. A wonder of Wikipedia is that it can catalog our culture with unprecedented breadth. The comments about how the work has not yet caught on with a large number of people seem beside the point. What matters is that the article describes a legitimate bit of the world.VtPerry 22:13, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The reasons are founded in that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia with narrowly defined pertinent entry criteria: verifiability and notability. The clarity of the subject's prose has nothing to do with it, nor does the putative honesty or sincerity of the expression therein, nor the level of (or lack of) vainglory, That the work has not caught on with a large number of people is <i>exactly</i> the point. The most idiotic, meretricious and slovenly artwork imaginable, fit only for subhumans, merits articles as long as enough people care about it. <i>That's</i> what matters here. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 22:56, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
