<p>A <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Border_history_of_Romania_8dc3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Border history of Romania">first nomination for deletion</a> resulted in no consensus more than half a year ago. Many users voted "keep" in the hope that the article would shortly be improved. I still believe this is not possible, since whatever encyclopedic content could be included in this article belongs rather to the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Romania_ed89.html" title="History of Romania">History of Romania</a> article. This standpoint is now more or less proven by the facts that (1) there have been 4 edits to this article since the previous AfD, none of which was in any way substantial, and (2) the only reference to this article (from the article space) remains a single link in the "See also" section of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Romania_ed89.html" title="History of Romania">History of Romania</a> article.</p>
<p>Apart from being practically useless (the images can be used later even if the article gets deleted now), this article also runs a mild risk of becoming a POV fork at some time, since it allows presenting historical states without providing enough context on what they do or do not have in common with modern states, unlike other articles containing sufficient amounts of prose (such as the well-written <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Romania_ed89.html" title="History of Romania">History of Romania</a> series). <b>Delete.</b> <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKissl_4f16.html" title="User:Kissl">K</a><a href="../../../k/i/s/User_talk%7EKissl_a765.html" title="User talk:Kissl">issL</a> 15:50, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

To which I will add: not only is that article a POV fork of no relevant use, but it is also not about what its title says it is about (the borders of Dacia and medieval Transylvania are certainly not the borders "of Romania", and wikipedia catalogs <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-earth.html" title="Middle-earth">the</a> <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantastica.html" title="Fantastica">more</a> <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulcan_%28Star_Trek_planet%29_f387.html" title="Vulcan (Star Trek planet)">popular</a> imaginary realms, not individual fantasies). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 10:22, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> In the middle ages, the East-Roman Empire was called Romania, thus, the title is not hisorically correct. If the title was eg. Historical states on the terriory of present-day Romania, there would be no problem with it. But if these maps were included in Category:Maps of the history of Romania, there would be no need for this article at all --<a href="../../../k/i/d/User%7EKIDB_32a1.html" title="User:KIDB">KIDB</a> 10:55, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Very simply, this article contains information that is more easily presented visually than in text. This is another example. I did not check each map, but it seems to me there are few if any fair use images there; that is not a reason not to have a gallery of these maps. Perhaps a <b>move</b> to something more precisely descriptive of the contents, like Gallery of historical maps of Romania, might be in order. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 12:02, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: As said above in various ways, one of the problems is that a state called Romania has only existed since the 19th century, not the 1st century BC. What exactly was going on during those two millennia is not straightforward enough to be able to be conveyed by just a series of maps. (Otherwise, why don't we present the histories of all countries like that?) <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKissl_4f16.html" title="User:Kissl">K</a><a href="../../../k/i/s/User_talk%7EKissl_a765.html" title="User talk:Kissl">issL</a> 15:33, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The captions in the article, while they surely could be expanded, made it reasonably clear that the various states in the region were not all called Romania. "Romania" and "Romanian" are one of those ambiguous terms that can mean both a citizen of a state of Romania, and a speaker of a Balkan Romance language. We don't present the history of some other countries like that because no one has written those articles yet. A category would be a poor substitute for this page; shifting borders would be harder to track. (FWIW, countries with less complicated histories can present similar data differently; look at <a href="../../../u/s/a/Image%7EUSA_Territorial_Growth_small.gif_1e3d.html" title="Image:USA Territorial Growth small.gif">Image:USA Territorial Growth small.gif</a>. If this has something to do with Balkan ethnic politics, please say so. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:47, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Indirectly, it does have somewhat to do with ethnic politics – most ethnic groups over here are trying to prove in various ways that "they were first" in the neighbourhood where they currently are and even its surroundings. In this sense, the situation is not analogous to the US, where a consensus exists on historiography (unless I'm badly mistaken). However, if we were talking about an article titled "Border history of the US" containing just the maps in <a href="../../../u/s/a/Image%7EUSA_Territorial_Growth_small.gif_1e3d.html" title="Image:USA Territorial Growth small.gif">Image:USA Territorial Growth small.gif</a> with some captions, my opinion would still be that it is not (and has no hope of becoming) encyclopedic. <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKissl_4f16.html" title="User:Kissl">K</a><a href="../../../k/i/s/User_talk%7EKissl_a765.html" title="User talk:Kissl">issL</a> 16:45, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, its just maps and maps. Well, my opinion on this article being kept has changed. Since nothing has been done since June 2006, this article does not deserve to be kept. As for the maps, they can be in a category and I don't see why its useful. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_2b97.html" title="User:Terence">Terence</a> 13:00, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Notable for Romanian history. It needs clean-up, but that's not a good enough reason to delete it. It also needs more text, but maps are a very good way to refer information. --<a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoamataa_f1eb.html" title="User:Roamataa">Roamataa</a> 13:59, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Border History is not a good way to organise this; it'd make more sense split up, the maps put into the main article or into articles about each period. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFel64_8f1a.html" title="User:Fel64">fel64</a> 14:44, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

While deleting the articles, keep images of course and use them in proper articles with <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Romania_ed89.html" title="History of Romania">History of Romania</a> series being the most natural candidate.

<li><b>Neutral</b> - on the one hand, this is not the border history "of Romania", but rather goes back much farther.

<li><b>Keep</b> and maybe change the name of the article in Territorial evolution of Romania. We can not include in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Romania_ed89.html" title="History of Romania">History of Romania</a> all details, is better to have a separate article and in the main article to have a link to it.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariusM_97ae.html" title="User:MariusM">MariusM</a> 01:21, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
