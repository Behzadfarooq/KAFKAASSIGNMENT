<p>Non-notable term; Google shows the phrase "pathological skepticism" practically unheard of outside of parapsychology and UFOlogy web sites. Almost all the references in the article point back to a single article written by a sociology professor in a self-published journal, and the few that don't simply show that somebody, somewhere, once used the term "pseudo-skepticism" in print somewhere way back when. Beyond the notablity problem, the article is overwhelmingly POV. This might deserve a line or two in <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skepticism.html" title="Skepticism">Skepticism</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debunker.html" title="Debunker">Debunker</a>, but that's about it. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 21:58, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> The irony! Deny the article first, ask questions <s>later,</s> never (see the first characteristic of Pseudoskepticism). A reminder that pseudoskepticism is <b>not</b> skepticism. It would be like suggesting that we merge pseudoscience with science. As for room to grow, yes there is much that could be added, such as Truzzi's motivation for developing the subject, examples of the various characteristics with respect to specific subjects, and comments from other commentators. As for the notability of Truzzi, he is the author (or co-author) of a number of books,<a href="http://tricksterbook.com/truzzi/ListTruzziBooks.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://tricksterbook.com/truzzi/ListTruzziBooks.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> and many articles in reputable journals,<a href="http://tricksterbook.com/truzzi/ListofArticlesbyMarcelloTruzzi.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://tricksterbook.com/truzzi/ListofArticlesbyMarcelloTruzzi.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIantresman_3a2c.html" title="User:Iantresman">Iantresman</a> 09:24, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And is "pseudoscience" also No True Scotsman fallacy, and should be deleted? Obviously not. In my opinion, this whole discussion reeks of double standard. If it's bad for "believers" to mess with the Pseudoscience entry, then it's just as bad if "skeptics" try to censor the Pseudoskepticism entry. I don't believe for one second the listed reasons for deletion. If they were true, then where are all the calls for deletion of "pathological science" and "pseudoscience," on the grounds that these other terms are inherently POV, or are nothing but no-true-scotsman fallacy, or are nothing but smear tactics? Should we delete "Creationism" because the term is inherently POV? Of course not. In fact, NONE of these terms are inherently POV, fallicious, etc., and all are useful and in use. Be honest now, and admit the actual reasons why this term needs to be hidden: Truzzi created a powerful weapon now being used by creationists and other believers, and it can be weilded as an effective rhetorical ploy to make the skeptic side of any debate look bad. This must be stopped! &#160;:) Delete it from WP! (Yet the same issue is true of the words pseudoscience and pathological science. Perhaps a Creationist group should mount an attempt to delete the Pseudoscience entry. Get a big enough group working for months, and they can do it. Heh. They won't have to work very hard, since they can just copy all the "skeptic" arguments being used on this page!) --<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbeaty_8fc7.html" title="User:Wjbeaty">Wjbeaty</a> 10:55, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I consider myself to very much be a skeptic, and I defend the inclusion of this topic here. (I happen to be the ringmaster for the <a href="http://l.webring.com/hub?ring=skeptic" class="external text" title="http://l.webring.com/hub?ring=skeptic" rel="nofollow">Skeptic Ring</a> and the <a href="http://g.webring.com/hub?ring=antiquackerysite" class="external text" title="http://g.webring.com/hub?ring=antiquackerysite" rel="nofollow">Anti-Quackery Ring</a>, so I think I have a bit of understanding on the subject.) It is a real concept used in the real world, and therefore Wikipedia should cover it. I really doubt that many skeptics are totally free from occasionally giving way to pseudoskeptic tendencies. Who doesn't get a kick out of an occasional ad hominem attack on true believing idiots? (How was that for an example?....;-) Why do we love Penn and Teller's "Bullshit" program? Because we find it perfectly appropriate, in the name of humor, to make fun of our antagonists. Skepticism and pseudoskepticism abide side-by-side in many of us, and it is only our higher self that intellectually recognizes and attempts to suppress the tendency to sink to the same level as many of our antagonists, especially when involved in serious discussions (which Penn and Teller don't pretend to be doing, although they still are spot on much of the time). The same principle is involved in racism: much as we'd like to think we are totally free of racist tendencies, we actually often harbor them in one way or another. This is human nature. I still support a strong keep, but only after renaming to the much more common expression "pseudoskepticism." -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 11:38, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak ... whatever</b>. The article was more POV before the layer of edits that I did immediately before the AfD was initated. An article like this should not be written in a way that suggests we support the theory that there is such a thing as "pathological skepticism" or "pseudoskepticism". The claim that this is a real phenomenon is intrinsically POV. However, the claim that such a phenomenon has been <i>perceived</i> by Truzzi and that this pejorative expression has been used by Truzzi and others to label it is objectively correct. <i>If</i> the article is retained, it will need to be policed for POV, and if that doesn't work the inherently POV nature of the article will have been evidenced. For the moment, I have no clear opinion either way as to whether it should be deleted. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 03:24, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

These references could be replaced with a single general reference to the paper, but we'd loose the context.

<li><b>Keep</b>- or rename to pseudoskepticism with mention of pathological skepticism and continue to bulid the article in a NPOV manner.

<li>Comment: Dematt raises a good philosophical point. The phenomenon described by Truzzi exists in the same way that "pseudoscience" does: a pattern that the speaker wishes to highlight by critically differentiating it from another pattern (with which another speaker has perhaps erroneously identified it). There are cases in which some people may not believe that such differentiation is meaningful or important (e.g., <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nontheism.html" title="Nontheism">nontheists</a> who don't care about identifying various <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heresy.html" title="Heresy">heresies</a>).

The POV that "certain forms of skepticism are excessive or damaging" is certainly notable and merits coverage in the article on <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skepticism.html" title="Skepticism">Skepticism</a>. Conceivably, if there's too much material on that aspect to be accommodated in the <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skepticism.html" title="Skepticism">Skepticism</a> article, it could be summarized there and elaborated on in a daughter article, but the latter would be something like Criticism of skepticism. It wouldn't be titled with this nonnotable term. I agree that Truzzi was notable (there's been no AfD on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcello_Truzzi_a8d1.html" title="Marcello Truzzi">Marcello Truzzi</a>), but that doesn't mean that every term he discussed needs its own article. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 11:06, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>rename</b> to pseudoskepticism. Merge "abuses of skepticism" into "pseudoskepticism." <b>"practically unheard of outside of parapsychology and UFOlogy web sites."</b> No, I've heard the term commonly used among member scientists at meetings of Society for Scientific Investigation (SSE) and used in their journal, and also used in online and offline discussions of the psychology behind various science controversies. It's a useful shorthand term, same as "pathological science." In my experience, pseudoskepticism is certainly a genuine behavior-flaw analogous to pathological science (also analogous to "flamer" or "troll,") and it's not merely a smear tactic. In fact, is it not a smear tactic if someone labels "pseudoskeptic" as purely POV? Should we also delete the entry for "pathological science" because it implies bad things about certain people? "Pseudoskeptic" is just as POV as "pseudoscientist," the former being coined based on the latter. Both can be used as neutral labels, and both can be hurled as ad hominem or smear tactics during fights. If "pseudoskepticism" should be deleted because some people use it as derogation, then we must also consider deleteing "pseudoscience" and "pathological science" entries as well. And delete "flamer" and "troll" for good measure. The first step in understanding a new phenomenon or concept is to give it a name. Truzzi is not the first to notice it, but is one of the early ones naming it. Others independantly gave the same phenomenon different names currently in far less widespread use, e.g. "pathological skeptic," "scoffer," "skepto-path," and "abuse of skepticism." I've been a member of local skeptic groups and debated on both sides of "believer/skeptic" issues, and over the years I've met a significant number of people both online and off who call themselves "scientific skeptics" but who constantly fall into the misbehaviors that Truzzi points out. Pseudoskepticism is a sort of mental flaw very much similar to "flamer:" there are some people who are unrepentant shameless flamers, and some who are unrepentant shameless pseudoskeptics, and many others covering an entire spectrum. But among the population of skeptics, the habitual pseudoskeptics are certainly not in the majority, yet they certainly have a significant impact. Carl Sagan directly and repeatedly cautioned skeptic groups against pseudoskeptic behavior, but without giving a succinct label to the behavior. And CSICOP split off from JREF partly because of just these issues (today JREF is very pseudoskeptic-tolerant, seeing little wrong with laughter and ad-hominem, while CSICOP has gone far in distancing itself from such things.) Would it have been better if skeptic groups coined the term? They did. Truzzi himself is a long time skeptic, and he debunks irrational beliefs as well as aiming skepticism at Skeptic groups. The term "pseudoskepticism" had its birth in the self-criticism within the CSICOP group, and only later was it employed by Creationists during evolution flamewars, etc. And finally: just as pseudoscientists try to distort or delete portions of the WP pseudoscience entry, the pseudoskeptic fringe would love to see this entry removed. I strongly suspect that this current deletion attempt is no way innocent, and may very well be disingenuous in that the reasons listed for the deletion are not the actual reasons leading to this deletion review. --<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbeaty_8fc7.html" title="User:Wjbeaty">Wjbeaty</a> 09:53, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The issue is not whether the term exists nor whether the term should exist but whether we have enough information to write a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> compliant article.

<li>Could have fooled me. The initial comment regarding <i>simply show that somebody, somewhere, once used the term "pseudo-skepticism" in print somewhere way back when</i> is making an issue of whether the term is in common contemporary use. Perhaps you personally don't see this as an issue, but others here obviously do. If the terms aren't being used in forums, journal papers, skeptic magazines, etc., then deleting the entry has no important consequenc. About Google hits: beware, since a large number of hits are simply mirrors of WP entries appearing on other sites. A better gauge of the level of usage might be to search Usenet Newsgroups at groups.google.com. About Truzzi: this WP entry started out referencing other websites and not Truzzi's paper, and was tarred with the brush of being unprofessional. Now that it references an actual publication, it's tarred with the brush of being Truzzi-centric. Damned if you do, damned if you don't (the important thing to those disliking its use is that it remain tarred, eh? Stigmatize it so it may be ridiculed and dismissed without fair consideration and without their needing to leave the political-emotional-beliefs mental state.) And shouldn't we be deleting "Cargo Cult Science" too? It's obviously just a Feynman-centric conceit and a ploy to sell Feynman books. And about SSE: the membership of that group is professional scientists. Unless things there have changed, members of the public cannot join as members, but may subscribe to the journal as "associates." The SSE is "fringe" to the extent that the group is in the business of giving fair invesigations of odd phenomena, whereas skeptic groups make the assumption (usually unspoken) that paranormal events, alien visitation, etc., aren't occurring. To a staunch disbeliever, the SSE certainly looks like a bunch of idiots --67.136.141.97 05:44, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Pathological skepticism: "I am a scientist and I know the truth, so don't try to change my mind with facts," is seen in many scientific fields, not just applied to pseudoscience.
