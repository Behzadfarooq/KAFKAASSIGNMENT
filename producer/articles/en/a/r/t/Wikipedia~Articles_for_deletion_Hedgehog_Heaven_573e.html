<li><s>Hi there. Since <a href="../../../o/v/e/OverClocked_ReMix_d57a.html" title="OverClocked ReMix">OverClocked ReMix</a> is notable in-and-of-itself, it doesn't seem wrong to potentially <b>Merge</b> some information with the OverClocked ReMix article, rather than delete the articles outright. OC ReMix started using MediaWiki to host its FAQ and other information a few months ago. Wouldn't be opposed to being pointed in the right direction (at my userpage) to learn how to properly apply the various templates in these articles in MediaWiki, so perhaps the articules could be ported there. In any case, I've got no problem with deleting the article per the nom, BUT would rather see a merge. - <a href="../../../l/i/o/User%7ELiontamer_20aa.html" title="User:Liontamer">Liontamer</a> 23:15, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

<ul>
<li>Since that AfD in April 2005, we've gotten much, much, <i>much</i> more serious about requiring quality references from reliable sources. Plenty of articles from that era got kept as "interesting" or "cool" that would never pass muster today. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 12:41, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, but meanwhile, I'm worried that "has no reliable sources" is used as a catch-all "<i>Hsssh!</i> ...and I've got more <i>hssssh</i> where it came from" kind of excuse for deleting content. Lack of sources is <i>foremost</i> a cleanup criterion, not deletion criterion. I <i>hate</i> it when people bring articles to AfD when it's obvious that articles have at least a good <i>possibility</i> of getting sources. Everyone gets terribly excited when they see "hey, if it's unsourced, you can delete it"; No one gets excited when they see "anyone can and should be constructive and add sources when they doubt the article's statements". --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 08:18, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Even though these songs were inspired by games, it doesn't necessarily mean it would only be of interest to fans. That's like saying, for example, if a music is inspired by a popular artist, it would only be of interest to fans of that artist. Or saying "This jazz album is up for deletion, since it would only be of interest to people who want to hear jazz." In short, I see no reason to delete this article. <a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V.">.V.</a> 22:32, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I don't see much of an argument to actually "keep" (let alone "strong keep") the articles there, nor an assertion of the notability of the content, just a disagreement that fan fiction is only of interest to fans, which is pretty well established on Wikipedia. Any ideas re: <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>? <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 22:57, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, add headers requesting improvement.</b> You could always just place headers requesting sources and/or establishment of notability, rather than impulsively moving for deletion. Primary sources are in fact available. I'm mildly deletionist myself in my view of Wikipedia, as I see a lot of fancruft added all the time, but have also respected the fact that notable articles which are either stubs or do not contain the necessary sourcing typical of top articles have been kept with the intention of improving them, rather than deleting them as a knee-jerk response. I've struck through my earlier comments, specifically because of <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a>'s comments of <a href="../../../o/v/e/OverClocked_ReMix_d57a.html" title="OverClocked ReMix">OverClocked ReMix</a> itself not meeting notability guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>If you Google "OverClocked ReMix" (with quotes), there are about 186,000 results, and "OC ReMix" (the common abbreviation for the site used in its music tags) lists 135,000 results. Google the word remix, and OverClocked ReMix is the second result out of 76,300,000 behind Remix Magazine. However, keep in mind <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearch_engine_test_390d.html#Validity_of_the_Google_test" title="Wikipedia:Search engine test">Google is not a be-all-end-all litmus test</a> (<i>"In some cases, articles have been kept with Google hit counts as low as 15 and some claim that this undermines the validity of the Google test in its entirety. The Google test has always been and very likely always will remain an extremely inconsistent tool, which does not measure notability. It is not and should never be considered definitive"</i>). That is specifically why search engine tests are not a factor in Web notability guidelines.</li>
<li>While merely a sub-culture (amateur video game music arrangements), OverClocked ReMix is the most popular and influential site related to that culture, with the largest collection of video game music arrangements on the internet. Especially given the additional information below, I would argue that it is a viable instance of genuinely notable fan culture rather than non-notable.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ocremix.org/info/Industry_Recognition" class="external text" title="http://www.ocremix.org/info/Industry_Recognition" rel="nofollow">Support from video game industry professionals</a> - OverClocked ReMix has received praise and support from several notable musicians/professionals in the video games industry not limited to Video Games Live co-creator <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Tallarico_08dd.html" title="Tommy Tallarico">Tommy Tallarico</a>, Secret of Evermore composer <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Soule_b771.html" title="Jeremy Soule">Jeremy Soule</a> (who has contributed an arrangement to the site), Doom lead designer <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Romero_710b.html" title="John Romero">John Romero</a>, Donkey Kong Country series composer <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Wise_56ac.html" title="David Wise">David Wise</a>, 7th Guest composer <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fat_Man_6016.html" title="The Fat Man">The Fat Man</a> (who has contributed 2 arrangements to the site), and Secret of Mana composer <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiroki_Kikuta_bbe4.html" title="Hiroki Kikuta">Hiroki Kikuta</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ocremix.org/info/Press" class="external text" title="http://www.ocremix.org/info/Press" rel="nofollow">OverClocked ReMix press clippings</a> - I'd argue that coverage from <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salon.com.html" title="Salon.com">Salon</a>, <a href="../../../g/4/_/G4_%28TV_channel%29_6dd5.html" title="G4 (TV channel)">G4</a>/<a href="../../../t/e/c/TechTV_35ea.html" title="TechTV">TechTV</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_de96.html" title="Electronic Gaming Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>, <a href="../../../1/u/p/1UP.com_c6a3.html" title="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>, and <a href="../../../m/p/3/MP3.com_de19.html" title="MP3.com">MP3.com</a> are sufficient in terms of point #1 of the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">Web notability criteria</a>.</li>
<li>In terms of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html#Others" title="WP:MUSIC">Music notability criteria</a>, I believe OverClocked ReMix satisfies the first and fifth bullet points of the "Others" section in regards to the video game music arrangement genre, which is outside mass media traditions: <i>"Is cited in notable and verifiable sources as being influential in style, technique, repertory or teaching in a particular music genre"</i> and <i>"Is frequently covered in publications devoted to a notable sub-culture"</i> (in this case, magazines, television, and leading websites devoted to video games [Electronic Gaming Monthly, <a href="../../../p/c/_/PC_Gamer_a838.html" title="PC Gamer">PC Gamer</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Informer_aab7.html" title="Game Informer">Game Informer</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edge_%28magazine%29.html" title="Edge (magazine)">Edge</a>], technology [G4techTV], and online music [MP3.com], respectively). Though it's easy to do and looks convincing I'm sure, there's no excuse for <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowking_Man_5da9.html" title="User:Slowking Man">Slowking Man</a> flippantly linking to the same music notability page in the deletion nom if a proper explanation isn't given as to why the albums would fail the linked criteria.</li>
<li>By extension, my conclusion is that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html#Albums" title="WP:MUSIC">since the music entity is notable, the albums created by it are notable</a>. As noted in the Albums section of the music notability guidelines, it is viewed by some as a controversial extrapolation, but one that I support in this case (and all other cases).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the album articles are deleted and/or OverClocked ReMix is nomimated for deletion, I will have the decision taken up at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Deletion review</a>. I believe that the nominating admin is assuming bad faith on both the group's notability and the potential verifiability of the information listed in these articles, that the group's notability is legitimate thereby permitting the existence of these articles, and that the procedural action being taken should be to label the articles as needing improvement rather than deletion. - <a href="../../../l/i/o/User%7ELiontamer_20aa.html" title="User:Liontamer">Liontamer</a> 21:22, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Pre-emptively threatening to take something to DRV is not, imho, terribly appropriate. Cross that bridge if-and-when. And instead of "Keep, add headers requesting improvement", how about "Keep, I created / love / cherish these articles and I'll be happy to add the citations, notable press coverage and whatever else needs to be done to demonstrably bring these articles in line with <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>"? My opinion was certainly offered in good faith, and if the <i>articles</i> (rather than the <i>AfD discussion</i>) demonstrate that these topics pass the bar, I'll happily change it to keep. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 02:10, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I definitely felt your specific observations were in good faith, <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz">Deiz</a>, and didn't mean to imply otherwise. My issue is with the nomination and most of the conclusions drawn in the discussion being in bad faith, particularly the intention to AfD <a href="../../../o/v/e/OverClocked_ReMix_d57a.html" title="OverClocked ReMix">OverClocked ReMix</a>'s article. Which is why I kept it in mind to use 'if' regarding deletion review. Since it seems not many here are even familiar with OverClocked ReMix or video game music sub-culture, it would have been more appropriate to <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#Nomination" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">discuss questions of notability in the appropriate Talk pages first</a>. The articles can be improved, I agree. My end of the discussion aims to clarify that the subject matter of the articles is notable enough where the articles should be flagged to be improved by attaching <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_resources_f8d0.html#Verifiability_and_sources" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup resources">proper cleanup headers</a>. With my points stated, that's now left for others to decide. Contrary to your thinking, however, if the AfD discussion demonstrates that these topics pass the bar, the articles should be left to be expanded upon and better formatted. You're criticizing the nommed articles for not demonstrating notability enough, and that's fine. But there's no sense in taking any article on a potentially notable topic, especially if the attempt to clarify notability is in this discussion, and deleting it because it's not <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_perfect_article.html" title="The perfect article">the perfect article</a>. If an AfD established notability despite it not yet being established in the article, I find it hard to believe that the resolution would be to delete rather than to keep and subsequently establish notability within the article as well. - <a href="../../../l/i/o/User%7ELiontamer_20aa.html" title="User:Liontamer">Liontamer</a> 04:47, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>One does not have to be familiar with a topic to nominate it for deletion. Such things need to be looked at thought clear eyes, not the rose colored glasses of fans of a website or forum. The article currently reads like a press release and the usual "forum drivel" that tends to be amassed in articles about websites. i.e. "The site's mission statement explains how its members seek to prove that such music "is not disposable or merely just background, but is as intricate, innovative, and lasting as any other form...." and "Site-related sub-forums include Reviews, where members can discuss ReMixes posted to the site, ReQuests, where members can request particular pieces to be arranged, Judges Decisions, where the Judges Panel posts their decisions on submitted arrangements, and Site Projects, where members organize community projects and collaborative efforts that benefit the site." The nature of an internet forum is certainly not encyclopedic.... "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia articles should not exist only to describe the nature, appearance or services a website offers, but should describe the site in an encyclopedic manner, offering detail on a website's achievements, impact or historical significance</a>" I researched the topic prior to mentioning that I should nominate it for AFD. I always do a through search of the <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexis_Nexis_3127.html" title="Lexis Nexis">Lexis Nexis</a> newspaper and magazine databases for multiple countries and regions of the United States. I found one "trivial mention". I also went through the citation list that you provided, most of them are blogs and do not meet the criteria listed in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Your google results are also bloated: "Results 361 - 361 of about 121,000 for "OverClocked ReMix" -Wikipedia . (0.15 seconds)" and "Results 271 - 277 of about 113,000 for "OC ReMix" -Wikipedia . (0.17 seconds)". This means that there are a few internet sites which mention the OC Remix multiple times. i.e. forums, blogs, and the like. If the article passes notability by citation, it's only by relaxing the interpretation of the reliable source guidelines to include blog entries. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 00:34, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I hear ya, but it's still important that notability is asserted and established in the article. Otherwise the next deletion-hungry random page patroller could start the process all over again. The WP:xx notability criteria apply to articles rather than AfD discussions. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 12:40, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or failing that <b>Merge</b> into one article ("OverClocked ReMix album projects" or like), or back to OverClocked ReMix article, with some trimming. Some of these have gotten media mentions (Slashdot articles for Kong in Concert, Relics of the Chozo (I think) and The Dark Side of Phobos, at least), so we're not exactly talking of an insignificant phenomenon here; OCRemix is famous among game music fans, and their projects do attract attention within the community. Like I imply above, we should rather try to clean these up and add references where needed; we're clearly not talking of an utterly marginalised phenomenon here and I believe the information could survive <i>somewhere</i>. I agree that these are not "real" albums and as such it's debatable whether or not they need articles of their own - some of these just <i>don't</i>, like RoFL - but merging them could be right in any case. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 08:18, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep, add headers requesting improvement</b> or <b>Merge</b> I agree with Wwwwolf and Liontamer. I think that OCRemix, and on that, a lot of the albums listed there are notable, and that they should be kept and fix them up, and if they fail that, merge into a less detailed 'OCReMix projects' page/pages. <a href="../../../y/a/d/User%7EYadaman_daa6.html" title="User:Yadaman">Yadaman</a> 22:08, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> One shouldn't assume that all the links on a page are from templates at the bottom. That's a joke. Could it be that those very links were removed from the main article because they simply reappeared in the navigation box at the bottom. Yes, because the Manual of Style stipulates that we shouldn't replicate links in a see also section if they appear else where. Don't kill the article for following good practice! Furthermore, have you actually downloaded the music for yourself? It is free after all, the community is not gaining anything for having it up here, which I believe the whole "not a directory" thing was about in the first place. Lastly, Hedgehog Heaven has been referenced by IGN in an article. What more reliable sources do you want? Articles served up on a silver platter? For the record, we used to have five or so fan-related articles under {{<a href="../../../s/o/n/Template%7ESonicFeatures_3f69.html" title="Template:SonicFeatures">SonicFeatures</a>}}. The only thing accomplished by deleting this and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sonic_fangames_9af1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sonic fangames">the other two fan-related articles that are left</a> will be to alienate [[<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Computer_and_video_games_Sega_c33a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games/Sega">the community</a> that is helping to improve <a href="../../../s/o/n/Talk%7ESonic_the_Hedgehog_%28character%29_bc8c.html" title="Talk:Sonic the Hedgehog (character)">this article</a>.

<li><b>Merge</b> unless professional reviews and sources can be found. A shame these weren't commercially released, or they'd have some kind of immunity. But notwithstanding, most aren't even good enough for commercial release, so meh. They also don't get too much attention at all; I had an external link on the Chrono one that barely saw a couple hits a day (I eventually took it down). But I'd caution OCR forumers reading this against voting DELETE, since you'll probably be banned for it. After all, they banned tens of people for criticizing the addition of a sidebar to the site's layout. --<a href="../../../z/e/a/User%7EZeality_4615.html" title="User:Zeality">Zeality</a> 19:42, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
