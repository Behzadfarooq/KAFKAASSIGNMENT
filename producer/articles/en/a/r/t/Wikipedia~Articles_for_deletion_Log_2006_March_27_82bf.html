<dd>Well, you could discuss making it an event article on the talk page, as a solution if you wish (e.g. a name change). I'm not recommending it, but it's a valid option, worth discussion. Deletion, as an option, has already been ruled out. We can not allow noms who fail, to simply keep trying until they get what they want. When you're point is "<i>...what I was trying to show the last time too.</i>", you're admitting you're just repeating yourself. What is the practical purpose of arguing the same thing, all over again? --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 06:07, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Because it's still valid - the article still fails the tests; it did three days after the fact, and it does now two weeks later. The basic issue with this not being AfDed is that people are (and were) confusing short-term popular consciousness (fifteen minutes of fame) with long-term notability (enough to be in an encyclopedia for all time, as it were). The claim before was that it would be expanded, but this has not happened in over two weeks, as evidenced by the history, and therefore is not likely to be expanded in future. The excuse that WP is not paper is <i>not</i> a blanket justification to include any old thing that comes to mind - if policies were meant to be exercised in a vacuum, there would be 47 million articles on absilutely anything on here, and there aren't. It was apparent then and it is apparent now that Kristi Yamaoka is only notable for falling on her head on video and waving her arms, not for any individual accomplishments. If nationwide news were a prerequisite, every disaster on record would need to be here on WP, which is why WP is neither a current events log nor a newspaper. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 17:12, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just as a point of clarification, the previous AfD was not closed as "Keep". It was closed as "No consensus" which has, I believe, somewhat less weight. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 07:05, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> If the nominator cares enough, set a reminder to bring this back in July and I predict you will get a total of four to six votes, all to delete or merge. This is obviously unencyclopedic ephemera, but the bias for including recent news events on WP under the guise of encyclopedic content is simply too strong to allow for rational consensus to form while the item is still relatively fresh. The conflation of news coverage with notability is regrettable but understandable. Cf the Saugeen Stripper, which was roundly declared to be of immense encyclopedic value (ok that's an exaggeration) until the meme wore off and AFD was able happily to merge it back to obscurity where it belongs.

<dd>Well, you are welcome to disagree with my personal view of course and you don't have to be sorry. But re the SS, by WP edit war standards it was more like a minor skirmish, the issue was resolved through a merge which stands as of now, and the 46-20 AfD vote to strip (sorry) the SS of a separate article was generally resolved, so my language may be flippant but the point is germane. And that was when the material was still rather fresh. By July, no-one will care and this can be dealt with without the interference of news-established notability obscuring the issue (which is not to say it would necessarily be deleted - that's just my prediction). <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 15:55, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Not to belabor the point, but the AfD you keep referring to closed as no consensus- <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Saugeen_Stripper_2_dfdd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Saugeen Stripper 2">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Saugeen Stripper 2</a>. Hence, there was no vote to strip, delete or merge anything. I also don't believe that anything was resolved. Furthermore, the comparison with SS is not even germane given the massive difference in news coverage. To my knowledge, the Saugeen Stripper, unlike Ms. Yamaoka, was never a guest on the Today show or featured on primetime news or the recipient of a call from President Bush. The SS also did not have an impact on organized sports. Instead of clouding the issue or playing with crystal balls, you should thus recognize that the keep voters here are perfectly "rational". -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 16:29, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, let's keep some perspective here. I think editors could well make a case that this is not a major event or a major subject, but given the tools typically used to determine relevance, the items listed by jjay to establish notability can distort encycopedic value. That is not to say that arguments for keeping this article are unfounded, but what I do think is somewhat irrational is using conflated google counts spawned by massive reproduction of a few wire stories to show encyclopedic value. Hence, in July, when those have disappeared, the issue can be addressed without this distortion. Per the point about disruption, I don't think renominating this for deletion when some distance has been established can be considered disruptive - that is simply acknowledging the bias of WP inclusion choices. We can disagree on this, surely, without deciding that one or another course of action is simply disruptive. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 22:21, 27 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The argument that a handful of wire stories being replicated across a number of media outlets is an irrational basis for notability is, I think, missing the point. Each media outlet, from your local newspaper through to the biggest names in the business, make editorial decisions on what news items to run of the dizzying array of articles that come down over the wire every day. Every one of the media outlets that ran articles on Kristi Yamaoka thought it was newsworthy enough to be in their particular media outlet's output. It doesn't matter if it is a replica of a news wire article. The fact of the matter is hundreds of media outlets found the incident and the outcomes of it to be sufficiently news worthy. Trying to minimize the impact of this by saying the articles are replicates of each other entirely misses the point. Should we never include notable events in Wikipedia when such events only have one reporter handy to write a story first hand? --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 15:27, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This individual quintessentially embodies a concept of continuing to do one's job under adversity beyond all expectations. Is there any better example of this concept to date in western culture? This could serve as the ultimate example of this phenomenon for generations to come. At this time, the correct decision is the one already made, which is to keep.

I'm not saying Delete/Keep because vote &lt;&gt; some percentage; just giving a summary of a very long vote/discussion page. I'm confounded somewhat that it's official policy that this is not a voting process, but still on the admin pages there was talk over stats of the vote tally for closing admins. Moreover, I've seen it used in practice by closing admins to exclude posters with low edit counts; particularly when there is indication of meat/sockpuppetry. Considering we got an influx of anons from the 911 eyewitness AfD just a few days ago, it's not unreasonable that there are still some socks around.

<li><b>Keep</b> Sure, there have been other figures to come out and questioned 9/11, including a former member of Bush's own cabinent, but few interviews have garnered as much interest in as short a period of time. There is too much information on that one page to realistically merge it into Charlie Sheen's page, besides, as someone else pointed out, it's an interview between Sheen AND Jones. Does the "merge" group think it should be "merged" into both pages? Also one has to wonder why we're even having this debate. Is wikipedia running out of hard disk space?

<li>While citability is a necessary criteria for inclusion, it's not a sufficient one. It's making a mountain out of a molehill. Yes, he said he's a member of the 9-11 truth movement. That's about as notable as this event gets. You don't need an article discussing the very salient points he's making, especially when there are more intelligent people making those points. Man, don't you realize fame is usually inversely proportional to intelligence and that he's just parroting what he's heard. You might as well go right to the source and quote Alex Jones.

<li><b>Merge</b> This article is a recent event about a set of theories that claim possible 'conspiracy' which in and of itself is not illegitimate for that. Conspiracy is by definition when a group gets together to commit an act. Like Lincoln's assassination and JFK's which more and more evidence indicates was a conspiracy by others. Alex Jone's does not just come up with quack conspiracy's but has massive documentation behind them. I do not agree with all his assertions but he is well sourced. Charlie Sheen is well known and this article fits wikipedia. He is not the only one who questions the official version of 9-11. Indeed it is not wrong to question, it is wrong to blindly follow anything the government says...Freemen are not Yes men, and Democracy encourages legitimate questions. Some in Academia are beginning to question 9-11 on the evidence alone. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 06:22, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

The difference between an encyclopedia and a newspaper is that the encyclopedia reduces any number of "notable" events to summary form and places them in context within a narrative. Most biographies refer to any number of notable events; it's not appropriate to create discrete articles on everything mentioned in every article. Otherwise, I look forward to pages for each of Eisenhower's heart attacks, the Grateful Dead's concerts, Muhammed Ali's bouts, and George W.

Early voting seems to favor Merge, although the Jackson article is already large and can better warrant forks.

<dd>To be fair, as Striver isn't American, he doesn't have the familiarity with American systems and the AJ bullshit doesn't ring on his bullshit detection as it does ours. However, a few points for you:
<ul>
<li>Congressional hearing implies Congress as a body heard the issue. In reality, one congresswomen held a hearing.</li>
<li>Showbiz tonight....well, you may not realize it wasn't on CNN, but just from title of the show? This isn't a hard-hitting investigative news show like Chris Matthews or 60 Minutes. They typically cover who's sleeping with who and who's snorting coke this week. Do we have an article on the Brad Pitt/Jennifer Aniston breakup? (actually never mind, we probably do&#160;:-( ). How about the nth time Gary Busey checks into the Betty Ford clinic? (a drug rehab clinic)</li>
<li>Similarly for Robert Bowman and Morgan Reynolds's claims.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Striver, you might want to consider how credible these people are if they're exaggerating and misrepresenting the significance of things like these. People have been fired for less significant misrepresentations than Bowman and Reynolds are guilty of.</dd>

<dd>Isisnosiris, Attributing motivation to others is seldom useful for producing anything other than offense. I don't see any "fear" among these comments, only people who put more emphasis on notability and others who emphasize the content or political context of the article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This band were a prominent part of a 1990s experimental music movement in New Zealand. The movement, sometimes labelled 'free-noise', was well known in experimental music circles around the world, and was a distinctive sub-genre. A Google search for "Flies Inside The Sun" reveals that this band's releases are stocked by numerous notable suppliers (such as Forced Exposure, Volcanic Tongue, Southern) and have been reviewed in numerous notable magazines (both online and print) (including Dusted, <s>Pitchfork</s>, Arthur etc). <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 01:03, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good faith? is prod and afd (without prior discussion) ever done in good faith? is saying that musicians are not notable when they have published recordings not a personal attack? I'm simply insisting that you practice what you preach, justice, nothing personal, I have no idea who you are, so ts impossible. I see that you are back working on your own article so thats good. Good faith says to discuss PRIOR to force deletion debate. NPA applies to the subjects of the articles as well, when they are real and named people, not hiding behind a mask.

<dd>sorry for usage of your and you, I accept that it could be misconstrued. I altered them to what they should have been. "perverting the course of justice" is a standard legal term in western society, and it is my POV that it applies to many afd sagas, and especially this one here. Now, how about an apology to the musicians named in the article, that have been attacked?<a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 13:46, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A nomination to delete is not a personal attack and should never be construed as such. See <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a>, because it discusses this. There is nothing in <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> or <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> that insists on using the talk page before a deletion nomination, but there <i>is</i> something about "Well-meaning people make mistakes, and you should correct them when they do. You should not act like their mistake was deliberate. Correct, but don't scold." Please don't scold, Paul, because the nomination was an honest mistake. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat">Ziggurat</a> 19:19, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>well now thats the point, you also believe that there is nothing to indicate disussion first. How could a well meaning person make such a mistake if they followed the clear policy of discussion first? oh my finger slipped on the afd button? afd should never be a mistake. A nominate to delete a group of persons MUST be an attack on those persons, not the wiki community, lets not confuse that here. This is not about a wiki person, this is about a process, hurting real people out there, not in here. Lets stop getting sidetracked! you can quote all you like about deletion policy references, and it will be about just that, <i>deletion</i>. I'm trying to discuss <i>discussion</i> policy to prevent deletion, thats just a tad different. My point is that these very smoke screens often prevent justice.<a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 02:37, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>A nomination to delete a Wikipedia article about a group of people is <i>not</i> an attack on those people or an attempt to delete them - <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a> is very clear about that. You are construing it as such, but it is not. An AFD merely indicates "I do not believe that this article is of the necessary standard to warrant inclusion in Wikipedia." The reason that there is a discussion on AfD is that sometimes mistakes <i>are</i> made. And about getting sidetracked - a deletion discussion is not the appropriate forum to talk about these things. If you feel that Wikipedia policy is inappropriate, propose a change and discuss it on the talk page of the policy in question or at the Village Pump. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat">Ziggurat</a> 02:48, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the contrary, I am happy with deletion policy, this is about pre-deletion policy. Its not the policy that is under attacke, but the use of it. There is a difference. This discussion is more about mental set and setting. What better place to discuss injustice, than where it is happening? And why not debate the pre-deletion policy (discussion, assistance, good faith) rather than again sidetarcking it to deletion policy?<a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 04:01, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I know this person very well. She might not have enough google hits... but her name is not common. for example, John Smith could be the editor, and no duh it would have a lot of google hits. Are you aware she really was an editor. She represented New Edinburgh. Check the Wikipedia article on that. If you read the article on her, she did more than be an editor. She also got nomminated for ottawa's women award. Isn't that a big achievement? So keep the article, so more people can learn about someone local to Ottawa.

<li>Tremont30 is not a sock puppit of me. Just to clarify that. Keep this article for one of the other reasons why... She was the first editor of those papers to start the layout electronically. She also interviews Adrienne Clarkson, a huge achievement for a local community editor. Can you name anyone else? Carolyn is knwo across New Edinburgh that a majority a residents in New Edinburgh were saddended tha she was leaving. If you keep this article, more people can learn about her.

<li><i>She was the first editor of those papers to start the layout electronically.</i> This is not a criterion that makes her notable. If she'd been the first newspaper editor in the <i>world</i> to <i>ever</i> use electronic layout, you'd have a point, but being the first one at a specific local community paper simply isn't encyclopedia-worthy.</li>
<li><i>She also interviews Adrienne Clarkson, a huge achievement for a local community editor.</i> This is not a criterion that makes her notable. Lots of people have interviewed Adrienne Clarkson over the years; it's not a feat that automatically makes someone deserving of their own article.</li>
<li><i>Carolyn is knwo across New Edinburgh that a majority a residents in New Edinburgh were saddended tha she was leaving.</i> This is not a criterion that makes her notable to anyone <i>outside</i> of New Edinburgh. This is a worldwide encyclopedia, not the encyclopedia of New Edinburgh.</li>

<li>Maybe she was the first on to start the layout electronically. Do you know anyother papers that started their layout before 2003, most likely but you don't know.A lot of people who interview Adrienne Clarkson are mainly people who work for big papers, but is it really often for a person working for a community paper? Can you answer me that? Maybe she is not known, but maybe in the future she will be known. Her husband works for the Canadian Foreign Service, maybe their will be an article on him, and might need one on his wife. So instead of looking at the present, think about the future. There are a lot of articles on wives of famous people. Also, (i know i told you this), but read the article. She is a diplomat, mother, activist, defender and newspaper editor.

<p>non-notable paper with a non-notable article featuring non-notable editors authored pretty much by the same person.

<li>The <i>editor</i> of a local community newspaper was a perfectly legitimate deletion; it's hard to make a claim that such people are notable enough for articles. However, for the publications themselves, the baseline criterion for inclusion is (or at least was, at one time — I can't seem to find the media criteria at the moment) a circulation of 5,000 copies or more, which this one certainly meets. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 06:10, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The neighborhood may be notable, but the newspaper hasn't got any verifyable presence other than some of its stories being copied to the community website. We can't reliably independently verify its existence, much less circulation numbers, content, etc. I am willing to be convinced otherwise, but someone has to find the sources. Scanning in the circulation description from one of the recent editions (if Canadian postal regulations require one like US do) would probably be good enough, if someone can do that. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 21:26, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable paper with a notable article featuring notable editors in a notable encyclopedia. It should be noted that notability is notably dependent on POV. Wikipedia as a notable encyclopedia serving the notable, less notable and not at all notable (not that this includes any of my notable colleagues who are notably here today), should notably strive to present notably unbiased information by ignoring our notably POV tainted notability censors and gendarmes. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 21:36, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have reread the nomination a few times and this nom has not in any way claimed that this paper does not exist or that there are verifiability issues with its two lines of text. Are you claiming that this is a hoax? That would be most troubling. Of course, the fact that it is listed in Ottawa newspaper lists <a href="http://dawn.thot.net/ontario_weekly_newspapers.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://dawn.thot.net/ontario_weekly_newspapers.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> and <a href="http://ottawastart.com/newspapers.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://ottawastart.com/newspapers.php" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> would seem to prove its existence. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:26, 2 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are plenty of suggestive links around. I am not proposing that it doesn't in any form exist. I don't even think that. What I am saying is that we don't have enough info to verify that it's big enough or covers notable enough subjects to be a notable paper. I could start publishing a quarterly pamphlet out of my home, about events on my block, and set up as much web coverage and presence that NEN has, within 24 hours. We need some verifyable evidence that this isn't a vanity publication... like, circulation information, article information, etc. <i>Anything</i>... And so far we have nothing. For the love of god, someone who lives in Ottowa, please find a copy and scan it in or something. We need more than a few links and a Wikipedia page to base this decision on. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 01:32, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, I respect your point of view, but you seem to be drifting back to that notability thing again, even going so far as to use the word "notable" twice in the second sentence of your response. I feel like I adequately expressed my feelings on that in my initial comment above. Since we both believe to the depths of our beings that this rag exists, there would seem to be little matter for debate between us, although I would tend to agree that further expansion from the article's modest beginnings may require additional information. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:43, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Let's back up a bit. You repeatedly say this is a notable newspaper. <i>How can I verify that</i>. What evidence (verifyable evidence) can you put forwards to justify the claim that it's notable? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 02:15, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I am not missing the point. We're both aikido-throwing each other. Unfortunately, Wikipedia policy on articles requires notability, defined in a verifyable manner, and not simple existential philosophical arguments as to whether particular things are measurable or not and whether there's any indepentent poitn of view to be found. You can keep going, but you aren't fulfiling the Wikipedia requirement to keep the article, and it's going to get nuked. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 02:27, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please point me to that policy page. Also, since you have already determined that this article is going to "get nuked", why did you ask me a question in the first place? -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:31, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am perfectly satisfied that the paper exists as indicated by the two links I have provided. You have admitted as much yourself. The article itself is two lines long and makes no claims beyond its existence. Note, as well, that this nomination is based solely on "non-notability". The nom has made no effort to explain what is meant by that and has offered no evidence to back up the claim. That does not work for me, because to spell things out in plain language and for the last time, notability does not enter into my thinking. I do not believe in that tattered POV concept since its definition varies from individual to individual. What is "notable" for you is not "notable" to me, etc. etc. Thus, it has no bearing on me when considering a school, newspaper, book, film or numerous other categories of articles. I will not now, or in the future, make a vain attempt to support this article on that basis. If we have a guideline page for weekly newspapers that lists certain criteria that should be met, I would be perfectly happy to see New Edinburgh News judged accordingly. Since to my knowledge we do not have this guideline, and we have no real policy on "notability", I choose to apply my personal criteria, which is that all newspapers should have pages here, including community newspapers, school newspapers, pennysavers, whatever. If these are word games that lead to the "nuking" of this article, depriving our readers now and in the future, of any knowledge of New Edinburgh News, then I stand accused.-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:00, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is a Wikipedia article for the Proposition 200 initiative in Arizona, so the Defend Colorado Now entry could be viewed as a similar article. This initiative is particularly important as it is a current event related to the very topical illegal immigration debate that is occuring this year. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Angner (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngner_9b5b.html" title="User talk:Angner">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angner_2655.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angner">contribs</a>) 2006-03-27 00:39:25 EST (UTC)</small>

Certainly, if this issue makes the ballot, it will be pretty notable. While its true that many initiatives don't get on the ballot, this does have the backing of a former Democratic governor of the state and one of the state's Republican congressmen.

<li><b>Comment</b> — Actually there already <i>is</i> a bio for <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Meier_2fc8.html" title="Billy Meier">Billy Meier</a>. The Talmud Jmmanuel Logia was created as I tried to re-write parts of the Meier page to bring it up to standards. (The re-write is not done, but I think the page is improved. Feel free to pitch in at <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Meier_2fc8.html" title="Billy Meier">Billy Meier</a>!)

<dd>I don't believe that is what the sentance means. The footnote says "Content that is distributed by independent online sites will almost certainly satisfy the first criterion." I beleive that it is saying that online media is inclusive to the criteria, not a condition. Otherwise, how is a site such as <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neowin.html" title="Neowin">Neowin</a> permitted? It doesn't appear to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> yet it is permitted. As well, how is it original research? Wikipedia is not a <i>publisher</i> of original research, but it does have articles on sites that conduct original research. Take <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gartner.html" title="Gartner">Gartner</a> for example. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Cyr_2f7a.html" title="User:Paul Cyr">Paul Cyr</a> 18:55, 27 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, a link from Apple's cite, or any web magazine, etc., would not meet this criteria. I take this guideline to imply that any significant article in a significant venue <i>about</i> a web-site is evidence of its notability. The fact that Apple provides a simple link to the site's comparison of Apple scripting to XP scripting does not establish notability. Secondly, the question of original research pertains to your article. How do you know any of the stuff that you write in the article? Cite your sources. There are none? Why, because it is stuff you know from your involvement with the site: that's original research. I want to emphasize that none of this is a criticism of the site, which may be very good, or of your article. It's just in my opinion this is not what wikipedia is about. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> 19:24, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I understand your points, which is why I did not vote a strong keep, and I realise the article is borderline non-notable, however, I do feel that it is in the end a notable website. Of course, this is why we are voting, as my opinion may not be the consensus of the community. However, I still do not see any original research from what I've added (there have been multiple contributors to the article, FYI). The overview is pretty much right from the website introduction. A web archive lookup will show the original page by the founder stating the original criteria of the site. The critisism is the only part that may be known from those involved with the site, but I refer to <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot_trolling_phenomena.html" title="Slashdot trolling phenomena">Slashdot trolling phenomena</a> as an example of first-hand knowledge that is almost entirely unsourced. Unless someone were to make a list of external links showing a trend of trolling on Slashdot, are you claiming that it should not be mentioned in the article? And believe me, after being on a site such as XvsXP for as long as I have, I completely understand that although you disagree with my opinions, it is not an issue with myself or the site.&#160;:) <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Cyr_2f7a.html" title="User:Paul Cyr">Paul Cyr</a> 19:38, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>So now every high school student with a few thousand hours of community service on their resume and a few newspaper cites deserves a WP article. Tried a speedy delete on Michael Nguyen, admin deleted it then the article was moved here. Subsequent speedy delete was not even contested, just removed by the two adamant editors. I think its pretty much clear that this does not meet WP notability. --User208.251.153.9 00:20, 27 March 2006 (UTC) <i>NOTE: User's first edit to Wikipedia.</i></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> , in contrast to viewpoint above. As seen in the history of the page of Michael Q. Nguyen, the delete was in fact contested by another WikiPedia user, and the acusations brought forth upon this User208.251.153.9 is invalid. Please see this link and contestation made by user Khoi.

<p>According to User208.251.153.9 above, I disagree. Although I have tried to improve the article to make it become more of WikiPedia's standards, the article itself could be further improved. I don't believe admin deleted this particular article (only the redirect move from SallyD1265.) Although I have only restructured how the information was presented originally by author SallyD1265, and have read/heard bits of information on Michael from several people through making my contribution, the speedy deletion was always contested and the original speedy deletion was deleted upon changing the article. I stuck to WP's standards. To settle this dispute, the subject of the context, Michael Nguyen, should be contacted in order to state whether he may want his information disclosed like this. KhoiFish 04:44, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS. Not every high school student can achieve a high number of hours such as this. 1,000 hours is equivalent to approximately 47 days without rest (working 24 hours a day), therefore making it significant. A typical (non-homeschooled) student on average spends approx. 8 hours a day on education, I believe (from time spent at school.) This article seeks to inspire others to follow his example and state that despite going to school, one can also achieve in other things as well. KhoiFish 04:47, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am not trying to produce a not worthy WP article, however this subject has caught my attention as a figure who has potential to develop himself. His work that he's done for others should speak for itself. KhoiFish 04:51, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> per SallyD1265. (moved decision) - after withdrawn old ruling. More: Just would like to comment on user Denaar's comments - Orange County, California and Los Angeles County, California is one of the most industrialized and populous areas. Newspapers and media from around the area mainly focus on crime and improvements, not only student achievement. To surpass and make the headlines in the region is something that must be distinguished and not "just another kid" who does charity work. In addition, Denaar stated that kids "work" more than 11.5 hours a week - is this voluntary or paid? As stated in the article, Michael's work has all been UNPAID. - Hard to live in Orange County, California (per homes/territorial costs) with an unpaid position, if you ask me. This shows unselfishness, dedication, and his good quality work to be a great asset to the community. Not many people work without a salary or no monetary gain for themselves.

<li>None of which is relevant to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">inclusion standards</a>. "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events" and "persons being featured in the paper" are, to me, two completely different things.

<li>Wait, wait. Volenteer work helps with admission into hard-to-get-into Colleges and Universities. Are you telling me he won't benefit from this? Its great for his resume, he will definately benefit, as he has obvious political aspirations. Nothing he has done meets the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO inclusion standards</a>. Therefore it doesn't belong here. I also would be shocked to find a newspaper that does NOT have human interest stories, even the Chicago Tribune and Sun Times have human interest stories. Denaar 01:09, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - It is true that volunteer work helps with admission into hard-to-get-into colleges and universities, however, excessive volunteer service and low academic marks does not merit or suffice getting an acceptance. Colleges are looking for well rounded students who are lucid and demonstrate excellence in both academics and extracurriculars. It doesn't state exactly anywhere in the article Mr. Nguyen's GPA and/or test scores, however it does state that he's in the Troy Tech and International Baccalaureate Programs and Troy High School is the 21st Ranked HS in the Nation, that does have some say in that he's not just another person, but at least a bright kid. I remember back in my high school years I didn't have that much community service or awards to talk about. 69.227.174.34 01:28, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>MORE: It seem as if the "CHOC" linked article back to the Orange County Register, plus look at the date (2004, Sept. 25) -doesn't state how many hours or specific achievements; it only speaks about one aspect about [those] respective individuals. It only serves as a summary of one activity. The focus should be on the work done in other accomplishments that are notable, such as (for example, <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/homepage/article_777636.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/homepage/article_777636.php" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>) Still, there are probably more places on the net, however not yet posted in the article's external links. 69.227.174.34 18:43, 2 April 2006 (UTC) ADDITION: As per meeting <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> The following statement(s) are present: "The following types of people may merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them. This is not intended to be an exclusionary list. Just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted." Those bullet points do not make a complete listing of what should be put on or off Wikipedia, only as a guideline. If the person has influenced many people, isn't that go towards the public liking him? (i.e. if he does good work, not bad.) I agree with user Kinu that not everyone should merit an article on WikiPedia, however those who exemplify something that surpasses the overall population should be taken into consideration as well. Wikipedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales has called it "an effort to create and distribute a multilingual free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language." and through this the more significant articles that they have the better. This is one of them. My perception is that hoax articles and "trashy" written ones who present one-time non-notable achievements should be put away and speedy deleted. This article, is different in that it is different in consistency and with progressing achievements. It has a good chance of being expanded in the future, as Michael goes on to continue his work with this pace. 69.227.174.34 19:13, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Kinu. Denaar 12:48, 27 March 2006 (UTC) More: 1800 hours in 3 years is 11 hours a week. Many high school kids have jobs that are more than 11.5 hours a week, I know I did. I was on the front cover of my local newspaper 4 times in Jr High/High School, I'm certainly not notable (enough for Wiki ^o^). Local news coverage, local awards, student seat on a local government? This is all "15 minutes of fame." Looks like a vanity article to help the future career of this student. Denaar 17:02, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Michael Nguyen has recently been recognized by the latino-dominated culture of the City of Santa Ana for presenting "the volunteerism experience" to school district board members and was featured on Adelphia Communication's Southern California News, in three appearances.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Um, in response to your comment, a person would have to know more about your life in order to render such a decision of either to be on WikiPedia or not. Specifically, being on the paper doesn't mean much, only the things accomplished that really matter. This young man out of the hundreds of thousands of teens in the region where he lives HAS made a difference and benefitted others from the things that he does. The role of the Media serves to depict him to others who he has not had a chance to come in contact with about his life. 69.227.174.34 01:28, 3 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Exactly. I'm not notable. Student politicians are not notable (I didn't get in the paper because of politics though). That's what Youth Councils are - youth members of political parties join them.<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 01:40, 3 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - On your statement above: "student politicians are not notable" - are you discriminating/stereotyping everyone to never be notable. This is outrageous. What you're saying is that if you're a student, you basically are worthless and haven't accomplished anything. It is a bit prejudicial. 69.227.174.34 01:48, 3 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - In the context of what we are talking about, " student politicians are not notable " - means that they are not notable, unless they do something more with it, that it is not a sufficient baseline criteria.

He is a unique - or if not - freakish individual when it comes to Community Service.

<p>Does not belong on Wikipedia: newly coined word that lacks importance. Appears to be in use by only one person. The article has remained unedited for six months with a "lacks importance" tag and is linked to by one page (a list). The content is not verifiable.

<li><s><b>Weak keep</b>.</s> The article might have been created purely to promote a naturopathic treatment for autism. And the term might be a neologism coined by commercial interests.

<li>The term does not appear to be in use by any academic community. The reference cited above is to an article written by an undergraduate student, and cites a paper by Mark Brudnak in a journal called "Medical Hypotheses"; he appears to have coined the word and is the only user of the word that I could find in journal articles. Outside of the academic community, a few pages cite him and his definition, but not many (Google test results above). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Prithason (<a href="../../../p/r/i/User_talk%7EPrithason_36e8.html" title="User talk:Prithason">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Prithason_8a71.html" title="Special:Contributions/Prithason">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Delete</b> The term is found in Medline/Pubmed only in articles written by Mark Brudnak, VP of MAK Wood, a manufacturer of dietary supplements. The only use in the medical literature (by Brudnak) is towards the benefits of creatine, and there are no uses of the term as it relates to autism. Removing the unsourced material would leave a stub defining a neologism; the term itself is probably worthless as a medical term as "naturally occurring compounds, which are able to affect gene expression" applies to thousands of drugs from aspirin to zeomycin. If the term becomes generally accepted a new article could be created. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 19:28, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> . art.net's page is worth keeping for at least two reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>1) It's history as one of the earliest art sites, one of the earliest cooperative sites on the Internet, and a site that has encouraged people who are not artists to produce art, and post it on the WWW.</p>
<p>2) More importantly, it's courageous participation with the ACLU in defending freedom of speech on the Internet. These are acts of public citizenship of the highest order and should be cited in wikipedia. As acts within and from the Internet community, they are one of the earliest examples of a web site doing so. These acts are similar to those of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the League for Programming Freedom, the GNU Project, the Free Software Foundation, among others.</p>
<p>Wikipedia promotes itself on each of it's pages. And explicitly asks for donations in TWO places on most pages. How is this different then what little self-promotion there is in this art.net page?</p>
<p>I suggest wikipedia err on the side of inclusivity, and delete pages rarely.</p>
<p>Who I am: I've been involved with the Internet and it's predecessors for four decades. I remember what the ARPAnet was like when it was less then 255 sites (and the transitions to larger address spaces). And many of the disputes that have occurred along the way.

<li><b>Keep</b> Art.net represents all the good things that the Internet aspires to be – freedom, community, mutual support and most of all social entrepreneurship. Art.net is a NOT-for-profit entity, which helps artists show their work. As such, it is essential that Wikipedia, a new source of knowledge and cultural history, recognize the value of art communities like Art.net...Lile Elam, the founder of Art.net, is a recognized leader in the realm of civil rights, cyberspace and a social entrepreneurship. She has donated her time and energy to supporting ACLU struggles to protect freedom. She has turned her technical and creative acumen into an online gallery for artists around the world. Her story and the story of Art.net deserve to be documented. --Tamara Colby 00:42, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><strong>A dead shopping mall is, in itself questionably notable (with most of the AfDs getting no consensus). The <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valley_Fair_Shopping_Centre_0df3.html" title="Valley Fair Shopping Centre">Valley Fair Shopping Centre</a> is indeed possibly notable by the standards being established thus far. It was founded in 1954 and was one of the US's first covered malls, and as disused heaps of bricks go, is faintly encyclopaedic. However, the Youth Futures Valley Fair Mall was created in 2002 using the skeleton of the Valey Fair Shopping Centre as a 'community of commercial and nonprofit endeavors geared to the needs and interests of youth in the Fox River Valley'.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In March 2006, after a whole 3 1/2 years in operation, this community of commercial and nonprofit endeavors geared to the needs and interests of youth in the Fox River Valley was sold to developers. It's now closed, and scheduled to be demolished. I'm not convinced that a community project that ran for three years is enough to justify an article. Note that the only source for this article is a dead URL, but a trip to the Internet Archive hunting for www.mallonamission.org provides the info. The blogsite deadmalls.com hasn't even been used to "reference" this mall. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">Proto</font></span></span></a><font color="#555555"><b>||</b></font><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">type</font></span></span></a></small> 10:33, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</strong></p>

The context of the article is not very clear, as far as can be established it is an essay to inspire/motivate HSC students (students in the last two years of high school in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales, Australia</a>). <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue520_f758.html" title="User:Blue520">Blue520</a> 12:23, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> as non notable vaporware. The article describes a fan-made game that has not yet reached demo stage, and the only reference cited for which doesn't seem to talk about it much. Even if it had been made, odds are it would be obscure, but as it is, it isn't even obscure, it's non-existent.

<p>The last time we AFD'd this article a bunch of people said 'she is probably notable, but we should do this again in a ~year'. Well, it's been a year and we need to reevaluate this person. Is she notable? No. She is a nobody. Nothing about her is unique or special (lots of people runaway, apparently). You could argue that the "media circus" around her was notable, but then the article should be called the "Runaway Bride incident". However, just because this person received media coverage does not mean she or the coverage is notable. No. Basically, the media made a mistake. Why should we be forced to cover their mistake? One rule of thumb that I use is "Keep the article if it can be featured", but this article is unfeatureable. There is just not enough to say about such a unimportant person. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><i>B</i>roken</a><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><i>S</i>egue</a> 14:08, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I do not understand the rationale of "why can't we forget her?".

<p>I believe this article should be deleted. Not because the information isn't useful, but because the information hasn't been updated and the thesis doesn't qualify as an article.

<li><b>Keep</b> This article is <b>Not</b> a hoax. I take no pleasure in creating fake articles because if you knew what I do for a living you would understand.

The area we study has long reaching history and has been a part of many battles and historic relevant times such as the "Tilbury Fort Speech" <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Boleyn_6705.html" title="Anne Boleyn">Anne Boleyn</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wat_Tyler_c0c4.html" title="Wat Tyler">Wat Tyler</a>. I have wikified many parts of the article to other totally relevant pages that contain considerable information about the area we study. It took a lot of work writing the article and I am prepared to re-structure should you wish it to stay. I have been working closely with a Wikipedia team member who has been a great help in making sure that this article meets the requirements. It is developing all the time. The team member has made sure that it changed from an advert which I now know was wrong. I have now included historical references to Thurrock's past and there is a lot more to come. I would like to add finally, that if you do decide to delete my links or my article please take a look at other articles/links which have done the same, to which I have followed suit. This is my first article written for Wikipedia and I have been given great help by members of your team who have been kind and understanding.

"A meat puppet is a variation of a sock puppet; a new internet community member account is created by another person at the request of a user solely for the purposes of influencing the community on a given issue or issues. While less overtly deceptive than sock puppetry, the effect of meat puppetry and sock puppetry on the community as a whole may be similar."</dd>

<li><b>keep</b> This is not spam or a hoax, feel free to contact thurrock museum and ask about us, They help me with the history of the location and after the report is done a copy is sent to the museum. They also tell us of location they know that paranormal events have been reported in, Some times will also ask us toinvestigate locations that might soon be pulled down so a record can be made of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have spent many years setting up Thurrock Paranormal and a great deal of my own money, the site and investigation is done for the love of the subject and not for any profit. you are also free to call any of the locations on the site to ask them about us. The reports that i do pull all the history form the local area into one report someting that has not ben done before. I try to get a good blend of local history and local myths, Thurrock is a very old place and is full of history and for years i have felt that not much has been put onto paper about the history and the strange events that have been reported. shane ralph, Thurrock Paranormal FounderShaneR 20:21, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I informed the witer of the article that any use of sock puppets would likely be detrimental to his cause, and do not think that he is using them. Check his IP address to be sure if you can. I think the criticism "Pure vanity spam, nonsense, pointless, nonnotable, just totally pathetic all around" by DreamGuy is really beyond the bounds of good taste and good faith. It would be nice if more civility could be used when critiquing an article. The user has put in a lot of work since the beginning of this article to ensure that it became steadily more encyclopedic. The notability requirement seems to check out, it passes the google test, at any rate and has been mentioned in a number of publications. The only problem I see now is that some people either may dislike the article because a member of the troupe wrote it (usually a bad idea, but if someone else were to have created more or less the same article, would it then be on AfD?), or that some people just dislike the topic because of its controversial nature. Remember this is this fellow's first post here, and if we delete the page, we need a good reason, not merely a dislike of the topic. <a href="../../../a/r/u/User%7EArundhati_bakshi_6df5.html" title="User:Arundhati bakshi">Arundhati bakshi</a> 20:54, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Keep" For a site that deals in the Paranormal and isnt a commercial venture, I suggest people commenting here actually take a look at the site and the reports. The locations mentioned are of historical value in the Thurrock area, see The Royal Hotel. For this to be up for deletion, but entries made in Wikipedia as per The Metro newspaper a few weeks back being allowed, though they were proved to be totally inaccurate at the time, this seems more like a witch hunt, pardon the pun than an administrative attempt at keeping wikipedia free of spamming. Can a truly plausible reason be given for why this site is up for deletion as spam?</p>
<p>On behalf of those being called Sock Puppets etc. If you know of an entry being deleted but beleive it to be totally unfair due to it being of value to readers (not all readers as not all people are interested in the Paranormal), you should expect some comments in defence of the entry. Does this not also show that those meatpuppets etc are also pleased to see such entry appear in Wikipedia and not see Wikipedia as a waste of cyberspace?</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> How many other sources in this entire encyclopedia are found in Lexis/Nexis European News Sources??? In fact I searched their website for "Paranormal" and it came back with "zero" results. I am shocked that you expect one source to be used as a quotation and reference point for notability for this entire site!</li>
</ul>
<p>Quite frankly <i>I have had enough of the way I have been treated on here</i>! There are only two persons on here who can show pride in what they do and that's <a href="../../../a/r/u/User%7EArundhati_bakshi_6df5.html" title="User:Arundhati bakshi">Arundhati bakshi</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolar_0332.html" title="User:Solar">Solar</a> I have been scorned and slated for writing something I am passionate in! Turning a part of where I live into a historical report on alleged paranormal activity and there was more to come. Just because it is controversial doesn't mean it should be deleted! And as for accuracy and quoting Lexis Nexis etc.... The "<a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolly_the_Sheep_2416.html" title="Dolly the Sheep">Dolly the Sheep</a>" article which was so full of errors it had to be pulled and made the national papers claiming this site to be fatally flawed, makes me so angry! This feels like a witch hunt against all "newbies" as I've been reading most newbie articles and there you all are ganging up on them! Some of the comments I have received on here have been totally out of order! Yet I stand there politely fighting my corner against all odds and I don't get one single apology about what was said!</p>
<p>Delete the article for all I care! I will not be posting or writing any more articles on here for fear of ridicule and abuse. I will not be visiting the site anymore and after seeing the numerous news articles from the bbc etc I know I'm making the right choice. I will also make sure I highly recommend no one else I know uses this site or attempts to write any article for this site as I certainly don't want them to be subject to abuse or highly one sided and inaccurate information! <a href="../../../a/r/u/User%7EArundhati_bakshi_6df5.html" title="User:Arundhati bakshi">Arundhati bakshi</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolar_0332.html" title="User:Solar">Solar</a> I thank you for all of your help and support in helping me write and edit the article and to <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayant412_f27c.html" title="User:Jayant412">Jayant,</a> thanks for helping me up when I was down.</p>

<dd>I'm sorry you feel put upon. One of the guidelines for inclusion is verifiability. The fact that there have been problems in the past is not a good reason to ignore the guideline now. Another guideline is notability or importance, which goes hand in hand with verifiability; if some independent sources have written about a subject, that is a good indication that it is both notable and verifiable. Regarding Lexis/Nexis, it is a tool I use to try and determine whether a subject has received independent news coverage. Many people use Google hits or Alexa rankings to influence their opinions regarding articles nominated for deletion. I choose to use Lexis/Nexis, partly because it is a specific indicator of coverage in "mainstream media" and partly because it is a subscription site that few other Wikipedians have ready access to, so it adds information to the discussion. I have never pretended it is some kind of ultimate authority. In fact L/N lists 129 articles in the past year with the words "paranormal" and "investigation" in the European press alone.</dd>
<dd>Regarding your article, it really is two separate articles. The information about haunted places in Thurrock could certainly be included in the article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_haunted_locations.html" title="List of haunted locations">List of haunted locations</a> if you can include soure citations, and I recommend you use in-line links or <a href="../../../f/o/o/WP%7EFOOTNOTE_26e2.html" title="WP:FOOTNOTE">footnotes</a>, and be specific (for instance, if a magazine discusses a place, give the date and page number of the issue, not just the magazine title). You could even try to create List of haunted places in Thurrock, England if you think there is enough specific information to justify a separate article. Be aware of the policy of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No original research</a> though; you need to point to independent 3rd party information. The other part of the article, about your own investigations, will generally not be supported here unless there is evidence that you have attracted independent attention (from magazines, newspapers, TV shows, etc.) <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 21:41, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>you asked for some verifiability; if some independent sources have written about a subject. well find the book THURROCKS PAST(ECHOES OF THE PAST) by Alan Leyin you will finda lot of our locations there and the reported ghosts. in fact Daiel Defoe in 1724 (a tour of the whole island of great britain) talks about mucking,tilbury and then resd The mirror of the sea by Joseph Conrad( lived in thurrock for some time) and then read,</p>
<pre>
and more Ghost information can be found in  The peoples history of Essex by D.W Coller 1861
</pre>
<p>and tend read Alice of fobbibg&#160;:or the times of jack straw and wat tyley by Rerv.w.e. heygate 1860 and then readHeart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad 1902 but you must read LIFE AND RECOLLECTIONS by Hon Grantly Berkely 1866 , there is great pice on the Ghost of Belhus. you said you need so pages well here are some A Essex ghost hiunters guide to essex page 83, langdon hills, pg,119 muckingpg, 120,124 corringham, 114,117,124,134 fobbing once you have read this then i feel you will see i know what i am talking about.ShaneR 11:39, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

oh must add somthing, about our logo, yep thanks i did do it and it was done on photo shop, yes i have just started using it but i tell you what its much better than MICHIGAN'S DAWN TO DUSK PARANORMAL cartoon lol, if you think they are better than you should lok at the paranormal photo on MICHIGAN'S site, hmm orb's dont think so, tattoo ghost dont think so, its a face on a tv screen and you dont need to be a paranormal investigator to work that one out.ShaneR 12:22, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ShaneR, (blank)cruft is the standard phrase used here for an article that appeals only to someone who is interested in whatever (blank) is. The generalization fancruft was the initial usage, and blogcruft is the most common by my count. It's not insulting. As for your notability claims: all those do is assert that the locations you have investigated are notable, not that you are. You need sources that mention Thurrock Paranormal, not paranormal places in thurrock. Calm down, chief, you're making yourself look foolish. -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/20px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="14" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" /></a> 17:16, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry but i feel that we are being told to sell out(turn to the media) if we did this every time we investigated a location we would be expected to say it was haunted, somthing we dont do, there are loads of location that I have been asked to visit and when i got there all it turned out to be was damp or the heating coming on in the night making doors pop open. As i state on the website we are link no other investigation team, we do not book location and charge £35 per person to go on a investigation and make loads of money out of it.

<dd>ShaneR, if you were notable, you would not go to the media, they come to you. At the very least a local newspaper would write a story about you. I went to college for journalism. If somebody comes to us asking for a story about them, we turn them down. We write stories, not propaganda.

<p>This article is the main article linked to from <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronics.html#Heat_dissipation_and_thermal_management" title="Electronics">Electronics#Heat dissipation and thermal management</a>. I don't believe it covers enough material to merit its own article, and everything in it is described in more detail on numerous other pages.

<li><b>Comment</b> I disagree with deleting this article. Where else will you put stuff on heatsinking and fan cooling of electronic equpt etc. If you can come up with an alternative page title, I'm willing to listen . Otherwise, please leave this page alone.--<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELight_current_29d4.html" title="User:Light current">Light current</a> 01:19, 23 March 2006 (UTC) <small>(copied from this article's <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThermal_management_of_electronic_devices_and_systems_0f2d.html" title="Talk:Thermal management of electronic devices and systems">talk page</a>)</small></li>
<li>Perhaps the previous poster is unfamiliar with the concept of <b>merge back to <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronics.html" title="Electronics">Electronics</a></b>? <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlba_9e53.html" title="User:Alba">Alba</a> 03:30, 23 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On the one hand, merging it back makes a lot of sense. However, <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELight_current_29d4.html" title="User:Light current">Light current</a> made the point on <a href="../../../m/d/d/User_talk%7EMdd4696_9dbb.html#Thermal_management_etc" title="User talk:Mdd4696">my talk page</a> that the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronics.html" title="Electronics">Electronics</a> article is already gigantic. I think there's room for just a paragraph on this subject there, but he also stated that this article could be significantly expanded. I'm somewhat less sure about deleting this article now, however I'd like the AfD to remain active so as to gather others' opinions. ~<a href="../../../m/d/d/User%7EMdd4696_2098.html" title="User:Mdd4696">MDD</a><a href="../../../m/d/d/User_talk%7EMdd4696_9dbb.html" title="User talk:Mdd4696">46</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mdd4696_369b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mdd4696">96</a> 03:37, 23 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case, I'd advise re-splitting with more sections after merging back. I would agree that <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronics.html" title="Electronics">Electronics</a> is too big, but you can't pull material out one paragraph at a time. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlba_9e53.html" title="User:Alba">Alba</a> 13:35, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a substantial topic. While the current article is written rather poorly as of now I believe that this is the sort of topic that is easily improved.

<dd>Finally, the band, Captain Peacock (music) contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such; and, a member has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country[1], reported in notable and verifiable sources.</dd>

<dd>Please don't be accusatory. You were very polite with me, so I know that you can make a calm argument about this.</dd>
<dd>Could you cite your sources for the member who was once a part of a notable band? Singing with Norah Jones in college doesn't <i>quite</i> cut it, I think, because she is an independent singer, not a band. Also, the requirement is, I believe, that the <i>band</i> has gone on a international/national concert tour, not just one member. Sorry.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I can assure you that I harbor no ill feelings towards you or the band. Thusfar, however, the band has not yet done anything to merit inclusion YET. They seem to be on the right track, however and will likely soon be notable enough for wikipedia. When they do meet one of the notability guidelines for a band, I will gladly support the inclusion of their article and contribute by way of copyediting, syntax, etc. Until then, they are just not ready. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">talk</a>)</small> 20:08, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Both resulted in a consensus to delete. It's also been speedily deleted at least twice.

It meets criteria (3) at minimum: TopWebComics (I believe) lists the comic. The proof<sup>1</sup> is in the "Vote" link, both on the main page and in several forumites' signatures.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If you are going to directly refute a statement made just two spaces above you, you really should say why that is. OmegaX123 stated that from what he can see, it meets requirement three. If you believe that this is not the case, you really should give your reasoning. Also, checking the TopWebComics listings, I found that Captain SNES currently holds slot 47, placing it above <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_Lumps_3418.html" title="Two Lumps">Two Lumps</a> in slot 48. 64.72.87.113 03:53, 1 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Generally, topsites don't count at all when looking for verifiability or as indicators of notability. The reason being, is that rabid fans spam votes, and that actual popular sites ignore them.

<li><b>Keep</b> Captain SNES is a long runing comic with high production values and a long, well thought out plot. to delete it (again.) would be a waste. if Bob and George can have a page, then a much superior comic like Captain SNES certainly deserves one. <a href="../../../o/m/n/User%7EOmniRedmage_975c.html" title="User:OmniRedmage">Omniredmage</a> 05:53 1 April 2006</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The various "top 100 comic" style lists are not generally considered evidence of notability because they are too vulnerable to ballot stuffing. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 14:15, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Look at the article again. At least two of the sites in the links are <i>not</i> topsites (don't know about the third), and have reviewed CSNES. Just like OmniRedmage said, might I add? OmegaX123 20:31, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I feel that Topwebcomics, the top site list that Captain SNES is on, has taken measures to prevent ballot stuffing. I voted today, as I am a fan of Captain SNES, then cleared my cookies and any other evidence that I could that I had voted, then tried to vote again. It did not let me, because the site logs individual IP addresses for ballot stuffing, thus preventing rabid fans from boosting their own sites to the top.--<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExperimentmonty_1859.html" title="User:Experimentmonty">Experimentmonty</a> 01:19, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Preserve</b> I feel that this article should be kept provided that the article be expanded upon. It is not up to the high standards expected here yet, but it has not been given much time to reach these high standards. This is a high quality comic, and given the chance, this article can be benificial.--<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExperimentmonty_1859.html" title="User:Experimentmonty">Experimentmonty</a> 01:19, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Are comics like <a href="../../../z/e/b/Zebra_Girl_349c.html" title="Zebra Girl">Zebra Girl</a> notable while this is not? I don't get the standards here. This comic has more refrences, and could be kept as <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_fiction.html" title="Fan fiction">fan fiction</a> if nothing else. <a href="../../../s/p/r/User%7ESpriteless_c2a4.html" title="User:Spriteless">Spriteless</a> 13:48, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Zebra Girl is part of Keenspot, it's apparently good enough that people have to pay for it. Have you taken a look at the "references"? They're not references at all, they're topsites and webcomic databases, which each contain links to thousands of webcomics. This isn't a notable website. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 14:07, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>- Since when do you have to pay for Keenspot? The readers certainly don't, and I've never payed for anything on KeenSpot OR KeenSpace. Are you implying that the more money you spend, the more likely you are to keep a wikipedia article? Who should I pay, you? or should I make the check out to Wiki? <a href="../../../o/m/n/User%7EOmniRedmage_975c.html" title="User:OmniRedmage">Omniredmage</a> 09:23 PM 4 April 2006
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Keenspot pays the comic for exclusive rights on the internet. They offer a Keenspot Premium service in which you pay for a better service. You don't choose to be on Keenspot, they choose you. And it's not like I personally think Zebra Girl is notable either, but the community seems to think that anything that has ever apeared Keenspot is inherently notable. Keenspace on the other hand is just a free geocities style host. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 08:47, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Furthermore, the so called POV fork seems to have resulted from this nom's edit warring to remove the list. Lastly, what difference does it make that these are Christian schools? For all I care, they could be Jewish, Muslim, or Rastafarian. Why did that need to be immediately specified in the first words of this nom?

<dd>You comparing TRACS to the NCAA? I fail to understand the connection. It should not be listed because (as I wrote in the nom.) "<a href="../../../t/r/a/TRACS_e3db.html" title="TRACS">TRACS</a> has a list on their webpage, which is more accurate and informative than this control-c list. Interested parties can visit the TRACS page and link for further information." The list is updated on the TRACS page according to schools that lost accreditation and earned accreditation. Most recently in Feb. 2006. There is no reason to think the wiki page will be updated to be accurate. Thus, the information will be incorrect and provide misleading details on school accreditation.</dd>
<dd>If this list is kept then the other accrediting agnecies will also have lists. That includes <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Central_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools_4015.html" title="North Central Association of Colleges and Schools">North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>, which accredits 10,000 schools. Do you want a list of 10,000 schools on wikipedia pertaining to one accreditation group? Or the 13,000 schools accredited by <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools_eac1.html" title="Southern Association of Colleges and Schools">Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>, which I removed the beginnings of the list one month ago <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Southern_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools&amp;diff=40691340&amp;oldid=39981069" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Southern_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools&amp;diff=40691340&amp;oldid=39981069" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 01:32, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Those are all very weak arguments. What may or may not exist on the web is not my problem. Almost every topic we cover here is covered in greater depth somewhere else. That should never be an excuse to remove content. The bottom line for me is that if we are going to do school lists such as these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_universities_and_colleges_in_the_United_States" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_universities_and_colleges_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>, I can find no reason to remove a list of accredited schools from a group such as TRACS for which we have a page. In my view, it is just as essential to know what institutions are under the TRACS umbrella as with any other accreditation agency. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:47, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, we'll have a list of 10,000 schools linked at <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Central_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools_4015.html" title="North Central Association of Colleges and Schools">North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a> and 13,000 at <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools_eac1.html" title="Southern Association of Colleges and Schools">Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> because you want to keep this list of around 40 schools, which only 12 have wikipedia articles.</dd>

<dd>Nobody is likely to nominate a project-space article listing articles for <i>universities</i> which need to be created, even though lists of redlinks tend (as with the Schools project) to spawn substubs of no encycloaedic value. If this was in project space - part of the Christianity wikiproject, for example - I think it's unlikely it would have been nominated. As it stands what this list does is to duplicate the list at the TRACS website (only with much less detail and not necessarily up-to-date). <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 09:15, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, probably should be a speedy keep. Vanity is not grounds for deletion, and the subject of the article is considered notable enough, for example, to serve as a juror on a nontrivial prize competition at UC Berkeley <a href="http://www.berkeleyprize.org/endowment/index.cfm?pg=committees" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.berkeleyprize.org/endowment/index.cfm?pg=committees" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>, and is identified by that institution as an award-winning writer and a prominent writer/critic in his home country of Iran. And while I can't read a word of the one's I've found, there are enough online articles from the Iranian press by the guy to demonstrate notability.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Reread that page; it says this quite explicitly: "<b>As explained below, vanity by itself is not a basis for deletion, but lack of importance is.</b>" Vanity vigilantes who are more concerned with authorship than content do far more to damage Wikipedia than to improve it. It's one thing to beat up on goofy (but fundamentally harmless) articles by high school kids who identify themselves as Pope of Latveria, or whatever; it's quite another to slag rather modestly stated, factually impeccable articles that improve Wikipedia. Excessive fannishness is also a vanity signal, but somehow the label is never attached to 50,000 word articles on Pokemon characters, or the veritable hagiographies of musicians like Mariah Carey, or the episode-by-episode exegeses of wretched televison programs.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Psalm 23 is one of the most well known passages in the Bible, one that has been made into song lyrics in thousands of languages, and an important element in the Christian and Jewish faith. Many non-adherents of the faith may also be interested to find out what it is actually about. There is enough information on this Psalm to discuss as an indivudial article, and personally I find it a good and very practical source of information. --<a href="../../../g/c/_/User%7EGc_susetyo_a8f7.html" title="User:Gc susetyo">gc_susetyo</a> 15:20, 31 March 2006 (GMT+1)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - utter rubbish. The translation Psalm 23 ('The Lord is my shepherd') is the most popular poem/hymn in the English language, Psalm 51 not far behind. Their impact on language, art, music and Christian and Jewish theology cannot be underestimated. Wikisouce is for primary sources not for a description of the importance, impact, and influence of these texts. There are only 150 Psalms (compared to millions of schools and barely notable bands), so having an article on every one (which we don't yet) is perfectly appropriate. Ridiculous nomination. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 22:06, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>These psalms are not grouped in any meaningful way. They're individual articles on diverse psalms that nom is just happening to afd all at once. Besides, psalms aren't "bible verses", nor does their numbering really correspond to the chapters of other books, both of which divisions are of relatively recent origin. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 23:41, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I realize that psalms are different than bible verses, but I think that they are analogous enough that the dicussions would be relevant. As e.g. <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Whole_bible_chapter_text_86f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Whole bible chapter text">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Whole bible chapter text</a> states, "as per <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_include_copies_of_primary_sources_e36f.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources">Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources</a>, entire chapters of the Bible do not belong on wikipedia. Since the Bible already exists in several different translations and different languages at its proper location (Wikisource), any article containing only Bible text should be speedily deleted or redirected as is necessary, and article should only contain as much source text as is necessary for purposes of example."

<li><b>Comment</b> - Esquizombi, if you actually look at the articles, you'll find that only <a href="../../../p/s/a/Psalm_23.html" title="Psalm 23">Psalm 23</a> <a href="../../../p/s/a/Psalm_51.html" title="Psalm 51">Psalm 51</a> contain the entire text of the psalms. (In several different translations for Psalm 51 -- I would support cutting them out.) Even in these cases, however, the text is not the entire content of the article. While all of them could use expansion, they are primarily articles <i>about</i> the individual psalms, not the psalms themselves. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 01:11, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> While I'm for merging a lot of the verse articles I think these are good enough. They aren't just replicating the text in different translations, focusing on trivial details to fill space, or could they been merged into something more in a logical way that I can think of. We shouldn't set any precedent though, each needs to be judged on their own merits.

Psalm 104 is important, for one thing, because of the link to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Hymn_to_the_Aten_31ac.html" title="Great Hymn to the Aten">Great Hymn to the Aten</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is one of the more famous psalms, often quoted and referred to. The fact that it's part of a collection shouldn't affect that. Ratbat 0:16, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The term is a corely used term, paticularly by fans and musicians in the Metal Scene. Bands such as <a href="../../../e/t/e/Eternal_Tears_of_Sorrow_f66a.html" title="Eternal Tears of Sorrow">Eternal Tears of Sorrow</a> often call themselfs Extreme Metal. Spearhead is doing some create clean up work, but this article is directly linked from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_heavy_metal_genres.html" title="List of heavy metal genres">List of heavy metal genres</a>, an article i mediate very closely to expell and integrate bad and good content.

<dd>I agree with you insofar as that the term does exist and is commonly used.

<dd>The reason i delete stuff from there is because people keep filling it with nonsense, and trying to create genres, here is a few: 'Circus Metal', 'Jungle Beats Metal', 'Evil Metal'. As for the merge, i think that, perhaps, Spearhead and me should merge all the articles that are cross-genre references into one article - which shouldnt be the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_heavy_metal_genres.html" title="List of heavy metal genres">List of heavy metal genres</a>, as thats supposed to be a general shortcut to all the main articles. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Ley Shade</a> 17:01, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Getting a proper <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_heavy_metal_genres.html" title="List of heavy metal genres">List of heavy metal genres</a> is a good starting point. If we could at least settle on that, we can start working on getting the actual articles fixed. Generally speaking all these metal genre articles are a load of crap. And it completely is beyond me why <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">Heavy metal music</a> is a featured article. One other thing is that all the lists of key artists should go, since they are target for vandalising and contained in the article anyway.

<li>Yes, those are all great lists. The problem is that they are mostly organized by US State. That is not too helpful if you don't know which State to check.

<li>The existance of this list seems an argument against the practice of not allowing things to be in subcategories and supercategories at the same time.

<dd>I don't think that there is a specific notability test for sports teams but if the team was a professional one that played as part of a well-established league then it might well be considered notable. If it was an amateur team, then some high profile reports in national media publications might make it notable. That's my view anyway. Maybe others will have more information for you. <a href="../../../n/o/_/User%7ENo_Guru_cc59.html" title="User:No Guru">No Guru</a> 19:07, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you. The team has featured in a local paper. It has a fixture with a university team and was invited to a tournament but could not make it. Have you any precedents that you can show me about a similar issue. I do think a more 'solid' definition is needed before it could be considered for removal.

<dd>I have visited the site. It has an entry for all element numbers up to #202, including many others which have not yet been created. Note that for elements that <i>have</i> been created, it lists a discovery date; no such date is listed for #176. Furthermore, if you check the <a href="http://www.apsidium.com/elements/118.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.apsidium.com/elements/118.htm" rel="nofollow">entry for #118</a> and view image properties, you will see the image tagged as 'Place-holder, no picture available of Ununoctium'. The (very similar) image associated with #176 is similarly tagged 'Placeholder', as indeed are all the ones past #118. I'm not clear about what part of the page gives you the impression that #176 has been created and #177 hasn't. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 21:54, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Oh, now, don't say it will never be produced. There are few physical limits on the ability to build bigger heavy ion accellerators, and the techniques which have rather reliably let us produce up to the low 1-teens (116 so far) should extend out a good long ways. At the current rate of progress, we would expect to see it synthesized around year 2200, assuming that continuing to produce new artificial elements out past the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island_of_stability.html" title="Island of stability">Island of stability</a> is seen as worthwhile for any purpose. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 17:17, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>After doing further research, I have learned that this element does not exist. There is no reason to keep it on Wikipedia. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to change my above "Keep" vote, but i'd like to change it to <b>Delete</b>. If it is merged, it so should the other atoms up to 200.
