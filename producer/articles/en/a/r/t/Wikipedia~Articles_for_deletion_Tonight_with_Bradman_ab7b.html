<li><b>Comment.</b> Tonight with Bradman is broadcast not only on cable access, but syndicated around the United States. A Search for "Tonight with Bradman" on Goolgle brings up well over 700+ sources of where TWB can be seen. It is also featured on iTunes, YouTube and other online boradcast services. There are several programs, Any Milinokis, etc. who wilm at a Public Access facility for syndication. The program has hosted Britney Spears, Playboy, Girls Gone Wild, Kenny Kramer, Wink Martindale, and many others. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by MarySwope (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarySwope_7972.html" title="User talk:MarySwope">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MarySwope_2a52.html" title="Special:Contributions/MarySwope">contribs</a>).</small> 14:18 September 21, 2006</li>

<li><b>Delete and also delete Bradley Laborman</b>, as the person himself (along with his show) have absolutely no notability. Both articles contains one link to a "<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>", that being the same article in the <a href="../../../d/e/s/Des_Moines_Register_3e34.html" title="Des Moines Register">Des Moines Register</a>, and the article is only half about the man and his show. The <i>Tonight with Bradman</i> page has no assertions of notability besides claims that are unverified (such as having Britney Spears on the show- until I see video of it, I'll refuse to believe that Britney Spears went to Iowa to appear on a cable access / Internet show), and the claims of celebrity guests probably wouldn't be enough to qualify it for a WP article, anyway. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 23:27, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete all</b> The whole point of the Iowa newspaper article is that any ol' local cable access host can now go nationwide on the Internet. That doesn't give any such host, or his show, notability.

<li><b>Concern</b> Is this more because of the fact that he is from Iowa? I was watching his program last night, and a person called with concerns about the Wikipedia editing. October 8, 2006 is going to be announced by Mayor Ross Wilburn as "Bradman Day". I am not sure if you realize this, but Bradley Laborman kept a town in complete communication when a tornado struck Iowa City this fall, and no network affiliates were there to cover it. Also if you want an answer to the question of notability, I guess, if you don't feel he's notable maybe Wikipedia isn't an accurate source for information.128.255.107.80</li>

<li><b>Reply</b>I find it hard to be told not to be demeaning when all I hear are comments about how being from Iowa makes you not-notable. I find it amazing that people who have not done anything to help a community and make a difference can decide if someone who has made a difference is notable or not.128.255.107.80

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hi there! Nobody is saying that being from <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa.html" title="Iowa">Iowa</a> makes someone nonnotable. We have articles on plenty of people from Iowa!! The problem with your article is that you havent't <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> any claims that you have made. If you can add sources to the article to back up your claims, it may very well be able to stay. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 17:41, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is a television show that is broadcast over Internet.

Your best course of action is to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a> to demonstrate that the primary notability criterion is satisfied — in other words that people independent of the show and its creators/promoters have written and published non-trivial works about the show itself. The <i>Register</i> article contains only a couple of sentences that are actually about the subject of this article. The <i>Press-Citizen</i> and <i>Daily Iowan</i> articles are far more what you should be looking for, because they are substantial, detailed, and not simple rehashes of publicity blurb. They demonstrate that something is not<i>able</i> because it has been not<i>ed</i>. (And remember that books, journal articles, and suchlike also count.

<li><b>FAN COMMENT</b> Although 'Tonight with Bradman' may not be nationally or internationally known, it in fact IS a big deal in the Iowa City area. It is, as far as I know, the only public access show that people will make time in their schedules to watch each week. Also, I believe that one of the reasons it has not gotten more press coverage is for the simple fact that it's a public access show. It might be worth a one-time feature article, but the newspapers would feel that any more would be kind of a waste of space for a public access show, no matter how big it is (unless it was a state-wide phenomenon or something). Despite it's relative 'smallness', I personally believe the show should at least be allowed a spot on Wikipedia. Thank you. 63.252.23.150</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. An article about this show came up on AfD before, and was deleted. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_TONIGHT_WITH_BRADMAN_%28TWB%29_1863.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/TONIGHT WITH BRADMAN (TWB)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/TONIGHT WITH BRADMAN (TWB)</a>. Maybe the show has become more notable since then, I'm not sure. But I would like to get some clarfication on the first comment above. Does the show actually air on broadcast or cable television anywhere besides Iowa City? Or is it seen outside Iowa City only via the Internet? Also, to anyone planning to submit another identical FAN COMMENT, please give us reasons why this show is notable in your own words instead. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 02:57, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>INPUT</b> I'm currently studying in Germany and was introduced to TWB through a friend. Since then I have enjoyed watching what I can on their main website, along with downloading podcasts and recommending the show to other friends. So far it seems that the main argument for not allowing TWB a wikipedia page is that the show is viewed as being insignificant or trivial. May I please remind you that all things start out small and it's only when they're given the <i>chance</i> to grow that they evolve into something of the "repute" wikipedia seems to desire. For what it's worth, TWB appears to be quite popular (or at least well known) among Iowa City Residents <i>and</i> as it's being viewed by people in multiple countries (let alone continents) I fail to see why it does not deserve a wikipedia page. Surely if Page France and the definition of 'Bank Reserve' get a page, a great show with a fanbase like that of Tonight with Bradman should deserve one also.--132.180.252.57 11:11, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>ATTENTION</b> This is actually Bradley Laborman, I was notified about this situation a while back and I just want to tell my fans thank you. I want to point out however, the people who run Wikipedia have a better understanding of what is notable and what is not. I am grateful for everyone who has spoke up for me and my work, but if Wikipedia does not wish for my account to be on here, I would respect that. I have alot on my plate with the application to NBC and other networks talking to me. If I am not on now, please believe me someday I wil be on the pages of Wikipedia, until then, please respect the site and respect the show by being appropriate fans and not terrorist. I also see now that <a href="http://www.facebook.com" class="external text" title="http://www.facebook.com" rel="nofollow">FACEBOOK</a> is now open to anyone, I would invite fans who do not have facebook to join that and join our many fan groups there. I frequesnt those alot. Thank you. BradmanTWB</li>
