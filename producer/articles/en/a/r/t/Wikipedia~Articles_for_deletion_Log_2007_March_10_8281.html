<p>Article is a category improperly implemented as an article Anonymous55 00:14, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This came out of a discussion on <a href="../../../o/n/e/Category_talk%7EOne-piece_suits_0f7c.html" title="Category talk:One-piece suits">Category_talk:One-piece_suits</a>. The One-piece garment article is essentially a list of links to other articles with very little other content, and has existed for over four years. The category was created three days ago. They're not identical in scope; the article includes non-bifurcated garments like dresses, whereas the new category does not. My idea is to replace the article with a category called <i>One-piece garments</i>, and make <i>One-piece suits</i> a sub-category underneath it, but I don't know if that's the best solution as the two categories may be too similar to justify keeping them both. Looking for input on that. Anonymous55 00:36, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Having articles on nearly everyone who exists (which seems to be the direction we're heading) is a liability because it only takes one vandal among those millions of articles to get a severe case of libel on our hands. Having articles on every person who makes the papers for a day (hundreds of thousands of articles which no one will pay attention to for long) is therefore a liability. We have to maintain quality control on these articles than anyone can edit. That's quickly becoming more and more unmanagable. This article isn't such a problem per se, but it is a very small part of a larger problem. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:10, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>That's what <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> is for.

It's also understood that anybody can edit this. But really, if you're worried that this can cause a legal liability to Wikipedia because somebody with a stick up their arse doesn't like what they see about themselves on a vandalized article, then I'm sure <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo.html" title="Jimbo">Jimbo</a> has some answers. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 07:22, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> is nice and all, but it assumes that someone is looking after these pages. Who will be watching <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Aspinell_1197.html" title="Barry Aspinell">Barry Aspinell</a> a year and a half from now? It's creator? Apparently he hasn't even noticed that it's at AfD. All it takes is someone to add "He's a pederast" to the bottom of the article and we've got a serious problem on our hands, as such vandalism <i>is</i> likely to go unnoticed for long periods of time in the future. And even if this particular article is not such a problem (maybe some of the people who voted here will put it on their watchlist and keep an eye on it, I don't know) think of the thousands upon thousands of similar articles on people who were in the papers one day and quickly forgotten (I was exaggerating about "nearly everyone" getting an article, but it's a staggering number of people). This is an example of a growing problem. Among our already 1.6 million articles, it's basically a statistical certainty that we have substantial cases of libel; Seigenthaler was likely the tip of the iceberg. And I don't think "I'm sure Jimbo has something up his sleeve" is a real solution. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:18, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I disagree. Just because something isn't <i>attributed</i> doesn't mean it's not <i>attributable</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - We can't go around deleting every article that's not properly expanded yet, instead we should try to make them better. I suggest adding one of them "help expanding this article" tags to it.

<li><i>Comment</i> This is an article that has been up for more than 6 months, that's plenty of time to find sources. We can't wait forever for sources that may not exist. Just because you consider it well respected doesn't mean that we can ignore policy. "Wikipedia articles must be based on reliable sources. Reliable sources are credible published materials with a reliable publication process; their authors are generally regarded as trustworthy, or are authoritative in relation to the subject at hand." (from <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>) <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPax%7EVobiscum_3a44.html" title="User:Pax:Vobiscum">Pax:Vobiscum</a> 11:40, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>Comment</i> .. 6 months and not a single "help expanding this article" or "needs citation" tags? I for one didn't even know you wanted more sources to begin with.

<p>Unprecedented list, overall pointless. Wikipedia isn't like a Middle School Black History Month powerpoint presentation. There is nothing *unique* about being Black and being one of these things so a separate article like this is just plain ridiculous.

<li>No, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_inventors.html" title="List of inventors">list of inventors</a> has precedent and reason.

<li><b>Comment</b> - if kept, the article needs to be renamed to remove the words "notable" and "innovators."

<p><b>Comment</b> Well, this page isn't very well done, for one thing, I think the name choice is poor. But since <a href="../../../i/n/v/Category%7EInventors_by_nationality_4f87.html" title="Category:Inventors by nationality">Category:Inventors by nationality</a> does exist, I'd say there's no inherent objection to identifying people by race or ethnicity as appropriate.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I personally am leaning towards deletition, though the easiest way to express my reasoning is a reverse violation of <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> (WP:OTHERCRAPDOESN'TEXIST), and as such, I feel it's best to hold off on voting for now. I also think that articles / sections / lists like these are just begging for "counter-article-section-lists" - that is, Notable white innovators, inventors, and scientists. I think it's important to come to some form of consensus on what would happen to such an article, before acting on this one. That said, one statement that I definitely feel strong enough about to bold is, <b>If kept, rename per <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a>'s statement</b>. --Action Jackson IV 05:35, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> also, it seems the List of Jewish _____ is being thrown around. I will say that there's several distinctions between being "Jewish" and being "Black" - two of which would be the ease of figuring out if someone is black (generally, and yes, there are exceptions), versus the relative difficulty of determining, from sight alone, whether someone is Jewish or not. Additionally, Judiasm is a religious choice. While we can bicker this way and that about determinalism and whether or not people actually "choose" their religion, it all comes down to the fact that it's a lot easier for me to pretend to be a goyim than it was for Michael Jackson to pretend to have light skin. --Action Jackson IV 05:48, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> the black/white issue isn't a relevant world view, race is alway debatable, soon enough we are going to see actors that are 1/4 this and painters that are 5/8 that. besides, don't we have categories to provide, hmmmmm, categorization? why the manually updated lists? they are just meant to fall out of date if not manually kept. Is the person relevant because he was an inventor? yes. did his race contribute to that relevance? I think not. and about the other lists, all the other lists, the same applies. if someone realy needs this information, i'm sure using google to search through the site will provide the same result. i'd also like to add that <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Steele_4e77.html" title="Claude Steele">Claude Steele</a>, who is on that list is not even described in his own article as black, but is categorized as such. <a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalf_4119.html" title="User:Galf">Galf</a> 12:30, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

And at least for the 19th century scientists, their race <i>did</i> contribute to their notability, considering nearly all college and universities in the US were segregated at that time, as were most professional organizations.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well, as a European scientist you might be particularly unsuited to comment rashly in this discussion because it neither involves your culture nor your expertise in science. And yet you have no compunctions about saying that it's "clear that this list is for Americans to divide themselves." You might want to be a bit more hesitant about assigning motives to people in other cultures not your own. You might also want to refamiliarize yourself with the Wikipedia principle of "assume good faith." As someone from a continent where ethnic tensions in almost every nation from the Atlantic to the Urals are higher than in America, you might want to treat your self-description more as a humble caveat than a credential. <b>Let me educate you:</b> For those of us in a culture where there are many ethnic groups at different levels of social and ethnic power, and where there is a history of those levels constantly changing over time, these lists perform both a practical and emotional purpose: practical in that they can be used by both middle-school students researching reports and graduate students or researchers studying ethnicity; emotional in that particular career fields have widely varying proportions of ethnic groups and it is often useful to people considering entering those fields to find out about the prominent people from that person's ethnic group who have gone before them. Ethnic organizations often refer to members of their groups who have succeeded in various fields, and one purpose of this is to discourage bigotry from outsiders who have said, in the past, that members of such-and-such a group can't do a particular job. It's not as important, but worth noting that it also happens to be verifiably true that certain ethnic groups, for cultural reasons, often predominate in one field or another for a period of time. That is also useful to study, and these lists might possibly help in that in some way. Particularly among ethnic groups where many people live in impoverished neighborhoods, it has been thought useful for children to know about people from that group who have been successful because despair and discouragement can smother ambition. Most of what I've just written are familiar points to most Americans, whether they agree with them or not. I encourage you to bring up the topic with an American, but when you do, try not to seem presumptuous. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 16:58, 11 March 2007 (UTC) (just edited a few words, no change in meaning <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 17:02, 11 March 2007 (UTC))</dd>

After all, by the logic being used here, they too should be deleted. All I'm saying is that this bandwagon got started because some provocateur created a "List of Caucasian Americans" for no reason other than to get it deleted so he could use it as justification to start the process of deleting ethnic lists. So regardless of the arguments presented to argue for deletion, I do think, if one looks closely enough, this is being fueled by xenophobes who don't like to see the accomplishments of ethnic minorities listed or highlighted in any way. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStudierMalMarburg_d798.html" title="User:StudierMalMarburg">StudierMalMarburg</a> 22:09, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I will admit that this article does need to be "cleaned up," and I have been working on that.

<li><b>Comment</b>: ugh. For one thing, grotesquely prolix, and ludicrous in the way it drops names. Quote: <span style="color:#000; background-color:#dfd">... in 1964 she briefly migrated to Los Angeles instead, following the destiny of another friend, Zekial Marko, a pulp fiction writer. Marko’s work, though totally unnoticed in the land of his birth, had somehow become serious fiction in France. Thanks to this, he was asked to write a film for a young French actor called Alain Delon in order to introduce him to an American audience. The result was the rather poor “Once A Thief” [3] directed by Ralph Nelson (who’d just made Father Goose with Gary Grant and Lilies of the Field with Sidney Poitier). It starred Jack Palance, Ann-Margaret, Van Heflin, Tony Musante, and John Davis Chandler. It also featured Longfellow, her first and last appearance in film. Again from her radio interview, she said the experience taught her acting was not to her taste, mainly because it was so dependent on the taste, actions, and "meddling" of others. As Jack Palance said to her while he whiled away the tedious hours between shots: “This is no job for real artists”</span> (plus markup). This one reeks of va -- of, ah, <i>conflict of interest.</i> It's full of fascinating (or not) little asides that aren't backed up, probably couldn't be backed up, and don't look as if they're worth the effort of backing up. It's an embarrassment. (Can promotion by/of/for somebody who's clearly articulate and intelligent be so shameless? Then again, perhaps it's a joe job.)

<li><b>Keep</b> I wrote it. I did try to follow what I'd read in the articles of other writers. The first coment is that there is so much name-dropping, and I can see that person's point. The problem is, this writer has been there and done that so much, it was hard not to name drop. If it would make things better, I could drop the movie paragraph because I can see it might be too much. I can't back up everything I've written, not by quoting published articles, but so much of what I've learned is taken from English radio and television documentaries. Is it really so terribly written? I admit that hurts a bit. But I do want to learn. I've googled a lot and more is coming out on this writer all the time. Perhaps I could work on it again. Or perhaps someone could take a red marker to it. There's someone else contributing, but I started the article (I admit, I am a fan), I take the blame for it being "terrible". But really, I am sure it shouldn't be deleted just because I did a a bad job since it meets wiki's criteria for an article. Shanalk 00:53, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: It may be hard not to name-drop. Well, try harder. Look, here's something that's quoted above and that is still in the article: <span style="color:#000; background-color:#dfd">The result was the rather poor “Once A Thief” [3] directed by Ralph Nelson (who’d just made Father Goose with Gary Grant and Lilies of the Field with Sidney Poitier).

The fact that <i>Once a Thief</i> starred all those people can be explained in an article on it (if it's worth an article, and since it's "rather poor" perhaps it is not worth one).

<li><b>Comment</b>: I've now trimmed it quite a bit. There's still a load of ho-hum biographical stuff that, if it's worth keeping, needs precise sourcing. What do I mean by ho-hum? Well, before meeting Stanshall she spent a lot of time in various places, meeting various people, but I don't see that what she was doing for most of this time was any more significant than what most people do. Can we skip the filler and just get the highlights? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 16:44, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> All artists, scientists, musicians, writers, etc. have a life before they make whatever it is they make. People find that interesting. If a person ends up doing something notable, then what they did before, or what influenced them, is of interest, at least to me. I'd like to know how they got there. That's what biographies are for. There are many writers here, some with long articles, some with short ones, a lot with unreferenced materials, many with quotes and accolades. I know, I've been reading them to understand what is wrong with my effort. Who wouldn't be disappointed when there is only a list of their books, discoveries, albums, included? You say ho-hum biographical stuff. Because you are not interested in this artist? Or any artist? Or only particular artists? I don't want to read about many of the notable people included on wikipedia, so I don't bother. But if I do want to read about them, I want to know some of these, to you, ho hum, details. I can understand your earlier comments about name dropping, but not cutting out real biographical material. Shanalk 00:00, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a fair question. It's possible that I've viewed this article with excessive coolth, prompted by its initial extravagances. First, there's a question about the status of this biographical material. Typically (although not necessarily), material about somebody's life while they were little known comes from that person. But in WP it must first be filtered through a source not controlled by that person. So we can't cite a web page written or controlled by KL, but we can cite the book <i>Ginger Geezer</i> even where the latter is doing little more than recycling what KL said. This requirement may knock out a lot of what's written here. Secondly, let's suppose that we have sufficiently independent evidence to assert that, say, KL spent a year in Paris, Nice, and elsewhere in Europe. Because it's a whole year, it's something that's probably worth saying even without any obvious reason; still, a good article might attempt to explain what effect this year had on KL, whether in the short or the long term. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:44, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Comment</i> Thank you, Hoary, for listening to me, and even more for hearing me. I shall work harder on making this a proper wiki article, using points about the writer's life that influenced her work. This is my first article and I have other artists I would like to include. This discussion is proving invaluable to me for any future articles. I would also like to work on already existing articles that I feel are not "right" now that I've learned quite a bit discussing what is wrong with this first article.Shanalk 15:49, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>Comment</i> Does this interesting discussion mean that the deletion notice will be removed from this article? If so, will it be soon? I've checked around among other articles that have still this tag, no discussion, and are months old. I'm hoping an active ultimately favorable number of Keeps will allow the delete tag to disappear.Shanalk 21:23, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Attempted explanation</b> You've asked at least two questions here. First, while I don't want to prejudge a decision that should be made by somebody else (somebody who hasn't participated), it does look likely that there'll be a "keep" verdict. If/when that happens, three changes will be made more or less simultaneously: the person deciding it will mark this discussion as finished, will remove the deletion-discussion notice from the article, and will add a comment to the article's talk page saying that the article survived AfD. There's no reason to push this. However, some discussions such as this do fall through the cracks, as it were; if you, I or some other participant here thinks this has happened, the normal thing to do is to contact some administrator who hasn't participated in the discussion. The other articles that still have this tag but are months old: you could mean any of several things by this; if you name one or more of the articles in a message on my talk page, then I'll take a look at them and get back to you. But let's not discuss them here. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 02:10, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable beauty pageant. Part of a "series" by User:Mtoa (stands for "miss teen of america"). Links to blogs, a general link to some pageantry magazine. All blatant advertizing.

<li><b>weak keep</b> Though it seems unnotable now, her early appearances were notable at the time, and thus remain notable for our purposes. Better sources till needed, tho it isn't easy for that sort of thing so far back.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>: That there could be an online source forty years down the road from her principal fame is marginally impressive. Come to that, though, there was an AfD that passed a few days ago on the sole strength that the subject made the cover of Playboy once, and this gal was in the mag twice, the main appearance being in the Sept. '68 issue. There's also a citation on the Stanford cite under corporate figures who attended (under her maiden name of Bowles) <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/wellspring/cgi-bin/company_browse_affiliation.pl?letter=a" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stanford.edu/group/wellspring/cgi-bin/company_browse_affiliation.pl?letter=a" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:34, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I would, however, like to contest the point that she was in the news only for taking off her clothes. She was in the news for taking off her clothes <i>in the 1960s in the United States</i> (yes, it was California, but still ...). Also, the fact that she merits a mention in <i>Time</i> 40 years after the peak of her fame suggests <i>some</i> lasting notability. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#PAPER</a> and we can always revisit the issue later on. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 06:48, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you suggesting that taking one's clothes off in the 60s in the US was more significant than doing so in the 90s in the US or in the 60s in France? If so, how? Also, I've looked at the links, but they really do little more than confirm that she took her clothes off and that she sells computer-generated artwork. I'm still underwhelmed. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:14, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And there is indeed nothing about which to be overwhelmed (or even regularly "whelmed"). Yes, she took her clothes off, but that's not all that happened and certainly not the relevant part. What's relevant is that she appeared in the news because of it and also in Playboy. And, yes, taking one's clothes off in the 1960s in the US was more significant than doing so in the 1990s in the US. Why? Because social norms were different then. I don't know about 1960s France, but someone taking their clothes off in France <i>now</i> probably wouldn't even get a mention in the local evening news (and rightly so), whereas the US media was captivated for over a week with a "<a href="../../../j/a/n/Janet_Jackson_4116.html" title="Janet Jackson">wardrobe malfunction</a>". Should she be in an encyclopedia based on her 1960s stripping? That's the wrong question to ask. Should she be in the encyclopedia because of the news coverage and her Playboy appearances? Yes. And again, if she is noted in <i>Time</i> magazine 40 years after her disrobing, that seems to suggest some lasting notability. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 17:29, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Most of the information on the page is clearly not notable, but I think we need to consider the possibility that the order, as an entity, may be notable. Seeing nothing on the page to establish notability right now, I'm a <b>weak delete</b>, but if somebody who actually knows something about this subject (unlike me) wants to edit the article into something else (a history of the order, any important effects the order has had on Philippine society, and the like) I could certainly be persuaded to change my vote.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcasticidealist_b731.html" title="User:Sarcasticidealist">Sarcasticidealist</a> 22:39, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As the article's author, I have no qualms about making the deletion painless by tagging this {{db-author}}. The former redirect, I guess List of Paring Bol-anon will serve its purpose the best, as a link to the article <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese_of_Tagbilaran_6e7c.html" title="Diocese of Tagbilaran">Diocese of Tagbilaran</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohol.html" title="Bohol">Bohol</a> and the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immaculate_Heart_of_Mary_Seminary_d6c9.html" title="Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary">Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary</a>. Furthermore, I am certain that this present article will find its best place in the Cebuano Wikipedia. I will appreciate a message in my talk page giving me the go signal to tag it db-author!

<li>- Originally, I thought it to be pointless to list a source around the plot summary -- for it would obviously be based off of its specified chapter. I know that making individual chapter articles off of a novel is rather strange to Wikipedia's norms, but I believe such actions could easily make this foundation be seen as a more creative society. You would think it to be rather strange, but won't it make Wikipedia a greater place within the end? All the information within each individual plot summary is word-for-word with my own knowledge (excluding a few quotes) and is thus liable information to be told. I could however make it slightly more organized and creative by organizing the info within bold headline titles -- such an action would make the information more organized and is thus probably recommended. Thus, to avoid any problems, I will specify the exact page numbers that the plot summary is based from.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, you could say that my chapter articles could be used as external informational links to each character within the Fengshen Yanyi characters category. If these chapters remained in existance, I could take every character and organize them into a few different character list article (such as "officials of the Shang Dynasty", or "Superiormen of Fengshen Yanyi"). Within each biography, I could say a general amount of information, and then provide bold subtitles of the characters' specific actions that will lead to a chapter; Thus chapter articles could combine "trivial" information with general information that is wanted by Wikipedia. Thus, these actions will make Wikipedia more creative and will combine information with Wikipedia's standards, and the want of the people. <a href="../../../t/a/t/User%7ETathagata_Buddha_0135.html" title="User:Tathagata Buddha">User:Tathagata Buddha</a>, 10 March 2007 (EST)</p>

<li><b>Delete all</b> The book itself is extremely notable, but this level of detail is a bit much. What's more, each article itself is disjointed - going to one article (via random article, for instance) I would have no idea whatsoever what it was talking about, and I'd likely stick a speedy delete on the page. I strongly suggest the creator either userfy these pages, see if Wikibooks would find them appropriate, or create his own website. The information really is valuable, but it's both too detailed and too disjointed for Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 20:22, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Even if so, these chapter articles could be used as a source of trivial information that may wish to be known. For example, see <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_Kiba_78ae.html" title="Characters of Kiba">Characters of Kiba</a>; this is a grand example of an unorganized - far too uncategorized article. My objective is to take a page like this, trim down it's information, and basicly you could say transfer it to external articles (such as a chapter article in this case). For example, I could take every character currently within the Fengshen Yanyi character category and put them into a few different mass article pages, such as "Offficials of the Shang Dynasty" and "Superiormen of Fengshen Yanyi". After telling a certain amount of general information for each character based from each specific plotline (or chapter in this case), I could label the corresponding chapter within parenthesis.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><b>Su Daji</b> Su Daji is a major character featured within Investiture of the Gods who has contributed greatly to the Shang Dynasty's fall. Throughout Daji's many torture devices, the Bronze Toaster (6) would be her first creation. The Snake Pit, and the Meat Forest (17) would be her additional creations throughout the course of the novel.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thus, instead of rambling on amount information that is "trivial", but yet needed in order for an individual to completely understand the plotline, the chapter articles could serve as information containers. As of the moment, my Category:Fengshen Yanyi characters is rather unorganized and generally says information that is already said within my chapter articles. Thus, by keeping these chapter articles alive, far more organization within the Fengshen Yanyi characters could be achieved and "trivial" information could be at a set base, while "general" information is at another base. Even if it is not seemingly right to have chapter articles within this foundation, it will avoid overcrowdment and will instill creative organization; and I thus believe they should be contined. However, if the chapters are still linkable from wikipedia to wikibooks, then I will conclude that such an action could be acceptable. <a href="../../../t/a/t/User%7ETathagata_Buddha_0135.html" title="User:Tathagata Buddha">User:Tathagata Buddha</a>, 11 March 2007 (EST)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Adding a delete vote would be gilding the lily, so I'll just confine myself to these remarks. I appreciate that you think Wikipedia ought to be more creative, but what Wikipedia is is an encyclopedia. We all want "creative" encyclopedias like we want "creative" telephone books or "creative" computer instruction manuals. These entries would have no place in a telephone book or in a computer instruction manual, and they have none here. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:39, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>As the original author of the article, I <b>oppose</b> the nomination with the following considerations: the subject is legitimately noteworthy as may be seen from the citations in the text. That she is a popular entertainer is borne out by her fan base and her notoriety in her own country (Holland). Will she be as famous as Madonna or even the Numa Numa guy, who knows? The subject is a project in the works - maybe we should place a "current events" notice instead of a deletion notice! And another thing: More proof of her fan base is here - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfSWCbUSd_o" class="external free" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfSWCbUSd_o" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfSWCbUSd_o</a> Is this fan devotion or what? <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVerne_Equinox_8d35.html" title="User:Verne Equinox">Verne Equinox</a> 16:17, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Most internet memes, even the ones that get some news coverage, do little except maybe get some people to put up fansites. This one is actually getting record companies seriously interested.

<li><b>Neutral</b>. Jessica Lee Rose (lonelygirl15) was up for deletion as well. The wiki community chose to keep her bio. Geriatric1927 also has his bio on wiki for six months now. Ms. Denter's is currently the 18th most subscribed to person and is the 41st most watched person ever on YouTube - all achieved solely on her own merit in 6 months. One of her original songs "Anything is Possible" is the most watched (over 1.4 million times) songs of any unsigned recording artists on YT. She's been watched nearly 10 million times. She is referenced on over 90,000 places on the web (google her). Is it unusual to have <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Mann_91f2.html" title="Billy Mann">Billy Mann</a> a top 10 rated U.S. record producer travel to a small town in the Netherlands to meet a and sign a non-native english speaking R&amp;B YouTube singer? Even the record labels are reportedly puzzled over the metrics of measuring notability of popular artists emerging from their bedrooms online. Heck, even KrucialKeys (Krucial Brothers and Alicia Keys) are reaching out to connect with their fan base with homemade video interviews (something Ms. Denters has an apparent handle on). Ms. Denters has been the subject of at least 14 known Dutch newspaper articles (all the leading ones included), has been on at least 4 major Dutch TV shows (the dutch fans also translate and subtitle the shows for us non-dutch speaking folks), on Dutch radio, gets a major Reuters/Billboard article written about her and her plans in the music biz, etc. Not just an article on the internet, but then to have this non-english speaking YouTube singer find herself on the cover of BillBoard Magazine, March 3rd, as the inset story? Kelly Rowland formerly of Destiny's Child even had Ms. Denters record one of Ms. Rowland's new songs she wrote. This may be Ms. Denters’ first single release (speculating). However, my opinion is just that Ms. Denters has caused a laser sharp focus in the music business in regards to the metrics of popularity and the transformation to record sales and distribution methods. All that said, I half-heartly agree with the wiki editors that the article should be considered for deletion - but not because of her notability, just because I think the article is premature and there is scant evidence on the actual mark on history she may have. I guess it comes down to what is notable vs. what is popular - I leave that to you folks. I just wanted to respond with some of the facts about Ms. Denters’ 6 month career.

<li><b>keep</b> Issues directly related to race and ethnicity are not "arbitrary specificity". At the heart of this lies very serious issues.

<li>
<ul>
<li>If the la times could write an article about this, then it shows that this is a very critical aspect and not some arbitrary characteristic. The article further mentions the changes that the movie industry is going through. without the history of movies in Africa, one may not appreciate the significance of films like <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotel_rwanda.html" title="Hotel rwanda">hotel rwanda</a> or even understand why <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_Whitaker_75e7.html" title="Forest Whitaker">Forest Whitaker</a> won an oscar for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Last_King_of_Scotland_%28film%29_0f69.html" title="The Last King of Scotland (film)">The Last King of Scotland (film)</a>.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> notability is permanent, just because this show is old doesn't mean we shouldn't have a page on it. Also Betty White is a huge figure in the history of televsion. Also what Jeff said about the awards makes this show notable.

<li>Unattributed does not mean unnatributable. Almost all of this can be taken from the show itself without resorting to OR. The OR that should be removed is "(hence the title)."

<li><b>Comment</b>. How would you do that? Sorry, I'm still a newbie at this kind of stuff...Its not very easy to find a lot of info on this show, without it either being a post saying "IT SUCKED. YEAH...", or anything. I'm trying the best I can to get this article done. It truly WAS cancelled by Game Show Network because it was considered tasteless, with particulary bad jokes, and especially disrespectful ones...I do believe one of those heads said that it was cancelled due to "high demand".

<li><b>Keep</b> - I added the first realiable source reference I could find. It's from Time Magazine, which is the only searchable, free news archive that's any good that I know of. It's going to be hard to find info about this game show, but not impossible. Let it live. If I have to cite a guideline, I guess it's that Notability is permanent. If famous newspapers didn't charge to search their archives, I'd ref it a bunch right now.

<li><b>Keep</b> - if English clubs are notable down to Level 10, I see no reason why Portuguese clubs are not at Level 3 (or possibly several layers lower). - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 16:28, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Mr Rundle. The Portuguese league, whilst not up there with the Premiership or La Liga, is still a strong league, so I'd say that a club just two levels lower should be notable. The article does need some serious work, though - you can understand why someone would look at the minuscule amount of info here and assume non-notability...... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 21:46, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a>: it's a level-3 team. Anyway, a lack of English-language sources is not a reason to delete the article. I could suggest linking any Portuguese sources in an "External links" section along with {{<a href="../../../p/t/_/Template%7EPt_icon_88b3.html" title="Template:Pt icon">pt icon</a>}}, then tagging the article for translation per {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotenglish_072b.html" title="Template:Notenglish">notenglish</a>}}, and finally describing the situation on the talk page. This is, however, not the actual intended use of {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotenglish_072b.html" title="Template:Notenglish">notenglish</a>}}, so whether anyone chooses to do this is up to h(er|im). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 07:24, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - my basic rule of thumb for notability for a club is they are notable if they participate regularly in their respective national association's senior cup (this is where the level 10 rule for English clubs is derived from). Based on <a href="http://www.rsssf.com/tablesp/portcuphistfull.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rsssf.com/tablesp/portcuphistfull.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> that is clearly the case for this club, so it should stay. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 17:40, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The way to fix excessive trivia in articles is to prune it, not to split it out into articles which are entirely composed of trivia. I absolutely love Carmina Burana and can sing much of it fomr memory, and I grew up with the Old Spice advert, but this is still just a collection of cruft which got too big for the article and should have been hacked down to size. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 10:52, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> As the original author of the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmina_Burana_%28Orff%29_1a54.html" title="Carmina Burana (Orff)">Carmina Burana (Orff)</a> article, I can tell you that scarcely a day goes by without more people adding on to this Pop Culture list. It scarcely existed in the original article and look at it now. I've tried to cut it back several times even deleting most of it before, but it becomes a daunting dask. Everything is always uncited, and formatted differently, and it's hard to tell what's notable and what's not. Personally, I'd rather preserve the information in some form, but get it the hell out of the main article. At least, it'd be nice to set some kind of precedent with what to do with this information when it's actually in the article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkBuckles_4300.html" title="User:MarkBuckles">MarkBuckles</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkBuckles_11a7.html" title="User talk:MarkBuckles">(talk)</a> 08:50, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(Copied from my <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard|Talk Page</a>) Hi, you cleaned up part of the article, however, I feel that the rest of it is little more than lore and next to impossible to source. even ignoring the language, reading it gives good hints. the Pedro and Ines affair has been the subject of a lot of writing, most of it heavy on the fiction...that's why I nominated it for deletion. <a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalf_4119.html" title="User:Galf">Galf</a> 08:49, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The fiction can be sourced as fiction. It is reasonable to say "According to legend..." as long as the story is properly characterized as legend and there is a verifiable source for the legend. I'm sure one can be found if someone digs around. Lack of sourcing is not a reason for deletion. What we should be trying to do is make sure that this isn't just a legend that someone made upon their own and inserted into Wikipedia for fun. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 15:32, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, the article hints at the sources.
<dl>
<dd>The love of Pedro and Inês, has survived through the centuries in the works of authors such as <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cam%C3%B5es.html" title="Camões">Camões</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Hugo_5093.html" title="Victor Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>, <a href="../../../e/z/r/Ezra_Pound_79cc.html" title="Ezra Pound">Ezra Pound</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stendhal.html" title="Stendhal">Stendhal</a> or Agustina Bessa-Luis.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>All that's left is for someone to go find the specific works in which the legend is mentioned. (Unless, of course, this is a hoax.) --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 15:36, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The legend is based on historical fact (see <a href="../../../i/n/%C3%AA/In%C3%AAs_de_Castro_9b1e.html" title="Inês de Castro">Inês de Castro</a>). What remains to be done is to prove that Quinta das Lagrimas is connected to the legend (I think <a href="http://atelier.hannover2000.mct.pt/~pr029/quinta.htm" class="external text" title="http://atelier.hannover2000.mct.pt/~pr029/quinta.htm" rel="nofollow">the website</a> is sufficient), resolve the copyvio issues and source the works of the authors (Hugo, Pound, Stendahl). --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 15:57, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'd like to point out that the addition to the <a href="../../../i/n/%C3%AA/In%C3%AAs_de_Castro_9b1e.html" title="Inês de Castro">Inês de Castro</a> article was done by the same user that created the <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quinta_das_L%C3%A1grimas_7a4e.html" title="Quinta das Lágrimas">Quinta das Lágrimas</a> article [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=In%C3%AAs_de_Castro&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87515940" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=In%C3%AAs_de_Castro&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87515940" rel="nofollow">diff</a>] and here [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_I_of_Portugal&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87516114" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_I_of_Portugal&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87516114" rel="nofollow">diff</a>]. Plus the Hannover website was published by a secondary school and lists the said hotel as one of the sources [<a href="http://atelier.hannover2000.mct.pt/~pr029/fontes.htm" class="external text" title="http://atelier.hannover2000.mct.pt/~pr029/fontes.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>]. Hardly what I would call reputable, which leaves us on the same problem once again, the only information comes from the hotel itself. Which leaves us at the same point and convinces me once again this is nothing more than spam. The literary references are also extremly vague, the Pedro-Ines affair is well known, but HEAVILY covered in lore. The article now has 3 lines on the farm and the rest of the article covers the affair... <a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGalf_4119.html" title="User:Galf">Galf</a> 08:08, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../i/n/%C3%AA/In%C3%AAs_de_Castro_9b1e.html" title="Inês de Castro">Inês de Castro</a> and <b>Redirect</b> Galf has a good point that the current article has very little on the farm/hotel and is now mostly about the affair which is covered in the <a href="../../../i/n/%C3%AA/In%C3%AAs_de_Castro_9b1e.html" title="Inês de Castro">Inês de Castro</a> article.</dd>
<dd>There's no problem with Wikipedia covering lore provided that the lore is notable. However, the article is now more about the Pedro-Ines legend than about the hotel/farm. We should merge it back into the Ines article and redirect this title to the Ines article. I think the hotel is worth mentioning in Wikipedia because of the connection to the legendbut it does not merit a separate article unless someone can add additional details that are encyclopedic rather than advertising. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 20:50, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reference to the Hotel should not have been deleted. The last time I visited the place was 20 years ago, and to suggest the place to foreign friends, reference to the hotel is important. Having accomodations in such a beautiful place is important information.</p>

<p>First off: a prod was on this, and removed because the creator of the article claimed it was "vandalism". Anyway: this is pure fancruft. Lots of movies have special effects, Lord of the Ring being a popular series doesn't make this any more notable. Put this on a fan wiki, not Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 11:08, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - Bad faith nomination. <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> was an enormous production and it already has two subpages on the Production Design and Principal Photography to help the main article cope with the mountain of information. This article is fully referenced by the DVD and is not fancruft. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki-newbie_efab.html" title="User:Wiki-newbie">WikiNew</a> 11:20, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Bad faith? Wrong. My opinion isn't bad faith. If you want to talk about bad faith: removing a prod by calling it "vandalism" is bad faith.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Film articles generally have information about special effects in the production section, and it's standard procedure to break off if you have too much information. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 18:48, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This meets notability requirements by policy. The effects of the films were ground-breaking and award winning and were the subject of many reliable publications and articles. I wish we could ban "cruft" from deletion arguments, especially from nominations. It's a lazy derogatory argument that means little more than "I don't like it" and does nothing to indicate non-notability. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 13:15, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Per Canley. and <s><small>per, uh... it's unsigned, but timestamped, so keep</small></s> because it's clearly notable for inclusion in the film page, and large enough to break into its own. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutocracy_4fe0.html" title="User:Autocracy">Autocracy</a> 18:44, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as it is a long and well-referenced subarticle of the LOTR article. —<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisavian_2333.html" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDisavian_f80f.html" title="User talk:Disavian"><sup>talk</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Disavian_e056.html" title="Special:Contributions/Disavian"><sub>contribs</sub></a>) 03:24, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Let's see, I know I saw more than a few mini-documentaries describing how the special effects in this series of movies were created. And I didn't even pay attention to them, but I know they exist. So I'm satisfied that this is notable, and given that it is three movies produced in the same time frame, I'd say covering their special effects in one article is quite convenient and handy. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:59, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Also: Category:Brothers in Arms characters</li>
</ul>
<p>This set of articles covers the main and support characters in the <i><a href="../../../b/r/o/Brothers_in_Arms_9971.html" title="Brothers in Arms">Brothers in Arms</a></i> series. Individual characters are not notable enough for their own articles and lack reliable sources that are not in-universe. These articles are little more than a collection of what happens in the game to each character, which often overlaps and should already be covered in the game articles. I would merge, but considering the length of the article name and non-standard rank usage, it's unlikely that anyone will input the whole title for a merge. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd"><b><font color="#00CC00">Scottie_theNerd</font></b></a> 11:51, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Further comments: Clearly, these articles have been hastily put together by one person without realising the significant overlap of each article. Also considering the names are practically unsearchable due to the use of rank, name and nickname (never presented all together in the game) and the creation of a category just for these characters, I don't see much merit in keeping, merging or even redirecting these. As mentioned above, some of these characters are barely notable in the games, let alone as standalone Wikipedia articles. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd"><b><font color="#00CC00">Scottie_theNerd</font></b></a> 12:10, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge/Redirect</b> I can accept that individual articles may not be appropriate, however, having information on these characters is somewhat desirable. Even if it's unlikely somebody would use the whole title, it's not impossible, and it doesn't cause a real problem, it might even prevent more in the future. So, make a page Characters in the Brothers in Arms Video game series or whatever you want to call it, and merge there. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:24, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That doesn't address that notability issue. Most of the characters are one-off and have little development beyond what's in the game manuals. Compiling them into one article doesn't make them any more notable, and there are no independent sources. Wikipedia isn't a fansite, and therefore should not be storing in-universe information without any encyclopedic value. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd"><b><font color="#00CC00">Scottie_theNerd</font></b></a> 17:04, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not really an issue for me, since the games themselves are notable, and if there's not enough information to make a characters page, I'd be comfortable with redirecting to one on just the individual game. I really don't care if there's an article on the characters or not, but the game's article should at least describe the characters in it. I don't insist on independent sources for simple biographical information. Now if say, one of those characters got compared to Jesus, that would be something for which an external reference would be needed. Otherwise, if it's in the game or the manuals, I'm satisfied that it can be sourced.. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:23, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Could you explain what you think is useful about the article? Just because something is true and can be sourced doesn't mean it should be included in Wikipedia. My main point is that the info about name etymology belongs in the articles about the bands.

<dd>Obviously is a mathematician in a somewhat specialized sense, even if that is the closest word to describe him.I might choose "numerologist" The general idea behind the N rules for academics is more N than most of the others in the field, and this is not a field where the ordinary sort of publications and faculty positions seem to be applicable. The standards that apply are the ones in this special subject. It further is obviously afield with different groups, who consider their group N, and not the other guys, so selecting any one is inherently POV. This is not that uncommon in some non-science areas. I do not see how BLP is relevant--he meets BLP. Based on what is being said, <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 08:26, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> because there are obviously factions involved, and choosing between them would be POV. If someone is opposed by what seems to be a POV faction, that makes a <i>very</i> good argument for keeping it. <i>NPOV applies to choice of articles as well as to what is said in them.</i> <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 08:26, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm afraid your argument is not making a whole lot of sense to me, DGG. Just because a non-notable researcher is part of a faction does not make him notable. Not having a bio for every non-notable researcher is not POV. Also, I don't see at all why the subject is "obviously afield" with groups that consider other groups non-notable. It seems to me even <i>obvious</i> that those with particular POVs are well aware of who the big players on the opposing sides are. Just as obviously, not everyone is going to be a big player. How is your argument (whatever it is) related to the notability of the subject? For example, how does the existence of factions change your earlier statement about requiring some reviews or significant mentions of his research for notability? --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 10:37, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not sure whether Rotenberg's name "appears alongside Eliyahu Rips" because Rotenberg is such an influential figure himself, or whether there is a large dose of self-promotion here (by User: Iser.unl). I think any claims to notability because of reasons like "I know Rips" or "I worked with Rips" ought to be viewed skeptically.

<li>I was asked for my <b>opinion</b>. I don't want to vote on this. Rotenberg is a small player in the Torah codes business. People familiar with the Israeli codes community know of him. Mostly he is known because of one example about the sons of Haman. He isn't mentioned in the books of Katz and Satinover that claim to trace the history of the codes. His book, which I have, shows "Lavi P. Enterprises" as a distributor not a publisher, so I guess it is true that the book is self-published. A large part of the article appears in that book or on its cover. I couldn't locate any mathematical publications of his in <i>Mathematical Reviews</i> unless he is the "A.R. Rotenberg" who published in Russian in the 1970s. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKay_32b8.html" title="User:McKay">McKay</a> 02:43, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm curious what DGG means when he says "The general idea behind the N rules for academics is more N than most of the others in the field …" Doesn't this imply a sort of relativism that would <i>automatically</i> make a "notable" person out of the lone "researcher" in a "field" that nobody else in the world views as meaningful?

<dd>If you mean, why should he have been listed as such for deletion sorting purposes: Because the first thing the article says about him is that he's a mathematician, and someone whose primary identification is as a mathematician is generally a type of academic. And because even if he's that rare kind of mathematician who's not a really an academic, he still is reasonably likely to be of interest to the Wikipedians who watch that deletion sorting category. But if you mean, why should he be evaluated according to <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> rather than <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, I don't know, because I'm not convinced he should be. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 05:31, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Factions-. In any field,there's a certain tendency to consider the people who agree with us more important than the other guys, who by definition have a lesser understanding of the subject or else we'd be on their side. Thats why there's a bias that needs correction. I don't say it happens always, but a determined effort to judge a particularly idiosycratic scholar NN is at least capable of being based on COI. If he is a leading exponent of his position, he's N. And if he were the only exponent of his position, yes, he would be all the more N. And if he were the only worker on the subject, and the subject were encyclopedia-worthy for intrinsic or popular interest, he would be N. I accept DavidCBryant's logic. If he were the lone worker in it, he would be N. if the field is N. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 07:42, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Notability is not subjective. The Flat Earth Society, living on our generally spherical earth, are a bunch of nutty, delusion kooks spouting banana talk, but they are worthy of an article because they are written about in multiple, independent reliable sources, and not because they go against the flow of sanity. Likewise, the notability of one of a small group of exponents of flat earth belief is judged based on his own write up in multiple, independent... and not because the field of adherents of that belief is small.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 12:42, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

That there may be some vanity involved in his creation of the article may make some think less of him as a human being, I don't think that in itself can justify the deletion. <a href="../../../s/e/m/User_talk%7ESemperf_0e01.html" title="User talk:Semperf"><font color="#008000"><b><i>semper fictilis</i></b></font></a> 14:43, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Advanced Chess appears to be the name used by a very small group to describe computer-assisted chess. Of the few references cited, at least one calls it ocmputer-assisted chess, not Advanced Chess. A measure of its significance is that the Advanced Chess Association uses a free webhost and does not even have its own domain name. The article seems to be written form personal knowledge, and is essentially unreferenced save for the aforementioned associations. This should either be significantly rewritten, referenced and moved to computer-assisted chess, or deleted. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 15:19, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> interesting list and certainly source-able. That it needs improvement isn't a reason for deletion.

<li>But many of them are *not*. Stephen Avenue in Calgary is just an extremely busy pedestrian mall - half the storefronts on it are things like falafel stands, music stores, Winners, donair houses, etc., etc. There are a few high-class shops but they're in between the law offices and Vietnamese noodle shops.

<li><b>Keep</b> nom says "No criteria for inclusion" although that must be clear from the title, and the fact that many of the streets have their own articles supports the implicit claim of notability, and "unverifiable"--much of this is fairly objective and well-published information.

<li><b>Keep</b> People refer to expensive neighborhoods, and they mean neighborhoods with expensive houses; same with streets. There are true practical criteria--the real estate ad subculture, supported by the frequent articles in newspapers.

<li><b>Delete</b> There is no way properly define inclusion on the list, making it totally subjective and unusable. How would it even be possible to calculate the value/price of a street? It wouldn't.

<li>Well, the Cushman &amp; Wakefield study actually <i>does</i> calculate the "most expensive" street in a mathematical way, by finding the average price per square foot of space on a street, and ranking streets based on that data. <a href="http://www.cushwake.com/cwglobal/jsp/newsDetail.jsp?repId=c7800055p&amp;LanId=EN&amp;LocId=GLOBAL" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cushwake.com/cwglobal/jsp/newsDetail.jsp?repId=c7800055p&amp;LanId=EN&amp;LocId=GLOBAL" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> Saying a street is the most expensive because it has the most expensive house/restaurant in a town is an original conclusion, and that stuff needs to go. I was careful that the sources I added actually claim a given street is the most expensive in a city. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 14:00, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But using another method of counting you would get a different result. There is no accurate way to measure the expensiveness of a street. Do you count the average cost per square meter or do you just pick the street with the highest total? Are we measuring the cost of renting space or actucally buying the buildings? Do we use the total value of all the buildings on the street or take the street with the single most expensive building? Saying which street is the most expensive is subjective and totally dependent on definition and method. That is why the list should be deleted.<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPax%7EVobiscum_3a44.html" title="User:Pax:Vobiscum">Pax:Vobiscum</a> 22:47, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is not really Wikipedia's problem, publications and research groups have put these studies out under their name, Wikipedia is really just organizing that information. If their methodology is suspect, people will question them... if people wrote articles questioning the studies, we could cite that. I admit it's a fine line, but researching this I found that <i>a lot</i> of articles are written about "expensive streets" (I had no idea) so I think there is a great deal of interest in this, and I think the information is verifiable. It isn't our job to make sure a source is true (within reason), we aren't investigative reporters. Wikipedia just looks for verifiability. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 23:02, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Oh yeah, I think this stance makes more sense when you consider I'd like to figure out some way to communicate that items on this list are merely <i>considered</i> the most expensive by our sources. Another subtle line, but an important one. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 23:06, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very weak delete</b>: I am convinced by the "keep" argument because it is reported on by sources, but I am leaning towards "delete" because there are not very strict requirements for inclusion on the list. I may live on the most expensive street in a city in central Illinois, but I certainly wouldn't put that street on the list. I may be swayed to keep if the phrasing of the article is improved upon. Is there a certain amount of money a street must stay above to be included on the list? Are cities of a certain size only included on the list? It needs to define its criteria. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangerer_d331.html" title="User:Strangerer">Strangerer</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerer_0525.html" title="User talk:Strangerer">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Strangerer_42fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Strangerer">Contribs</a>)</small> 01:36, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Doesn't and shouldn't "expense" refer to the cost of renting or buying on those streets?

Also, the nominator has withdrawn the nomination (albeit weakly). Lastly, whether researchers use different techniques is not a problem we have to fix: that would be original research. We simply report what's published.

<li><b>Keep</b> First of all, i want this submission to meet all the standards of WIKIPEDIA and would like some help putting it together before we think about deleting it. I have many sources of the artist, particularly all the newspaper, magazine, and other publications that prove his worthiness for inclusion. Sponsoring a historic tournament in the Athletic Club in NYC and having your work (and the only work of art) present for the entire event is also noteworthy. Many of the worlds top chess grandmasters collect his chess works, and the chess collection is 10% of his output. He has done an anatomy collection, mind collection, spiritual, and abstract collection. he also has over 200 paintings, some appraised as high as $50,000. The artist has sold works for as high as $10,000 and i also have that proof. In my opinion, this artist, through his knowledge of many aspects of life as shown in his entire body of work and the level of quality, deserves to be recognized on WIKIPEDIA. I had one fellow, an Air Force officer, email me to have him deleted. If we have people who aren't even aware of art or the art world and then without any research into the person, file them for deletion, then this is a flawed system. Air Force pilots judging the level of quality of an artist? Im sure Da Vinci (and i'm not saying Justin is a Da Vinci, but if you study all he's done, he is similiar in a modern way), who wasnt even known during his time, would have loved to hear a military person tell him he shouldnt be included in an encyclopedia. I find Justin Michael Jenkins to be as worthy as most living artists right now and i can back it up with many more documents.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi Alf, i have placed many links to support the documentation already. What exactly do the wikipedians need to see. If i visited the artists page as it is now, it would seem to me he is definitely on the rise and worthy of inclusion. Just being Susan Polgar's full time artist/designer should be enough. That makes him already of a high credibility? Creating a biography/article for an artist is rather tough considering the bias and broad idea of what it takes to get into this encyclopedia. Thanks, Mike Retla</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Hi Tyrenius, would you help me get Justin on WIKIPEDIA? Between me and you i can send you documents to support why he should be on. I would even provide you with a phone number to reach me at to talk about his possible inclusion.

<li><b>weak keep</b> Still needs some improvements--there should be more selectivity--winning a 6th grade art prize isn't notable, and a description of developing style based on your own personal knowledge is OR--perhaps you can find one to cite. Each of the prizes and so on needs an exact citation, not just the name of the newspaper. This is within the range that can be made encyclopedic.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi DGG, i am trying to put together everything for his inclusion. How do i place links to a newspaper, magazine, and other article? Do i scan each one in and upload a photo? Yes, i agree the 6th grade thing is weak (LOL) but i am trying to make it interesting , like a timeline, but i will try to cut back and focus more on the critical and important material. I am not even close to being done yet. IN fact, it goes as far as 1989, and he was only 18 at the time. IF i make a list of what he ahs done can anyone help put this together. I am not the best writer of biographies for encyclopedias. Thanks for all your input and let me cross my fingers i can get him on here!!

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi Metropolitan90. Thank you for your input. I'm not sure about we he meant by thanks for all the good imagery given to WP, doe's that mean hes going to use it irresponsibly? I would hope not and i had no choice to do that although i would much prefer to keep the images just for this site. In terms of getting Justin on this site, i have absolutely no problem hearing from anyone , but at least research someone before stating the person is unacceptable to the wikipedia. I have checked stats that go to the artists website and no one has even clicked any links to visit and learn more about the artist. In the end, through the quality of work and hundreds of sources online that show what Justin has accomplished, i feel i can get him accepted. Hopefully everyone will help me and teach about how to make this more acceptable. If you use other articles from other comparable artists as role models then perhaps we can use their format to make Justin's presentation as nicely as theirs. I have found many artists on here with less credentials and with very little information , yet they are on here? Does knowing someone on the inside help get on here? These are interesting questions and i intend on fighting every step of the way to get him accepted and using various examples. I hope others will help me or at least show some support (:. Thanks for your time, Mike Retla.

<li>I don't think DGG meant to imply an intention to use the images "irresponsibly;" however, perhaps you should read the article on the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> closely, just so you know what rights you've given up. The images are now licensed under the GDFL, and are no longer your property, and you can't control how they'll be used. Also, I just wanted to point out that the artist's website itself is not the kind of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">independent source</a> we're looking for to establish notability, so gauging hits there probably won't give you an accurate idea of what research people might be doing. —<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolfrog_505f.html" title="User:Carolfrog">Carolfrog</a> 00:39, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi Tyrenius, after reviewing dozens of artists biographies on wikipedia, i have begun to mold the article in a similiar fashion as theirs. I am not trying to blatantly promote him, just give him credit in a nice article. By the way, we are not friends, but we have worked together and i feel he should be given a chance to be on wikipedia. I would also like to point out that any article or biography on wikipedia is a form of promotion to some degree. You are "promoting" the person by given them a proper article discussing what they have accomplished. I have also began to change the internal links to the wikipedia areas rather than link outside the artivle (my mistake at first - i thought they wanted external links within the article). In terms of reliable sources, linking to direct newspaper articles and other resources that further confirm my points is the wrong way? I am a bit surprised you think this is a self promotional article? I thought writinga biography about an artist was done along these lines after reviewing other artists pages. <b>Also, does wikipedia have editors you can hire to write up biographies and articles? - I would hire someone to help me make this acceptable</b> Thanks, Mike Retla --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael144_6432.html" title="User:Michael144">Michael144</a> 07:59, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

In terms of the WIKIPEDIA standards, i am learning and do not find this write up that bad as compared to others i have read and researched on here for artists. So perhaps your bias?

I had originally written these in separate points, but my points have subsequently been combined with those of another user (User:121.6.154.98) and summed up as above.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It was a real phenomenon, like it or not. Needs cleanup, not deletion. No valid reason for deletion sited, as I don't see how this reads like an advertisement. Despite claims of nominator the article doesn't so much as mention the no-longer-active Web site. It's actually reasonably well done for an article on an internet meme. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 22:40, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> You know, when I went to the article, I was expecting a huge, unmaintainable list of examples of dumb "facts," but what I found instead was a concise, fairly well-written article with only one or two examples here and there (a seemingly magical feat for an article of this kind). Plenty of coverage in multiple, non-trivial publications. This is a huge pop-culture phenomenon, not just a summary of one now-defunct website (which can be easily removed from the external links, if that's the problem). I'm actually not really sure why this has been nominated. Some of the statements could be sourced and the article could use a quick cleanup, but otherwise, I don't really see a problem. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 02:42, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> I see value in having a clickable title for <i>any</i> succession box and, in particular, succession boxes for NFL QBs.

<p>Response from Fredrick Pritchard:</p>
<p>First, I DID remove the previous tag placed on the page, in the belief that the article had been accepted. Apparently <a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKon-Tiki001_1156.html" title="User:Kon-Tiki001">User:Kon-Tiki001</a>, had placed the tag, but I replied on his/her talk page (Section: Autobiographies). I presented my arguments and appeal there. He replied, "Your article is probably an exception to the rule, and should in my opinion be allowed to stay." However, I will make efforts to provide sources, and carry out all above requests. Obviously, only someone who knows much about me in each area (composer, performer, theory, and education) would have a reasonably complete basis to act as an editor. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProf.rick_6928.html" title="User:Prof.rick">Prof.rick</a> 19:21, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Response to ERcheck</b> This is NOT salting! The above-named artists were first consulted, and were most enthusiastic regarding my contributions, and endorse my article 100%. Why not "wait and see" if these artists remove these edits...or else contact them yourself! (Greg's comments on the Fredrick Pritchard page would help verify this, had you not removed it.) [See Fredrick Pritchard History page.] Furthermore, I have only referenced myself in "Musical Notation" as a PUBLISHED composer. (Perhaps it would help to take an overview of said article, and recognize that this reference helps to "round out" concepts of musical notation.) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProf.rick_6928.html" title="User:Prof.rick">Prof.rick</a> 03:23, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Wikipedia articles did, but did not cite any sources. I was commenting on the personal websites of the artists, none of which contained any reference to you that I could fine.

<p>To <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">User:NBeale</a>: Thank you for changing "Strong Delete" to "Delete". Is another editor not notable if Wikipedia contains an article about him/her? Please refer to the article's talk page for "published sources", and also please check the References I have provided. (I could add more, but should the page be smothered with references?) Again, I regard this issue as not primarily about me, but about Wikipedia policies, and their interpretation.

I spent many hours researching the subject, and contributing to the page. The quote (to which I refer) is published and verifiable.

<p>Furthermore, I can hardly be accused of "salting" when all such edits were done with the approval and support of the subjects of the articles in question.

<p>This one is interesting... It is an article about a <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_holdout.html" title="Japanese holdout">Japanese holdout</a> who supposedly surrendered in the Philippines in 1980. The problems with this article are the lack of any verifiable material. A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=kY5&amp;q=%22Fumio+Nakahira%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=kY5&amp;q=%22Fumio+Nakahira%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> pulls up only one line mentions here and there, plus a bunch of Wikipedia mirrors. Other Japanese Holdouts who (verifiably) were found earlier than Fumio have fairly large ammounts of material on them online. "The most famous" one, <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiroo_Onoda_ed2b.html" title="Hiroo Onoda">Hiroo Onoda</a> who was found in 1974, had international media attention and a presidential pardon. If Fumio had been found a full six years later, how come nobody cared? How come there is practically zero information anywhere on this guy? The one external link goes to a website on holdouts, at <a href="http://www.wanpela.com/holdouts/" class="external free" title="http://www.wanpela.com/holdouts/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wanpela.com/holdouts/</a>. It is a good resource with plenty of info and archival photos on several notable holdouts, but Fumio gets just one line midway down <a href="http://www.wanpela.com/holdouts/registry.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wanpela.com/holdouts/registry.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a>. That there is a lot of mentions out there on Fumio suggests that he <i>may have</i> existed. That all the mentions don't have any kind of source of their own, and that there is so little information suggests that he never existed. <b>Keep</b> if we can conjur some verifiable sources, <b>delete</b> if we can't. --Jeffrey O.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The most convincing source I've found so far is the Philippines government home page for tourism <a href="http://www.tourism.gov.ph/explore_phil/place_details.asp?content=thingstodo&amp;province=20" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tourism.gov.ph/explore_phil/place_details.asp?content=thingstodo&amp;province=20" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, where he is mentioned. That is barely enough to think that it is not a hoax (other ghits seem to have been around since 2001 or earlier, too), but, perhaps not enough to meet WP:A. By the time 1980 rolled around, the novelty of Japanese holdouts was wearing off, so it is not such a surprise that the 1972 and 1974 events have garnered more attention. (And, the fact that Onoda was actively shooting people until shortly before his surrender also added to his infamy).<a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 05:39, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page has gone unreferenced since I called for valid references in January of 2006. Wikipedia requires that all articles be reference-able by published sources, not self published ones. So documentation by self published online "aquaphile journals" are okay external links but do not factor into the deletion for this article. My question is this: is there a published, valid source that can verify the use of the term "aquaphilia" as it is used on this page. I understand that this is a somewhat popular fetish, but attributability by published sources is policy on wikipedia, not guideline. In my own search using lexisnexis, Jstor and Google Scholar, I have found that there are scholarly articles related to aquatic erotica, but they never call it aquaphilia and have not termed it a sexual fetish, the information on the page is related to attributable things, but is itself unattributable to published source. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 18:50, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did full text searches for aquaphilia in journals, newspapers, books, and after quite a lot of time wasted I didn't find any articles that used aquaphilia to refer to anything sexual.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This material is significant, there are web sites, there are discussions. The sources may not be the conventional ones used in WP, but the fact that we cannot write an article about something we know to be significant without adjusting the rule here a little should cause us to adjust the rule. The established web journals in the field are bviously published by those involved in the fetish, but this does not necessarily make them unreliable. "Self-published" is probably not applicable in this case-- I do not see how material about a subject can be literally "self-published" as distinct from the usual meaning for material about and by a person.

<li>Welcome to wikipedia.

<dd>I can see how this brief mention of bathtub swimsuit photos as aquaphilia would change your vote from delete, but now how it would change it to keep. If only one published source mentions it and only incidentally, a full article cannot be built of it. A merge is acceptable, but to where?</dd>
<dd>That article is a primary source, and wikipedia articles require <i>some</i> secondary sources. Even if it were an analytical writing, the coverage of the topic is too incidental to prove notability. From wikipedia's notability guideline: <b>"Trivial, or incidental coverage of a subject by secondary sources is not sufficient to establish notability."</b> Therefore a book or a journal actually discussing aquaphilia that is published by outside sources would make this notable. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 22:20, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Notability is a guideline, not a policy, and is subject to common sense. So, what does your common sense say, can we fully attribute a complete article to a single sentence about someone's prosecution?<a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 22:39, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>names</b> In general,Primary literary or other media sources are sufficient to document a name for a type of behavior,and to document that this behavior is something which people either do or fantasize about. They by themsselves justify an article if the behavior is worth the description. For behavior with no established name but where a name has been reported in a single source, we can use it; if the ultimate name should change, the articles can be edited accordingly. Commonly used names can change no matter how many sources there might be.
<ul>
<li>The web journals report the fantasies of the authors, and are for this purposes as reliable as if in a more conventional medium. They would not be reliable to establish that some particular person had engaged in a particular form of behavior, but they are, to establish that it is something humans think about.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Recall that truth is not a wikipedia policy, attribution is, and attribution is defined as to published sources.

<li>The newspaper article reports on a lawsuit, and is therefore a secondary source, and a prima fascia reliable one. WP accepts newspaper accounts, and such documentation has been used throughout WP. It is sufficient to establish the name. <i>To call a newspaper report of a lawsuit a primary source is a novel suggestion indeed</i> and should first be discussed on the suitable policy page.</li>

<dd>It seems like you are endorsing using forums and self published websites for sources. If so it is you that needs to take your arguments to the attribution policy talk page. There is serious question to notability. As for using self published sources, the definition of a neologism is always contentious, and an article must not be based primarily on unreliable sources. Nobody has shown any other sources from which anyone could really base this article on. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 00:50, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Thanks to both of you for working on sourcing and rewriting this. The article now looks a lot more NPOV too. I'm still concerned that while this term can be sourced it is not widely used, as my web search found, and where it is used it is only by a few economists of a particular political POV (one of them is with the Independent Institute and the other the author of <i>White Man's Burden</i>). I still lean toward a weak <b>merge</b> with <a href="../../../l/u/d/Luddite.html" title="Luddite">Luddite</a> which would place the concept in broader context. But could go either way at this point. The concept appears real enough, just specific to a few economists and not widely used. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragomiloff_1fd6.html" title="User:Dragomiloff">Dragomiloff</a> 12:20, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The concept is indeed used only by economists of a particular point of view (namely neoclassicists), but it has not infrequent use (it is probably mentioned in most economics textbooks and university economics courses). If you'll note, a number of the mentions to the Luddite fallacy are from by university-level economics courses: see <a href="http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gperi/Teaching/Econ%20136/midt2_w06.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gperi/Teaching/Econ%20136/midt2_w06.pdf" rel="nofollow">UC-Davis</a>, <a href="http://www.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ302/Doyle/Notes_GrowthPolicy.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ302/Doyle/Notes_GrowthPolicy.pdf" rel="nofollow">Iowa State University</a>, <a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:K5CFJVIBDfgJ:faculty.citadel.edu/woolsey/micro/cmp.doc+%22Luddite+fallacy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=17&amp;gl=us" class="external text" title="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:K5CFJVIBDfgJ:faculty.citadel.edu/woolsey/micro/cmp.doc+%22Luddite+fallacy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=17&amp;gl=us" rel="nofollow">Citadel Military College</a>, <a href="http://home.ku.edu.tr/~musomer/Lecture%20Notes/ECON%20THEORIES%20OF%20DEVELOPMENT.pdf" class="external text" title="http://home.ku.edu.tr/~musomer/Lecture%20Notes/ECON%20THEORIES%20OF%20DEVELOPMENT.pdf" rel="nofollow">University of Kansas</a>, <a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic96850.files/1393Quizz1aFall06.pdf" class="external text" title="http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic96850.files/1393Quizz1aFall06.pdf" rel="nofollow">Harvard University</a>. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:35, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Okay, I'm convinced, at least convinced enough that this is a real concept that it's worth keeping a separate article on it. I'm withdrawing my nomination. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragomiloff_1fd6.html" title="User:Dragomiloff">Dragomiloff</a> 20:23, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Thank you. I will keep this page on my watchlist and add additional relevant sources and information as I come across it. To be fair, I do recognise that the previous versions of the article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Luddite_fallacy&amp;oldid=112173040" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Luddite_fallacy&amp;oldid=112173040" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Luddite_fallacy&amp;oldid=114111315" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Luddite_fallacy&amp;oldid=114111315" rel="nofollow">this</a>) were of substandard quality and did not establish the notability of the subject (or justify why this should be separate from <a href="../../../l/u/d/Luddite.html" title="Luddite">Luddite</a>), so your proposed deletion and AFD nomination were fully valid.

<li><b>No-Delete</b> Comment by the creater this entry - Yes, the group was formed only a couple of weeks ago. However we now have over 26 members, with an expected minimum of 10 playing at one time (only 3-week repeat members are displayed on official website numbers). The group is composed of newcomers, experienced SCA, SCP, and trained fencing players (mostly rapier and epee). We may be new but we are well organized and will be around for quite a while. At the current growth rate we are expecting over 100 members in less than six months. I use the following Wikipedia articles for dispute as "Non-Encyclopedic":

<li><b>Delete</b> Non encyclopedic. Larps which have been around for a number of years or even decades, or have hundreds or even thousands of players may be encyclopedic (like some of the ones mentioned above, NERO International has been around for 18 years and has several thousand players across 50 locally run licensed games in the US and Canada, a totally different scale to this "The Greater Phoenix Boffing Group"), but a newly formed local group with about two dozen members isn't exactly notable yet. If it gets bigger later, then it might warrant being remade at that time, but it's no different than countless other flash-in-the-pan groups which might last a few months or a year or two locally then fall apart, and that's not encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWingsandsword_3b20.html" title="User:Wingsandsword">Wingsandsword</a> 20:22, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The only evidence this class exists is a number the aritcle's author found within an artist's impression on a flyer distributed to local residents. Given the intended audience of the flyer, there is no reasonable expectation that the publishers would have verified such a piece of technical ephemera was accurate.

<dd><b>Keep</b> - the fact that TfL have gone to all the trouble of releasing an official artist's impression on an official piece of publicity with a clearly visible class number (<b>378 000</b>) is indicative that this will prove to be the final class number of the new rolling stock.

<dd>So you're questioning a freely available, published document from Transport for London, that states categorically that Network Rail has categorised the new rolling stock as "Class 378"? Fair enough then, I guess you must be right and the body that runs public transport in London must be wrong.

<dd>The point you seem to be missing is that you shouldn't have to dig around for evidence for something as important as the name of your article. Admittedly, the minutes do make your case a bit stronger, but there's really no hurry to create this article until a number is officially announced. I'm OK with the number being mentioned in Wikipedia, but only with the appropriate framing (ie seen in some documents, but not officially announced). That would preclude the article with this name existing, since that implies it is a hard fact. --<a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDtcdthingy_8e94.html" title="User:Dtcdthingy">Dtcdthingy</a> 20:14, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that this should be separate from the Class 376 article, as the 376s have nothing to do with TfL and thus all the TfL stuff, beyond a single sentence that the trains are similar, would be irrelevant to that article. A good precedent is that the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbus_A380_9089.html" title="Airbus A380">Airbus A380</a> article was at <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbus_A3XX_a736.html" title="Airbus A3XX">Airbus A3XX</a> before the name was officially announced. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 10:51, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I believe that the note in agenda item 4 is a strong source supporting Class 378. I would however, consider the artist impression to be less so and in that respect agree with the nominator. I don't think that the picture on its own would support this article but certainty consider the TfL minutes to be a good source, especially as it specifically says that is the classification by Network Rail. It isn't a reference made in passing to the number which would be more likely to be incorrect. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambro_fced.html" title="User:Adambro">Adambro</a> 21:53, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I'm afraid I wouldn't agree with that analysis. "Wikipedia is not a collection of unverifiable speculation". Whilst I've previously said that I believe the meeting minutes to be a strong source for the classification, the existence of these trains is under no doubt. This article should certainly not just simply be deleted, it should either be kept as per my reasoning or merged into <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_376_1910.html" title="British Rail Class 376">Class 376</a> if the TfL source isn't considered strong enough. Another option could be the renaming but I'd be unsure of what a suitable name might be. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambro_fced.html" title="User:Adambro">Adambro</a> 08:43, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>WP:CRYSTAL would apply if the content of the article was speculation, but it isn't. Even the title, which appears to be all you have issue with, has a reliable source. When the name is not certain but the subject is, then we either use a placeholder name or we make it clear in the intro that the name has not been finalised. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a></dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - there are multiple reliable sources that back up the existence of the subject of the article, with multiple reliable sources presented that confirm the name. The article is deliberately separate from the Class 376 article because the TfL specific information is not relevant there. If there is doubt that the name has been finalised (I don't believe there is, but others apparently do), then the correct course of action is not to delete the article, but to either move the article to a place-holder name (possibly London Overground rolling stock) or note at the start of the article "British Rail Class 378 is the presumed name...". <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 10:51, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Assuming this article is kept though, it wouldn't be a particular stretch to alter the text in the main London Overground article to have that as a brief summary, and then this as the main bit about the rolling stock. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> 12/03/07, 13.30 GMT

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I'm not sure that it not existing yet really justifies merging it, we have plenty of articles about future events. It seems that the only thing really under question is the name. It seems most likely that it will be the 378 and as such I suggest it makes sense to keep it there unless anything emerged to bring the numbering into doubt. As per Thryduulf's comment, it could be a good idea to mention in the article that name and details might be subject to change. Maybe a template like <a href="../../../f/u/t/Template%7EFuture_London_Transport_Infrastructure_8f31.html" title="Template:Future London Transport Infrastructure">Future London Transport Infrastructure</a> might be appropriate. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambro_fced.html" title="User:Adambro">Adambro</a> 08:49, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. A primary source calling it "Class 378" is reliable enough for confirming simple facts, being primary does not invalidate the source, it just means we should treat it with some caution. Although this is about a future trainset, the article is well-sourced and covers the subject pretty decently. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:32, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the article, but <b>move</b> it to a less speculative page title, leaving a redirect. I suggest London Overground rolling stock as a possibility. It's not up to TfL what the class number is. The article can still mention the TfL article referring to it as Class 378 though. The article itelf is, on the whole, of a reasonable standard and should not have been sent to AfD. --<a href="../../../r/f/b/User%7ERFBailey_ef11.html" title="User:RFBailey">RFBailey</a> 22:30, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> makes a very valid point in making that distinction.

<dd>The point is not valid at all. Meeting minutes are a record of what individuals have said during the meeting. Minutes are <b>never</b> a reliable source. They are not a definitive statement of anything other than what was said and who said it - even then they not even be right in this. It does not reliably state "This is C378". What it does say <i>reasonably</i> reliably is "Someone in TfL says that someone in NetR says it's C378".

<dd>I would have to disagree with you there Chris. Whilst I appreciate the nature of meeting minutes, I don't think they simply are a record of what was said, that would be a transcript. They provide a summary of the topics discussed and matters raised. These minutes are likely to have been distributed to the attendees prior to publication and as such any misinterpretations could be corrected. The statement within the document is clear; "The first trains will be delivered late 2008 and have been categorised by Network Rail as Class 378's". This kind of statement leaves little doubt. So, I would suggest, it makes sense that we use this as the name until something can be presented that might imply an alternative numbering. I would however, welcome suggestions as to how the article might be reworded slightly so as to inform the reader that there is some doubt about the name. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambro_fced.html" title="User:Adambro">Adambro</a> 23:20, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It's real and verified by reliable sources. There's no reason to change the name as that has been specifically reported.

<li><b>Comment</b>: while the minutes of a TfL meeting are clearly a more reliable source than, say, the Spring 2007 Newsletter of the Poppleton University Railway Enthusiasts Club (or whatever--I'm exaggerating a bit), it doesn't mean that Class 378 is in any way an official designation for these trains. As I said before, this is not up to TfL, even if they are quoting Network Rail. What do Network Rail say on the subject? The remark about the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbus_A3XX_a736.html" title="Airbus A3XX">Airbus A3XX</a> is a red herring: that's what Airbus were calling it themselves before they decided on <a href="../../../a/3/8/A380.html" title="A380">A380</a>. --<a href="../../../r/f/b/User%7ERFBailey_ef11.html" title="User:RFBailey">RFBailey</a> 01:35, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have asked both TfL and Network Rail that very question (well, more specifically "Is the new rolling stock to be classified as Class 378?"), and am waiting for their replies. While, as far as I can see, Network Rail are not bound by the Freedom of Information Act, TfL are and so the question I asked them was phrased as an FOI request.

So much for open sourcing and internet democarcy Once again mainstream takes control of the net Wik may as well just get payed monkeys typing AUTHORATIVE articles so it can sell them to the highest bidder ie encyclopedia brittanica It seems all wik is is a watered down version of brittanica with articles which just reproduce briitanica written by amateurs who in effect just paraphrase more authorative sources —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Gamahucher (talk • contribs) 16:14, 10 March 2007 (UTC).People are running around wik deleting entries that mention mr dean ie case in point an entry about his ideas in Absurdism was just completly removed based only on it basicvally has no britanica entry-ie not s a so called notable. Also entries on dreamtime and Indigenous Australians have also been flaged for removal . It seems wikipedians may as well jus go to brittanica paraphrase that then past in wiki In regard to mainsteam articles like philosophy, absurdism, poetry,dreamtime, anti-poetry wiki will only put entryies in only if they are already in britanica Wik may as well just get payed monkeys typing AUTHORATIVE articles so it can sell them to the highest bidder ie encyclopedia brittanica It seems all wik is is a watered down version of brittanica with articles which just reproduce briitanica written by amateurs who in effect just paraphrase more authorative sources. Wik in fact just pillages other authorative sources it is a parisite feeding of others works -like brittanica. You say you want wik to be an accepted authorative encyclo but all it is realy is a poor man brittanica hobbled tgether from other authorative sources on the CHEAP so wik want have to pay money for anything. So wat has the future instore&#160;: wik going private bought up by google and all the entries then making some corporation heaps of money through adverstising or some other ingeneous way to use the wikpedians hard work etc. Just go read brittanica<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Gamahucher (<a href="../../../g/a/m/User_talk%7EGamahucher_76d4.html" title="User talk:Gamahucher">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gamahucher_8f62.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gamahucher">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>There should be no merger. <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenomorph_%28Alien%29_8e31.html" title="Xenomorph (Alien)">Xenomorph (Alien)</a> is full of inconsistencies in the canonical description of the creature. <a href="../../../g/i/g/Giger%27s_Alien_037b.html" title="Giger's Alien">Giger's Alien</a> directly addresses the inconsistencies of the canon of the aliens creature, but only to the point of how the creatures are named as to avoid redundancy. The information in the xenomorph article could necessarily change due to future additions to the fictional universe. On the other hand, the accurate information on the GA page can only be added to. So while the canon of xenomorph is temporally based on new input, the GA page is a history of different incarnations of the creature (which uses the names the creature is called as landmarks). Combining the two articles would complicate things by either removing information or requiring both a canon and a historical analysis of the changes in the steps of the canon. There are other articles on wikipedia that have similar dual (or more) pages on different ideas behind a subject. These two articles may be about the "same" subject (the creature), but they are not addressing the same ideas. Maybe GA needs work, but xenomorph is not a perfect article either. That is the point, so the GA article is not pointless. I disagree that it is fan fluff. Batman Dead End, for example, is fan fluff. It is not canon (other than how it appears on imdb.com), nor does it matter to any aspect of the canon. In addition, there are many places on wikipedia where information is not absolutely exclusive to one (and only one) article. The information on these two pages, and the separation of the two subjects, better allows for the understanding of the creature, and the ways the creature has been interpreted by so many writers, artists, producers, etc. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETrakon_e653.html" title="User:Trakon">Trakon</a> 14:35, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not going to deal with everything you've written, because you've written a great deal, but, briefly, if <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenomorph_%28Alien%29_8e31.html" title="Xenomorph (Alien)">Xenomorph (Alien)</a> is full of inconsistencies, then you should address them by correcting errors and drawing attention to them on that page, not by creating a rival article with the express intention of creating a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">content fork</a>. I'm not sure I understand the arguments you have made, but I would simply point out that by combining the two pages the content that you acknowledge would be removed would, if worthy of inclusion, surely be redundant? And with reference to Batman Dead End: it is precisely not fluff, it is a fan-made film, however it is one that meets Wikipedia's notability requirements, the very fact I know what it is demonstrates this; what is fluff and <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">OR</a> is attempting to create an article where realistically none need exist. This page doesn't aid understanding, it hinders it. <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDriller_thriller_eb0d.html" title="User:Driller thriller">Driller thriller</a> 00:51, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"This page doesn't aid understanding, it hinders it." If that statement were true, then things in the GA article that have been written that were in fact true have aided the degeneration of the understanding of a subject. The xenomorph and GA articles are not dealing with the same issues and they do not function in the same way. The xenomorph article will change in content, while the GA article will expand its content; the xenomorph article can expand its content, but the verified content of the GA article cannot be changed. Maybe you think GA should be called "A list of names of the creature from the Aliens movies" (or hopefully something shorter in length). Other articles on wikipedia use supplemental articles to define different levels of abstraction. Maybe you think there is not enough information for the GA article to carry its own weight? In this case redundancy solves the need for the GA article. But if you are trying to tell me that redundancy of information is purely the reason to merge different levels of abstraction on a subject, I would have to disagree. Or at least I would have to know where to arbitrarily draw the line at a level of abstraction or an amount of information in order to separate one article into two or more articles.</dd>

<dd>Concerning, once again, the Batman Dead End short, it is my opinion that almost everything in general is fluff. It is my opinion that especially fan-fiction is fluff. I realize that my views on this may be in a minority, but I am not throwing out information. I will not purposefully spread misinformation or lead someone away from accuracy, but I do not really care about Wikipedia's notability requirements (or any other requirements, except for when we share opinions), the Xenomorph (aliens) article, or the Giger's Alien article. But I do care for accuracy of information and my own self-interests. In this case, I am either right and knowledgeable by default, or I am subject to being lead to the truth by people like yourself. To me, that is why wikipedia is interesting, because it is a communal hub of information, thoughts, and ideas (the community somehow arguably being self-interested, but nonetheless well intentioned for the whole). The content of an article X is only a place to start.</dd>

<p>The article is simply the curriculum vitae of a web-developer (appart from the section that reads "<i>On December 16, 2006 Alex got engaged to his girlfriend Kathryn Staczek.</i>"). He may have worked at notable companies like Netscape, but this doesn't make one notable, no matter how good one could have been on his tasks. Google returns a great number of hits for his name, but most of them are posts by himself on open forums or his profiles accounts on a diversity of websites. The article seems to be maintained by the person in question himself, User:Alexrudloff, that also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gavin_Hall&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gavin_Hall&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">wrote the bulk</a> of the article about his "<i>long time business partner Gavin Hall</i>" <i><a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">Abu badali</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/b/u/User_talk%7EAbu_badali_00c9.html" title="User talk:Abu badali">talk</a>)</sup></i> 21:31, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To clarify, an acceptable claim of notability would be something like interviews (or some other kind of coverage) in reputable news source. I would retract this nomination if it can be shown that the subject of the article is something more than a internet entrepreneur, blogger, and web developer that worked for notable companies. --<i><a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_badali_cd78.html" title="User:Abu badali">Abu badali</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/b/u/User_talk%7EAbu_badali_00c9.html" title="User talk:Abu badali">talk</a>)</sup></i> 21:35, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Keep</b>. The article is a sad mess in need of pruning, but I think the word's long history (it goes back to the 30s) and wide, varied usage means this deserves more than a simple dictionary entry.

<dd>Thanks for the ref, but I wish you had added it to the <i>Wiktionary</i> entry instead. Dictionary entries don't have to be "simple."

<dd>Per <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>, Wiktionary articles "are about the actual words or idioms in their title" and "A <i>full</i> dictionary article (as opposed to a stub dictionary article, which is simply where Wiktionary articles start from) will contain illustrative quotations for each listed meaning; etymologies; ...". Information about a given word is Wiktionary content. In the case of "yo," I can certainly imagine that a <i>Wikipedia</i> article may be possible, for example perhaps on controversy generated by its usage. (This of course would depend on whether there are any reliable sources on that.) But the current version of <a href="../../../y/o/_/Yo.html" title="Yo">Yo</a> is 100% Wiktionary content. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 12:44, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>State was bad choice of words, I have changed it to entity. When the United Kingdom was formed, England and Wales were regarded as a single item. That is why the Union Jack has no Welsh element. The fact that England and Wales are more inter-related than England and Scotland is an important historical fact. This article is the place to highlight this, and how it still effects the modern country. The article has been greatly improved by the recent addition of the sections. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMortimerCat_ce93.html" title="User:MortimerCat">MortimerCat</a> 09:43, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Incomplete is not, but unnecessary is. The entires for the United Kingdom could easily include this. All the references to this article are for organisations that have welsh and english membership and the article addes no value to those. The statistical material is self evident on the relevant articles and if someone wants the full history then it is laid out in the Wales article in some detail.
<dl>
<dd>My point wasn't about the material, but about the entity. There are loads of articles for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/Statistical_area" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/Statistical_area" rel="nofollow">statistical areas</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/Census_region" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/Census_region" rel="nofollow">census regions</a> etc. This is one of them. <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETotnesmartin_9344.html" title="User:Totnesmartin">Totnesmartin</a> 13:35, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think if the article was called "Statistical Area: England and Wales" and was a simple statement of links then I can see an argument. However "England and Wales" attracts the sort of meaningless, better handled elsewhere material which is currently there.

<p>This is actually an object lesson in demonstrating that separate notability guidelines for songs are, in fact, needed. Technically, this, as written, does not demonstrate itself as meeting the general notability guidelines, but I find it hard to argue that the song is not actually notable.

<li>I apologize. I've mostly done minor edits and added a few significant stubs/redirects. I've never done anything this major before, and wasn't aware of the policy-formation-related rules of Wikipedia. I'm fairly certain it's considered bad form to just erase an AfD nomation, so I'd like to petition for it to be closed. I will look for the proper place to state my case, rather than try to demonstrate the veracity of it directly. Quite honestly, I agree that it's blatantly noteable, but I've seen the argument 'there aren't multiple independent articles written with it as the primary subject' used to label songs not-notable so many times before that I wanted to somehow bring up the obvious point that articles aren't often written about songs, no matter how blatantly noteable they are. Uncertain of the 'proper' forum, I went for the first one I could think of. It was an ill-advised decision, but I wanted to get the topic out there somehow. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevilot_d2d3.html" title="User:Devilot">Devilot</a> 22:51, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is nothing notable about a local shopping center with grocery and drug stores.

I have reviewed this page and disagree becuase,1) A-M is famous over the internet (mostly myspace) and i personally know him, and 2) there is a group called ALB and there is a link on that page that takes you to the website. so In my opinion, I think that the wikipedia page of A-M should not be deleted for it appears noble.</p>

<p>I personally will go though all of the entries and eliminate any of the entries that violate wikipedia rules. I don't know who put the things other than the 1st paragraph in there, but it was not me. And to Denni, I wiped out a paragraph to remove the "advertising" theory. If I must, I will also wipe-out the other paragraph that is more than 2 sentences long to fix this problem.

<p>What I was going to do was that the entries were to e-mail me, I would pick the top 5 that follow Wikipedia standards, send them to the admin of the school, get the cleared one, and post it creating any needed formatting and etc. But, what's on there right now looks good enough for now or indefinately. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_Intellegent_fa05.html" title="User:Sir Intellegent">Sir Intellegent</a> 01:53, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Guide_969f.html" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a>: it's a helpful list to have archived here, and it is a notable list.

<li><b>Keep</b> while technically it was a news report (sort of) it was also, well, news. Just a quick google search shows that the article was covered and reported on by <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/04/26/entertainment/main507388.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/04/26/entertainment/main507388.shtml" rel="nofollow">CBS News</a>. Sometimes the news covers the news, that's not the fault of this article's editors. Now that being said, I think the mandate of this article should be extremely limited. The "criticisms" section has always been awash in POV and OR (completely uncited). It's a small section, but seems to be a popular one for editors to complain that their favorite TV show didn't make the list (in my opinion). -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 14:53, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>merge</b> with <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Guide_969f.html" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a> does seem a reasonable solution, though I lean more towards <b>delete</b>. I don't think a magazine's "best-of list" is worthy of an article; if they do another feature like this 5 years from now, the list will change drastically. Similarly, nobody will post a list of TV Guide's 1978 feature "The 50 All-Time Best TV Shows", because nobody cares. Also, as a suggestion, would the article fail <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, especially the part about Wikipedia's "Anglo-American Bias"? <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllGloryToTheHypnotoad_177b.html" title="User:AllGloryToTheHypnotoad">AllGloryToTheHypnotoad</a> 00:26, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
