	    <p>The Ducky Boys are the most prominant example of true '90's Boston punk rock, which several bands (most notably, possibly, The Dropkick Murphys) have since brought to national attention. This specific breed of music existed in the same form nowhere else. To delete these pages would do a large diservice to the archival histories of the cultural influence of contemporary rock'n'roll. -Bernard P. Provencher LeVautour, cultural and literary scholar, Phoenix, Arizona</p>

This should not be an issue! I think that Wikipedia has an obligation to NOT delete this page. It goes without saying that Mark Lind is an amazing, talented musician and writer -prolific if nothing else- but this is <b>INFORMATION</b>! You can't delete an article because it is not popular!! Consider this: someone took the time to <i>write</i> the article, others are taking the time to fight for it to remain avaliable, that in and of itself should tell anyone reading this or who is affiliated with Wikipedia that it shouldn't be deleted, its popular at least to those people. Its popular to all of those people who buy his music, support his creativity, go to his shows, enjoy his music even remotely, and Mark Lind himself who made his fans aware of this affront. It is popular to me, a girl on the otherside of the country who knows nothing of the band other than the day after I heard "For The Underdogs" off of Three Chords And The Truth went out and bought ALL the Ducky Boys, Sinners And Saints, Mark Lind, and Dirty Water albums I could find.
If one feels the need to delete this particular article, then why not delete ALL the articles. For that matter, shut down the whole site while we're at it!...yeah people can edit pages, yeah it may not all be true, but we all know that going into it! No one is going to read this page and cite it somewhere...this page contains nothing offensive, nothing lewd, nothing except information on a musician, a wonderful one at that...  And on a more solemn note, I am confused as to Wikipedia, who claims to support free speech, considers it appropriate and/or necessary to delete this or any other page!

<p>KEEP! It's absurd to think that anyone would want to delete an artist as important to the Boston Punk Scene as Mark Lind. As stated above... do a google search and take note of all the results. This also would apply to Marks band the Ducky Boys. Seriously, to delete this artist and his former band The Ducky Boys, would undermine the credibility of Wikipedia in general. This also would be a slap in the face to any and all artists who take a DYI approch to music. The fact that Lind has mantained C.D. sales in a very competitive market, even after problems with his lable, is a testament to his "Notability". If Linds status as a "signed artist" due to a "hiccup" from Sailors Grave records is your basis for deletion, then you realy ought to re examine your policy. I would think that a 12 year recored of putting out succesful releases, not to mention influencing many other young Boston bands alone would warrent inclusion in Wikipedia. I won't even go into the other "notables" Mark has performed with. That would take up quite a bit more space. The staff of Wikipedia needs to reconsider this ill advised deletion.Skv260 21:17, 1 April 2007 (UTC)ssm</p>
