<dd>I respectfully disagree. The American Heritage Dictionary defines subjective as "Proceeding from or taking place within an individual's mind such as to be unaffected by the external world...existing only in the mind; illusory." I don't believe that such a thing is verifiable. On the other hand, so-and-so made such-and-such statement would be objective (and verifiable). But "List of computer games, hardware, etc. that someone has declared to be a commercial failure" still would not be an acceptable list. <font face="Old English Text MT"><a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007"><span style="padding: 0px 2px 0px 2px; background: black; color: white">JChap</span></a> <big><b><a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007"><span style="color: black">T</span></a><span style="color:black">/</span><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JChap2007_1e7f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JChap2007"><span style="color:black">E</span></a></b></big></font> 01:30, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is actually the very definition of "<b>commercial</b> failure". Sure it was a critical success, and was well received by those that bought it but it was a huge <b>commercial</b> failure.

<li><b>Comment</b> I just wanted to point out that while the list of failed gaming consoles is I think, a quite good idea (but what, no Shanda EZ, guys?), a complete list (or okay, only a list of those produced by notable game companies) of video games which were commercial failures would <u>ridiculously</u> long, containing maybe as much as 60%-80% of all games released (after all, this is very much a hit-driven industry), and this even before accounting for <a href="../../../v/a/p/Vapourware.html" title="Vapourware">vapourware</a>. The number of games released is obviously much higher (thousands more) than the number of automobiles that have been commercially marketed (though the list wouldn't be as large as say, List of commercial failures in fiction publishing or List of commercial failures in the Hollywood movie industry). If the list was only to be selective and so deliberately shortened to a manageable size, then the question arises about how this selection was decided, and if it is a subjective choice. Can someone come up with what this selective criteria would be? Such criteria would also help with the POV/OR objections raised in this discussion<a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:17, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I mean, the opening line is a staggering and very misleading understatement about the industry:"The computer and video games industry has seen several commercial failures since its birth in the late 1970s".

<li><b>Keep</b>. This story has gotten to the point where the blogs are themselves reporting a story--not just making comments about a story reported by someone else. So if the blogs use a new word, that should be treated the same as if the New York Times published the story and used a new word. We would not say "you need a published or peer reviewed verifiable secondary source before we can use a word from the New York Times".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Most of the comments above seem to ignore that blogs can be news sources. New terms used by blogs who are wearing a news source hat should be treated as new terms used by other news sources, not as new terms created by Joe Blow on the Internet.

<li>Nonsense. The two aren't even comparable as sources. If a blog uses a new word, that should be treated the same as if the New York Times used a new word? Er... no. That position kind of assumes equal credence for both, which is ridiculous: the point about blogs is that any idiot can get one, whether they can design fancy websites and create stupid portmanteau words or not.

<li>The details actually *aren't* verifiable without reference to blogs, because the blogs are drawing conclusions (these two photos show the same woman, this seems to be a 4 hour span, etc.) In order to have this story at all, you must accept the blogs as reliable sources. A word made up and used by the major sources of a story isn't a neologism in the sense barred by the guideline. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 14:27, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's difficult to draw the line. Surely before the blogs did their digging, Reuters publication of one of the Hajj photos would have been considered a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, but they've admitted that they were fake. Surely before the blogs did their work, CBS would have been considered a reliable source on the <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killian_documents.html" title="Killian documents">Killian documents</a>. How many errors must a major news source make before it's no longer a reliable source, and how many blockbuster scoops must a blog score before it's considered reliable? When it comes to the qualification of a reliable source, I have a strong predisposition to err in favor of inclusion, trusting Wikipedia readers to be able to judge for themselves which sources are reliable and which aren't. For example, I would have no problem with an article citing <a href="http://www.zombietime.com/reuters_photo_fraud/" class="external text" title="http://www.zombietime.com/reuters_photo_fraud/" rel="nofollow">ZombieTime's analysis of the photos in question</a>; it's original reasearch (but on the part of Zombietime, not the hypothetical article creator) and it's got enough documentation to enable a reader to decide for himself whether or not it is credible.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I was the one who put this up for deletion, and I almost want to change my own vote, because of the disregard for the rules which people are performing by excercising such predjudice against this page. Come on people, the problem is that there are no reliable secondary sources as of yet, not that "evil bloggers" are trying to rule the world, or that neolgisms must be squooshed without mercy. The issue here is lack of established credible sources because it's way too young to have sources that qualify under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 01:43, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It seems to me that the root of the argument here is the whole reliable source problem. The only reason this topic exists is because many of the sources considered as reliable, have repeatedly published questionable material, and have taken little responsibility for their actions. This topic also covers more than just photo manipulation, it includes staged pictures. The concept of publishing pictures to distort events is what the topic is about, not specifically about chaning pictures. Due to the number of publications dispensing this material, I do not see that it should be rolled into a single occurrence. This may need to be discussed again in the future, but for now it seems to be a reasonable place to give the details of what is happening in the sources previously considered to be reliable. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedLyons_e791.html" title="User:RedLyons">RedLyons</a> 13:55, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Do you reckon the character name to be a common enough search term to warrant a redirect? Given that historical coincidence, the Evans article is in order.

<p>Although some spelling bee winners deserve a page for various reasons, Nupur Lala doesn't really seem to need one.

<li><b>Strongest possible keep</b> I've argued this before and I'll argue it again: Anybody who wins the National Spelling Bee- which inherently involves beating many millions of other people and competing on national television- deserves their own WP article. Even if there is no other information about the winner, they at least deserve a stub. National Spelling Bee winners are, at the very least, as notable as Go players, or World Series of Poker champions (and certainly poker players who have never even won a WSOP bracelet, and there are hundreds of players on WP who never have, including my favorite poker player), or reality show contestants (many of whom do not have WP articles, but some of whom do). So there it is- if you can win a highly-publicized, televised competition (with almost a century's worth of history) over millions of other people, you deserve your own article. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 11:35, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I might agree with you if the article on Spellbound didn't already have more information on her than her article does.

<li><b>Delete</b> as is describes an OS from a one page paper that accompanies a poster in the SOPS poster session.

Moreover, since we're talking about a SOPS paper from 2005 you would at least expect some citations to show up in google scholar. However, although the paper is there (when you search for Gu and Stankovic) there a no citations at all. Actually, also with google <i>sec</i> I'm unable to find any other papers that cite this one.

The article has a small introduction which I shall reproduce here in full: "This is a list of television shows currently in syndication in the United States." A list then follows along with a second list "Shows entering syndication for the 2006-2007 television season" which is just made up of a brief preamble, this time slightly larger, and another list.

<li><b>Delete</b> High mantainance lists (as opposed to ones with fixed membership, only growing) would be better as catagories.

<li>Personal opinion is that sub catagories would be easier to maintain, and more appropriate, as Lists are best used when the entry onto the list should be qualified.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This appears to be a serious academic database project, and a very useful reference for (especially modern) architectural history, which I have seen linked to (and have myself linked to) in Wikipedia articles. It includes a lot of professional photographs and drawings, bibliographies, biographies of architects and notes on individual buildings. It has prominent <a href="http://www.archinform.net/info/partner.htm?ID=8c0610436cf5e212c9016cd3b2d2eb79" class="external text" title="http://www.archinform.net/info/partner.htm?ID=8c0610436cf5e212c9016cd3b2d2eb79" rel="nofollow">partners</a>, including the publisher K. G. Saur Verlag and includes biographies from its <i>Allgemeines Künstlerlexikon</i>. That a specialized online database has a low Alexa ranking is hardly surprising but completely irrelevant. It also claims (<a href="http://www.archinform.net/info/press.htm?ID=8c0610436cf5e212c9016cd3b2d2eb79" class="external text" title="http://www.archinform.net/info/press.htm?ID=8c0610436cf5e212c9016cd3b2d2eb79" rel="nofollow">here</a>) to have been covered in major architectural publications, which I have no reason to doubt. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 07:10, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Being referenced on Wikipedia and being informative are not criterias for notability (see <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>). Also, the link you gave describes architectural magazines that have given the website a <b>review</b>, which falls under <b>trivial coverage</b> ("brief summary of the nature of the content"). By the way, how is the traffic ranking not at least partly relevant to determining a website's notability? After all, traffic ranking is based upon the amount of visitors to a website.--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 09:08, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think this should be judged in analogy with academic books (see the proposed guideline at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html#Criteria_.28academic_books.29" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">Wikipedia:Notability (books)#Criteria (academic books)</a>), where we would accept a smaller printing run than for, say, a novel. Another criterion for academic books is if the book is "printed by a reputable or well known academic press". This website includes content provided by K. G. Saur, which is one of the most respected academic publishers in the world. If this had been a book, it would probably have been allowed as an academic publication. Including articles on often used reference works and authors, whether in print or online form, is helpful for Wikipedia and its readers. As for the reviews, I don't know if they are just "brief summary of the nature of the content" as I haven't actually seen them. I would, however, argue that a printed academic publication being reviewed in the pertinent academic journals would add to its (and its author's) notability, and see no reason to treat a website differently. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 09:32, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm a bit confused about your analogy. You've stated that the website is notable because it <b>includes</b> content provided from a notable publisher, which is completely different from being <b>published</b> by a notable publisher. Using your analogy, if a newly started wiki had articles from a notable source, the wiki would be notable regardless of how influental or how popular the wiki may be. Also one should note that <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">Wikipedia:Notability (books)</a> is still a <i>proposed</i> guideline. --<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 15:21, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>K. G. Saur is an official partner (along with some image archives etc) allowing use of its copyrighted material (which is different from just taking stuff from out-of-copyright publications, as Wikipedia does, and as anyone could do). As for <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">Wikipedia:Notability (books)</a>, I already pointed out above that is just proposed. Are you disputing the general principle of the proposed section on academic books in the proposed guideline? <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 17:30, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You should have clarified your sentence, stating that K. G. Saur is a partner of ArchINFORM, not just a contributor. Also, I'm not disputing the content of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">Wikipedia: Notability (books)</a>, I'm simply stating that its still a proposed guideline, thus the criterias may still be in development and not yet represent the majority consensus of the Wikipedian community. Either way, I do admit that the low Alexa ranking might be due to the fact that it's both a foreign and an academic website. --<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 01:12, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am sorry TBC, but you are arguing in decreasing circles. This site is very notable indeed. Perhaps it would be a good idea to check these things out before listing pages here in future, then you won't find yourself having to defend the impossible, which carries the entailed risk of making yourself look rather silly.

<li>TBC's nomination was fine. The notability of the subject is non-evident to someone outside the field of Architecture, even now (I hope the article will be improved to show notability of the subject, if it is kept). Nothing inherently wrong or silly-looking with nominating an article that ends up being kept; it happens all the time in good faith. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_11.html" title="August 11">08-11</a> 20:17Z</small></i></span></li>

The article also lists only English language programmes from four countries - the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom - and focuses mainly on American programmes. I am sure there are programmes in the other hundred sixty some odd countries that are comedies without laugh tracks. Also I really do not see how this article can ever be verified as either complete or accurate and I can even think of a few that are not on the list.03:57, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result was: Numbers are roughly evenly split either way. However, AfD is not a vote, and there is certainly a large burden of argument to show that a fast food restaurant's menu is something that belongs in an encyclopaedia. The essential points of the argument that it does belong in an encyclopaedia are:</p>
<ul>
<li>it includes information that isn't available elsewhere (i.e. discontinued items). If it isn't available elsewhere, then it isn't <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, and it doesn't belong here. I acknowledge that this isn't an argument that has been discussed fully below, as it ideally would be, but verifiability is a non-negotiable pillar of writing an encyclopaedia and I consider it more important than any potential argument for me not to consider it.</li>
<li>RFerreira's argument that someone may wish to read a Taco Bell menu who doesn't have access to a Taco Bell or the Internet. I believe Wikipediatrix and JIP have the weight of argument, in that the only purpose of reading a menu is so one may order food from it; conversely, no-one would wish to read a Taco Bell menu when they have no opportunity to order food from Taco Bell.</li>
<li>There are also numerous keep arguments with little bearing on policy, along the lines of "it's useful" (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> - of course it's useful, that's why you'll find this information nailed up in Taco Bell or on their website, but that's not a reason to include it in an encyclopaedia), appeals to precedent (<a href="../../../n/b/d/WP%7ENBD_62b7.html" title="WP:NBD">no such thing here</a>), appeals to <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">WP:POKEMON</a>, and appeals to the incomprehensible (I've no idea why this is "important for culture").</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a fast food menu, with a liberal seasoning of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> trivia. The argument needed to show that a menu is somehow an encyclopaedia article isn't present here. I expect this to be a controversial close, but AfD is not a vote, and I see no way to summarise the arguments in a way that makes this out to be an encyclopaedia article. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 15:13, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The Central Market grocery store chain in Washington State is probably less notable than the Central Market that operates in Washington, D.C. -- that market, a landmark that was once one of a series of city-owned marketplaces in D.C., is of some historical interest.(Corrected my original comment -- Central Market is not still active, it is <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Market%2C_Washington%2C_D.C._ae5b.html" title="Eastern Market, Washington, D.C.">Eastern Market, Washington, D.C.</a> that is still active.

At Central Market, small bands play on Saturday afternoons while the store serves barbeque chicken and green beans to the residents." This was added back in July, before this AfD discussion, and not by me: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mill_Creek%2C_Washington&amp;diff=61818122&amp;oldid=56058308" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mill_Creek%2C_Washington&amp;diff=61818122&amp;oldid=56058308" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuadfranklin_3f67.html" title="User:Joshuadfranklin">Joshuadfranklin</a> 15:08, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Any number of cities around the world are going to have similar types of stores, and a small group of three in the Seattle area is not in itself notable. If <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is to have any meaning at all, size, distinctiveness, notability outside its local trading area, or <i>some</i> sort of encyclopedic justification is surely required, which does not seem to be present here. With respect, I believe that some of the Keep voters may be confusing "verifiable" with "notable", which in turn is not the same as "mentioned in local papers in the normal course of business".</li>

<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuadfranklin_3f67.html" title="User:Joshuadfranklin">User:Joshuadfranklin</a>'s examples are unfortunate choices for his argument. The <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powell%27s_Books_0d8c.html" title="Powell's Books">Powell's Books</a> article informs me that the main store "<i>is the largest independent bookstore in the United States</i>.", and it would appear to have been something of a pioneer in online book retailing. These are the sorts of things which establish notability, whereas the stores in question do not seem exceptional in any way. The <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Market_%28Texas%29_e612.html" title="Central Market (Texas)">Central Market (Texas)</a> chain has 8 (larger) stores, and is part of a 300-store regional grocery outfit. The article also tells me the Austin stores combine to be the second largest tourist draw there, which again contributes to notability (unless it is an indication of a dearth of other attractions in Austin). <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrods.html" title="Harrods">Harrods</a> is of course an internationally known name with notability to burn.</dd>
<dd>Town and Country Markets should definitely be deleted (redirected if this article should survive AfD), as the corporation and the three smaller stores are even less notable. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 07:44, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>My name is JT, a poster at the site and I was the one who started the article. There is much more about the site then what was mentioned, but I have left it to other members of the site (as well as visitors) to add their own input to the article. The site has been around for a total of 8 years, and does have a following notable enough among wrestling fans and smarks to be on Wikipedia. I actually started this article after looking up TPWW on Wikipedia and decided to start my own when I couldn't find one. Also, there is much more about TPWW then what I mentioned (popular articles, other trademarks), but have left it open to more knowledgable people to add to the article...and it will take more than one day (which is less then the amount of time given to the article before the deletion notice) to build it up. jayteecool 00:59, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also to note the inactive period of time...the site was never inactive. I mentioned the slowdown of the site to note the impact of the forums community which became even more popular during this period and lead to the revival of the news &amp; column section, as well as other areas of the site. Also during the time, the forums led to some of the most popular staples of the site which were created on the forums. jayteecool 01:13, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Definite keep.</p>
<p>An excellent web site, I made changes to a few things on the page as per suggestions made, and cleaned up the grammar and spelling errors. It is definitely an entry worthy of keeping around as TPWW is certainly one of the most popular wrestling websites on the internet today. -Shaved Munkey</p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. I have to say this so often that I should write an essay about it. <b>Forums have a very high standard for notability on Wikipedia.</b> They must not only be popular, but have a reason for notability <i>outside of the fact that they are a popular forum</i>. My classic example is that of <a href="../../../e/v/e/EVE_Online_f4f6.html" title="EVE Online">EVE Online</a>, which has a forum with over a hundred thousand active members, over 370,000 threads, an Alexa rank of 5000, and millions of posts, yet it <i>doesn't even get a mention anywhere in Wikipedia, even in the EVE Online article.</i> Why? Its just not notable. There's no reason someone outside of the EVE Online community would have heard of it.

<li><b>Comment</b> The page has been updated with more info, there's no possible way it can be considered too lacking in content now in comparison to other 2006 SA election articles. And by the way michael, it's not about the 0.9% that means he should get the page, I think it's his direct opposition to the sitting independent in that electorate that is the reason why. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 06:18, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> At the risk of encouraging another indentation, can you provide examples of press coverage that he has received regarding this opposition? I oppose a number of politicians myself, but a page about my views does not belong on Wikipedia. The fact that he got .9% of the vote (~180, apparently) makes him look non-notable. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrepi_31ce.html" title="User:Garrepi">Garrepi</a> 06:25, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Correct. You have to demonstrate that someone other than the subject himself has written and published something non-trivial about him. Candidates for elected office are generally considered notable if they (a) win or (b) lose but do so in a fashion spectacular enough to cause non-trival press coverage. Candidates about which nothing is written apart from a single row in an election results table should be represented in Wikipedia in the same way: as a single row of an election results table in (say) <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_district_of_Mitchell_%28South_Australia%29_3e36.html" title="Electoral district of Mitchell (South Australia)">Electoral district of Mitchell (South Australia)</a> (see <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading_West_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_7429.html" title="Reading West (UK Parliament constituency)">Reading West (UK Parliament constituency)</a> for an example). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:51, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This non-notable character editor for Diablo II survived a previous AfD nomination in March 2006, mainly due to lack of interest.

I fail to see what the difference is here. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 17:28, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Julia Pomeroy's page in Wikipedia is solid. She might not be Marilyn Monroe or Sylvia Plath, but since when did Wikipedia become an index of only the most famous (or most tragic) people. Pomeroy is a SAG actor, as well as a published author. Her film "Over The Edge" is considered by many to be a cult classic. There are a lot of people who might be interested in reading something about Pomeroy in Wikipedia.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> It is unfortunately original research because their region-free property is almost always obscured. It's not a developer credit, fictional character or plot summary, these things can be sourced from the original medium. Finding reliable sources for all individual titles to prove they are region-free may be difficult. For instance, this GameSpot article<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/streetfighteranniversarycollection/news.html?sid=6111875" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/streetfighteranniversarycollection/news.html?sid=6111875" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> discusses that the Japanese version of <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_Anniversary_Collection_d80c.html" title="Street Fighter Anniversary Collection">Street Fighter Anniversary Collection</a></i> was intentionally region-free. This sort of thing could be used. I do have a question though - can an established retailer, such as <a href="../../../l/i/k/Lik_Sang_1529.html" title="Lik Sang">Lik Sang</a> or Play-Asia, be used as a source, since they seem to have done the research and mark their region-specific games as region-free when applicable? --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 06:43, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Mostly speculation. Although it's certainly a reasonable guess, there is no confirmation that the "thing" that Square Enix and Taito are collaborating on is a console, especially a seventh generation one. That the product will be a console, though a reasonable conclusion, is original research.

<p>I do not believe that the concept of a "Spanish law state" is real.

<li><b>Comment</b> I began the article as a serious venture. My mistake was making it immediately known to other users who may not have taken it as seriously. I apologize for stepping on any toes, but Uselessjunk.com receieves 750,000 page loads per day. Uselessjunk.net (the forums) have well over 30,000 members. Perhaps this will go into your consideration. Live Dog 16:45, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Question</b> I'm not disagreeing with your assesment, I'm just asking for your opinion. Why are there so many active members, but so few people link to uselessjunk? If there were 30,000 members, wouldn't some of those members link to uselessjunk from their webpage/blog/sites? I mean, google only found 73 (now 74) unique pages.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The members usually rarely link to their own websites for two reasons: to maintain some level of internet anonymity and because external links to personal websites are generally considered spam by the UJ community. I'm not sure about all the online rankings, Hoover would be a better person to ask about that. Alexa lists 508 sites that link Uselessjunk.com. As far as the unique hit calculations, I'm not sure of that either. But I said 600k-700k in "page loads".

<li><b>Comment</b> - I agree with you on some stuff. The sun article doesn't even say what website posted the news and probably shouldn't belong on the article (right?). About the southernvoice article it <i>does</i> make mention to the fakeawish.com site and it seems to be semi-non-trivial coverage. However, this AFD is about uselessjunk not fakeawish. Even if this article <i>was</i> about fakeawish, though, one article isn't enough (<i>multiple</i> non-trivial published works). I disagree on one point. I think the southernvoice article <i>was</i> about fakeawish.com, not <i>just</i> the rumors that fakeawish spread. <b>~a</b> (<a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EArichnad_d429.html" title="User:Arichnad">user</a> • <a href="../../../a/r/i/User_talk%7EArichnad_2e77.html" title="User talk:Arichnad">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arichnad_abd7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arichnad">contribs</a>) 17:27, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> When I say an article is "about" a topic, I mean its the main topic being discussed. Given the headline, "Atlanta Falcons quarterback dispels gay rumors", I would say thats the case. If "about" means directly pertinent then I would say the article is about fakeawish,the rumor, and the Falcons. Regardless of our semantic differences, you are right; we need multiple non-trivial sources to gauge notability for this site. As the article stands, it does not have that. --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> <sub><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitaphane_f38a.html" title="User talk:Mitaphane">talk</a></sub> 18:53, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Frequently I have found that the information on Uselessjunk is more current than that of local news stations. It seems that given the fact that it is used as a source of current information by radio personalities and individuals around the world (the forum browsers/users), it hardly would seem to be non-notable.

<p>Barry Foy grew up of Irish origin and was constantly surrounded by Irish music and culture.

<p>There is no doubt that an actor called Barry Foy played a character called 'Billinge Boy' also credited as "Bombhead's mate" in the Tv series Hollyoaks. It is up for debate however if this is the same authour of a field guide to Irish music. I suggest the article stays but we remove any reference to the aforementioned book until this issue is clarified.

<dd>While I had no <i>personal</i> opinion in this as the deleting admin, my careful examination of the arguments presented says this comes down to a bun-fight between <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a>. This material is a very high level of detail regarding a theme which does not appear to be in common parlance, thus falls squarely into <i>"Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information."</i> This has been countered with <i>"Non-notable minor characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be merged with short descriptions into a List of characters."</i> This counter argument is an incomplete quote however as the guideline goes on to say <i>"This list should reside in the article relating to the work itself [...]"</i> In this case the work itself is the episode in which the charater appears. As there is nothing meaningful to merge (minor characters have very little information, plot-important charaters already have more information in the parent articles) and the article title would not serve as a meaningful redirect I recomend deletion.<br />

An AfD crowd won't necessarily have full understanding of the Simpsons project. If it's decided to merge this or that it's unneeded, it can be harmlessly redirected to the character list. As it is, a person could navigate with this list in the sense that he doesn't know the name of the episode in which his/her favourite character appeared, or even the season of the episode, and thus opens this list to find his/her favourite character and the link to the article about the episode- thus making this list serve as an odd form of disambiguation page. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 17:07, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Split to episode articles</b>. I have thought about this for a while now. I still believe that it is an example of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> #2, but I do think that the list is really long and would be too long if it were complete. It is not my favorite page on Wikipedia, but it does serve a purpose. As long as we have this list we don't have too hunt down Simpson stubs about minor characters. I think the best compromise would be to split the list, move the information to the episode articles, and create/change the redirect so that it would go to that article. If we decide on this I will personally split the list (although it would be nice with some help from others). --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMaitch_8373.html" title="User:Maitch">Maitch</a> 17:18, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete'</b>. While they are funny, one time characters still aren't notable. I suggest (if it's not made already): a Simpsons Wiki for this.

<li>Conflicting guidelines, defaulting to <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> also says <i>[Not] Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as ... persons (real or fictional)</i> with the disclaimer <i>Merged groups of small articles based on a core topic are certainly permitted</i>, but counters with <i>Plot summaries - Wikipedia articles should not act solely as a summary of the plot of a work of fiction</i>. <a href="../../../1/s/p/WP%7E1SP_77c6.html#Check_your_fiction" title="WP:1SP">WP:1SP#Check your fiction</a> says <i>If the subject, a character in a TV show, say, is too limited to be given a full article, then integrate information about that character into a larger article.</i> etc., etc. I can't take from this that there is unambiguous grounds for deletion so I vote keep, but clearly this article might be the catalyst for the creation of a Simpsons Wiki.

<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a>. This is a textbook case of how to handle the subject. Comments above regarding WP:NOt are not applicable. There is nothing indiscriminate about the subject matter here, which is linked to one of the most important shows of the last 20 years. Furthermore, the WP:NOT "indiscriminate collection" clauses are specific, not elastic. This article is not even close to the specific examples in the policy. I also think a merge is a poor idea and would greatly reduce the utility of the article since those seeking minor characters are not going to know the episode. This lists puts these characters all in one place and that's a good thing. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:32, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm curious how this is a "textbook case" when the suggestion of "keep" contradicts that guideline? As to finding the characters, the likelihood that someone will <i>not</i> know the name of the episode but will know that they were in <i>only one episode</i> is pretty close to zero. A whole swag of redirects from the name of the character to the parent episode solves that problem easily enough, as well. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 23:30, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Does not contradict anything because the Simpsons is long. That's why we have <a href="../../../t/h/e/Category%7EThe_Simpsons_b7f9.html" title="Category:The Simpsons">Category:The Simpsons</a>. The rest of your points regarding redirects are nonsensical given that you are arguing for deletion of the material rather than a merge.

<li>Err, what? Please actually <i>read</i> my comments, where I explain why merging is not appropiate and creation of a redirect to parent episodes <i>for the character names</i> is also seperate from the article.

<ul>
<li>Yes, exactly. Please actually <i>read</i> my comments, where I explain why keeping the list is appropriate. The Simpsons is the parent work for all its daughter articles, and the episodes are just chapters in an ongoing saga. This list gives an overview of the use of minor characters across the entire series that surpasses the reach of an article on an individual episode. It is perfect as a jumping off point to the episode articles if greater detail is required. A very similar example is <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Shakespearean_characters_60d7.html" title="List of Shakespearean characters">List of Shakespearean characters</a>, which is full of minor one-off characters. I would point out that I have no <i>personal</i> opinion in this; my thinking is based on careful examination of the best way to organize encyclopedic information on notable topics at wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:24, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ugh. That list you gave is a useless cruft. And it doesn't matter that it's about Big Bill Shakespeare. (By the way, you should've put <i>five</i> asterisks instead of three to have the right indentation.

<ul>
<li>Thanks. I disagree. That's not "useless cruft". It's useful information. Every serious reference work should have a list of all Shakespeare and Simpsons characters. After all, they have both been going strong for quite some time. Certainly longer than many of our editors and readers. Your comment looks good btw. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:30, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Useful information!? If I wanted to know more about the drunken porter's monologue in <i>Macbeth</i>, do you really think I'd go to that list and look for "Porter"? No, I'd go look in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macbeth.html" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a> for the aftermath of Duncan's murder. (Or, I'd go read the play itself.) You can pretend that an indiscriminate character list is a result of scholarship, but really it is raw notes stapled together with no context.

<li>You are missing the point. Where do you go to find a summary listing of all the characters from all plays? Or to find Reynaldo if you can't remember the play? There is nothing "indiscriminate" about these types of lists (please review WP:NOT), and "indiscriminate" can not be a catch-phrase for "I don't like it". They are well defined and useful reference tools. After all, we don't all have time to "go read the play" as you suggest. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 14:36, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Indiscriminate" is tantamount to "put together in such an unwieldy manner that it is very difficult to use," which is what this list is. As for your example, it goes back to Brenneman's point a while ago -- The chance of someone knowing Reynaldo without knowing about <i>Hamlet</i> is nearly zero. It is much, much more likely that someone would ask, "What was the name of the servant to Polonius in <i>Hamlet</i>?" For this kind of question, this list would be useless. --<a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 19:06, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongest possible Delete</b>. The article's own title proclaims the non-notability of its subject. A list of characters who only appeared <i>once</i> in the course of a long-running TV show is such a extreme form of trivia and cruft I can't believe we're even discussing it. There has to be a point at which we say "Just because it is Simpsons-related, it is not automatically notable".

<li>Scratch what I wrote above. Upon looking at the list one more time, I find it as cumbersome and crufty as the one in discussion. What we need is a "List of celebrities" <i>ordered by the name of the celebrities</i>, instead of the characters they voiced or the episode numbers of their appearance.

<li><b>Comment</b> is their notability due to the fact that they are one-timers? if not, but due to their celebrity voices as suggested by another editor, why wouldn't there be List of two-time characters from The Simpsons, List of three-time characters from The Simpsons, <i>ad nauseum</i>? Moreover, if we have the precedent of this we'll have List of one-time characters from Star Trek, List of one-time characters from Sesame Street etc., and the analogous List of Biblical characters who appear in only one verse, List of Harry Potter characters who appear in only one book, etc. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 21:37, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Remote Access As a whole was the BBS package to run in the 90's as well if you look at the links on the BBS page it is listed there. It was the main runner in the 90's and I think this page will grow with time. Although I have been the one of the ones changing it I would like it to stay. I still run a bbs so I am biased, but in time this page will be like everything else on Wikipedia. IMHO this is the first Draft and will grow with time when old sysops look up there software. You know they are still out there. And this page is accurate. Vagabond

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm not sure why delete this entry would even be in question. RemoteAccess was one the most important pieces of software to hit the streets. It, with other BBS software, with their compliment of applications, forged the path to the commercial internet as we know it now. Omitting it from the Wikipedia would be like removing the civil war from US history books. If you aren't familiar with the subject matter, it doesn't necessarily make it insignificant nor not noteworthy.

<li><b>Question</b> What about this article have we not verified. It merely states the software exists. What more do you want? Open the archive and read the WHATSNEW.TXT for more then that. Were you some WWIV BBS fan or something? Seems this is a personal battle for you. It's just an entry in the Wikipedia, that will probably only be viewed by those that know what a BBS is anyway.

<p>What do you want? All we've heard is 'cite' this, and several links to wikipedia policies. We've cited. we've given websites, and documentaries that you can view for free. Honestly, what more do you want?<br />
I would really like to come to a consensus with this. The people involved with bbsing were notified, and they have spoken. I don't want this to develop into some wikipedia ego war. It's obvious that having this article considered for deletion was a mistake.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am the person who submitted the RemoteAccess artical to Wikipedia, and I admit I am am a noob to submitting articals here. The initial issue I had was Wikipedia said that the artical needed to be "Wiki'fied", so I asked for some assistance in a #BBS IRC channel, and Dopefish was kind enough to jump in and help out. Then we ran into the issue that someone had requested for it to be deleted, and it was discussed by several people on IRC, but it was certainly not my intent to turn this into a war. As I understand it, the real issue is that the software is considered "Notible" unless media (newspaper, magizine) sources are cited. This is difficult since RemoteAccess was popular before the world wide web explosion. Andrew (and most RA sysops) lost intrest in it by 1996. There was only one popular media-publication for BBS software that I know of, which was a magizine called Boardwatch. While Boardwatch did contain frequent articals on RemoteAccess, these articals would be difficult to locate because Boardwatch no longer exists. Incidently Andrew Milner was on the cover page of the January 1995 issue, standing next to his Jaguar. You can see a thumb sized image of it here: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991116131747/boardwatch.internet.com/mag/online95.html" class="external free" title="http://web.archive.org/web/19991116131747/boardwatch.internet.com/mag/online95.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/19991116131747/boardwatch.internet.com/mag/online95.html</a> Unfortunatly Boardwatch did not post the older issues from 1990-1994 on their web site, and even the later issues from 1995-2000 are not well archived by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Archive_a5d5.html" title="Internet Archive">Internet Archive</a> so most articals are lost. I think the best proof that RA existed, and its popularity can be cited by the large number of third-party utilities that were written for it. I have started adding links to RA specific files, and other links to prove not only that RA existed, but it was indeed very popular in its day. I will continue to search for more proof, but my concern is that someone will delete it before enough sources have been cited. Incidently, I have no commercial intrest in RemoteAccess. I was a RA beta tester since the early years, and I was also a North American RA Support Site. <a href="../../../p/c/m/User%7EPcmicro_f547.html" title="User:Pcmicro">User:pcmicro</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. RemoteAccess was a very important piece of BBS software. Computer stuff, specifically "online communications"/telecom/whatever predates the internet be several years.

<li><b>Comment</b> Guys, I understand your thoughts on this subject and how you can view it as popular, but the fact remains that Wiki does have policies and guidelines in place. If you could find old magazines, books or some form of hard copy at least that can back up your claims then this would be accepted by the wiki policies. The simpsons characters have pages because they meet all the standards. The claims are verifiable, not original research and presented in a neutral point of view. <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClintJCL_f2a6.html" title="User:ClintJCL">User:ClintJCL</a> I will remind you to remain <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and stop making <a href="../../../p/a/_/WP%7EPA_04e2.html" title="WP:PA">Personal Attacks</a>. You are making general statements about people whom you do not know. <a href="../../../m/y/l/User%7EMyleslong_0d1d.html" title="User:Myleslong">User:Myleslong</a>, I remember the BBS days and was using them on a 286 (with 640k of RAM and a 2400baud modem) long before the internet was around. I remember this software, and using it before being introduced to Gopher, Telnet, and finally the Internet. However, unless wiki's policies can be meet, the article can not be kept. This AFD is not about how many people raise their hands and say 'I remember the software, so let's keep the article' as the Admin who will make the call on keep or delete does not take those comments into concideration. Mainly what they look at is the arguments made and if the article passes all of wiki's standards. Also, it's not anyone's job to have to race all over wiki making AFD's. Instead of making personal attacks, contribute. Nominate those articles yourself if it bothers you so. Don't expect that it's someone else's job. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 02:01, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b><a href="../../../m/r/o/User%7EMroblivious1bmf_6e38.html" title="User:Mroblivious1bmf">Mroblivious1bmf</a>, I'm not taking this personally, nor am I engaging in personal banter. Someone is accusing people who this this article is worth deleting as being too young to know about the subject. I provided information disproving that. Also, note that the Articles for Deletion process is designed to get community input. Your views are not being heedlessly dismissed. Also remember that voting here is done by consensus, meaning that a majority is not enough to delete. If the article has merit as it stands, it will remain. Mr Obvious, how are we supposed to write a useful encyclopedia if we don't have a set of standards that govern what we will allow ourselves to publish? How are we supposed to verify that your, my, or anyone's submissions are accurate, for example, if this software has never been covered in the press? I hope you'll read <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and understand why we have these debates. I assure you that nobody here has anything against you or this software personally - it's just that many, many people try to use Wikipedia to publish announcements, opinionated statements, or unverifiable information. It's nothing personal - these articles just do not meet Wikipedia's standards. A word of caution: in the true Wikipedia spirit, voters/commenters should try to judge the merits of the article itself in the light of the rules (see <a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">WP:RULES</a>)--<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 20:32, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I understand the need for references, citations, etc, and why this is a big deal for Wikipedia. But couldn't we simply remove this article from AfD and instead put in a tag saying that citations are needed? I think that by now, even without "proper" citations, there should be little doubt that the software was actually notable. --<a href="../../../c/o/t/User%7ECotoco_32b8.html" title="User:Cotoco">Cotoco</a> 02:49, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> while a nice thought, the problem is the AfD process is almost over at this point. The 'citations' tag really is used to give the authors a chance to cite their sources before the Prod and then AfD is assigned. If it is notable, then there should be newspaper, magazine or books mentioning it. If so, then people should cite them. If people feel so strongly about a keep, then obey the process and wiki standards/guidelines, and do research and cite sources. The burden of proof is on the article writers to provide evidence that the article shouldn't be deleted...not visa versa. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 15:58, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<font color="blue"><font color="red">:: The RemoteAccess(ra) Scene

Where did the RemoteAccess scene go? this famous and in many eye's
infamous BBS-software. In early 1994 when the first Betas of RA was
realeased many sysops looked there eye's up and saw this BBS-software,
this software who was too easy to configurare that people never used
more than a few weeks to mod it and it was ready. A lot of PCB sysops
look'd at this pathetic software and wondered, was is this shit? and
took a look at it. They saw the most easiest to use menu system ever
being made to setup a board that even my kidbrother who is 7 years old
could start a BBS and make it popular.

Alot of newbie sysop's started to build there BBS:s in RemoteAccess and
soon almost 50% of the europian Bulletin Board Systems where RemoteAccess
certified And with alot of board running RA the modding people started to
build there groups to release "doors" to RA and to there own boards.

Around 1996 there where about hundrets of Modding-Groups active like:
RA-force, MAD, TRAP, RUDE, CROW, IDS, COT, COFFEE, NAILBOMB, NOVA STORM,
S!P, DX, XPress and alot more or less unknown groups. German was a big
holdout for alot of these groups.

You didn't have to do anything as a sysop, everything could be found at
most of these modding groups. As a lame newbie sysop you could find about
100 of LastCaller Doors, about 50 Note 2 Next User door, a total of 200
Doors with unknown features (like lamer-killers, random quotes and
userdupers) About 20 different rumour doors, somelike 300 page-the-sysop
doors, userlisters, bbslisters, userconfig doors, and even clocks you can
tell the user what the local time is (whaow!, i'm impressed!). And the
best - they all where free. Doors with shareware shit never got used
becouse RA-sysop's could always find a look-a-like door that was freeware.
With all these plugins/doors it wasen't hard for a newbie sysop to choose
system. Not to say all the utils that was available, status-doors, top
download/upload and so on...

As usual in the scene, all PCB-sysops got pissed off all these newbie
sysop's didn't know how to run a REAL board, so all the modding groups
As usual in the scene, all PCB-sysops got pissed off all these newbie
sysop's didn't know how to run a REAL board, so all the modding groups
started to say "now with pcb lightbars" / "now got pcb-ansi" / "pcb style"
so all RA-sysop's thought that was kewl, they will soon run a 100% pcb
clone. Alot of ideas to doors to RemoteAccess (RA) where directly taken
from the PCB modding groups, even the ansi where ripped, that's the main
reason the PCB-sysops got angry.

Well, as every good start it have to end, alot of modding groups died most
becouse of the "ideas" was empty, and the BBS-scene in general was fading
out, and worst of all - The Developers behind RA have stopped developing
it. Ofcouse was RA 2.50 not buggy but alot of sysop's wanted to see Even
more features but there it stopped.

RemoteAccess source code was later sold (expensive) to a man with name
"bruce morse" who still (today) is working on a new version but he seems
to work very very very slow so alot of RA-fans started to build there own
RA-clone's, as the structure of RA was free.

In 1998 the RA-scene is 100% dead, there is only 1 real active group left
producing RA doors - Coffee from UK - Respect!
One of the more famous RA-clones is "eleBBS" which is still in beta-status
and the GUI/windows version that is named "tcRemoteAccess/32" they are both
being developed and they are both in Beta-Stage, but they are not giving up
so respect to them too! They are both YK2.</font></font>

I assume that those, however, ARE of "encyclopedic value." This was very clever and I vote that it stays. I had it forwarded to me, and I have since forwarded it on to several family members and friends. With the Tigers gaining so much television and media exposure, and all with Rod Allen and Mario Impemba as the faces of these great Tigers, I would say that it falls into the category of current event relevance.

</ul>
</li>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="red"><b>Comment</b> I also want to remind people, one newspaper article does not make anything 'notable'. Notability standards usually require citing more than one major news source. Please look at a few of the Wiki guidelines. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wiki is not a Publisher of Original Thought</a> - Specifically - <i>Original inventions: If you invent the word frindle or a new type of dance move (or drinking game), it is not article material until a secondary source reports on it. Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day!</i> Since the newspaper article was written after the Wiki page, and refers specifically to the wiki page, the article is in violation of this rule. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Sources cite on an article must be Reliable</a> - Specifically - Wikipedia cannot cite itself as a source—that would be a self-reference. The newspaper article references the wiki article as a source, hence the wiki article would be self-referencing by using the newspaper article as a source to verify this game. The fact of the matter is, this article fails two of the Wiki policies on Article Standards. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">No Original Research</a>, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>, and the majority of anons in this discussion are not basing their statements on the Wiki Standards but on their personal feelings for a sports team. As it is jeff, I personally feel your stand holds no merit when applied to the Wiki Article Standards. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 15:57, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</font></font>
<ul>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="red">So are you trying to say that the article would be okay if the Detroit Free Press had written the article and I created it today? The point is simple: this article does not run afoul of any sourcing as the subject has been reported about in a third party publication. We are not citing the article as a source, the Detroit Free Press is the source. Whether they relied on Wikipedia for part of the article isn't relevant. My stand is entirely within policy and guideline here. Just because the article was created two days earlier than you may have preferred doesn't mean it's a bad article now. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:08, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</font></font>
<ul>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="red">Jeff, the article most likely would not have been written if the wiki article was not here. But beyond that, one mention in one newspaper does not make this notable. Notability, as a guideline, usually requires three or more major news sources for verification. There is only one local newspaper mentioning this 'game' in only one small article. That, by most standards, is not enough for notability...especially as the article was written after the wiki article, and the 'game' has been shown to have few ghits. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 16:41, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</font></font>
<ul>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="red">Speculation as to whether the article would exist without the wiki article coming into play is idle speculation at best. Notability, as a statement of fact, has <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">no official policy</a>. The article, as it stands, is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> by a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, so it should stay. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:50, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</font></font>

<li><font color="blue"><font color="red">So you will throw out the few ghits and the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> citations as not worth paying attention to in this discussion. Because one Local newspaper gave a small article to this game, it should have an article? Well, I have been mentioned in the Fargo/Moorhead Forum numerous times, so I should have a large article as well, right? It's Verifiable by a Reliable source right? No, we have to look at the trinity of the Standards and the wiki article must meet all three..Neutral POV, Verifiable, AND No Original Research. Since the only source for this game (before the newspaper article) was a blog where the author admitted to making up the game, and there are no media mentions before the wiki article (or this DFP article) was made, this falls into OR. The DFP article only refers to Wiki as a source, which makes citing the DFP article in the wiki article self-referencing. There is no mention of the blog on this DFP article. We may also want to look at the fact that the DFP newspaper may fall into a 'trivial' newsource. It is not a national paper (it's local only) and is not nationally known. No other newspapers or media have picked up on this 'game'. The game itself is only a locally known thing, and only because of the wiki article and this newspaper article. Nationally or world wide, it is just unknown. If you dismiss all that, the wiki article does fail OR, and if an article fails any of the three main Standards so harshly, then I believe there really isn't any reason for the article to exist.--<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 17:13, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</font></font>
<ul>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="red">Well, we're just running around in circles at this point. The article is verifiable by the Detroit Free Press (highly non-trivial and nationally known), it's NPOV, and no longer/doesn't fail original research. I'm failing to see the problem. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:36, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</font></font></li>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="red">The article is trivial in both length and content, it sources Wikipedia, and the Detroit Free Press is "nationally known" on the basis that it has "Detroit" in its name. It is still a local newspaper- it just happens to be in a large city. The original research still stands- where did the material come from? Blogs and message boards. What did the news article add to the wikipedia entry? Nothing. It apparently can't be stressed enough that this article is <b>self-referencing</b>. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 17:54, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</font></font>
<ul>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="red">So it's a stub in reality. No problems there. As for the Detroit Free Press, it's the 12th largest paper by circulation in the US, that stands for something. Whether the material came from blogs is irrelevant, truly - the information was important enough to be used in a newspaper article. The news article itself may not add anything new to the article proper, but it does infer notability and verifability that may not have existed before. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:09, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</font></font></li>

<li><font color="blue"><font color="red">Well, we are running around in circles, but I am not willing to concede to your point, jeff, that it somehow magically passes OR. Looking at the history <s>through untinted glasses</s> [Edit: I don't know if you are a Tiger's fan or not]] shows that this was OR when the AFD was created. The DFP article (trivial or not) still has the article falling short of multiple third-party sources. Since the article references Wiki as the source of this game, I can't, in good faith, accept the DFP article as a mention of notability or Verfibiliy. If the article had mentioned the blog AND there were other newspapers that had picked up on the story before the AFD, I would concede this had merit. As it stands, there isn't an article that references the blog (only verifiable source of this game outside of wiki), and so...it fails OR. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 17:58, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</font></font>
<ul>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="red">Well, this Red sox fan disagrees. It doesn't "magically pass" OR. It passes WP:OR easily, note the key phrase that applies here: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is <b>verifiability, not truth</b>." WP:V states "Articles should rely on credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy." The Detroit Free Press, <i>even if it notes the Wikipedia entry for this article</i>, meets this. The part you're attempting to cite here is at WP:RS: "Wikipedia is a tertiary source. Wikipedia cannot cite itself as a source—that would be a self-reference." Wikipedia is not citing itself in the article in question. The DFP article uses Wikipedia as a source, but that does not run afoul of policy. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:09, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</font></font></li>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="red">Then you run into issues with verifiability. Who do we have to verify this by? A few blogs and message boards, which are not reliable sources. What does the local newspiece say? That Wikipedia mentioned the game, so therefore the game must be notable because it is on Wikipedia. This is very circular logic. Please also take into account the length, relevance, and content of the article and not just the fact that it mentions the game. If the circumstances were the same, but the subject in question were a dog winning a local dog show, would you consider it notable? --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 18:39, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</font></font>
<ul>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="red">The newspiece cites Wikipedia as an example of how widespread the game's popularity has gotten. That doesn't mean they're treating Wikipedia as a source, nor would that disqualify it. If the circumstances were the same, but the subject in question were a local, unknown dog, maybe it'd be different. This isn't about a dog or a little-known event, though. People who don't watch dog shows typically don't know the names of the dogs. The Detroit Tigers aren't a dog show. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:43, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</font></font>
<ul>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="red">The newspiece is citing Wiki as an example of how 'widespread' the game's popularity is...but a google search does not back up that claim nor is Wiki an example of popularity as anyone can make an article here. Just look at all these AFDs around this one. Are they automatically 'popular' because they are on wiki? And the DT's are not a dogshow...Yes, you are correct in that, HOWEVER we are not talking about the DT's nor are we talking about the merits of the game's link to the DTs. We are talking about if this Game had any notability beyond the blog that stated they created the game and it merits a page based on such criteria as only having one questionable source....a personal Blog.

<ul>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="red">Okay, now we're getting somewhere. A Google search is a poor factor of notability, it's why we don't use Google as a verification tool when it comes to verifying notability. So we have to figure out what would be a proper notability situation. As it is a drinking game, it doesn't fit into the basic notability guidelines we have available, so let's look at another aspect: is it verifiable? The answer is yes. Is it original research? If it was before, it isn't now that it has the DFP mention. To quote the nonbinding notability essay (since you're insisting on notability here): "while all "famous" and "important" subjects are notable, not all notable subjects are famous or important." The article is verifiable, it doesn't run afoul of any major policies, so what's the problem? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:13, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</font></font>

However, in the course of writing the article, you contact the physicist and he tells you: "Actually, I now believe Theory X to be completely false."

Especially if you where 1 millionth in line and can verify this at time of creation, what happens wene your 1 millionth and 1 and cant cite it then? Its counter productuve as it means more work of deleting nn, wasting space etc.. we need a policy of what is not notable. Not a policy to make everyone in the line notable straight away. You wouldnt give a local newspapaer reporter an articlem but he or she has probably done more notable things then 70% + of these royals. <font face="Tahoma">MatthewFenton (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">contribs</a>)</font> 18:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes but its extremley unlikely he will ever come to the throne, if and when he has a claim to notability then he could have an article yet. having one "just in case" is unfair to those others who would like one "just in case" if and when he is notable i wouldnt object to an article but at the moment i do. <font face="Tahoma">MatthewFenton (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">contribs</a>)</font> 18:53, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>This really boils down to what an individual deems as "noteworthy" - I consider that someone born into the royal family of the UK and fairly high in the line of succession noteworthy, obviously you do not. We obviously won't agree, so lets see what happens!

<p>The result was: in this AfD there is a larger majority for deletion than in other AfDs for sub-stub biographies just above this entry on the line of royal succession, but I believe this is more due to the randomness of participation rather than because we're getting close to some magical limit on the line of succession where you're no longer automatically notable.

<p><b>Delete</b> It's unclear where we draw the line in relation to descendants of royalty. This person is not royal, she does not have the title "Her Royal Highness", or any other title, not even "Lady" or "The Honourable". My own view is that I would be prepared to treat all children and grandchildren of monarchs as inherently notable, which is a fairly low threshhold of notability, but this person is only a great-great-great-grandchild.

<li><b>Comment</b> as I have said previously, there has to be some sort of cut off point beyond which distant relatives of royalty are not inherently notable. Wikipedia is not paper, but there are limits. I previously suggested a cut off point of regarding the grandchildren of monarchs as inherently notable, but not beyond that. Some people are arguing for inclusion on the grounds that this person is in the line of succession to the British throne. This suggests an alternative cut off point. Fair enough, but I would point out that the <i>verifiable</i> line of succession to the British throne, on the British monarchy website, stops at 39 people, most of the wikipedia article on this subject is original research. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 10:43, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am the primary author of the article (at this point) and I disagree with the statement that there are many such field programs like this. Please provide examples. As far as I know there are not any other programs in the visual arts that combine such a range of sites through direct contact with the landscape as this program. I am eager to learn of any other models that exist as they would help the general effort of our work. In response to the question of importance, I am a bit confushed why references in scholarly publications preclude importance. Guess I always thought it should be a matter of 'both and'. Here is a list of additoinal citations and references about the program that are not included on the program website from a range of source types:</li>

<dd>It is my belief that the string of press we have consistently received (this is an edited list of web accessible materials) has substaintiated the notability of the program---in addition to it's uniqueness. As a co-director of the program it seemed to me to go on about how notable the program is would be to succumb to the creation of a vanity entry. I figured that portion of the entry is for others (than I) to expand upon. C dog taylor 15:52, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Most of the press you've received is limited to the local area or to academia. I admit that your program is unique, but Wikipedia is not a collection of the unique. It is an encyclopedia to chronicle notable people, events, inventions, scientific discoveries and phenomena, societies, etc. The key word there is <i>notable</i>. Unfortunately, unless your programme has received wide national exposure, or been involved in notable discoveries or experiments, then simply being a unique field study is not sufficient to imply notability. — <a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENMChico24_74ee.html" title="User:NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>NM</b></font></a><a href="../../../n/m/c/User_talk%7ENMChico24_41e0.html" title="User talk:NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>Chico</b></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NMChico24_752e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>24</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Mexico.svg_6b3a.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_New_Mexico.svg/25px-Flag_of_New_Mexico.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Mexico.svg_6b3a.html" /></a> 21:16, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I understand your concern for notability and do feel that you are not evaluating the material submitted from within its context. I welcome a review based on merits and content and thus far do not feel one has occured. It seems that a decision has been made early on and attempts to clarify or provide additional substaintiating material have not affected the view held. Being new to the world of Wikipedia, its formats, and protocals, perhaps the problem has more to do with syntax. If that is the case I welcome feedback that will allow progress to be made. If you would like to deem this entry a stub from our website and encourage other users to flesh out the entry that would be fine by me. My interest is in contributing to the network of ideas that are already underway (and referenced) within Wikipedia. Productive feedback on those fronts would be welcomed.</li>

<dd>The endowment grant from the Lannan Foundation is profoundly notable in the spheres of visual arts, literature, and academia. Their support of other projects included and referenced in Wikipedia is not a coincidence. The program is currently the subject of a book that will be published by the University of Texas Press. I would gladly make available a copy of that contract if you would like. I will also gladly furnish a full list of publications and press the program has received if that will help in the evaluation. It is a considerable list that ranges from the very local, correct, to national and international. This listing above are only references available online and they include a range that exceeds the local --- NPR, Princeton Architectural Press, CLUI Los Angeles.

<p>Ethnicity seems to be a troublesome word for the editor of the article. Although they Wiki-link to <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_groups.html" title="Ethnic groups">Ethnic groups</a> they seem to make a prejorative that includes anybody who is not them same as you as being "ethnic". That would go to include a supporter of a football team, political party, style of dress, who happened to live in the same household as oneself. <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinship.html" title="Kinship">Kinship</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_groups.html" title="Ethnic groups">Ethnic groups</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/b/Sub-culture.html" title="Sub-culture">Sub-culture</a> all become this big set of ethnic pigeon holes of taboo identity. As such, the list goes beyond anything it implies it is going to list. It redifines the scope of the criterea so that neologism and made at school could easily go unnoticed there. i like lists, lists are useful, if i can further research entries, but they are few and far between. Some groups are described as Black or white when there is cross cultural identification between members of different races. I list the <b>Afd</b> purely because the amount of editors involved would take months to resolve.I will not give any opions on its right to be a constituent part of Wikipedia. However, if it were to remain, discussion should be made on "What is ethnicity", because I think the editors have it very wrong. Based on that discussion, the article needs to be throughly edited to remove neologism, POV and slurs which are kinship/locality rather than generically ethnic. <s><b>NEUTRAL</b></s> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike33_94a4.html" title="User:Mike33">Mike33</a> 17:37, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bias? compare the opening paragraph:</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>The following is a <b>list of ethnic slurs</b> that are, or have been, used to refer to members of a given <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnicity.html" title="Ethnicity">ethnicity</a> in a derogatory or <a href="../../../p/e/j/Pejorative.html" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> manner in the English speaking world. A</i> slur <i>is a remark another person finds insulting. Ethnicity can be determined by either race, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationality.html" title="Nationality">nationality</a>, region, orientation, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socioeconomic.html" title="Socioeconomic">socioeconomic</a> class, because an ethnicity is a community of people possessing common physical or mental traits as a product of their common heredity or cultural tradition. Each term is listed followed by its country or region of usage, a definition, and (where applicable) a reference to that term.</i></p>
<p>With a problematic definition of <i>Ethnicity</i> from the UK census department.</p>
<p><i>How do you define ethnicity?</i></p>
<p><i>Definitions of what constitutes an 'ethnic group' or an 'ethnic minority' are subject to much discussion. In fact, there is no consensus on what constitutes an 'ethnic group' and the terminology used to describe these groups has changed significantly over time.</i></p>
<p><i>This is because membership of any ethnic group is something that is subjectively meaningful to the person concerned, and can be based upon a combination of categories such as:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>country of birth</li>
<li>nationality</li>
<li>language spoken at home</li>
<li>parents' country of birth in conjunction with country of birth</li>
<li>skin colour</li>
<li>national/geographical origin</li>
<li>racial group</li>
<li>religion</li>

<p>As far sighted as you may well be, the opening paragraph redefines <b>Ethnicity</b> in a way that does not match literary convention. Notice the way that <b>Because</b> is used. Given that the first amendment doesn't apply in the UK, ethinicity should not include <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socioeconomic.html" title="Socioeconomic">socioeconomic</a> class or orientation. The correct heading would thus be <b>List of hate slurs</b>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike33_94a4.html" title="User:Mike33">Mike33</a> 03:07, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b>. Slang and slurs are not just a thing of the past. They are a thing of today still. This article can be very useful for educational purposes, and help provide a better understanding of what words are not acceptable to certain races and groups. Often times, what a word means to my race or group, could be a derogatory slur against your race or group. It's the trouble with langauges that have common words with different meanings. Even if some of the slang being posted is not a historically used word, and is a relatively new word, it is still appropriate. It can let others better understand where racial/religious slurs originate from and later identify these words if you are subjected to them. Also, I agree with <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike33_94a4.html" title="User:Mike33">Mike33</a>, this would be a form of censorship if you removed this article. The way to deal with hatred and racism, is not to just ignore it and delete it. You have to face it, and knowledge is power. This list of ethnic slurs is not an article of racism or hatred, as it is not directed to someone nor encouraging negativity. It is clearly posted as an informational article and I believe that it should remain that way.<br />

<p><b>Nominee has a final say</b> ~ I never suggested that the article should be deleted because it included controversial terms. My Afd was based on ethnicity including socio-economical class, political affiliation and village/town/county to mean region. The vote is undoubtly against my nomination. Serious editors of wikipedia should help me redifine a new opening paragraph and remove all of the uncited entries and phrases which could be moved. I have never suggested deletion. Afd seemed a way to engage editors. Afd should not be abused, but discussion in the lists' talk page would take weeks or months and perhaps never be resolved. As an editor has mentioned above, this list has been used as source. <b>All editors have a duty</b> that sources on wikipedia can be tried and tested.

<p>Propose deletion of this 'article'. As a sydneysider, this looks mostly like some sort of joke; much of it certainly isnt enyclopedic. Such concerns have been raised by many on the article's talk page. The majority of the material cannnot be verified and is POV.

<dd>Agree. This sort of article - where the central definition is loose and unverified - always attracts casual editors who go in and describe, in exaggerated manner and at length, their favourite sketch comedy <i>trashy woman</i> stereotyped character. The external references listed in the article do not corroborate much, or any, of the article content. If it stays, the article <i>can not</i> contain a long list of characteristics; any characterteristic defined in the article must be backed-up by an external source <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 20:13, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> as it has been verified.

None of the results returned refer to the meaning or context of the term 'eastie' as meant by the wikipedia article in question. In fact the only relevant site in the results that displays this meaning of eastie, is the wiki article. So i'm not quite sure how your point is valid? Furthermore, if we narrow the search down to <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22easties%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryAU" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22easties%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryAU" rel="nofollow">Australian sites only</a> We get a mere ~1500. Most results refer to 'eastie' in a different meaning, and those results that are relevant appear on message boards and forums. The first point in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is 'Articles should contain only material that has been published by reputable sources.' There are almost no reputable sources around that verify the claims made in the article.

<p>Disregarding the mess above, I think the article should be deleted as well. I have slapped a notability tag on it last week but no reliable sources covering the wiki have been added. Currently the article fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The result of the last afd was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_WoWWiki_0631.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WoWWiki">keep</a> but no actual evidence of notability was given there either, other than the site having a high alexa ranking. The wiki has received about <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Special:Statistics" class="external text" title="http://www.wowwiki.com/Special:Statistics" rel="nofollow">22 million page views</a> but wikis with similar amounts of page views have had their article deleted or are being put up for afd at the moment. <a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 20:11, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as above, this fails WP:WEB, WP:NOT, and WP:V. (Two of those are policies, one is an interpretation of policy or what we call a guideline.) Just because a site uses the mediawiki software doesnot make it a notable. Just because a page has a high Alexa rank or a lot of content also does not make it notable.

<dd>Because other concerns have come up. Concencuses change. A quick search shows that it has good company. There seem to be articles 10,000 articles with second nomination for deletion. Also, how does the link convey notability? What recognition has this site gotten apart from those in the community of users of that game? Is there anything besides a lot of content, a good alexa rank, and the use of wikimedia software that would make the article notable in anyway? It's often argued that these sites are top in alexa for their gaming category .. That's not a good rationale for a seperate article, that's rationale for including the article in the external links list. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 12:36, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Obviously notable website if the game itself lays reference to it and links directly to it. What is the Alexa rank? and what are the daily hits etc. Without this information you cannot really say its not notable, yet its inclusion on the wow site says it has some major backing.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm a WoWWiki contributor, and would just like to set a few points straight: WoWWiki does have more and more well-notarized information about game lore and facts than any other WoW-related site, including <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/</a> itself. It is also <i>the</i> prime source of information on developing for the game (<a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Interface_Customization" class="external free" title="http://www.wowwiki.com/Interface_Customization" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowwiki.com/Interface_Customization</a>); there is no other site with the same information - <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.blizzard.com/" rel="nofollow">Blizzard's</a> sites included. So, as such, the wowwiki really <i>is</i> a unique information source about World of Warcraft. I also wonder how the "who links to the site" (mostly blogs and forums you say?) applies to begin with. Now, having said that, I'm not necessarily in favor of Wikipedia keeping the article, hence this being a comment rather than a vote for keeping; WoWWiki explains itself well enough. But, yes, I do think a link from the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> page is in order at the very least. --Mikeclueby4 05:18, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: See comment above. Wikipedia itself is mostly notable only because it's free and people don't want to pay for an on-line encyclopedia. It can arguably be said that Wikipedia itself fails WP:NOT (which is sad in its truth). I'm biased in that I'm an admin at <a href="../../../w/o/w/WoWWiki_90d8.html" title="WoWWiki">WoWWiki</a>, but I can pretty much guarantee that <a href="../../../w/o/w/WoWWiki_90d8.html" title="WoWWiki">WoWWiki</a> gets more hits than <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.wowwiki.com/Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia on WoWWiki</a>&#160;:-P <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFandyllic_70bf.html" title="User:Fandyllic">Fandyllic</a> 5:33 AM PDT 12 Aug 2006</li>

Has WoWWiki gotten any strong international press of this sort? Has it won any major web design awards? Ok. WoW users like free things, the site has a lot of information on the subject, and get lots of hits. So? How does that make it notable? This more of an argument to include it in the external links section of the WoW article than as its own article. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 14:59, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It also appears on the top 10 pages on Google for a search of "World of Warcraft", which returns 64,900,000 results. The fact that Wikipedia also references this Wiki numerous times backs up its notability. Also, I do not think it should be merged with the main WoW article as this would cause it to become to large, and many search engines including <a href="../../../m/s/n/MSN_9caf.html" title="MSN">MSN</a> will time-out while trying to index the whole page. --<a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriadoss_a3f2.html" title="User:Ariadoss">Ariad</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">o</font></a><a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriadoss_a3f2.html" title="User:Ariadoss">ss</a> 19:28, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Query from a non-dog enthuthiast</b>&#160;: shouldn't the question be whether the accidental breed exists and whether or not there is a better name for it? And let the person who created the file link to it? I'm pretty new to wikipedia and this is way outside my area of expertise — I have 2 kittens and no dogs — but just because a google search doesn't find squat doesn't eliminate things from existing and from having importance. I fell here through my interest in all things from Newfoundland and Labrador and I noted with interest the link from the Labrador Retriever to the Bordador and its speedy deletion. Just my opinions. <a href="../../../i/a/i/User%7EIainsona_c670.html" title="User:Iainsona">Iainsona</a> 02:06, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The mix is recognized by an organization known as the American Canine Hybrid Club, which seems dedicated apparently to coming up with catchy names for cross-bred dogs: The "Cock-A-Chon" anyone? (I'm serious.) This is just what it sounds like: a cross breed. That's not good or bad, but its name and "genealogy" - as well as the particulars of this article and its assumptions - are fantasy. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECMacMillan_ef05.html" title="User:CMacMillan">CMacMillan</a> 04:32, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>However</b> -- You must admit that he is totally cute though. Since I got him from the SPCA I have come across very many dogs of the same mix here in California. The rural areas of the state have many working border collies and Labradors and the mixes are adopted out at the urban SPCAs throughout the state in fairly large numbers. I'm sure many other states (and countries) have a similar experience. People around here are regularly calling them Bordadors. No one intentionally breeds them and I hope no one ever does -- there are far too many wonderful homeless dogs being killed at shelters every day. If you use the advanced search function on Dogster.com (a tiny fraction of the world's dogs are represented on the site) you will currently find 333 dogs under Labrador/Border Collie and an additional 346 listed under Border Collie/Labrador. That is 679 on Dogster alone, suggesting huge numbers in the world in total. Why shouldn't all of the guardians of these dogs (and all other people) have a word to easily describe their dogs? Just because no one is irresponsibly intentionally bringing more puppies into a world with an enormous dog over-population? Sorry, but I just don't get it. Words come into usage because they are useful.</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. As pointed out, when we have articles on RPG character classes, they generally discuss their role in the fictional universe. This is a game guide with the class' stats and everything. If it is copied from a manual it may violate copyright. The deletion of this article does not prejudice something, to quote a 'weak keep', "something more descriptive and less howto". --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:29, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Why Delete</b></p>
<p>While I agree this particular article is kind of obscure (and the current reason given is far more suitible than the previous one), it is well recorded from the original source (The Complete Warrior book) and, since there's an entire list of prestige classes, each with a link that is actually REQUESTING INFORMATION be added, it doesn't make sense to, when someone says, "ok, here is the exact information from the source" delete it.</p>
<p>I've removed my post from the discussion section of the warshaper article to bring it here.</p>
<p>{ Previous post from 'discussion' on Warshaper Article }</p>
<p>why, precisely was this page scheduled for deletion?</p>
<p>"nn, ue - scary stuff!" doesn't seem to qualify for deletion. It may simply be my searching skills, however I can't actually make heads or tails of what that means either.</p>
<p>The reason given below (simply saying that someone who came across the article who was unfamiliar with the subject matter would be lost) also seems a poor reason... that's true with many things (take physics for instance), though Wikipedia doesn't delete articles about that either. I attempted to rectify the problem and, since I am not skilled with linking, simply wrote some description and gave directions to search better, and invite anyone to improve upon this work. So... yeah.</p>

<p>{ End of Previous Post }</p>
<p>One other point to ponder. While the majority of articles in the list actually focus on the prestige class as it relates to the fictional world (most of which are actually quite well maintained) this particular piece seems to be more how it relates to the 'real world' (i.e. actual mechanics), although with RP's, at least in terms of what is and is not "cruft", I would guess that this would seem to be blurred or even reversed. Nonetheless, technically, this is less "crufty" (if that's a word), at least going by what I understand the definition to be, than the other pieces that are NOT nominated for deletion.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> since we're not a game guide ("How to become a Warshaper"). If there's anything which can be <b>merged</b> to an article on the game itself, that's the best place for it. Just because there are "cruftier" articles which exist currently doesn't mean that any specific article should do so. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 00:08, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Discussion</b>. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_prestige_classes.html" title="List of prestige classes">List of prestige classes</a> has over a hundred of these classes. I don't think they can all be combined in the prestige classes article in this depth, nor do I think this is the D&amp;D Wiki. I would say that an article of this depth would be great there, and what would be more appropriate for Wikipedia is a one-paragraph blurb on the class...in the aforementioned list. So I've got weak delete arguments fighting with weak keeps internally. At this time, I make no recommendation in either direction, but I reserve the right to reconsider based on further discussion. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 00:40, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>speedy keep</b>, though this was a close call. Nominating an article hoping that it gets kept to set a precedent contradicts general expectations that those who nominate articles for deletion want them deleted. This comes close to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and may qualify under <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_keep_5dff.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy keep">Wikipedia:Speedy keep</a> as such and may also fit the description of a situation in which "No-one other than the nominator recommends that the page be deleted, and the nominator either withdraws the nomination, or wishes the page to be moved, merged, or have something else done to it other than deletion. Also, there are some cases where the nominator specifies they are nominating for the sake of process, for someone else, or some other reason but are not stating an opinion themselves. These are also to be kept." This seems to be a <i>nomination for the sake of process</i>, and the <i>nominator has stated he wishes for an outcome besides deletion</i> (in this case, a keep). <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 01:03, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please do not treat this as a personal attack on Wookieepedia. Lostpedia, a wiki for the ABC series Lost, has had its page deleted based on this policy. I hope that Wookiepedia survives this review and a precedent is set for other articles on Wikipedia. A quick look at the stats of both sites shows that Lostpedia, with an Alexa rating of 11,175, has over 19 million page views. Wookieepedia reports 8.9 million page views. The Alexa rating for this site includes all of Wikia, so those stats don't compare. The Wookieepedia article does not list any notable external references to the site, whereas Lostpedia was listed in <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_30/b3994072.htm?chan=tc&amp;chan=technology_technology+index+page_more+of+today's+top+stories" class="external text" title="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_30/b3994072.htm?chan=tc&amp;chan=technology_technology+index+page_more+of+today's+top+stories" rel="nofollow">businessweek.com</a> and was a <a href="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/sites/sfw13095.html" class="external text" title="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/sites/sfw13095.html" rel="nofollow">Scifi.com site of the week</a>. --<a href="../../../j/a/b/User%7EJabrwocky7_f09c.html" title="User:Jabrwocky7">Jabrwocky7</a> 23:58, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I could riff on these articles all night long and think of hundreds more questions like <b>"Can we someday regenerate severed limbs?"</b> and <b>"Can we someday spontaneously generate a third bionic eye that is capable of sending and receiving text messages?"</b> This parlor game of free-association regarding such "unsolved problems" in question form has no parameters and thus no end. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 20:37, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm glad it's so obviously "rediculous" [sic] to you. Maybe you can explain why you think "problem" is NOT a subjective (that means "matter of opinion") term? What constitutes a "problem"? Seriously. And since these articles are filled with open-ended free-association loaded questions, (some are almost as bad as the old Groucho Marx loaded question "Do you still beat your wife?") how can you deny that unsourced questions that wonder if mankind will ever achieve certain things are anything but speculation, and therefore POV/OR? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 21:13, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, because there are verifiable, citable sources at to what is or isn't an unsolved problem in a field.

<dd>There are unsolved problems in every field that when solved, will advance knowledge in that field to a new level. Division by zero comes to mind as an example. Lists of those questions are attractive to the intellectually curious.

<li><b>Keep</b> I see I am tilting at windmills, but these articles are a bit of a work in progress, so they may need to have more content added.

My reasoning is partly that the group includes information about the relationships between geographic features in the capital of Canada, the transit way system in Ottawa is unusual, with different bus routes for different uses, (region wide, local, express, etc) once one has compiled this information it can be used by menay folks who are interested in other aspects to extract knowledge. It would not be hard to imangine articles on points of interest in the capital linking to the bus routes that serve then to allow the link-to to be used to find what is logicaly accessible by the OC transpo system.cmacd 18:10, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>* Ok you can trash all the remaining bus route pages but I though of doing <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bus_routes_in_London_60e4.html" title="List of bus routes in London">this</a> instead but with just the starts and ends or terminals of routes. P.S If Wikipedia is not a bus schedule, then all the London U.K bus route pages should go for deletion as well no matter the history except maybe route 30 as it was the route where the double decker bus exploded on 7/7/05. --<a href="../../../j/f/o/User%7EJForget_e21d.html" title="User:JForget">JForget</a> 23:51, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for that Deenoe - so I think the result of this discussion is to <b>delete</b> the expresses, peak, and routes 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 85, 87, 99, 118, 125, 145, 154 &amp; 182 route articles.
