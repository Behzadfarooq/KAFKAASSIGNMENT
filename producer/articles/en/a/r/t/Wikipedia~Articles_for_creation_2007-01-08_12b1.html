<p>Mikea is a social identity for Malagasy speaking horticulturalists/foragers of southwestern Madagascar. Mikea identity is flexible and complex, linked to living in the forest and using forest resources. Foraging and maize horticulture connect the Mikea with local, regional, and global economies. Being Mikea also entails managing connotations of primitivism with the social and economic consequences of government, researcher, missionary, and tourist interest in hunter-gatherers.</p>

<p>Horse Chestnut (born on 19 August 1995)is a champion thoroughbred racehorse bred in South Africa by Harry and Bridget Oppenheimer at their Mauritzfontein Stud in Kimberley. He won the South African Triple Crown and was awarded both Horse of the Year and Champion 3-year-old Colt at three. He ran 10 races, winning 9 and being placed 3rd once. Some notable wins include the Group I J&amp;B Met over 2000m by 8-and-a-quarter lengths, the Group I SA Derby over 2450m by 10 lengths and the Group I Classic over 1800m by 4 lengths. In his only international race, the Group III Broward Handicap over 1700m, Horse Chestnut won by 5-and-a-half lengths. During his preparation for the Group I Donn Handicap, Horse Chestnut fractured a piece of his splint bone on his near-foreleg, resulting in his early retirement from racing. The Oppenheimer's subsequently sold the majority of shares in Horse Chestnut to Seth Hancock's Claiborne Farm in Kentucky where he went to stud.</p>
<p><br />
Horse Chestnut was sired by the champion stallion Fort Wood (USA) out of the South African broodmare London Wall. His pedigree includes such big names in thoroughbred breeding as Fall Aspen (USA), Sadler's Wells (USA), Shantung (FR), Grey Sovereign (GB), Hail To Reason (USA) and Northern Dancer (USA).</p>
<p><br />
Some of Horse Chestnut's most notable offspring include Lucifer's Stone, Spanish Chestnut, Smart Enough and Fete.</p>

<p><b>Football Club Woot</b> (<b>FC Woot</b>) is a <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> club currently based in <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runcorn.html" title="Runcorn">Runcorn</a>. The club was formed in November 2006 by <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runcorn_F.C._Halton_bd24.html" title="Runcorn F.C. Halton">Runcorn</a> supporters, many of whom decided to withdraw their financial support for the club following the clubs decision to move the club away from Runcorn. FC Woot currently enjoy a healthy rivalry with FC Riverside and Riverside Plate.</p>
<p>FC Woot have become something of a cult figure amongst the Runcorn population, with local newspapers reporting the games frequently. FC Woot‚Äôs first season is currently being played with the team making a respectable start against tough opposition. Manager Karl Sch√∂n was unavailable for the beginning of the season due to personal reasons, which will also be a contributing factor to the teams less than impressive start.</p>
<p>Regardless of the start, both the club and the fans have high hopes for the current season.</p>

<p>The club was formed by the ideas of current player Gareth Reed and current manager Karl Sch√∂n. In <a href="../../../n/o/v/November.html" title="November">November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> the club officially joined the league and, after a pre season friendly with rivals Riverside Plate, played their debut match on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_5.html" title="December 5">5 December</a> against <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beechwood.html" title="Beechwood">Beechwood</a> resulting in a 3-1 defeat for <a href="../../../f/c/_/FC_Woot_d293.html" title="FC Woot">FC Woot</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Before the season began, <a href="../../../f/c/_/FC_Woot_d293.html" title="FC Woot">FC Woot</a> played a friendly match against rivals Riverside Plate resulting in FC Woot suffering a crippling 9-1 defeat against a much stronger side. In the disappointment of the result though, history was made that day. Striker Gareth Reed scored the first goal in the club‚Äôs history. The early defeat dented the confidence of the side going into the season. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> The first match of the season also resulted in defeat, 3-1 the score this time against a strong <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beechwood.html" title="Beechwood">Beechwood</a> side. <a href="../../../f/c/_/FC_Woot_d293.html" title="FC Woot">FC Woot</a> however, put these defeats behind them and on the <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_19.html" title="December 19">19 December</a> they recorded the first win in their history with a 3-2 victory over Runcorn FC. This result was flattering for Runcorn as they were dominated by <a href="../../../f/c/_/FC_Woot_d293.html" title="FC Woot">FC Woot</a> throughout. The first match of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> however, <a href="../../../f/c/_/FC_Woot_d293.html" title="FC Woot">FC Woot</a> took a big step back with another poor performance against the Pavillions Veterans, losing 5-1. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Many blame the defeat on the winter break resulting in a lack of preparation and consistency.</p>

<p>Acapello Ahddub is a band founded by south london musicians Harry Wingfield and Patrick Christie in 2006. Their most notable hit is the "classical" version of their song 'the Buddhist WAY', which won the award for 'best new-age song' in the Stirling awards. They are heavily influenced by Buddhism and non-violence, and their name, Ahddub, was created by writing Budhha backwards. They are working on their second album due for relaese in 2009, named 'Stop! that's not the way'</p>

<p>Smith &amp; Sons Cafeteria (or S&amp;S Cafeteria, as it is more commonly known) is a small chain of cafeteria-style restaurants in the deep south that serve traditional home-cooked style foods, such as roast beef, mashed potatoes, fried okra, etc. The first S&amp;S was started in Columbus, GA. in 1936. Later on, they moved their corporate headquarters to Macon, GA, where they currently operate two of their restaurants. They also have locations in Atlanta, Augusta, and in South Carolina and Tennessee. They had a restaurant in Roanoke, Virginia, but due to the falling popularity of cafeteria and home cooked foods, they were forced to close their doors. Through their S&amp;S Food Administrators, they also provide food service to hospitals, nursing homes, and certain industries.</p>
<p>For people who wish to have S&amp;S style food at home, they also sell food mixes for their biscuits, beef gravy, cornbread, dressing, whipped potatoes, and poultry gravy.</p>

<p>1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre By, Melissa Ishikawa Intro: Imagine, in only two single days, ten thousand people are severely injured or killed. The survivors are either imprisoned, or sentenced to death. Only because they lead a protest against the government. But they took it too far, and got too violent. Did the citizens and students of Beijing, China deserve the punishment for taking a stand for what they believed in? Summary of What Occurred: Tiananmen was built in 1417 in the Ming dynasty. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, no public square existed at Tiananmen, the area was filled with offices for imperial ministries. Tiananmen Square was badly damaged after the Boxer Rebellion. So the area was cleared to build the Tiananmen Square. Tiananmen Square has held many political events such as the proclamation of the Peoples Republic of China lead by Mao Zedong on October 1, 1949, and for mass rallies during the Cultural Revolution. It also held a number of protest movements such as the May Fourth Movement of 1919 for science and democracy, protests after the death of Zhou Enlai in 1976, and the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Many problems existed in China even four years before the unfortunate event at Tiananmen Square. Leader Deng Xiaoping‚Äôs ideas focused more on economic reform. The west made an assumption that this would slowly move china towards capitalism and democracy. ‚ÄúThe Chinese thought of a compromise between a market economy, a command economy, and a socialist economy [would] be possible. However, the Chinese seemed to be having spurts‚Äîmoving ahead, then stopping.‚Äù Said Pye, who is an expert on China. When Deng began his reforms, discontent grew and led to agricultural problems, leading to government to give peasants IOUs instead of cash for their grain. Because of Deng‚Äôs reforms industry slowed, including low labor productivity and slothfulness. Large differences between state-set and free-market prices created difficulties, including an overheated economy and high levels of corruption (Tinanmen Square Protests of 1989). The workers of China were against Stalinism and capitalism. (Conachy). About five thousand unarmed troops were turned back by students and citizens as they attempted to reach Tiananmen Square on foot on June 3, of 1989. Later that day, police of Beijing fired tear gas on crowds gathered near the Zhongnanhai leadership compound. In the late afternoon of that day, ten to fifteen thousand troops in large trucks and convoys moved toward the city center. The troops in the trucks and convoys were helmeted and armed with automatic weapons. By the evening of June 3, the crackdown at Tiananmen Square had begun. Trucks and tanks came into the city from several different directions. Civilians turned out in massive numbers to prevent the troops from advancing on the square for seven hours! Demonstrators set things on fire, and besieged troops with rocks, bottles, and bricks. PLA troops broke the windows of shops, banks, and other buildings. A column of fifty tanks and trucks entered Tiananmen from the east on the morning of June fourth, 1989. ‚ÄúMore than seventy tanks moving at fast speed headed toward the square‚Äù. This was within an hour, reported nearby cable fifteen. Deaths from the military assault on Tiananmen Square range from one-hundred-eighty to five-hundred! Thousands more had been injured. One woman said she witnessed one tank running over eleven people. About ten thousand people were killed and/or injured in the Tiananmen Square Massacre (Tiananmen Square, 1989 The Declassified History). A total of forty thousand soldiers moved into the Tiananen Square in the night of June 3, 1989. Some forty thousand people were arrested in only June and July after the Tiananmen Square Massacre, and dozens of workers were sentenced to death (Conachy). The violence had occurred in the night between June 3rd and 4th of 1989 (Tiananmen Square, 1989 The Declassified History). Pye also says, ‚ÄúTiananmen has become a word that fits in politics, like Hiroshima, the Berlin Wall, and Pearl Harbor‚Äù (Tinanmen Square Protests of 1989). Conclusion: The 1989 massacre at Tiananmen Square is an event no one will ever forget in history. It was a time of corruption, disagreement, and poor leadership. Tiananmen in Beijing, China is a place where thousands lost their lives within two days. It is a place of sorrow and anger. Like Pye has said before, ‚ÄúTiananmen has become a word that fits in politics, like Hiroshima, the Berlin Wall, and Pearl Harbor‚Äù. It is a date and event no one will ever forget, and shows what anger and violence can do to a society.</p>

<p><br />
Born in Europe, raised in Africaand now in America, Fishe` is a profoundly gifted and outspoken Nigerian U.S based lyricist that can rightfully be said to transcend continental boundaries.</p>
<p>Real named Andrew Mosheshe, Fishe` was bred in one of the most volatile regions in the West- African nation of Nigeria; Warri, where incessant gunfire and explosions are an almost everyday occurrence where Fishe` recalls miming the words to rap songs as a kid before turning introspective as a young teenager, creatively penning down words at a furious clip about the misery he'd constantly witness on the streets around him from arson and murder to thievery and constant tribal hostilities. Using his wits not only to stay alive, Fishe` developed a knack for catching the action of whatever he saw within his rhymes and within a short period of time had gained popularity performing on major university campuses across Nigeria before arriving the U.S to advance his music career in the middle of 2004.</p>
<p>After departing his homeland Nigeria, within a year he came up with the self- release of his debut E.P Moment of Truth mostly produced by Swedish based production outfit IMA Music Group and within months thereafter secured a one year deal with Californian based indie label, Random Records Inc/BeatDown productions. His debut E.P grossed thousands in sales in the U.S and tens of thousands in Nigeria where he receives constant radio rotations and the video for the first single Where I'm From <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ax0PIjR4_v4" class="external free" title="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ax0PIjR4_v4" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=ax0PIjR4_v4</a> is played regularly on t.v stations across the nation as well as on MTVBase.</p>
<p>His music is undoubtedly original, devoid of any pretence, explicitly blunt and poignant and can sometimes be constructively critical and apolitical. With beats highly syncopated, stripped down and organic, the result is an in-your-face brand of hip hop that sounds like no other but possesses the heart and muscle of the best MCs out there.</p>
<p>With an instantly identifiable accent Fishe` possesses the strength and tenacity to make a more impact in the American hip hop scene with his phenomenal rhyme ethic. Fishe is currently working on his next release which is billed to be distributed by Universal music Group.</p>

<p>John Ruffo and his associate, Edward (ED) J. Reiners, developed an elaborate scheme which defrauded more than ten banks of $350 million dollars. Reiners, a former employee of Phillip Morris, went to several banks and pretended that he was in charge of a ‚Äútop-secret‚Äù project for the tobacco company. Ruffo introduced himself as being in charge of purchasing computers for this phantom project. Reiners and Ruffo used the money that they borrowed from the banks to invest in the stock market. According to investigators, both lost miserably in the market.</p>
<p>Over the course of two years, the "project" that Ruffo and Reiners thought up kept growing and growing. Nine US and international banks were on-board. The con men met with Vice Presidents from these banks, convincing them to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars to the bogus operation. The plan unraveled when an official from the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan called Phillip Morris and asked for Reiners. He was shocked to hear that Reiners hadn't worked there in almost three years.</p>
<p>The con men were arrested and convicted. Reiners is currently serving a 16 and a half year sentence.</p>
<p>In March 1996, John Ruffo was convicted of one-hundred sixty counts of bank fraud, money laundering, wire fraud and conspiracy. He cost several foreign and U.S. banks more than three-hundred fifty million dollars. Ruffo pleaded guilty and was sentenced to seventeen years in prison. Ruffo was released on ten-million dollars bail. On November 9th, 1998, authorities ordered him to report to prison in Fairton, New Jersey. Ruffo never did. Later that day, Ruffo‚Äôs rental car was found at JFK airport. Authorities had believe John Ruffo had escaped American jurisdiction, however Ruffo was last seen April 3, 2001, in Duncan, Oklahoma where he attempted bank fraud with two local banks. This time the scam involved $250,000,000.00 incoming wire transfers from Nigeria.</p>

<p>Joyce Holms left school at the age of sixteen with nothing but a love of words and some credit for having published the school magazine. Now she is known for her creative use of language and quotes from her books are to be included in the new edition of the Oxford English Dictionary. She has worked in a variety of jobs, from fashion model to hotel owner, and ultimately as a private detective in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
<p>She began her professional career by writing short stories for women‚Äôs magazines and the BBC. These were followed by both historical and contemporary romances. However, since working in the detective agency Holms has achieved success as a crime writer. Currently living between Edinburgh and the South of France, she is now working on the tenth in her Fizz and Buchanan series.</p>
<p>One of the two eponymous characters in her crime series, Fizz Fitzpatrick, undoubtedly grew out of the female protagonists in her earlier romantic works where Miss McIntosh and Miss Frazer are confident and capable women. The Masquerade historical romances are set during and shortly after the Jacobite rebellion of 1745. The last in that series, set during the Peninsular Wars of the 18th. Century languishes unpublished, rejected on the basis that it was ‚Äúmore of romp than a romance‚Äô‚Äô These early works set the tone for Holms‚Äôs crime novels where wit, humour and very capable female protagonists are key notes.</p>
<p>The Fizz and Buchanan series is set mainly in Edinburgh, a douche gentle Edinburgh and not the dark and bleak city of Ian Rankin‚Äôs Rebus novels. To quote Rankin ‚ÄúWhile Edinburgh probably isn‚Äôt as rough tough and gangster strewn as I represent it in the Rebus novels, it almost certainly is as quirkily humorous as Joyce Holms shows it to be‚Äù.</p>
<p>Fizz‚Äôs associate in the series, Tam Buchanan, personifies the civilised side of the city. A 30 year old lawyer, Buchanan‚Äôs life seems predictable and terminally uneventful until Fizz "like a Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse" inveigles her way into his law practice and his life.</p>
<p>The novels, strong in plot, characterisation, wit and sense of place, although set mainly in Edinburgh, take the reader all over Scotland from Berwick-upon-Tweed to Achiltibuie in the North West Highlands. Holms‚Äôs love of the Scottish Highlands and empathy with it‚Äôs culture shows in these books as it did in her early short stories in women‚Äôs magazines and for the BBC. End.</p>

<p>p-Chlorophenylalanine is known non-generically as Fenclonine. It reduces serotonin levels by inhibiting (irreversible inhibition) an enzyme involved in the synthesis of serotonin. (tryptophan hydroxylase)</p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1185998" class="external free" title="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1185998" rel="nofollow">http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1185998</a></p>
<p>p-Chlorophenylalanine is an Analog of phenylalanine. p-Chlorophenylalanine inhibited the growth of, and was toxic to neuroblastoma cells in animal models. (mice)</p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/166/3911/1433" class="external free" title="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/166/3911/1433" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/166/3911/1433</a></p>
<p>The effect of p-chlorophenylalanine is potentiated by pargyline. p-Chlorophenylalanine depletes brain serotonin and induces longlasting sexual excitation in male rats. Administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan to rats treated with p-chlorophenylalanine plus pargyline blocks the sexual excitation. (Increased levels of 5-HTP may act to partially offset the action of p-Chlorophenylalanine; though a logical conclusion, this was not stated explicitly in the reference and so may be unsuitable for Wikipedia, as it constitutes original research/speculation)</p>

<p><b>Portable Cord</b></p>
<p>A <b>portable cord</b>, which is also known as portable cordage or flexible cord, is a cable with multiple conductors used for functions requiring flexibility. The bendable cord can be employed for power in a range of applications, such as operating motors in small and large tools, equipment, power extensions, appliances and machinery.</p>
<p>Portable cords may be used in commercial, industrial and residential applications. They work well on jobsites where resistance to oil, chemicals and abrasion is vital and also perform well in extreme environments - both the heat and the cold, outside or inside. Additionally, some portable cords can be water-resistant or water submersible. Because of their characteristics, portable cords are commonly utilized in a range of facilities, such as construction sites, mills, mines, sports complexes, or even marinas.</p>
<p>Although the construction of a portable cord varies depending on the type, a standard cord has at least two stranded copper conductors. The copper stranding, insulation and jacket directly influence the physical properties of the cord.</p>
<p>A variety of portable cords, differing in styles, lengths and thicknesses, exist in the marketplace. Common types include Type SJT, SVT, SEOW, SJ, SJOW, SO and SOW. Each has specific applications associated with it. All portable cords are usually comprised of thermoset, thermoplastic elastomer, or thermoplastic. Thermoset cords have heavy-duty-grade rubber jackets and are extremely sturdy. Thermoplastic elastomer cords have medium-duty-grade thermoplastic elastomer jackets and perform well in cold conditions. Thermoplastic cords have a light-duty plastic compound jacket and thus work for light-duty use.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Portable Cord Connotations</b></p>
<p>The letters used to describe portable cords hold significance. Below are the meanings for each letter.</p>
<p>S = 600 Volt Service Cord J = Junior Service - 300 Volt T = Thermoplastic E = Elastomer - thermoplastic that looks and feels like rubber O = Oil Resistant Outer Jacket OO = Oil Resistant Outer Jacket and Oil Resistant Insulation W = CSA Weather and Water Resistant (approved for indoor and outdoor use)</p>
<p><b>Safety</b> Even though portable cords are essentially safe, always handle them carefully. Breakage in a portable cord could be a potential hazard, so be certain equipment is running properly. A qualified person should inspect contractor-grade portable cords before and after each use to check for damage.</p>

<p>The Nottebohm case standed in front of the International Court of Justice in 1953. The Applicant was Lichtenstein and the Respondent was Guatemala.</p>
<p>The case in dispute regarded the granting of the Lichtenstein nationality to Mr. Nottebohm. The ICJ decided that Mr. Nottebohm could not claim his being a Lichtenstein national, unless there had been a solid connection between him and the State of Lichtenstein.</p>
<p>This particular decision of the ICJ is usually cited as the case-law solving the problem of effective nationality of persons who are nationals of more than one states.</p>

<p><br />
The watershed, or drainage basin, of the Black River consists of some 202 square miles in southeastern Vermont, almost all of which lies in Windsor County.</p>
<p>The Black River begins in a small body of water called Black Pond, in Plymouth, Vermont. Winding its way toward the town of Ludlow, its narrow flow picks up a variety of small brooks and streams and is cooled by overhanging branches. Passing through Amherst Lake, Lake Rescue, and Echo Lake, the Black River picks up more tributaries and winds through the town of Ludlow, the home of Okemo Mountain Ski Resort. Tumbling through impressive Cavendish Gorge, the river widens as it passes under the Downers Covered Bridge and enters Perkinsville.</p>
<p>The North Branch of the Black River, its headwaters in Reading, VT, joins the main stem in Weathersfield at the flood control dam. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers between 1957-60, the dam holds back waters to protect the downstream towns of North Springfield and Springfield from floods.</p>
<p>The Black River pushes on through these final two towns, past small dams and many industrial sites, until its final confluence with the mighty Connecticut River at Hoyt's Landing, across from New Hampshire's Fort No. 4 in Charlestown.</p>
<p>Since the settlement of Springfield in the mid-1700's, the river has been at its heart. A source of power for the many industrial factories built on her shores, many small hydro dams were built near the impressive Comtu Falls in the center of Springfield.</p>
<p>Flooding was a common occurrence on the Black River, and there are many residents who still remember the rampage of 1927. A late-season tropical storm brought torrential rains to the lower towns of the watershed in early November. The small tributary streams overflowed their banks, gushing thousands of gallons of cold water into the already turbid waters of the Black River. Homes were lost, hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage was done, and businesses were destroyed. However, citizens pulled together to save each other and to rebuild their towns and communities.</p>
<p>In recent years, citizens have pulled together to take part in improving the health and in celebrating the heritage and recreation of the Black River, from the Lake Rescue Association and its invasive plant removal activities to the Black River Action Team and its annual cleanup project, visual assessment, and educational programs.</p>
<p>From the lakes in Plymouth to the mountain in Ludlow, from the gorge in Cavendish to the trails and waterfall in Springfield, the Black River is a must-see in Windsor County. There are many sites for recreation, whether a paddle trip, bicycle tour or hike is planned.</p>

<p>Roron Corrob was an Ithorian Jedi during the time of the clone wars. He was the apprentice of Yarel Poof, and fought with a blue lightsaber. When Courascant was under attack, he, Foul Moudama, and Shaak Ti were to get Supreme Chanceller Palpatine to safety. General Grievous and his bodygaurds followed them. The bodygaurds were defeated, but Grievous killed Corrob and Moudama, trapped Shaak Ti, and captured the chanceller. Roron Corrob appeared only inthe Star Wars: Clone Wars cartoon.</p>
