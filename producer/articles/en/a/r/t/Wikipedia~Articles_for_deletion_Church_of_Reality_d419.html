<p>The Church of Reality ironically doesn't appear to exist within the realm of reality. it appears to be someone's idea of a joke religion, that isn't very funny. 3,300 google hits, mostly on infidel message boards and the like, and it is POV. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 10:32, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The Church of Reality has existed for 7 years, it returns 2610 hits on Google and has been granted a registered trademark by the United States.

<li>I'm not religious in the least, so you needn't worry about that being a motivation (I was actually quite active in the Bay Area freethought communities when I lived out there). I have here a page from <a href="http://marc.perkel.com/archives/000658.html" class="external text" title="http://marc.perkel.com/archives/000658.html" rel="nofollow">your blog</a> which says that the Chuch was about to launch in December 2004, and another from July 2004 saying you were still <a href="http://marc.perkel.com/archives/000301.html" class="external text" title="http://marc.perkel.com/archives/000301.html" rel="nofollow">working on its "doctrine"</a>, so claiming it has existed for "7 years" seems like a bit of a stretch. Most of the Google hits are either a few bloggers saying "huh?" or things that you seem to have posted yourself to open directories. Trademark status means nothing other than that you filled out a form. We're not "attacking" anything, we just don't think it conforms to Wikipedia inclusion requirements.

<li>Under what standard is it "established" except that a guy has self-promoted it on the internet, has made a website for it, and has registered its name as a trademark? None of those things make it very "Established" in my mind.

<li>And when we advertise Wikipedia for gain of notability, it's not ok? I've been an active member of the IBS Self Help group and I posted an promotional offer to the Church of Reality in two places: <a href="http://ibsgroup.org/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/76110261/m/23310063" class="external text" title="http://ibsgroup.org/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/76110261/m/23310063" rel="nofollow">Church of Reality - my way of life</a> and <a href="http://www.infidelguy.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=11096" class="external text" title="http://www.infidelguy.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=11096" rel="nofollow">Invitation to the Church of Reality</a>.

<li>There's no hard-and-fast line on Google hits - it's just one piece of the puzzle. Looking at the main site itself, and at some of the links Google comes up with, it seems that it has made some waves in a variety of places.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The raw number of Google hits can be instructive but alone it can just mean that someone has been agressivley posting links on blogs and forums, sending out press releases that are automatically picked up on some web sites, submitting listings to various directories, etc... That is what this looks like to me. No real third party comentary or other validation that I could see. One person can get a couple of friends together call it a religion - that is exercising freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, etc... However, it should have some broad support before it gets an article in Wikipedia. If 10 people form a local club in S.F., I'll bet it would be deleted. If 10 people with common beliefs call themselves a religion, I don't see how the group is any more encyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 20:21, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The only member of this purported church appears to be Marc Perkel. The only evidence of its existence stems from that same, single, central source, either from his own vast flood of web log postings and discussion forum contributions, or from other people simply citing the several web sites that he created and owns (<a href="http://perkel.com./" class="external text" title="http://perkel.com./" rel="nofollow">perkel.com</a>, <a href="http://churchofreality.org./" class="external text" title="http://churchofreality.org./" rel="nofollow">churchofreality.org</a>, and <a href="http://bartcop.com./" class="external text" title="http://bartcop.com./" rel="nofollow">bartcop.com</a>, for starters). Marc Perkel doesn't seem to be lacking the ability to create his own soapboxes. Looking at the discussions that Tommynchucky points to above (where the tag team is exactly the same as it is here), people seem to be ignoring what he cries from atop them, rather than joining his purported church. The other two purported members of the purported church's "Council of Realists" are strangely quiet about the entire thing, too. One doesn't even need to read the "Tithing" section of the purported church's "Fundamental Concepts", where it says "<i>I am a person who has unusual mental talents. I think science should study me to see what it is about me that gives me my unusual mental abilities.</i>" to know that this is a religion of 1 adherent.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't understand the arguments for deletion. They are primarily "vanity" and lack of "notability". It seems that the argument from vanity would imply that if I, someone who is on the emailing list for the church, wrote this thing then it wouldnt be vain and it would be acceptable. And the argument from notability would imply some objective standard of notability, which there is not. Those arguing from notability are just declaring their own ignorance. And those arguing from vanity are just arguing their own contempt. It is just an article about a very real existing church, one that is obtaining IRS status, and one that has a very sympathetic membership. Delete it now, it will be back later, perhaps written by someone notable and not so vain.By the way I am not a "sockpuppet" but I am a new user with no notoriety. And I only know this this article because I am on the CoR mailing list, which says something about how known it is.--Asklocus 02:01, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well if we <i>do</i> delete it now and it <i>does</i> come back latter, because it has become more well known … well that's the way it's <i>supposed</i> to work. But — it is no part of our mission to <i>help</i> it become more well known. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 02:57, Jun 5, 2005 (UTC)

<li>It looks like the Universist Movement is getting the same sentiment for this entry as this one. They have a discussion <a href="http://universist.org/wikipedia.htm" class="external text" title="http://universist.org/wikipedia.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> with references. They are more notable than the CoR and have gotten publicity in a relatively short period of time. I guess even <a href="http://universist.org/nytimes121204.htm" class="external text" title="http://universist.org/nytimes121204.htm" rel="nofollow">an article</a> in the New York Times is still not good enough. Also interestingly enough there is an entry for <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">Bright</a> which was started in 2003, and they seem less notable then the Universists. There is overlap in principles in these groups. What is notable is that Starblind and other made the allegation of sockpuppetry without providing any evidence in these talk pages Talk:Universism, Talk:Universist_Movement, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_Universist_Movement_666c.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion/Universist Movement">Wikipedia:Votes_for_undeletion/Universist_Movement</a> -- Tommynchucky June 05, 2005 1:45AM EST</li>

<dd>Tommynchucky, If you are not a sockpuppet — and I see no proof that you are — then I'm sorry, and I apologize on behalf of Wikipedia, for those who are calling you one. For the record, I don't see Starblind (explicitly) calling you a sockpuppet, it was user Duncharris, who did that, although others have (naturally enough) expressed their suspicions about a new user with no previous edits. Nevertheless, it is a well-respected Wikipedian practice to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>, and we may have fallen short of that here. In any case, as Starblind pointed out it is our policy to listen and consider the comments of new users, but, in our efforts to reach a consensus, we sometimes give less weight to their votes. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 15:43, Jun 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
