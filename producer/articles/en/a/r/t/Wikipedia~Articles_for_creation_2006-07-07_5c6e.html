<p>Hyped energy storage substance that has been reinvented through the Fox network and published clips on www.youtube.com. Is sold as a new solution for the energy crisis in the world.

<p>Craig Matthew Hoying was born on May 12, 1990. His parents are Martha and Charles Hoying. He has one older brother Eric Hoying. And a younger sister Sarah Hoying.</p>
<p>Craig Hoying is the most collest (co<b>ll</b>est???) person you will ever meet. He is so cool he has his own Wikipedia article. If you were to ask Craig Hoying how cool he is, he would not answer, because he is too honest to tell a lie, and too humble to tell you how much better he is than you.</p>
<p>Craig Hoying attends <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_Alter_High_School_a0fc.html" title="Archbishop Alter High School">Archbishop Alter High School</a>. He is aweinspiring in all respects of the word. If you ever see him, you should hail him as The Supreme One, lest he burn you with his eyes.<br />
Craig's Superpowers derive from his being dropped on his head as a child.</p>
<p>Some of Craig's Favorite Teams include<br />
The Buckeyes (Football)<br />
The Bengals<br />
The Reds<br />
Navy (Lacrosse)<br />
AC Milan (Soccer)<br />
Germany (National Soccer)<br />
The Crew (Soccer)<br /></p>

<p>Brent Bourgeois began performing in Dallas clubs at the age of 13. After graduating from high school, he moved with his friend Larry Tagg to Sacramento, CA, forming the pop group Bourgeois Tagg in 1984. A duo by name, the band also included drummer Rick Walter and guitarist Lyle Workman. They released a self-titled debut album in 1986, which produced the hit single "Mutual Surrender (What a Wonderful World)." The following year, they released their second album, Yoyo, which was produced by Todd Rundgren, and had another hit, "I Don't Mind at All," which reached the Top 40. The band appeared to have a bright future, but Bourgeois became addicted to drugs and alcohol. When fellow musician and drinking buddy Charlie Peacock began going to church, Bourgeois followed and became a Christian. Conflicts that were brewing in the band became exacerbated by Bourgeois' trend toward Christian lyrics and they split. Tagg eventually released two solo albums, both on Damian, with Skeleton Crew in 1995 and Rover in 1997. Bourgeois worked as a producer and solo artist within the CCM scene, and continues to produce new work.</p>

<p>Heinrich Knote (1870 - 1953) was considered the best German tenor in his time. He specialised on Wagner's Heldentenor. Knote was a competitor of Enrico Caruso on the metropolitan opera, who was accused of commercialising music. His breakthrough, however, was at the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich, where he first gained popularity.</p>

<p>He was discovered by Captain Kelly, an eccentric racehorse trainer Maddenstown, the Curragh. Kelly lodged him in his brother's house in calverstown, near Kilcullen and trained him in the art of bare-knuckled boxing. Dan Donnelly was to fight twice at the Curragh, the first time in 1814 against Tom Hall from the Isle of Wight before 20,000 spectators for the prize money of 100 sovereigns. He beat Hall easily.</p>
<p>His second fight before a great crowd took place in December 1815 against George Cooper. The fight lasted eleven rounds, and ended with Donnelly knocking Cooper senseless to the ground. As Dan left the arena, his supportersmoulded out his footsstepsas he walked, and these can still be seen today. 'The steps to strength and fame.' In July 1818, he beat the English champion Tom Oliver at Crawley Hurst near London where £100,000 in wagers changed hands. He was reputed to have been knighted Sir Dan in a tavern after the fight by the Prince Regent (Later King George IV). Sir Dan died penniless on 18th February 1820 aged 32 years.</p>
<p>Dan's body was interred in the Bully's Acre, Kilmainham, but was lifted by body snatchers or "sack-'em-ups" and sold to a Dublin surgeon, who removed the right arm for the purpose of examining the muscle structure. For many year's Dan's arm was on display in the Hide-Out public house in Kilcullen, but was removed with the recent sale of the premises. The Obelisk is located in Donnelly's Hollow, Athgarvan Road, The Curragh.</p>

<p>Bacone College is a private four-year liberal arts college in Muskogee, Oklahoma. Founded in 1880 as the Indian University by Almon C. Bacone, Bacone College is the oldest continiously operated institution of higher education in Oklahoma. The college has strong historic ties to various tribal nations, including the Cherokee Nation and the Muscogee Creek Nation, and the American Baptist Churches of America.</p>
<p>Bacone College is a member of the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, the Oklahoma Independent College Foundation and Universities, the Joint Review Commission for Radiography Education, the National League for Nursing, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, and an affiliate member of the Oklahoma Association of Colleges for Teacher Education. Its current president is Rev. Dr. Robert J. Duncan, Jr., a United Methodist minister from Drew University.</p>
<p>The college traces its origins to a request to the American Baptist Home Mission Society by Professor Almon C. Bacone, a missionary teacher, to start a school in the Cherokee Baptist Mission at Tahlequah, Indian Territory. The only faculty member, Professor Bacone, enrolled three students and by the end of the first semester, the student body had quadrupled; by the end of the first year, student population was fifty-six and the faculty numbered three.</p>
<p>Seeing the need to expand, an appeal was made to the Muscogee Creek Nation's Tribal Council for 160 acres of land in nearby Muskogee, Oklahoma, known then as the "Indian Capital of the World." The land was granted, and in 1885 Indian University was moved to its present site. In 1910, it was renamed Bacone Indian University after its founder and first president and was later changed to Bacone College by its Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>One of the first buildings to be erected was Rockefeller Hall, a three-story building made possible by a $10,000 contribution from John D. Rockefeller. "Old Rock," as it came to be called, served as classroom, dormitory, dining hall, chapel, teacher quarters and administration building. It was razed in 1938 and a Memorial Chapel was built in its place, which was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The campus contains many other reminders of Bacone's history, tradition, and goals. One of these is a small cemetery, the final resting place of Bacone Presidents Almon C. Bacone (1880-1896) and Benjamin D. Weeks (1918-1941), as well as others associated with the school. A "stone bible" sculpture marks the spot on which President Bacone and two Baptist missionaries who were also trustees of Indian University, Joseph Samuel Murrow and Daniel Rogers, knelt in prayer to dedicate the college. The names of all its presidents, are inscribed on its surface.</p>
<p>Other structures on campus include the The Indian Room at the Bacone College Library, which is the home of many of Almon C. Bacone original papers, the Ataloa Lodge Museum, which has one of the largest privately owned Native American collections, and the McCombs Gallery, which features a large cross-section of Native American art as well as work from faculty emeritus Richard "Dick" West, a Master Artist best known for his traditional Plains style artwork, and Woodrow "Woody" Crumbo, the only American Indian ever to receive the Julius Rosenwald Fellowship.</p>

<p>[[James Caroll was born in California on 9th June 1989. He later moved to Wilmslow, in the United Kingdom. In this small commuter town, 12 miles south of Manchester, James lived an extremely merry life. He does however sometimes get drunk and seek to start fights with innocent locals, namely Oli Moggle. At High School, James is known as Jim-Bob, Jimmy, Caz, Caroline or just plain old "gay-boy". He was at his prime in year 11, where during year 11 he abused numerous teachers during his GCSE. The most famous incidents were: i) The Big Walker incident - here Jim-Bob moved the table just as Big Walker was about to step onto another. This dare-devil action resulted in Roadrunner being humiliated infront of the whole class, as he saw his life flash before him. ii) The Bush Knowles PC incident - here Jimmy succeeded in winding up the crazed Afro-woman and she lost her cool. She visciously banged the computer screen in true rage, only to turn the whole PC and projector screen yellow. She was totally unsure of how to ammend this problem, hence the hours of laughs that the class endured. Caz is the type of person who will not go very far in life. He exceeds in areas where there are no relative job prospects, for example being a World Cup GEEK! However due to his easily extracted mischievous facets, James has achieved nothing else. In the future, he desires to have a good summer in 2006. He is attending the Leeds festival, that is not as good as Live 8 a recent poll showed. Furthermore, he is rocking it out at Wakestock '06. In the further future he plans to travel Asia and Australasia. Jim has shown a strong fondness for a visit to Thailand. Close friends believe that this is due to his ambition to marry a Thai-brida, as he honestly has not a chance in hell of obtaining a respectable woman in the UK, or rest of the world, (except maybe Mongolia).</p>

<p>Sir George Percival Bargery was born in Exeter (UK) on October 1, 1876. He was educated at Hele School, Exeter, Islington College and the University of London and ordained as a chaplain to the Church Missionary Society in 1899. In 1900 he went to Northern Nigeria, where he served as a missionary until 1910 and returned to serve from 1912 until 1930 in the Colonial Education Service. He founded the first government school among the Tiv people on the Benue and then turned his attention to the Hausa language. He was commissioned to compile a dictionary of Hausa language and his Hausa-English Dictionary was published in 1934, including the first tonal analysis of the Hausa language. For this work he received a Doctorate in Literature from University of London in 1937.</p>
<p>He was appointed as Lecturer in Hausa to the School of Oriental Studies. He was made Senior Lecturer in 1935, and Reader in 1937. After retirement from the School in 1947 he taught at both Oxford and Cambridge until 1953. In 1953, he returned to Kano, Nigeria at the invitation of the British and Foreign Bible Society, to oversee the compilation of a new Hausa translation of the New Testament. He was awarded the OBE in 1957. He was married to Eliza Minnie in 1906 who died in 1932, and eight years later, he wed Minnie Jane who died in 1952. He had one son by his first marriage. Despite ill health and near total blindness, he lived almost until his 90 birthday, dying on 2 August 1966.</p>

<p>Charles Gordon's hometown is Carson, California. He attended Santa Monica High School.</p>
<p>Gordon is well-known as a 'hash' type football player. Weighing in at around 170 tons at 12'3", Gordon is not a large football player. Gordon's primary position is bone-crusher, but he was used extensively as a enemy decapitator in college. Gordon was also employed as friend of Dorothy at Kansas. Gordon lead NCAA Division 26Z in interceptions in 3063. He also holds freshman records for least receptions in a game (none every game of every season) and least total receptions (-50).</p>
<p>Gordon was a fan-favorite at Bouvine University. Anytime the punt or kick return teams took the field, the student section would scream "run, that crazed maniac's comin' into the stands to hurt people again!" over and over until his return to the loal detainment center was complete.</p>
<p>Gordon played a part in the lockdown killing squad Abe Lincoln's ghost pieced together in 3078. The squad redefeated the rebels in the Kazakastan, USA in December 3082.</p>
<p>After declaring "no survivors" year on july 52nd, 4005 in Bangladesh, Russia, Charles was not selected as an early entry in the 4006 US army Draft. He signed days later as a volunteerkilling machine with the Shaolin Monks shortly after the USA had seperated newly conquered China into states. Many pundents argued Gordon should have stayed in the detainment center all his life to improve his "social skills". He now must make the Vikings flee Iceland or be assigned to the assassination squad before the inital killing season kickoff or he will be terminated by Arnold Swarzenegger and available for any other zombie to be beaten mercilessly</p>

<p>Daniel Calliste a.k.a. Bang 'Em 'Smurf, is an african-american rapper. He is commonly known as Smurf. He is a Queens, New York based rapper. Smurf is a big name in the New York underground world of rap. His successes are credited to his beef with another Queens-based rapper, 50 cent. Smurf was one of the original members of G-Unit (50 Cent's crew). The crew was originally made up of 50 Cent (a.k.a. 50), Bang 'Em Smurf, Lloyd Banks(a.k.a. Banks), Tony Yayo(a.k.a. Yayo) and Domination(a.k.a. Domo). Smurf was close friends with 50 and Domination. Later on the group had a falling out, Domo and Smurf left G-Unit soon after 50 Cent debuted on the top of the charts and brought his crew into the picture (now consisting of only 50, Banks and Yayo). After 50s crew showed up at one of Smurf and Domo's videoshoots and stirred up some trouble. Knowing 50 so well, Smurf felt betrayed by 50, he teamed up with Domination and threw swift bone-crushing lyrical jabs at 50 and his posse. Unleashing a series of mixtapes with loads of songs dedicated to their ex-buisness partners. In 2005 Smurf was arrested due to a handgun violation, through the year Domination acted as the mouthpeice of the beast within the prison, dishing out a heavy arsenal of creative verbal attacks at 50 cent. There are rumors about Smurf and Domo forming a truce with 50. Smurf and Domo have also had beef with former G-Unit member The Game. Smurf has said the reason why he felt betrayed was because he knew 50 for the longest time. When 50 was shot (in the notorious 9-shot incident) Smurf was the one that slept at 50's house with a gun to watch over him, Smurf went out like a true soldier to get 50s shooter, and after all that 50 and his posse let him down.</p>

<p>Fare evasion are a rock band formed in the early 2000s in rural Victoria, Australia. Cam Duff (Bass, vocals), Matt Buckis (Guitars), Dave Kelsey (drums), and Luke Considine (Guitars, Vocals on 'Gremlins') formed in the summer of 1999, later relesing their debut EP ' Absence of recognition', with their now iconic Zone 1 and 2 Train ticket on the cover artwork. Many still see this as a sign of irony, even though the band wanted simply a literal interpretation of their name. Absence of recognition's 4 tracks lingered in the sounds of their idols, Pearl Jam, Live and Swervedriver. Duff's lyrics are often mis-interpreted for love songs, however many fans insist he is simply singing from the heart about life in general. 4 albums later, the band is still going strong, playing at venues such as the Esplanade Hotel in St Kilda and the Punters Club in Toorak Road. The band often use their live shows as opportunities to try out new material. In 2003, They were unearthed by Australian radio station Triple J.</p>

He is shown even more in Season Three as he begins to date Bevin Maskey a cheerleader and ditsy friend of Brooke Davis. He is present in the Study Hall room during the shootout at the school, the most serious episode in the series.</p>

<p>Azeroth can be a dangerous place, full of monsters and warring clans and races. But it can also be a land of great wonders and undiscovered treasures just waiting to be claimed by adventurers brave, smart, and patient enough to uncover them. Or, then again, you could just read these tips and skip all of that work.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Easter Eggs TREKKIE REFERENCE: In Booty Bay, just outside the inn, you’ll encounter Chief Engineer Scooty manning a teleportation device. If you have a quest that takes you through the device, you’ll find a character named Sprok and his away team.</p>
<p>MATRIX REFERENCE: On your way to the Ironforge Auction House, ask one of the guards the location of the alchemy trainer. One of his answers will be, “why, oh why didn’t I take the blue potion?”</p>
<p>FIGHT CLUB: Further into the Undercity, in the War Quarter, there’s an honest to God Fight Club where you’ll find two NPC fighters named Edward and Tyler.</p>
<p>GHOSTBUSTERS REFERENCE: Another movie reference can be found in the Mage Quarters of Stormwind. There, you’ll find three mages-in-training talking shop. Hang around long enough and one of them will say “wouldn’t that be bad, like crossing the streams bad?”</p>
<p>STAR WARS: The Shimmering Flats. Peek around a bit and you’ll find a goblin race team with a very familiar looking vehicle—Blizzard’s version of Sebulba’s podracer from Episode I. Do a little more exploring and you’ll also find a wrecked podracer which smacked into a canyon walls.</p>
<p>CONAN: In the Badlands around the middle of the map is a semi-hidden crypt. Enter the crypt and you’ll see a decomposed guy sitting on a throne with a sword to his side. It’s a scene from the first Conan movie.</p>
<p>BRUCE CAMPBELL TRIBUTE: In Dun Mo-rogh, just south of Kharanos, there’s a small camp where a group of dwarves are taking target practice. Hang around long enough and you’ll hear one of the dwarves scream out: “This is my boomstick!”</p>
<p>BOOK REFRERENCES: In the upper levels of Booty Bay, there’s a clothing shop named “A Tailor to Cities,” an homage to Charles Dicken’s A Tales of Two Cities. And in the Undead capital, the Undercity, you’ll find Algernon at the alchemy trainer’s holding a flower. This is a nod to Daniel Keyes’ novel Flowers for Algernon.</p>
<p>MEMORIAL: Blizzard designers also left a tribute to fallen comrade. In the Barrens, atop a hill just southwest of Crossroads sits a small shrine. Here, you’ll find a memorial dedicated to an Orc with the initials “M-K.” In the real world, M K was Michel Koiter, a Blizzard illustrator who passed away during production of World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>To reach the memorial, follow a ridge to the southeast and half-way up the hill you’ll find the base of a mound. Go up the short trail to reach the shrine. As a little bonus, if you visit the memorial in spirit form you’ll find a spirit healer named Koiter.</p>
<p>GAME REFERENCES: While fighting your way through the Deadmines to get VanCleef’s head you’ll encounter a Goblin Shredder. Take it down and look at the dashboard and you’ll see a familiar face: Kerrigan, The Zerg Queen from Starcraft: Brood War. She appears to be the ruler of the goblins as well. Other goblin shredders can be found in Strangle-thorn Vale and Gadget-zan.</p>
<p>In northern Un’goro Crater, there’s a place we’ve started calling “Camp Nintendo.” Two residents of the camp are the feuding brothers, Larion and Muigi. If those names sound a bit familiar, they should, they’re anagrams of Mario and Luigi; and the battling brothers are even decked out in red and green overalls.</p>
<p>Deep in the Uldaman instance, you’ll find a friendly refuge manned by three dwarves: Baelog, Olaf and Erik “The Swift.” Dedicated gamers should recognize these dudes from The Lost Vikings—the first game Blizzard created for the Super Nintendo back in ‘92.</p>
<p><br />
RARE PETS LIL' TIMMY: Lil’ Timmy is one of the game’s best pet dealers. Timmy doesn’t spawn often, but when he does, he wanders the streets of Stormwind trying to sell his one and only white kitten. This animal costs sixty silvers, but can be sold for five gold. Even we couldn’t determine exactly when Timmy materializes, but we discovered that he spawns at the end of the canal between Old Town and the Trade District in Stormwind. You can camp at the bridge between the two districts and work on your fishing skill while you wait for him to come by. Once Lil’ Timmy appears he wanders along the canal outside Old Town and Dwarven District. If you don’t catch him before he passes through Cathedral Square and turns right, poof!--he’ll be gone....</p>
<p>TINY CRIMSON WHELPLING: This beastie must be farmed from the gameworld. Your grinding begins in the Eastern Wetlands where you have to kill Crimson, Red and Flamesnorting whelps to find the drop. The drop rate of Tiny Crimson Whelplings is about one in a thousand (we got ours in 30 minutes). These little guys are worth much more then their weight in gold. If you decide to sell your rare pet, he’ll fetch about 40 gold pieces at auction.</p>
<p>TINY EMERALD WELPLING: In the southwest corner of the Swamp of Sorrows you’ll find Dreaming Whelps. Farm these badboys long enough and eventually they’ll drop a Tiny Emerald Whelpling.</p>
<p>HIDDEN QUESTS THE CHICKEN QUEST: Head to Sal-deans’ Farm in Westfall and find a chicken. To unlock the secret you have to do the “Chicken Dance” for the chicken about a hundred times. Set up a macro to enter the command easily--bring up Options, select Macros, choose the icon you want and enter the command "/chicken". Then put the icon in an action bar. Soon you’ll see the message, “Chicken looks at you quizzically. Maybe you should inspect it?” Accept the quest and purchase the special chicken feed from Farmer Saldean. Return to the chicken and type "/cheer" before feeding the chicken. Do this right and the chicken will lay an egg. This egg is your new pet, a prairie chicken.</p>
<p>ZELDA TRIBUTE QUESTS: This is only available when you reach level 47. Head to Un’Goro Crater and in the marshlands you’ll find a wrecked raft and a faded photograph. This find will initiate the quest “It’s a Secret to Everybody” (a quote from the original Legend of Zelda). There is a Link counterpart in Marshal’s Refuge named Linken, whom you’ll be helping find his lost memories. This quest has you trekking all over Azeroth completing a chain of 13 tasks. Eventually the trail will lead you back to Un’Goro and the final part of the quest, “It’s Dangerous to Go Alone”.</p>
<p>The next tribute can be found by beating Blazerunner at Fire Plume Ridge. Blazerunner is a level 56 elite (we whupped him by pairing up with a paladin and casting Fire Resistance Aura, then having another party member use the Silver Totem of Aquamentas to take down Blazerunner’s protective shields). After he’s beaten, pick up the Golden Flame in the back of the cave, which looks like a piece of the Tri-Force. Now return to Linken in Marshal’s Refuge and claim your reward--Linken’s Sword of Mastery and Linken’s Boomerang.</p>

<p>Considering they named their group the Dismasters, it’s suprising that Raven T &amp; Lord Mike Ski’s album contained only one diss record. While they claimed a spot in rap history with the timeless "Small Time Hustler", and to a lesser extent with "Black and Proud", their most entertaining moment in the booth was “Act Like You Know”.</p>
<p>Delivered in their typical Shout Rap style, the first couple of verses include a few vague stabs at the competition: "Run-DMC can’t do me nothing, I wish that KRS would say something / PE I like what you’re doing, Rakim drops science/ yeah, that’s kool and the gang, but don’t ever suppose you could beat me!". Luckily, the final verse makes it all worthwhile, as Kool DJ Red Alert receives a verbal beatdown for "being the only DJ in New York who wouldn’t play our record". It starts off with: "Red Alert and the Jungle Brothers, go on safaris and play with each other / out in the jungle - no womens in sight, one of them plays the girl for the night!" This is all funny shit, but the crediblity of the whole attack is pretty suspect when you take a look at the Dismaster’s</p>
<p>The Propmaster was no stranger to diss records himself, as he was the first to play BDP’s "South Bronx", which itself was made in retaliation to Red Alert’s radio rival Mr. Magic’s reaction when Scott and KRS asked him to play one of their pre-Criminal Minded 12"s. The Juice Crew fired back at Red with Craig G’s “Duck Alert” from Marley Marl’s In Control, Volume 1 LP, which is pretty tame compared to "Act Like You Know" but still comes off due to well-placed Star Trek soundbites. Not to be outdone, Red included several tracks dedicated to himself on his Next Plateau compilations - MC Mitch-Ski’s "Red Alert Is A Great Man", Total Control’s "DJ Red Alert" and Bizzy Boys with DJ Supreme Nyborn’s "Kool DJ Red Alert" all attested to his superiority in the rap radio wars.</p>

<p>Catch-Flame! was recorded at London’s Alexandra Palace and is Paul Weller’s third solo live album. Recorded on 5th December – the last date of Weller’s 2005 UK tour – it features live versions of songs spanning his entire career, including those of The Jam and The Style Council.</p>
<p>The album has attracted faint rumblings of criticism from fans due to the slight deviation from the original setlist of the concert. Certain songs have been omitted from the CD: Mermaids, Amongst Butterflies, Early Morning Rain, Here’s The Good News, and We All Need Love, a duet with The Charlatans’ Tim Burgess. Nevertheless, it is a fine reflection of Paul Weller’s career and encapsulates the passion and energy that still emanates from his concerts, and proves to critics that he still bounds on stage with the same élan and ferventness that he did when he was a young man with The Jam.</p>
<p>Catch-Flame! entered the UK chart at #17 on 18th June 2006.</p>

In 1990, Clark accepted a position as Senior Psychologist at the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra. Prior to his arrival in Australia, Clark was Senior Vice-President at Quantum Constructions, Inc, a successful commercial construction company located in the metropolitan New York area, and a lecturer in the Psychology of Human Performance at Temple University in Philadelphia. The opportunity to associate with the world's best residential training centre for elite athletes was a dream come true and instigated the move down under, an experience to this day that has shaped many of PST Systems philosophies, of which Clark is the Managing Director.</p>
<p>For more than two decades he has mentored and worked closely with a wide array of elite athletes at four Olympic Games; three Commonwealth Games; eight World Championships; five Pan Pacific Swimming Championships; Bledisloe, Cook and Tri-Nation Cups; as well as four Super 12 Grand Finals. His great successes with athletes and teams has earned Clark a reputation as a world leader in sport psychology, leadership and team development that is second to none. As the co-creator with Coach Don Talbot of the Australian Swimming Team from 1992-2006 he has been heralded as the architect of the now famous team environment that has taken the Dolphins to the top of International Swimming. Besides the Australian Swimming Team, Clark has been part of the Australian Wallabies, Australian Cycling, Australian Baseball, Australian Triathlon and the ACT Brumbies teams.</p>
<p>A registered psychologist, he currently holds the position of Adjunct Senior Lecturer at The University of Canberra. He earned his Bachelors Degree from Trenton State College in Psychology, a Masters and Doctorate Degree (ABD) from Temple University in the Psychology of Human Movement and a Diploma in Clinical Hypnotherapy.</p>
<p>In 2000, Clark was presented with the Australian Sports Medal by the Governor General for his contribution to sport in Australia and continues to work with elite athletes and a range of corporate clients assisting them to further develop their potential and leadership capabilities.</p>

<p>The USA Pirate Party supports the notion that the government should encourage, rather than smother, creativity and freedom. They encourage the release of material to the public domain, and aim to reform US copyright laws.</p>
<p>Quote: "Copyrights are now stretching into the hundreds of years, and fair use is under constant attack by attorneys who exploit the vagueness of the law. Creativity has come to a standstill in this country for those who wish to work within, and benefit from, the confines of the law. Whereas 50 years ago there was no great uproar at creative "pirating" of works without the permission of the original artist (Mickey Mouse was made as a parody, but Disney prosecutes all similar parodies of their Mickey Mouse symbol), similar legitimate creative derivative works are now smothered by the excessive terms, restrictions and punishments of our copyright system."</p>

The term half-originated from the terms blog and skin which is the standard term for the blog look and the other half originated from BlogSkins.com, which is a website where Blogskinners submit their designs for others to download and use. It can also be called skinning if it is not intended for the BlogSkins website, since there are other similar websites. In fact, if you search Google, you get about 1,190,000 results in an average 0.15 seconds. Many people around the world state their hobby as blog skinning.</p>

<p>Soil Transmitted Helminths</p>
<p>Helminth” is a technical word for a worm. Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are also known in many places simply as common intestinal worms.</p>
<p>Causative agents</p>
<p>In terms of public health, three species are important,</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Transmission</p>
<p>A person infected with STH has parasite eggs in their faeces.</p>
<p>In areas where there is no latrine system, the soil (and water) around the village or community becomes contaminated with faeces containing worm eggs.</p>
<p>In the soil, the eggs mature – a process that takes between 2 and 4 weeks, depending on the type of worm:</p>
<p>about 2 weeks for roundworms and hookworms; about 3 weeks for whipworms. The STHs can then infect humans in the following ways.</p>
<p>The eggs are ingested:</p>
<p>The eggs stick to vegetables grown in the area. If the vegetables are not carefully cooked, washed or peeled, the eggs are ingested and infect the person. The eggs are ingested from water sources which have become contaminated. Young children who play on the ground and often put their hands in their mouths without washing them, ingest the eggs and become infected. The larvae penetrate the skin:</p>
<p>For hookworms, the eggs also hatch into larvae which rest in the soil. If a person walks on the contaminated soil, the larvae can penetrate the skin, usually between the toes. There is no direct person-to-person transmission or infection from fresh faeces because eggs passed in faeces need about 3 weeks in the soil before they become infective.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Symptoms of infection and Impact on health:</p>
<p>The symptoms of STH infections are nonspecific and only become evident when the infection is particularly severe.</p>
<p>The nonspecific symptoms include nausea, tiredness, abdominal pain and loss of appetite.</p>
<p>STHs cause morbidity through various different mechanisms; three of particular significance are listed below.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anaemia. Hookworms live in the intestine. They attach and re-attach themselves to the intestine wall every few hours as they feed on blood from the cut vessels and mucosal tissues. This blood loss contributes to anaemia, especially in countries where the dietary intake of iron is already marginal and malaria is widespread.</dd>
<dd>Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency. STHs need vitamin A to live. In many countries, a person's vitamin A-intake is already marginal and in these situations, STH infections can compete for the limited amount of vitamin A which is absorbed.</dd>
<dd>Loss of appetite. One of the most noticeable changes after a child has been dewormed is that his/her appetite returns.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The impact of STH infections on an infected person’s life can be significant. Some examples are listed below.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Restricted growth. Loss of appetite, increased levels of vitamin A deficiency and higher anaemia levels all interfere with a child's ability to grow healthily and to his or her full potential. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that a child with heavy worm infections is less resistant to other infections. Altogether, this means a child infected with STHs will be sickly and, if untreated, will grow up to be an unhealthy adult.</dd>
<dd>Need for surgery. When the number of worms in the body becomes extremely high, they build up in the child's intestines, stopping the normal flow of blood and eventually blocking the intestine entirely. The only solution in this situation is surgical intervention and in many cases, this is not possible in remote areas and the child can die.</dd>
<dd>Reduced ability to learn. Worm-infected children are less able to concentrate or memorize information. They score less well in school tests and therefore their only chance to gain a few years of schooling in their lives is compromised</dd>
</dl>

<p>ATM, a.k.a. Timothy Moore, is from St. Louis, Missouri . While born into the 80's rap genre, his childhood proved as the start of his music career. His desire to entertain was present to his family and through school, where he joined music and acting classes to show his range of talent. Music is in ATM's blood, his great uncle Bennie Smith was a legendary Blues singer who worked with Ike Turner and B.B. King. The progression into music was only natural for this young actor who became a full time rapper 8 years ago.</p>
<p>In 1998, upon entering high school, he formed a group Young High Rollaz. In 2002 they finally recorded a self-titled CD, which was critically acclaimed in the streets. Unfortunately, no major labels were interested in signing them at the time, so the independent spirit prevailed. The group promoted themselves vigorously, passing their CD on to every DJ, promoter, and other music professional they could meet. They also sold over 7000 copies internationally with no major promotion.</p>
<p>ATM is currently in Frankfurt , Germany , and has released a new independent solo CD titled "Misery's Misfit."</p>

<p>Chew is a Marvel Comics superhero.. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Romita Jr., he first appeared in Ultimate X-Men #184 (August 2004). Chew, born Dane Chew and often simply called Chewy, is a Marvel Comics superhero He first fully appeared in Ultimate X-Men #1 (May 2005). His willingness to use deadly force, efforts to come to terms with his questionable past and angst-filled inner conflicts, and gruff personality have become standard for comic book super villain . A mutant, Chew possesses animal-keen senses and reflexes, razor-sharp claws, and a healing factor that allows him to recover almost instantaneously from virtually any wound. He is another protegey of Weapon X who two has been fused with Adamantium metal alloy to his skeleton, making it unbreakable. He is also a master of hand-to-hand combat. It was a very long rumor and debate, if Chew was the son of Wolverine. Only until recently the secret has been revealed in the newest issues of the comics. He is indeed the descendent of Wolverine and Gene Gray. POWERS Chew has gained his fathers bone claws, super human senses, super speed/strength and super fast healing abilities, which makes his experience confusing. Only looking like he’s in his early or mid 20’s he is believed to be in his 80’s. He has also gained many of his mother’s powers including the ability manipulating any object and the ability to fly. Chew is rumored to be in the possible up coming movie about Wolverines life. There is no further information about this developing hero but more will be obtained by August 2006.</p>

<p>DSM" means demand-side management. "DSM measures" means all equipment and technologies procured and supplied by Eskom-DSM and installed by the ESCo at the Customer's facility.</p>
<p>Demand Side Management (DSM) is the process whereby an electricity supplier influences the way electricity is used by customers.</p>
<p>DSM means the planning implementation, and monitoring of end-user's activities designed to encourage consumers to modify patterns of electricity usage, including the timing and level of electricity demand.</p>
<p>Electricity demand is the amount of electricity required by all electric equipment operating at one time in a building, an area or a city. The prime objective of DSM is providing constant, efficient use of electricity thus resulting in lesser amounts of electricity during peak times, thus managing the demand effectively.</p>
<p>If electricity is managed in this way, the demand is more consistent and consequently electricity suppliers are more able to meet the requirements of all of its consumers.</p>
<p>The key benefit of DSM is efficient use of electricity, without influencing the customer production and satisfaction levels, resulting in significant cost savings for the provider and thus the consumer as well.</p>
<p>Eskom DSM already has the necessary expertise, skills and strategic positioning to be an effective vehicle for the implementation of these initiatives.</p>
<p>The term Demand Side Management was first used in the United States in the early 1980s, later adopted in the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia and today, In terms of DSM implementation in South Africa, the concept is still relatively new. While Eskom formally recognised DSM in 1992, the first DSM plan was only produced in 1994. Since then Eskom has spearheaded many DSM initiatives and continues to lead the way in promoting the efficient use of electricity.</p>

<p>Sledgehammer levering is an exercise or feat of strength in which a person holds a sledge hammer in an extended arm and moves it using only the muscles of the forearms. There are typically three kinds of levering practiced: Strict levering – Holding the handle of the sledge at the point furthers from the head that you can still fit your entire hand on it, the arm is extend straight in front or two the side of the body, the head of the hammer is lowered to the nose and then taken back to vertical. Side levering – The hammer and arms are all in the same position above. The hammer is moved by rotating the wrist. So the hammer makes a full 180 degree arch with it’s center point at the hand and wrist. Front levering – The hammer is resting on the ground, on its head with the handle pointing upward. The hammer is grabbed at the top portion of the handle (furthest from the head) with the thumb down and the pinky up, the shoulder is used to bring the arm and hammer parallel to the ground. Once parallel is achieved, the muscles of the forearm and wrist are used to bring the hammer to perpendicular.</p>
<p>Levering is most popular among grip enthusiasts and is believed to build wrist strength often used for tearing and bending. Many trainees start with an eight or ten pound sledge hammer. Progression is usually made by moving the hand down the handle (away from the head) as the trainee grows stronger. Once a certain weight hammer is overcome, some trainees attach more weight using magnets, tape, welded bolts and other methods. Most trainees consider a sixteen pound hammer a very good weight, some can train up to twenty pounds.</p>
<p>The most famous leverer is Slim “The Hammerman” Farman. There is some debate about his best levering feat ever. Most sources cite a lever of thirty- one pounds per hand in both hands simultaneously. As of 2006 Slim is an actively performing strongman. It is believed by many that no one will ever surpass Slims record.</p>

<p>Ovingdean is a small formerly agricultural village which was absorbed into the borough of Brighton, East Sussex, UK, in 1928, and now forms part of the city of Brighton and Hove. It has expanded through the growth of residential streets on its eastern and southern sides, and now has a population of about 1200. Some of the current housing replaces earlier shacks of the type once found in Woodingdean and Peacehaven, built after the Great War. It almost abuts Rottingdean to the south-east and Woodingdean to the north-east, but still has open downland on its other sides, on which may be found a golf course and Brighton racecourse as well as some residual farmland.</p>
<p>The historic village is a conservation area. Its focus is the eleventh-century church of St Wulfran, a dedication found in only two other places in England (Grantham and Dorrington, both in Lincolnshire). Many homes in this area are converted farm buildings, and the most prominent houses are Ovingdean Grange and Ovingdean Hall. The Grange is the subject of legend, having reputedly been visited by Charles II (with fetal consequences) during his escape from England in 1651, but this story is an invention of the once well-known novelist W. Harrison Ainsworth. The Hall is a gentry farmhouse which now serves as a school for the hearing-impaired.</p>
<p>Buried in the churchyard, or having a monument there, are the inventor Magnus Volk, the stained-glass artist Charles Kempe, the pioneer female medical student Sophia Jex-Blake and the distinguished lawyer Helena Normanton, one of the first female barristers and QCs.</p>
<p>The village is distinguished by having a single shop (a sub-post-office) and no pub.</p>
<p>Just outside the historic boundary of Ovingdean, and actually in historic Rottingdean, is Ian Fraser House, better known as St Dunstan's, a famous residential and rehabilitation centre for blind ex-servicemen. It is at the moment of writing (July 2006) the home of Britain's oldest living man at 110, Henry Allingham, the last surviving founder-member of the RAF.</p>

<p>The voice of the adolescent male and mature male is seperated into three natural parts: Chest voice, head voice and falsetto. Also, by isolating parts of the vocal chords, fry tones can be produced. It is not done within the natural confines of the voice, but by closing the throat and forcing air through the vocal chords. Individuals can be taught to do this correctly. However, if not done properly, it can have many negative effects including polyps and nodes. Many voice teachers, especially those who teach on the foundation of resonance usually do not like this technique. Not only is it difficult to do it properly with the right support, however. It implies that the voice is segmented, which contradicts the idea of having voice a well connected to the breath and consistent from top to bottom. In our society, fry tones can most commonly be heard by rock stars and other pop artists to achieve a lower and/or desired effect. Most typically this is done by heavy metal stars such as Metallica and Black Sabbath for a dark (stereotypically satanic) sound. One group most famous for correctly using this style of vocal isolation is the monks of Tibet. Because this is done off the normal voice, this fry tone can be accompanied with the normal voice and the falsetto voice to create three voices at once. This takes many years of training under the supervision of qualified individuals.</p>

<p>The Bisbee Kings are semi-pro baseball team playing in the <a href="../../../b/o/r/Border_Baseball_Series_eff1.html" title="Border Baseball Series">Border Baseball Series</a>. As of July 7, the team had compiled a record of 13-2. The Kings play their home games at the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Ballpark_6672.html" title="Warren Ballpark">Warren Ballpark</a> in <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisbee%2C_Arizona_a5e5.html" title="Bisbee, Arizona">Bisbee, Arizona</a>, however a doubleheader against the Borderland Cowboys was played in Copper King Stadium in <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas%2C_Arizona_a16b.html" title="Douglas, Arizona">Douglas, Arizona</a> as part of Douglas's <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_of_July_c9c0.html" title="Fourth of July">fourth of July</a> festival. The team is owned by Bob Lipp, who also serves as the general manager. Butch Hammett is the field manager of the kings, and also managed the Bisbee-Douglas Copper Kings team in 2003.</p>
<p>The Kings opened their season in Naco, Sonora, against the Naco Aguilas(Eagles), there was some tension that there would be border issues between the two teams, but none surfaced. The game was held as a charitable event to raise for Naco's little league team to participate in the Sonora State Tournament.</p>
<p>The Kings home opener was a double-header against the Aguilas. The Kings were not originally scheduled to play the Aguilas, but the scheduled team, the San Luis Banditos, were unable to make the game because they were participating in a tournament in Mexicala and advanced beyond the point that they thought they would. The kings won the games 8-6 and 8-0 to advance their record to 3-0.</p>
<p>The Kings had been scheduled to play Naco again the next weekend, but because they didn't want to play each four times in a row, Bob Lipp arranged for a three game set against the Borderland Cowboys in <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Paso_1575.html" title="El Paso">El Paso</a>, and one game in <a href="../../../d/e/m/Deming%2C_New_Mexico_14d4.html" title="Deming, New Mexico">Deming, New Mexico</a>. However a Deming city ordinance against charging admission to any event in a city park could not be worked around, and the Cowboys agreed to come to Bisbee to play a three game set. However, the Cowboys decided they didn't have the depth for a three game series, and Lipp arranged for a friday night game against the Nogales Tigers. The kings beat the tigers 6-4, then defeated the cowboys 10-0, and 10-3.</p>
<p>On June 16, 17, and 18, the Kings almost got their schedule right. They defeated the Cananea Mineros 15-2 at home, then beat them 12-0 in Cananea. However, the sunday game against the Nogales Tigers was cancelled. The Kings record was 8-0.</p>
<p>On June 23, the Kings played against the Amarillo Ace and won 6-2. After the game Butch Hammett said, "That was probably the best team we have played so far." The Ace proved that the next day handing the Kings their first loss 6-3 in the second of a doubleheader. The Kings won the first game 7-6 in walkoff fashion. In the second game, the Ace had a 6-3 lead when the sprinklers went on at Warren Ballpark, ended the game because know one had a key to the sprinkler shed. The next day, the Kings were playing the Arizona Diamondjaxx in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandler.html" title="Chandler">Chandler</a>. The game was tied at 1 when the Kings 3rd baseman Manny Davila broke his leg sliding into second base. The game was called due to unsafe playing conditions.</p>
<p>The Kings beat the El Paso(formerly Borderland) Cowboys 6-0 and 10-4 in Douglas as part of the fourth of July festival. The Kings lost their second game of the season the next day to the Tucson Stars in Bisbee, 6-3. That following Tuesday, the Kings were scheduled to play the Casa Grande Cotton Kings in Bisbee.

<p>The Bisbee Kings are semi-pro baseball team playing in the Border Baseball Series. As of July 7, the team had compiled a record of 13-2. The Kings play their home games at the Warren Ballpark in Bisbee, Arizona, however a doubleheader against the Borderland Cowboys was played in Copper King Stadium in Douglas, Arizona as part of Douglas's fourth of July festival. The team is owned by Bob Lipp, who also serves as the general manager. Butch Hammett is the field manager of the kings, and also managed the Bisbee-Douglas Copper Kings team in 2003.</p>
<p>The Kings opened their season in Naco, Sonora, against the Naco Aguilas(Eagles), there was some tension that there would be border issues between the two teams, but none surfaced. The game was held as a charitable event to raise for Naco's little league team to participate in the Sonora State Tournament.</p>
<p>The Kings home opener was a double-header against the Aguilas. The Kings were not originally scheduled to play the Aguilas, but the scheduled team, the San Luis Banditos, were unable to make the game because they were participating in a tournament in Mexicala and advanced beyond the point that they thought they would. The kings won the games 8-6 and 8-0 to advance their record to 3-0.</p>
<p>The Kings had been scheduled to play Naco again the next weekend, but because they didn't want to play each four times in a row, Bob Lipp arranged for a three game set against the Borderland Cowboys in El Paso, and one game in Deming, New Mexico. However a Deming city ordinance against charging admission to any event in a city park could not be worked around, and the Cowboys agreed to come to Bisbee to play a three game set. However, the Cowboys decided they didn't have the depth for a three game series, and Lipp arranged for a friday night game against the Nogales Tigers. The kings beat the tigers 6-4, then defeated the cowboys 10-0, and 10-3.</p>
<p>On June 16, 17, and 18, the Kings almost got their schedule right. They defeated the Cananea Mineros 15-2 at home, then beat them 12-0 in Cananea. However, the sunday game against the Nogales Tigers was cancelled. The Kings record was 8-0.</p>
<p>On June 23, the Kings played against the Amarillo Ace and won 6-2. After the game Butch Hammett said, "That was probably the best team we have played so far." The Ace proved that the next day handing the Kings their first loss 6-3 in the second of a doubleheader. The Kings won the first game 7-6 in walkoff fashion. In the second game, the Ace had a 6-3 lead when the sprinklers went on at Warren Ballpark, ended the game because know one had a key to the sprinkler shed. The next day, the Kings were playing the Arizona Diamondjaxx in Chandler. The game was tied at 1 when the Kings 3rd baseman Manny Davila broke his leg sliding into second base. The game was called due to unsafe playing conditions.</p>
<p>The Kings beat the El Paso(formerly Borderland) Cowboys 6-0 and 10-4 in Douglas as part of the fourth of July festival. The Kings lost their second game of the season the next day to the Tucson Stars in Bisbee, 6-3. That following Tuesday, the Kings were scheduled to play the Casa Grande Cotton Kings in Bisbee. In the bottom of first inning, the rain started to fall and was soon coming down in torrents. The dugouts, locker rooms, and offices were soon all flooded. The only open entrance was on the first base side of the stadium, and water was coming through a foot deep. Eventually they called 911 and police came and opened the 3rd base gate. The game was rained out by an Arizona Monsoon.</p>

<p>Give4Strips was formed in April 2005 by a group of Sunderland AFC supporters with the idea of providing underprivileged children across Africa with brand new football shirts from the UK.</p>
<p>They raise money purely from donations and use this money to buy sets of shirts for a full team. Initially the focus was on Sunderland AFC football shirts, given the origin of the founder members, but over time this has been extended to cater for every UK football team.</p>
<p>Their aim is to give hope and a sense of belonging to children that have precious little in their lives. The organisation works with existing charties such as EMIMA (who educate children about HIV/AIDS awareness through sport) and The Loveshack (A home for abandoned children in Kenya)</p>
<p>To date Give4Strips have donated many shirts in Tanzania, Kenya and Malawi and have set up an annual football tournament in Dar Es Salaam where dozen of teams from surrounding areas gather.</p>

<p>Hyattstown,Maryland is a small historic town located on Rt 355 in upper Montgomery County, Md. Established in 1798, this crossroad's town provided multiple services such as a blacksmith, butcher shop, schoolhouse and full-service inn. Being the main route, formally know as The Pike, from Washington D.C. to points west, it is likely that many historical figures would have travelled through and perhaps spent the night in Hyattstown.</p>

<p>Though living in Idaho and working as a ski instructor at the time, Gabriela Andersen-Scheiss represented Switzerland in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. On August 5 of that year, 50 runners from 28 countries began the 26-mile, 385-yard trek on a hot, muggy California morning from Santa Monica College. Fourteen minutes into the race, Maine’s Joan Benoit began to pull away from the rest of the pack. She went on to win in a time of 2 hours, 24 minutes, and 52 seconds. Twenty minutes after Benoit finished, then 39-year-old Andersen-Scheiss staggered into the stadium. The L.A. Coliseum crowd looked on as she limped around the track in the race’s final 400 meters. Her right leg had for the most part seized and her left arm was dangling. While the effects of her heat exhaustion were plainly evident, trackside medics saw that she was perspiring, which meant that her body still had some disposable fluids and let her continue her march to the finish line. At the completion of this final lap – which took Andersen-Scheiss five minutes and 44 seconds – she fell across the finish line. Medical personnel tended to her immediately and, miraculously, she was released two hours later.</p>

<p>Harbinger is an adventure <a href="../../../c/r/p/CRPG_c780.html" title="CRPG">CRPG</a> by Silverback Entertainment published in 2003 by <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreamcatcher_Interactive_762e.html" title="Dreamcatcher Interactive">Dreamcatcher Interactive</a>. Harbinger takes place on a massive space ship inhabited by multiple warring races and a band of refugees. The player has the choice of 3 distinct characters with their own unique quests, items, and full-game storylines.</p>
<p>Harbinger has no multiplayer and only limited control of character development(there are only four stats). The levels and areas are static and only accessible in storyline order, and then only for their given quest or quests. While it lacks the replay value and allure of random maps and online play, the sheer size of the storyline and the number of levels makes it a decent middlepoint between classic linear CRPG's (e.g. <a href="../../../d/a/y/Day_of_the_Tentacle_1e67.html" title="Day of the Tentacle">Day of the Tentacle</a>) and the current hack'n'slash style (e.g. <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diablo_II_0e9e.html" title="Diablo II">Diablo II</a>)</p>

Using his technical expertise, he devised the first ever '3D game show studio' for sale pitches. Celador (makers of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire') called his presentation, the best they had ever seen.</p>
<p>After three years in the UK, he moved back to Canada fronting the Canadian Arm of the gameshow company. He has also started his own videography business creating videos for Mississauga Ice Dogs and Nightmares Fear Factory.</p>
<p>David has also worked with behavioural children and has studied Neuro Linguistic Programming while in the UK.</p>
<p>David currently is a writer, web designer, graphic artist &amp; media specialist for Vices Magazine and is the co-creator of Vicesmagazine.com.</p>

<p>John Edward McGinness, PhD, MD. BS, Pioneer in Organic electronics and Nanotechnology. B.S. Physics - University of Houston, 1966, Ph.D. Physics, Rice University, 1970, M,D. University of Texas at Houston, 1985.</p>
<p>In 1972, Dr. McGinness suggested that electronic conduction in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanins.html" title="Melanins">melanins</a> (polyacetylene, polypyrrole, and polyaniline "blacks" and their copolymers) is analogous to conduction in amorphous solids such as the chalcogenide glasses (1). That is, it involves such things as mobility gaps, phonon-assisted hopping, and so forth. This work directly anticipated the Nobel-prize-winning work of Shirakawa et al on conduction mechanisms in polyacetylenes.</p>
<p>Further, the chalcogenide glasses show "switching" behavior, in which an applied "threshold voltage" reversibly switches the material from a low-conductivity "OFF" state to a high conductivity "ON' state. As a proof of concept, Dr McGinness and his coworkers constructed and reported a similar bistable switch incorporating melanin as its active element (2). They also further characterized its electronic behavior (3-8).</p>
<p>In retrospect, this device represented several "firsts" in organic electronics. For example, while high-conductivity was observed long before in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charge-transfer_complex.html" title="Charge-transfer complex">charge-transfer complex</a> type organic semiconductors, the "ON" state of their device represents the first demonstration of a high "metallic" conductivity state in the polyacetylene-derived organic semiconductors. A subsequent article in the journal <i>Nature</i> makes much of this materials "high conductivity", etc..</p>
<p>Most significantly, McGinness' et als device is the first identifiable "active" organic electronic device. (An active device is one in which a current or voltage controls current flow.) As such, it is parent to large swaths of the field of organic electronics. Moreover, organic electronics is generally considered to be part of Nanotechnology. So this gadget is arguably the first nanotech device. As such, it is now in the Smithsonians Institution's National Museum of American History collection of early electronic devices.</p>

<p>Family Health Plus was created in 1999 under Governor Pataki to provide very low cost health insurance for individuals and families in New York who earn a low income (yet do not qualify for Medicaid) and who do not have health insurance provided for them through their employers.</p>
<p>The program is described on their webpage as: “Family Health Plus is a public health insurance program for adults between the ages of 19 and 64 who do not have health insurance - either on their own or through their employers - but have income or resources too high to qualify for Medicaid. Family Health Plus is available to single adults, couples without children, and parents with limited income who are residents of New York State and are United States citizens or fall under one of many immigration categories. Family Health Plus provides comprehensive coverage, including prevention, primary care, hospitalization, prescriptions and other services. There are minimal co-payments for some Family Health Plus services. Health care is provided through participating managed care plans in your area.” (quoted from page <a href="http://www.nyhealth.gov/nysdoh/fhplus/what_is_fhp.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.nyhealth.gov/nysdoh/fhplus/what_is_fhp.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyhealth.gov/nysdoh/fhplus/what_is_fhp.htm</a> which is a govermental website and, by your directions, can be directly quoted without risking plagiarism)</p>

<p><br />
Alternatively, Governor Pataki has also created a sister program: Healthy NY. This is aimed at New York residents and sole proprietors who fit the above criteria, but are in a slightly higher income bracket. Healthy NY can also be used by small businesses to attain reduced cost coverage for their employees.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-07_5c6e.html" title="Edit section: Auroleus Phillipus Theostratus Bombastus von Hohenheim">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Auroleus Phillipus Theostratus Bombastus von Hohenheim</span></h2>
<p>Auroleus Phillipus Theostratus Bombastus von Hohenheim, immortalized as "Paracelsus," was born in 1493. He was the son of a well known physician who was described a Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, and it was from him that Paracelsus took his first instruction in medicine. At the age of sixteen, Paracelsus entered the University at Basle where he applied himself to the study of alchemy, surgery, and medicine. With the science of alchemy he was already acquainted, having previously studied the works of Isaac Hollandus. Hollandus' writing roused in him the ambition to cure disease by medicine superior to those available at that time to use, for apart from his incursions into alchemy, Paracelsus is credited with the introduction of opium and mercury into the arsenal of medicine. His works also indicate an advanced knowledge of the science and principles of magnetism. These are just some of the achievements that seem to justify the praise that has been handed him in the last century. Manly Hall called him "the precursor of chemical pharmacology and therapeutics and the most original medical thinker of the sixteenth century."</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Abbot Trithermius, an adept of a high order, and the instructor of the illustrious Henry Cornelius Agrippa, was responsible for Paracelsus' initiation into the science of alchemy. In 1516, Paracelsus was still pursuing his research in mineralogy, medicine, surgery, and chemistry under the guidance of Sigismund Fugger, a wealthy physician of the Basle, but the student was forced to leave the city hurriedly after trouble with the authorities over his studies in necromancy. So, Paracelsus started out on a nomad's life, supporting himself by astrological predictions and occult practices of various kinds.</p>
<p>His wanderings took him through Germany, France, Hungary, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, and Russia. In Russia, he was taken prisoner by the Tartars and brought before the Grand Cham at whose court he became a great favorite. Finally, he accompanied the Cham's son on an embassy from China to Constantinople, the city in which the supreme secret, the universal dissolvent (the alkahest) was imparted to him by an Arabian adept. For Paracelsus, as Manly Hall has said, gained his knowledge "not from long-coated pedagogues but from dervishes in Constantinople, witches, gypsies, and sorcerers, who invoked spirits and captured the rays of the celestial bodies in dew; of whom it is said that he cured the incurable, gave sight to the blind, cleansed the leper, and even raised the dead, and whose memory could turn aside the plague."</p>
<p><br />
Paracelsus ultimately returned to Europe, passing along the Danube into Italy, where he became an army surgeon. It was here apparently that his wonderful cures began. In 1526, at the age of thirty-two, he re-entered Germany, and at the university he had entered as a youth, took a professorship of physics, medicine, and surgery. This was a position of considerable importance that was offered to him at the insistence of Erasmus and Ecolampidus. Perhaps it was his behavior at this time that eventually led to his nickname "the Luther of physicians," for in his lectures he was so bold as to denounce as antiquated the revered systems of Galen and his school, whose teachings were held to be so unalterable and inviolable by the authorities of that time that the slightest deviation from their teachings was regarded as nothing short of heretical. As a crowning insult he actually burnt the works of these masters in a brass pan with sulfur and nitre!</p>
<p><br />
This high-handed behavior, coupled with his very original ideas, made him countless enemies. The fact that the cures he performed with his mineral medicines justified his teachings merely served further to antagonize the medical faculty, infuriated at their authority and prestige being undermined by the teachings of such a "heretic" and "usurper." Thus Paracelsus did not long retain his professorship at Basle, but was forced once again to leave the city and take to the road in a wanderer's life.</p>
<p>During the worse of his second exile, we hear of him in 1526 at Colmar and in 1530 at Nuremburg, once again in conflict with the doctors of medicine, who denounced him as an impostor, although once again, he turned the tables on his opponents by his successful treatment of several bad cases of elephantiasis. which he followed up during the next ten years by a series of cures that were amazing for that period.</p>
<p>In his book Paracelsus, Franz Hartmann says: "He proceeded to Machren, Kaernthen, Krain, and Hungary, and finally to Salzburg in Austria, where he was invited by the Prince Palatine, Duke Ernst of Bavaria, who was a great lover of the secret art of alchemy. But Paracelsus was not destined to enjoy the rest he so richly deserved. He died in 1541, after a short sickness, in a small room at the White Horse Inn, and his body was buried in the graveyard of St. Sebastian. At least one writer has suggested that his death may have been hastened by a scuffle with assassins in the pay of the orthodox medical faculty, but there is no actual foundation for this story.</p>
<p>What is odd is that not one of his biographers seems to have found anything remarkable in the fact that at sixteen years of age, Paracelsus was already well acquainted with alchemical literature. Even allowing for the earlier maturity of a man in those times, he must still have been something of a phenomenon in mental development. Certainly, few of his contemporaries either could or would grasp his teachings, and his consequent irritation and arrogance in the face of their stupidity and obstinacy is scarcely to be wondered at. Although he numbered many enemies among his fellow physicians, Paracelsus also had his disciples, and for them no praise was too high for him. He was worshipped as their noble and beloved alchemical monarch, the "German Hermes."</p>

<p>Deze Antwerpse immobilienmakelaar kwam in 2002 uit Schoten aangewaaid om op de heilige Racing grond neer te strijken. Hij verliet hiervoor zijn vorige club FC Schoten, een zinkend schip na (vermeende) omkoopaffaire. Zijn voorgangers op de voorzitterstoel bij Racing Mechelen waren Racingers in hart en nieren en stuk voor stuk geboren en getogen Mechelaars. Rooms, Gielis, Dogaer, Van Kesbeeck, ... Allen deden ze Racing Mechelen mooie tijden deed beleven. Het eerste wapenfeit van Joel Hendrickx "als Racinger" is datgene waar alle Racingsupporters nu met intens verlangen naar uitkijken.

<p>THE ACCELERATORS are an Italian band from Roma. "Oddville" is the name of their debut album, a concept of 11 tracks recorded in several analogue. Produced and mixed at forward studios in Roma on february 2006 by grammy winner David Bianco (Tom Petty, Coal Chamber, U.S. Crush, Danzig, Failure, AC/DC, Ozzy Osbourne, John Hiatt, Mick Jagger, Del Amitri, Teenage Fanclub, The Posies) and mastered by Gene Grimaldi at Oasis studio in Los Angeles on march 2006. They are unsigned and looking for a label. "Though an eclectic collection of songs, the foundation of the accelerators' debut album is soul. The grooves are thick and solid whatever the genre with every tune enriched with enormous amounts of energy and heart. the accelerators' capabilities instrumentally and vocally seem boundless and they attack what they do with great passion. The music surges with life and freedom, a reflection of their awareness of musical styles yet their refusal to toe the line of popular trends. Unpretentious and able to laugh at themselves, the bands songs are equal parts humor and drama. This album is honest, beautiful and a welcome breath of fresh air" David Bianco</p>

<p>The Grand Prix of Minnesota 1996 - 1998 was an auto racing event held on a temporary street course in Minneapolis, Minnesota near the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. It was known as the Children's Grand Prix of Minneapolis in 1996, changing its name to The Sprint PCS® Grand Prix of Minneapolis for its final two years.</p>

<p>The Grand Prix of Minneapolis was started as the first professional auto race in the United States that would contribute all of its profit to charity. The goal of the grand prix was to make a $1 million annual contribution to Cancer KIDS Fund, part of the Children’s Healthcare foundation of the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>The grand prix was founded by Mark Cohn, president and CEO of Damark International, and his wife Claudia after their youngest son Tyler (1988 – 1997) was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of 4. They knew first hand what families dealing with childhood cancer face, and found that the Cancer KIDS Fund helped these families with some of the expenses that were not covered by insurance or other agencies, like parking fees and educational material for missed schooling. Rather than just writing a check, the Cohn’s decided to create an event that would provide long-term support for the Cancer KIDS Fund.</p>
<p>The grand prix debuted on July 6-7, 1996 with Boston Market as the sponsor, returned for it’s second year on July 4-6, 1997 with Sprint PCS® as its sponsor, and was held a final year on June 27-28, 1998 again with Sprint PCS® as its sponsor.</p>
<p>All three years had the SCCA Trans-Am Championship as the featured race. Supporting races in 1996 included the World Challenge Grand Sports Division - Sports 2 and Touring Division – Touring 1 and 2, Spec Racer Ford Pro Series, and a Vintage Car race. Supporting races in 1997 were the Barber Dodge Pro Series, World Challenge Touring Division 1 and 2, Spec Racer Ford Pro Series, and a Vintage Car race. Supporting races in 1998 were the Can-Am Series, GT Series, U.S. F2000 Series, World Challenge Touring Division 1 and 2, and the Dodge Neon Charity Challenge.</p>
