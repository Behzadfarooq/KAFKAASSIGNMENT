<p>This was the first VFD I'd ever been involved it, so I wasn't trying anything malicious with the VFD page - I put my vote for keep up and then removed it because I wanted to see what kinds of comments would be put on the page before commiting to that vote. Sorry for the confusion. Also, I don't think most of the no-user comments are from sock puppets, though they obviously aren't from people who care a lot about the wikipedia's process. <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThirty3_0c92.html" title="User:Thirty3">Thirty3</a> 01:33, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I would agree that it is a neologism, yet, I think that the basic concept, a sexual practice made possblie by the internet, is a an identifiable conecpt that should have a term. the label would be helpful in discussions. This is English, after all, essentailly a chimera of neologisms words stolen form other languages. The influx of technology, and the resultant new methods of interaction are rapidly increasing the speed at which a neologism is accepted. Blogging, podcasting, Googling, Etc.

<li><b>Keep</b>, there are plenty of neologisms on this site already, deleting <i>this</i> one just because certain people don't like it is rather foolish, and the term does have its place within a fairly wide audience. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrinberry_1d21.html" title="User:Krinberry">Krinberry</a> 05:32, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This entry is not really misleading in any way; it is not as if it is incorrect. Webcest seems like an interesting linguistic experiment. I for one would like to keep around to see what happens. Besides, who is it going to hurt to keep it? 6:58, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Langauge is an ever changing and evolving concept of verbal communication. As such new words with merrit must be kept in some sort of record (hence Wikipedia). As <b>all</b> words were new once, word age cannot be considered a valid reason for discontinuation. Also, considering that the average person's vocabulary is less then 25,000 words (Psycholinguist Dr. Catherine E. Snow - Harvard Gradruate School) and there are more than three times that many 'official' words in the English Langauge (Oxford English Dictionary), one cannot assume common usage as an appropriate moniker for a word. Most importantly though, the word provides an adequate label to "innapropriate internet behavior", something that has yet to be done; therefore, the word has a place in the English Language and a justified exsistence.</li>

<p>In essence this is not an argument for whether Webcest should be a word or not, that will be decided simply if it cathes on or not. This argument concerns the ability of one to post a usefull and catchy neologism on this site. Therefore the question which is actually being voted on is this: "Is Wikipedia a place where language can evolve, or is it merely another online encyclopedia?" <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJake_Mercer_b972.html" title="User:Jake Mercer">Jake Mercer</a></p>
