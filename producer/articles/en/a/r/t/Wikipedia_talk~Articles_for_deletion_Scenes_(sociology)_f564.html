<p>The reason I believe this article should NOT be speedily deleted is that covers an area of sociology not covered anywhere else in Wikipedia. The current list of Groups of people only covers groups with a defining limit. Scenes by their very nature do not HAVE these limits.</p>
<p>Their main importance is they include EVERYTHING involved in something. From the people who are interested in it for profit, fun, legislation, studies about it, and many more. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorrupt_one_8b41.html" title="User:Corrupt one">Corrupt one</a></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_Scenes_%28sociology%29_f564.html" title="Edit section: Difference from other groups">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Difference from other groups</span></h3>
<p>They emcompass parts from different groups of people, without applying restriction, be it subculture (the most obvious part of a scene to the media), Communites of Interest or location, class, groups, movements and many other things.</p>
<p>All of them have limits</p>
<p><b>Subcultures</b>; although the most obvios part of a scene, (and are commonly called scenes by themselves) do not include everyone else involved in the activities that cater to their subculture. How many ravers do you see managing a company that sells raver music CD's? How many anachists sit on the censorship boards that decide if some video clip can be played? How many bikers are represent other bikers as lawyers in court?</p>
<p><b>Communities of Location;</b> these may count as scenes, ONLY for the local area, but on the condition the community is not affected by the outside world much. (Yes, theer ARE some places like that) Otherwise, you have to consider those things.</p>
<p><b>Communities of Interest</b>; These communities focus on those with a shared interest. they do NOT include those who are involved in other ways. Examples include the motorbike racing community of interest. The community would NOT include those who advertise it.</p>
<p><b>Class</b>: It is not a main facter in scenes.</p>
<p><b>Groups</b>; A Scene includes people who never meet each other, and may be on the other side of the world.</p>
<p><b>Movements</b>; Movements are people who want to cause a change and set out with that as their goal. A scene can include many diverse movements, like in the 70's with Peaceniks, hippies, antigovernemt, antiauthoritarians, anachists, communits, woodchildren, wicca and all the rest. they were part of the movement scene who banded together to increase their apparent numbers. This method is still in use, according to Virtual Nation; the Internet in Australia edited by Gerard Goggin. in the section Networks of Influence it case studies We are all Boat People which ADMITS to do that! Scenes would include these people, and those who are involved in other ways, like the media that covers them, and other such things.</p>

<p>If you want to fully study something in sociology, you end up having to study it's scene, if you want to do a proper job. You study the thing,a nd the related things. What people like it, where those people came from, how it affects local businesses and groups, the media coverage, the laws response, and other such things.</p>
<p>A fully study of a sociological impact on something can not be compleate until a person studies all who are involved or interested in something. The very thing that a Scene is being defined as!</p>
<p>I am hoping that people would add to the article and make it grow from there. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorrupt_one_8b41.html" title="User:Corrupt one">Corrupt one</a></p>
