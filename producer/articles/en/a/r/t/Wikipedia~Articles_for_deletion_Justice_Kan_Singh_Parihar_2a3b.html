<p><s>article. There are lots of articles in wikipedia. But it is not necessary that those articles should apply to people who live in other parts of the world, of course not. Whatever you contribute to Wikipedia is not necessarily useful or interesting to everyone. But it can be good, useful, and informative to the people of the related country or certain region. Wikipedia is a very broad educational site it should not reflect with someone’s likes or dislikes. I do not feel there is any hero-worshipping. I support this article.

<li><s><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../j/o/d/User%7EJodmar_9ce0.html" title="User:Jodmar">Jodmar</a> is grossly mistaken on policy. AFD frequently results in reworking an unacceptable article into an acceptable one. Reverting to a version that is absolutely, grossly unacceptable is odd behavior from someone who wants the article kept. We have articles here, not fawning tributes and hero-worship. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 13:00, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</s></li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b>. Even though he may meet standards for notability, it seems clear that the proponents of this article are unable or unwilling to accept Wikipedia standards for an article. That leaves no alternative but to delete unless someone can come up with an alternative solution. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 13:43, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</s></li>
