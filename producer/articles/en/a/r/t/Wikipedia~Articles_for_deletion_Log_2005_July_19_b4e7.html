Perhaps the article (and the Wikipedia) would have been better served had the article initially been created as a stub - it is certainly light on content and on substance, but then stubs are.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as vanity, self-promotion, original research. Whatever. If someone wants to write an article about the real person behind it, may be encyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidH_d410.html" title="User:DavidH">DavidH</a> 05:40, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Since I'm a "stranger", I'd first of all better say that I have no connection with Mr. Rat, know almost nothing about him, and have no reason for bias, although I do use one of his free scripts.</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I firmly feel that the 2 current entries for Mr. Rat should be kept. A search of either the <a href="http://forums.prosperotechnologies.com/n/mb/listsf.asp?webtag=am-associhelp&amp;ctx=128" class="external text" title="http://forums.prosperotechnologies.com/n/mb/listsf.asp?webtag=am-associhelp&amp;ctx=128" rel="nofollow">General Amazon Associates Discussion Board</a> or the <a href="http://forums.prosperotechnologies.com/n/mb/listsf.asp?webtag=am-associhelp&amp;ctx=1024" class="external text" title="http://forums.prosperotechnologies.com/n/mb/listsf.asp?webtag=am-associhelp&amp;ctx=1024" rel="nofollow">Amazon Associates AWS Discussion Board</a> shows that his scripts are an overwelmingly important contributor to the success of the Amazon AWS project, and thus are an extremely important example of the practical use of XML and remote feeds. As long as there are entries relating to XML, remote feeds, or the Amazon E-Commerce Service, the articles on Mr. Rat are also a major contribution to Wikipedia.

<li>I'm the anonymous user who was apparently 62.0.112.191 a few hours ago. (I don't quite understand that, but it's not relevant here. Maybe my router mysteriously rebooted and reconnected without my noticing, though I don't see how.) Will I seem more respectable if I sign up for an identity? I doubt that I'll be writing on Wikipedia much. And if I do sign up, is there a way to aim my new-found respectability retroactively to this thread? Thanks. David.

<li>Signing up for a username solely to vote in this discussion won't get you much of anywhere. Votes from usernames registered after the beginning of the discussion are routinely discounted, as are votes from anonymous or registered users with very few edits (which applies to most of the keep votes here, I'm afraid). This is to prevent the occurrence of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">sockpuppetry</a>. As for your IP, it's certainly possible you got reassigned a new IP between your first and second comments; see <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamic_IP_7e5b.html" title="Dynamic IP">Dynamic IP</a> if you aren't familiar with this aspect of the Internet. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 02:03, July 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> beacuse, as written, it has way too much marketing. If it was rewritten as a real article, and not a promotional advertisement, then it may have a chance. And yes, I *use* mrrat's scripts. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclipsed_8cc9.html" title="User:Eclipsed">Eclipsed</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I don't see how it is possible to have an article about someone who is famous for his work without talking about his work! I have posted a request on the articles discussion page explaining the dilemna and asking Wikipedians for suggestions in how to move this forward. One or two of you have commented that there may be the basis of an encyclopedic article in there. Any constructive suggestions for how to move this forward - or comments on my earlier suggestion of marking the article as a stub, which is after all a marker for articles that need bulking out with more content - Dean Marshall.

<li><b>Keep</b>, MrRat is a well known figure among many Amazon Developers and the users of there Affiliate system. Without him, I personally could not have started my career in XML web apps as easy as I have. His forums are a great help to many and his software, even though he is "mysterious", is well known. I suggest we keep this and add more to it as we can to help others see a pillar of how to make money with open source. Open source is the future and MrRat is helping many of us realize that future with no selfishness on his part. His support is free, his script is free, and his forums are free. I personally have donated money to his project as a thank you but its not a requirement to use his script. This is my first post to Wikipedia and hopefully not my last, but please do not let my newness discount my comments towards this very generous and helpful person. Thank you. -SilentJoe User:SilentJoe

<li>Hello, only a small comment from my site, sorry for my bad english, my native language is german. MrRat wrote the first open source application for Amazon Webservices AWS. His amazon products feed (APF) is one of the most suggested software from Amazon.com and in my opinion the most used Amazon software worldwide. (Most used affiliate software worldwide...) It is open source so everyone can use it without profit for MrRat and thats the best on it, because he coded this script for tousands of affiliates and websites in the world who earn money whith it every day. For me this script was the start in the world of webservices and XML and I'm sure without it webservices, Amazon usage of XML wo't be what it is today. Regards from Germany Frank — <i>(Unsigned comment by 194.138.39.52; user's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_194.138.39.52_10ca.html" title="Special:Contributions/194.138.39.52">37th</a> edit. Contribution history suggests this is an IP shared by many editors.)</i></li>
<li>KEEP the Mr. Rat Entry in Wikipedia. Mr. Rat's script is the most widely used of the Amazon API scripts. It has literally HUNDREDS of hacks and mods written for it and posted on the web, and probably THOUSANDS including those which are proprietary. The product is an open source script used by THOUSANDS of users on TENS-of-THOUSANDS of websites, and with a built-in ability to load and run special mods. Mr. Rat is nothing short of a PHENOMENON in the world of API scripting for automated web page creation, and his scripts work on the world's largest and most widely-distributed API - the Amazon.com API. Deleting Mr. Rat from the Wikipedia would show an extraordinary IGNORANCE of what is happening in the world of API scripting - a massive and growing phenomenon with THOUSANDS of users and TENS of THOUSANDS of websites. Come on Wikipedia, what's going on? Does the category manager really not know of Mr. Rat? Let's get with the program here. KEEP Mr. Rat entry. Do NOT delete it.

<li>Ditto everything in the above posting from HostingDude.com KEEP Mr. Rat. Mr. Rat's script is the finest and most widely used on the Amazon API. I run hundreds of websites using it. DO NOT delete the Mr. Rat Entry.

<li><b>STRONG DISAGREE</b> - As an avid and long time user of MrRat's scripts, I don't see what the hub bub is about here. He is an established author of widely used programs. I can't believe it was even considered for deletion. Seems like sour grapes from the competition to me and if allowed to be deleted for such a reason it brings the viablity of Wikipedia itself into question. — <i>(Unsigned comment by Piwacket; user's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Piwacket_6aa1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Piwacket">1st</a> and only edit so far.)</i></li>

<dd>True, there is no limit on the size of an article or number of topics because we're not limited to physical constraints of paper encyclopedias. However, servers cost money. And everytime you get an error message because the servers are overloaded it should remind you that non-encyclopedic topics shouldn't be on here. There is no "recyclable list" so the best thing is to delete articles that shouldn't take up space. I don't know if <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Green_5ab0.html" title="Dave Green">Dave Green</a> is notable, it may be notable in his community, but the article doesn't explain how. Writing freelance to magazines that have disappeared and being on committees to organize conferences and being friends with <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_O%27Brien_a7e9.html" title="Danny O'Brien">Danny O'Brien</a> does not implay notability. He does seem to have fans or friends who have voted with no previous record of contributing with wikipedia. Is that why he should have an article? --<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizcarra_288c.html" title="User:Vizcarra">Vizcarra</a> 00:58, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't agree but if I did then I would point out this VfD is longer than the article you want deleted. Your comments alone are longer than the article you want to delete. So next time you get a server overloaded message... <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 01:21, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>However, keeping this article would justify the inclusion of every freelance writer (how many are they? tens of thousands?) Every owner of a website (millions like his "snackfood" site) and other hundreds of thousands of people that helpt put together (the thousands of) conferences around the world, thus requiring much more server space than many times the size of this VfD article. So, hopefully my remarks will not go in vain and save server space in the long run. --<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizcarra_288c.html" title="User:Vizcarra">Vizcarra</a> 02:21, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can vote, but the vote won't count because you don't have enough contributions to the wikipedia (there's a determined number of edits necessary before being able to vote). It's easier to argue <a href="../../../n/t/k/NTK_56bc.html" title="NTK">NTK</a> to be notable, but harder to argue you to be notable. You are not exactly a celebrity outside of the UK (as far as I am aware). And those in the UK haven't provided much information in the article to justify you to be notable (other than saying that "yanks don't know who the f**k Dave Green is).
<dl>
<dd>Even if David Green is unknown outside the UK that has never been a criterion for inclusion/exclusion. Many Wikipedians are in the UK and they need an encyclopaedia too!

<p>Wickerpedia: The parody. Wikipedia is the collaboratively created Web encyclopedia, using software that permits many editors, i.e., a wiki. Wickerpedia is not. It's a parody of wikipedia.org, only with more of an emphasis on wicker (which is terribly represented by wikipedia). The site features a more wickercentric view of history, the news, and common wisdom, as well as a much improved searching engine.</p>

<li>Definitely <b>expand</b> and <b>keep.</b> Whitney High's claim to being a Wikipedia topic in its own right does not rest exclusively or decisively on its being a highly rated magnet school in California's public education system. It is also the subject of a widely reviewed volume, <i>School of Dreams</i>, written by the Pulitzer prizewinning journalist Edward Humes <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A28398-2003Sep4?language=printer" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A28398-2003Sep4?language=printer" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://www.eddigest.com/html/EHumes.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eddigest.com/html/EHumes.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://www.educationnews.org/book-review-school-of-dreams.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.educationnews.org/book-review-school-of-dreams.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Humes uses this book-length case study of Whitney High to bring to national attention the pressures endured by the students of America's selective schools as they strive to give their families nachas through their academic and future professional accomplishments, and interrogates the "wisdom" of educating children in such a hectic learning environment.--<a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDefrosted_5367.html" title="User:Defrosted">Defrosted</a> 07:51, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well I'd just like to say that I personally know a sect of Alianists and that the religion is not a hoax. I don't who added the article to Wikipedia because Alianism doesnt promote use of technology and therefore I doubt that it was a practicing member who posted it. However, most of the information in the article is correct according to my source and she finds the idea of you dismissing her religion as a hoax hurtful and deeply discriminatory. Alianist members are also in the process of setting up a website she tells me so the point about there being no search results on google is totally moot. I have to say it sends a very bad message, image wise, about Wikipedia that it is willing to delete the first publication about a new religion for absolutely no reason. And to the person who was talking about the IP address you'll probably realise that this has the same address. This is because I am on a computer at Sydney Girls High School in Sydney. This does not, however, make me a student, nor does it make up opinions invalid. <small>(Unsigned comment by Hesfb (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hesfb_8a8b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hesfb">contribs</a>), user's first edit)</small></li>
<li>I think this open patronising of such a worthwhile religion is horrible. i am a converted full believer of Alianism. My husband converted me in order for us to be married in a traditional Alian ceremony. I am slightly unorthodox in the fact that I use computers and do believe in technology, but i find it terribley offensive that my deep spiritual belief would be questioned in this way. <small>(Unsigned comment by Hannah g (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hannah_g_42b4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hannah g">contribs</a>), user's first edit)</small></li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This is the kind of thing I used wikipedia for when I first came on this site. I would fine a (relatively) obscure reference, and would look it up here... and lo-and-behold, the term usually had an article.

<li>It appears it should be "Spy-Fi", based on googling. This reveals a lot more usages in established sources (i.e., not Wikipedia mirrors or do-it-yourself websites). I'm reconsidering... <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 18:48, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm still on the fence on this. Looking at a lot of sites on "Spy-Fi", most are refering to <a href="../../../s/p/y/Spy_fiction.html" title="Spy fiction">Spy fiction</a>, which we already have. The only place I've ever heard of Spy-Fi or SpyFi in which the article defines it is at Wikipedia and its mirrors.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I find the tendency of spy TV show script writers (and also authors, of course) to invent gadgets, with total freedom (as in without any knowledge of or reference to actual contemporary technology), to be disturbing. Thus having a term for this sort of thing is useful, because then we can talk about that which is not spy-fi. I think the term spy-fi (or spyfi or SpyFi) is badly chosen, but I can't come up with a better one. --Peter Knutsen, 23th of July 2005.

<li>Define Notability: Obviously they will not be notorious outside Mexico. They are however most notable within Mexico. The stub is very poorly written and I would vote to delete on that de-merit but notability seems to be the point, the "Libres y Locos" is not a cheerleader squad or a bunch of guys who go to sports games (Actually, two people who voted for delete admit not knowing what "Libres y locos" really are).</li>

<dd>Jun Cruz Reyes, is , surely a notable Filipino. He is a gifted writer and his works has inspired a new twist in Philippine literature, specifically contemporary Tagalog or Filipino literature, because of the lightness and casualness in tone and humor-inspired, satirical style. This is notably evident in his famous "Utos ng Hari" short story and the novel "Tutubi, tutubi, huwag magpahuli sa mamang salbahe" and the latest Centennial Award winning great novel "Etsa-Puwera" all of which I have read. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaluyot_587c.html" title="User:Saluyot">Saluyot</a> 03:31, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy</b> hoax/attack page. Well, this is interesting (ok, not really)... what looks at first glance like a silly hoax vanity article is actually a silly hoax attack page. Basically a longwinded (and therefore dumber) version of the "___ IS GAY!!!11" articles we get fairly frequently. If anyone needs proof, check out the part about STDs in the next-to-last paragraph. Even the basic facts are wrong: The current Broadway run of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? started in 2005, not 2004, and Bill Irwin (not "Irvin") is still in the lead as George. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 10:56, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Either/or. I'm not picky.&#160;;) Seriously though, if you don't have enough information to keep an article from sounding like advertising, maybe you shouldn't start the article. Also, I don't actually think it does sound like advertising; you note in the text that all info comes from the govt. report.

<li>Did you read my post aside from the first tongue-in-cheek line? Editors don't exist to copy their sources verbatim; they must exercise judgement and determine what from their sources is unbiased and NPOV. Also, as to adding information, what is that but finding another source and getting a more rounded, balanced view of the article's subject.--<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/User_talk%7EScimitar_c843.html" title="User talk:Scimitar"><sup>parley</sup></a> 17:14, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ofsted reports give rounded, balanced views by reporting major weaknesses when then find them. If they don't find any, that's significant fact worth reporting. They have a tendancy to flatter schools, so I toned that aspect down. I didn't copy the report wholesale, but strengths/weaknesses and popularity are some of the most important aspects for describing what is distinctive about a school. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 21:42, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable (22 year old) student political groupie. Is one of several co-authors of a soon-to-be published handbook on the most recent installment of the "<a href="../../../a/r/s/Ars_Magica_becc.html" title="Ars Magica">Ars Magica</a>" game, apparently intentionally misspelled "Arse Magica" in the article. Some of the claims of notability seem exaggerated. Unreferenced claim that his blog that "is a frequent reference point for campaigners" in Melbourne or student government. A careful Google search excluding other "Alex Whites" brings up only about 200 unique hits, mostly from an active blogging community at his college. Nonetheless, no printed sources. So he appears to be a young political-type who may someday be notable. Delete or userfy.

<li>I'm leaning toward <b>keep</b> as well. While it's not likely to be viewed on its own, it certainly can make a good companion piece to the main Nickelodeon article and can be wikied accordingly. - Lucky 6.9 01:01, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I suggested at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_musicians_that_are_popular_amongst_Nickelodeon_fans_aa97.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of musicians that are popular amongst Nickelodeon fans">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of musicians that are popular amongst Nickelodeon fans</a> that this was a better list to have. We have similar lists, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_celebrities_on_the_Simpsons_641d.html" title="List of celebrities on the Simpsons">List of celebrities on the Simpsons</a>. Nickelodeon is a very prominent cable TV channel, and artists appearing on there usually get a good following from that channel's demographic (and the successful ones usually get started by appearing there, on the Disney Channel, and on similar kids' TV channels). So if we could take this list and expand it to include names from Nick's past history (which goes back to 1979) and the international versions of it, then that would certainly have encyclopedic value. (By the way, thanks to Uncle G for letting me know that this article was up for VfD.) --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 03:08, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not unsympathetic to that argument -- however, since the list has two entries now, how about renaming it List of celebrities who have made a guest appearance on Nickelodeon shows? Why just musicians, when there are only two as of now, and I distinctly recall seeing <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Cosby_9aa1.html" title="Bill Cosby">Bill Cosby</a>, for example, at the first Kid's Choice Awards in 1988? <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 05:39, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good point. I'd support that; it's in keeping with all of the "List of celebrities who have appeared on (some show, channel, or something like that)" lists. When the list gets big enough, it would be good to divide it (within the list, not create new articles) into musicians, actors, and so on. I think it's worth noting that Bill Cosby appeared on a Nickelodeon show. (Though I haven't looked at the related articles very much at all - are hosts of awards shows included on those, or just people who appear on the regular daily or weekly shows?) --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 06:23, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>For a long time, this page listed all the stub categories. Now, it's a description of how to modify your CSS settings to make a couple of templates look different. Is there a general how-to page for tweaking Wikipedia CSS? I couldn't find one, except on MediaWiki -- maybe this belongs there.

<p>Not notable. I had not realized we have an article on this publisher until now. I spoke with Marc Snyder, the proprieter of this establishment, some time back while verifying some facts regarding the now-deleted Daniel C. Boyer article. Marc told me at that time that they typically produce 10-25 copies of the materials that they publish, and that distribution is primarily to a list of subscriber/sponsors. Insofar as none of the chapbooks they have published are particularly notable, I believe that this falls well short of the notability we would expect for a publisher. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 15:59, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Weak <b>keep.</b> Article needs improvement. Would be better as a redirect to an article on erasable typewriter paper in general. Erasable typewriter paper was an important technology in the 1950s and 1960s and my recollection is that in the United States Eaton's Corrasable truly was the dominant brand, and a "genericized" tradename like Kleenex or Scotch tape. Big stationary stores might carry other brands but always carried Corrasable, and any store that carried typing paper at all would be likely to have it. It was pretty much superseded by opaquing technogies like Ko-Rec-Type and Wite-Out and Liquid Paper and "correcting Selectrics." As a grad student I still remember the excitement when a colleague brought us the news that the university would now accept photocopied theses as long as they were photocopied onto 100%-rag paper. That meant we could type our theses on Corrasable Bond and photocopy them onto thesis paper for submission! <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2005.html" title="As of 2005">As of 2005</a> is the stuff even manufactured?

<li>Thanks Splash for cleaning up the page creation. My concern is that Mr. Kinsella himself recreated this new page about himself. It was already voted deleted once. He wants a second bite at the apple for his own self-interest.He has commented about it on his blog. <a href="http://www.stephankinsella.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stephankinsella.com/" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> Someone has linked him under "Noted" <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_attorneys.html" title="Patent attorneys">Patent attorneys</a> almost immediately after his new page was created. This looks like self-promotion. I do not think Wikipedia should be used like this. I do not think that it is appropriate. Mr. Kinsella looks notable enough to me to have an article about him. As far as I know, the information is accurate, however, it seems hard for the article to be neutral when he wrote it about himself. He certainly speaks very highly of himself, "He has drawn on his expertise as a practicing patent lawyer to become a leading libertarian opponent of intellectual property laws; his seminal argument 'Against Intellectual Property' has become widely referred to and cited." This does not sound neutral. I suppose it could be rewritten, but who is going to correct Mr. Kinsella about himself, so I think this creates an on-going problem for the article.

<li>RyanK: I had no idea until you just wrote this that I am under patent attorneys. I had nothing to do with this. I am really not interested in self-promotion. I just want people interested in my writing to be able to access it. As for the promotional aspects to my entry, I'll modify and make it shorter and more factual. But I have summarized my case for why my entry clearly satisfies the Wiki "notable" criteria here Votes_for_deletion/Stephan_Kinsella_2. None of the delete voteres have tried to follow the policy. Let me summarize: I have published books and articles, with audiences that satisfy the criteria. I have 19,000 Google hits. I am more well known than the average college professor. My info is factual and easily verifiable. Moreover, I am as far as I know the only practicing, licensed patent attorney who has written an explicit critique of the patent system as a whole, who calls for its abolition; and this articles has gotten a large amount of attention and is seen as one of the leading pieces in the libertarian anti-IP movement. By Wikie's own standards, I believe my entry is acceptable, as was the initial one not put up by me and therefore never should have been deleted. I would at least like to see Wiki editors citing and applying Wiki policy if they are doing to cast a delete vote. For example, why do I not qualify, in view of the factors I have noted, that I got from Wiki's own policy pages? <a href="../../../n/s/k/User%7ENskinsella_1eb3.html" title="User:Nskinsella">Nskinsella</a> 23:56, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually, if you take out the domains mises.org, stephankinsella.com, lewrockwell.com and other domains that have blogs that you post to, your mentions drop to 13,000. Most of the 13,000 other hits are posts by you to other blogs, and responses to posts to the other blogs, since you seemingly spend every waking hour logged onto the internet to rebut your critics. So please don't go around claiming 19,000 hits as if these were people independently citing your work. Most of these instances are blog comments, and answers to your blog comments.

<li>I was the original contributor of the first article on Stephan Kinsella, although I contributed it before I started my present account. My contribution was based on a growing number of refereed journal articles, books, and lectures in which Kinsella's "Against Intellectual Property" was being cited. I was the original founder of the Birmingham, AL and Auburn, AL <a href="../../../t/h/e/2600%7E_The_Hacker_Quarterly_e4af.html" title="2600: The Hacker Quarterly">2600</a> meetings, and ran an "h/p/c/a/v" <a href="../../../b/b/s/BBS_e769.html" title="BBS">BBS</a> in the 90's. Since the late 90's, I have been very interested in IP, and have lectured on it at Auburn University and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. When I came across Kinsella's IP article in 2001 (in the Journal of Libertarian Studies), I had not met him, nor anyone else who knew him personally, but I did meet numerous academics who were taking his dismantling of IP very seriously. I personally thought that it was an essential step towards an exhaustive conciliation of the <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacker_Ethic_cf5b.html" title="Hacker Ethic">Hacker Ethic</a> with <a href="../../../p/r/o/Property_rights.html" title="Property rights">property rights</a>. Kinsella is now a frequent lecturer at Mises Institute events, and is constantly cited by eminent scholars like <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Block_b788.html" title="Walter Block">Walter Block</a> as /the/ go-to guy on IP theory. As the point most germane to this discussion though, please let me reiterate that I was the original article contributor, and only mentioned the entry to Stephan when I asked his permission to release an image (stephankinsella.jpg) from his website into the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>.

<li>Willmcw: My original entry was put up by someone else. It was not a vanity piece. But I have summarized my case for why my entry clearly satisfies the Wiki "notable" criteria here Votes_for_deletion/Stephan_Kinsella_2. Why do you disagree with it? I fail to see the relevance of my motives for posting the entry, but if you must know, after looking at the criteria for notability more closely due to the delete debate about the Palmer entry, I realized my entry qualifies and should not have been deleted. The preveious delete debate did not cite of follow Wiki policy. People just used their airy-fairy discretion to say "notable" or not. BUt there are criteria, and I expect Wiki editors to make a good faith effort to apply them. WHich of the policy criteria that I have listed do you deny? Notice, you yourself are inconsisten, Willmcw: you voted to keep the Tom G. Palmer entry, on the grounds that he is openly gay at a think tank. This is ridiculous. What if I am a closeted gay?-wouldn't your policy punish gays in the closet? Moreover, as far as I know the only practicing, licensed patent attorney who has written an explicit critique of the patent system as a whole, who calls for its abolition. You seem to be nonobjective in my case. <a href="../../../n/s/k/User%7ENskinsella_1eb3.html" title="User:Nskinsella">Nskinsella</a> 23:56, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>The previous version, since you keep mentioning it, was most likely written by you originally. It was then posted to a copyrighted webpage. Another editor, DickClarkMises, posted it here verbatim. That was a clear "copyvio" and I marked it as such. You refused to release the text under our <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> and made disparaging comments about me on your blogs (thanks). We undertook to write a fresh version that was not a copyvio, and that version was subsequently VfDed (in a process which saw several brand-new editors voting to "keep") three months ago.</li>
<li>Regarding the Palmer article, Wikipedia is not consistent. Please do not try to prove a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> that if your rival gets something then you must too. Nonetheless I see you said there that you are not notable for your writing. If not that then what? On the other hand, in the spirit of equity, I'd be happy to change my vote to "delete" on that page if you'll do the same here. The chance that the Palmer article (which is mostly irrelevant to this discussion) may have started as autobiography and be currently edited by its subject are bothersome. Subjects who edit their articles are almost always a problem.
<ul>
<li>Willmcw, don't you think it's a bit ... off... of you to offer to change your vote on Palmer? Shouldn't you simply vote (a) in accordance with your good faith application of Wiki biograph policy; and (b) try to vote consistently? I assure you that my first Wiki entry was not vanity, nor did I do it or have anything to do with it. And as I have modifed the current version, it is short, unobtrusive, purely factual, and completely non-vanity.
<ul>
<li>I'm glad you haven't lost your sense of humor. Anyway, the offer still stands. You said you're not notable, you say Palmer isn't notable either. If you vote to delete both of them then, as a gesture of "wikilove", I'll do the same. Oh, and if you had nothing to do with the previous version, then I guess "nothing" includes the fact that you wrote it, edited it, and then you (and your friends) fought to keep it. It didn't just "happen." -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 06:25, July 20, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Willmcw: I said i was not notable in a colloquial sense; but when I read the criteria, I believe I qualify. As for the previous version: I meant I had nothing to do with an entry being put up in the first place. Dick Clark is not my friend; I do not even know him. I cannot access the origianl article since you had it deleted, but yes, he probably got most of the info from my online bio. that is true. Once it was up, and i was made aware of it, I did edit it, which is not impermissible. I actually did not fight to keep it, when you deleted it, I just objected to your calling it a vanity page since it was NOT. --<a href="../../../n/s/k/User%7ENskinsella_1eb3.html" title="User:Nskinsella">Nskinsella</a> 19:54, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Willmcw: I have removed the books. I can't find the original version of my entry, unfortunately. You say I wrote the original article; yet I have denied this and you have no proof. In fact Dick Clark admitted to doing it. Are you calling us both liars? That is uncalled for. I could have put my entry up anonymously or asked someone to do it. I have been honest. Your insinuation is uncalled for. As for copyright, there was not one, since I consented to it. The VfD of that first page was improper, since I clearly meet the criteria specified on Wiki policy. You have just asserted your own opinion as to consistency, but not tried to apply actual Wiki standards. As for Wiki not being consistent--no, it might not be, but you, as an individual, should be, otherwise you reveal unfairness, bias, or arbitrariness. Your alleged reason for Palmer's "keep" vote is that he is openly gay; this is absurd. Others say he has a large number of google hits, thus they vote "keep"; my google votes are higher. Others point to Palmer's publications; mine are greater in number, and I have books in addition to articles. I am only trying to have this entry treated fairly and judged by actual Wiki policy, which none of you deletes seems to want to try to make an effort to apply. I would appreciate a little fairness here.</li>
<li>Your google hits are almost entirely links to comments made by you on blogs, or responses to comments made by you on blogs. For instance, the number of hits drops by 6,000 if you take out the domains stephankinsella.com, mises.org and lewrockwell.com.

<li>Whilst I'm merely observing this debate, I should point out that you spelt the subject's name incorrectly in your search. Also, Google isn't fooled that easily either. Click forward through a few pages of hits (by jumping e.g. 10 pages at a time) and Google will truncate the search to the 'unique' results like <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22stephan+kinsella%22&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=5nF&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=400&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22stephan+kinsella%22&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=5nF&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=400&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Note the message from Google at the bottom. As an aside, I'm not sure that specifically searching with an engine that avoids any kind of media/literature search is particularly useful for establishing notability or not. Without commenting on this article, I would suggest that your 22 hits just shows that there are 22 references to him in usenet groups and the like; that doesn't cover any of the more useful outlets at all. There may or may not be anything more notable turned up in a proper Google, but the groups search doesn't even admit the possibility. I find the truncation that Google does to be quite useful. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 15:34, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The subject has enough publications that someone might want to know more about this author and turn to Wikipedia for the information. Although it's an autobio, most of it seems verifiable, and we can remove the puffery, as we would with any non-autobio article. (I've seen worse in articles that clearly weren't vanity.) That it was already VfD'd once is certainly a concern. We don't want to be debating the same articles over and over.

<li>You are not being penalized. An encyclopedia article is not a reward or something you deserve or have a right to.

<li>This is not true. I have noticed some people who voted to delete my entry are applying other standards elsewhere so I have merely asked that they make sure their standards are consistent and fair. That is all. If someone in good faith votes to delete my entry I have no problem with this. Strangely, however, I have noticed that NONE of the "delete" voters have even made an attempt to justify their decision based on Wiki's own criteria for bios; as I have shown, by those standards, my entry is permissible. No one has even attempted to contradict me on this. Sad. <a href="../../../n/s/k/User%7ENskinsella_1eb3.html" title="User:Nskinsella">Stephan Kinsella</a> 19:16, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Stephan is obviously making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. An important difference between his article and Palmer's is that the latter isn't self-written. Also it seems that Palmer simply has a greater claim to notability. Creating your own article out of disagreement with a deletion is poor form. Wanting an article deleted because your own may be deleted is similarly poor form. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 21:22, July 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>With regard to criteria... all right. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> is a guideline, not a firm policy; it is a set of suggestions on how to look at biographies. The main section says that biographies meeting some criteria <i>may</i> be included, not that they <i>must</i> be. I happen to like the Google test, one of the criteria mentioned in the article. My own vote was originally based on an application of a variation of the Google test, using Google Groups. I then confirmed my impression using a Proquest search. I am now about to do a third: I personally regard a person as notable if they have written a book with an Amazon sale rank number that is less than (i.e. higher ranked than) 200,000. I do not know how this test will turn out. I believe by the way that this is a weaker criterion than "sales over 5,000." If Amazon shows that <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephan_Kinsella_bf6a.html" title="Stephan Kinsella">Stephan Kinsella</a> has written a book with a sales rank number under 200,000 I will change my vote to "keep."

<li>Note that Amazon sales ranks depend strongly on recency of sales. a bookm that has sold fewer copiees, but sold them more recently will generally have a lower (better) rank. The ranks are really not meaningful until you are dealing with books currently sellign well -- then they may be used to compare how well. Also they only record online sales, and are thus subject to systematic bias against books disproportionaly sold directly. I think you can get actual sales figures fromw Bowker (the people who maintain the Books in Print database) that are much more accurate, and give actual numbers of books sold, not a "rank", but I don't know exactly how to do this. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> 15:13, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't blame you, and thanks. The Civil Law dictionary is a mistake by Amazon; it's not even a book. I tried to get them to fix it but they won't. I have an article by that title. Someone at Amazon is confused. The other books are expensive, specialty books. They hardly ever sell on Amazon; almost all of them are bought directly from the 50 year old publisher Oceana, which has an established catalog and direct mail and online presence. Digest is a 6 volume set so has less than 5000 sales. I am not sure of the sales of Online Contract Formation, but I think it's less than 5000 so far; but it was jsut releated last year. However, the International Investment book IS BEING RELEASED NEXT MONTH so there are no sales yet (though there are over 1000 pre-orders). The book it's replacing is the 1997 book, on Protecting Foreign Invesmtment. Its sales have petered of in last 2 years b/c the new book is coming out and b/c it's dated, but that book did have well over 5000 sales, and I can get a letter from Oceana to prove it if you want. MOroever, the criteria say articles in publications w/ more than 5000 subscribers, and several of mine have that. The Freeman for one, and probably some of the law reviews. <a href="../../../n/s/k/User%7ENskinsella_1eb3.html" title="User:Nskinsella">Stephan Kinsella</a> 00:34, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> My original vote was deleted from this page. This is a vanity page, and Kinsella admits he wrote it himself. If you delete it, he's going to repost it as Stephan Kinsella 3, anyway. But it should be deleted anyway. Also, nearly all of the "keep" votes are sockpuppetish, or, I suspect, people on mailing lists that Stephan Kinsella has urged to vote for him. Virtually no libertarian knows who this guy is, except for a small band of people in Alabama. He's not cited in any serious academic articles. He's not published in any serious academic journals. He's just some lawyer guy who has a gigantic ego and a lot of free time to play around on the internet. Look how many times he comments on others' votes.

<li>Stephan: I have been in the mainstream libertarian movement for 10 years. I've met every notable libertarian academic in the U.S., and many foreign ones. I have also met you. I have met and had discussions with nearly every important libertarian legal theorist from Epstein, to Posner, to Volokh, to Barnett, to Post, and so on. Not once has your name been mentioned by ANY one of them, even when we've talked about IP law. It's very likely that not ONE of them knows who you are, although I wouldn't know for sure since your name doesn't come up. You are not cited by them. You are not invited to conferences hosted by or attended by them. You haven't taught at any particularly impressive schools, or published in any respectable academic journals. You may be a fine practicing attorney - I would not know - but you do not qualify as a libertarian thinker, if by you mean "taken seriously by others." What's more, my vote was deleted.

<dd>I'm sorry, but by what criterion are you defining "respectable academic journals"? It seems to be an arbitrary one. Others have already listed journal articles has Kinsella has published. And I find your assertion that you have met "every notable libertarian academic in the US" laughable. It sounds to me that you have such a monster ego that if you have not gained personal audience with a "thinker" than you refuse to allow them to be referred to as notable. I have been in the "mainstream libertarian movement" for five years, and I HAVE heard of him. Maybe you should read more, so you could open your eyes to the notable libertarians that you haven't had a beer with.</dd>

As a libertarian (with no association with Shephan Kinsella) I value this article as a noncommercial document that provides information I find educational. In reviewing the other votes for deletion I find many votes citing what I see as a weak reason (vanity or non-notable) outweighed by by what I believe is the reason Wikipedia or any encyclopedia article should exist: to provide useful information in context.

Also, I suggest that this might as well be a VfD on all three of them, and on the other planned additions to this series, since each of the articles in the series covers equivalent topics. I think it would be a shame if this new series were deleted out of wikicowardice and unwillingness to protect Wikipedia from the POV mosquitoes who will be attracted to these articles. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 18:14, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm absolutely flummoxed by your claim that this is original research. Please help. I guess I'm slow. I quite literally do not understand what you mean when you say that it is original research to state that the Bible claims that Jews, qua Jews, committed acts of violence against non-Jews. Take a look at my Wikipedia edit history and see whether you think I am acting out of the anti-Jewish agenda you suspect has motivated this article. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 18:33, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please review the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> article; the "Religious persecution by Jews" article asserts that there is such a phenomenon as "Religious persecution by Jews", and that actions by the ancient Israelite tribes constitute examples of the same. This is a novel thesis which needs to be supported by citeable sources. Considering that the Bible is not considered a particularly reliable historical source, and that the Bible nowhere says the incidents mentioned were done by Jews (but rather by Israelites), the whole article is questionable. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:26, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh incidentally, the Bible repeatedly describes these events as being committed by "Yehudim" (Yud-heh-dalet-mem), then and now the Hebrew word for "Jews". I think what you are trying to say is that the Torah (pentateuch) describes only Israelites, but the transition to "Jews" is made at some point in the Nevi'im. Not that any of this will influence any votes on the VfD, which is fueled by more, uh, primal concerns. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 22:14, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would posit that drawing a connection between ancient Israelites and modern day Jews is not a "novel thesis". Certainly members of every synagogue on the planet would be startled to learn that this is a novel thesis, as would anyone who has glanced at any primary or secondary source covering 2300 years of post-Tanakh Jewish theology or Jewish history. "Moses was a Jew" is not an outlandish assertion, though it certainly can stand for scholarly qualifications. Anyway, why did you not raise these concerns on the Talk Page? Why did you go straight to VfD? And yes, you did speculate on the motivations of the contributors, by speculating that the article was an attempt to revive some already deleted article that none of us had actually heard of. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 19:35, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

This is the first time I've heard a Jewish person tell me that Moses was not a "Follower of the jewish faith", I woul have thought he wrote the book on the Jewish faith.

<li><b>D</b>elete. No merits. The record in the Bible, even if correct, cannot be termed "religious persecution" - it certainly was not by the standard of those times.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - for several reasons. 1) The evidence presented is very weak and makes the assumption that biblical literature can be used as historical sources, an assumption that would be met with harsh opposition if it were made anywhere else, e.g., the status of the West Bank and Gaza; 2) the title begs the question, namely that Jews (in some timeless sense) are guilty of religious persecution; 3) it makes a strained point that the Arab-Israeli conflict somehow is grounded in Jewish religious persecution. I certainly agree that point #2 also applies to articles about "Christian" and "Moslem" persecution as well, but this article - as often is the case in this area - appears to have a hidden agenda. If someone wants to make the point that societies in biblical times were religiously intolerant, that should make a separate article. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 19:44, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I do not believe that this was the intent, but it sure is the effect. For example, you use <i>Ethnic cleansing</i> as a header instead of <i>Palestinian exodus</i> and <i>Biblical incidents</i>.

<dd>However, I repeat that your worst offense is that you do not know the material. Since we Jews have for most part had little opportunity to perseucte over the last 2500 years it is a somewhat sparse record, but it does exist and you have barely scratched its surface. For example, there was a forced conversion episode during the Maccabean period that is famous amongst Jewish scolars, but which you are apparently quite ignorant of.

I hope that someone will revive this article in the future, but it must be someone who can and will do a good job with it. There are a lot of votes to keep this article because it can be used for Jew-bashing and a lot of votes against it for the same reason. In the middle is a core vote that dislikes it because it is just plain a poor article. A good article will have the approval of that core and will therefore survive a Vfd effot. It's too bad that you could help to create such an article, or even be bothered to defend an improvement (however inadequate) of this one. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 01:55, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I updated the article last night, revising the headings but keeping the content. Those changes seem to be sticking. This article now looks and reads better, but still is an very inadequate treatment of a highly sensitive topic. I regretfully maintain my vote as listed just above. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 14:31, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Final vote: <b>Strong Delete</b>. The edit war finally started over my revisions. None of the other editors cared to support them (although only one other editor opposed them). Without a community of editors dedicated to doing the truth in a NPOV manner and to defending both the truth and the NPOV, this cannot succeed. No such community exists at this time.

<li>EMS, I agree with everything you say about this being a sensitive subject and requiring copious documentation and meticulous wording. I disagree that I'm ignorant of this material: see my talkpage discussion with Eliezer on the debate within the Gemarrah on dealing with female POWs. And my knowledge of Jewish history is pretty solid. Anyway, I appreciate your efforts to get the article going, and apologize for not, as it turns out, having the time to work on these articles, as I'd hoped to.

As far as evidence, I'd say that your creation of the piece is strong enough evidence at the start that the article wasn't intended to be here for any other reason than Jew-bashing, because you've got a long history of doing just that. The continual attempts by editors (both yourself and others) to insert Jew-bashing comments into the article is all the confirmation I need, and I'm not the only one who thinks that way about this article as evidenced by the numerous deletion comments stating exactly that. <a href="../../../e/x/i/User%7EExistentializer_7778.html" title="User:Existentializer">Existentializer</a> 14:45, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> <i>This won't get a fair trial.</i> Any time that there is an article like this which discusses factual examples of Jewish negativity, it goes for VFD because people blanket label it some Nazi POV and if not that, an Islamic POV that nobody will take seriously. Now for me, I have had many offhanded bad experiences with Jews and their attitudes but this could be because they lived in the city or because of their culture and I'm about to say it's a bit of both. There are no people on this planet with a blank check for how much damage they can do without return criticism. Those who believe the Jewish people are unable to be guilty for any significant charges, are just as wrong as any Nazi who tries to paint the White race as unfailing in kindness and decency. For instance, Jews in the media(yes, I checked names) believe it is all right to paint White culture and history in a negative light and you will only ever see Jewish culture expressed negatively by Jews. Then again, the Jews don't mind if Whites hate on themselves and speak against their people, even for the sake of propping other races up on their shoulders instead. Fox news is probably the only station that I see which steps away from the chronic anti-Gentile bias which plagues most of the other media conglomerates, but you'll probably meet a Nazi who disagrees with me on that. There is no justification for institutional prejudice by Jews and Judeophiles, any more than there is for Whites and Blacks. Of course, most here would be loathe to act bold and decisively where there is a case of potential ego dropping for the people who shove the Holocaust on Whites. For me, I find a problem with the outspoken Jews who rail on about that Holocaust as if it was all about them and not other people, with their complete sense of innocence in comparison to carving a plot of land out where the Palestinians live because the British said they could. Jews rewrite White history with Jamestown and the Wild West, while Whites cannot criticise the Mid-East conflict. It's almost like using the word Nigger/Nigga, or that only Whites owned slaves. While the Jews in the Bush administration went after Iraq for WMDs, they neglected to mention that their famous scientists invented them in the Manhattan Project and that there was pogrom of Japan. <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Kissinger_71ce.html" title="Henry Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a>, anybody?

<li><b>Delete</b> The name of the article is not encyclopedic. Something like: “Religious persecution in Israel” could get an entry, but for sure not this. It is simply a generalization of an ethnic group, and the support of a POV, the POV being that, an ethnic group is more than a social construct, all this, in the articles name alone. I think there should be appropriate rules here in Wikipedia, on what is an encyclopedic entry, this will spare us all the trouble of having to vote the deletion of articles that should not exist in the first place. This sort of article will only get answered by similar articles(I just hope they don't already exist), which the subject, and probably the aim, will be generalization. There is a distinction between directly criticizing a group of people, and criticizing an aspect... If I write an article like: “Religious persecution under king David's reign” or something such, I could write an encyclopedic article. I could of course, as well, write something like: “Religious persecution under Judaism.” While this seems to be about the same thing as the article voted for deletion, it is not. In the same token, I could write an article, like; “Religious persecution under Islam.” This will be an encyclopedic name, but not: “Religious persecutions by Muslims,” or even more direct: “Religious persecution by Arabs” (I'm making the comparison, because being a “Jew,” is not only being part of a religion, but as includes the ethnic group.) But I could write: “Religious persecutions under Arabic regimes.” It is permitted to write about an aspect, or a system, etc. but not to generalize directly. Guilt by association is simply not encyclopedic. One way of knowing if a name for an article like this is encyclopedic, is to wonder if when using the name to criticize, it would be considered as a generalization. Having said all this, I think that the problem is not only with the name, but what the name could permit to write in the article, in this cases. We can not write with such a subject(the name of the article/subject), a real NPOV article, so it will be unwiki, and it's existence will inevitably lead to failure. <font color="blue"><i>Fadix</i></font> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix"><sup><font color="green">(My Talk)</font></sup></a> 20:16, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I would like more information on how "Religous persecution under Judaism" and "Religous persecution by Jews" differ, and why the former is better. Also, I for one do not see why this requires a delete instead a move of the existing article. (I support deleting the article, but that is because it is a lousy article on the subject.) I also cannot support your view of their being a lot of smaller articles. In that case, the larger scale article is still needed to pull it all together.<br />
I also disagree that such an article is inherently POV, but to be NPOV it has to be dry recitation of the facts, something which most of the current editors seem to be struggling with (when they are trying for it at all). --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 20:37, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>“Religious persecution under Judaism” report persecutions under a system, while the second directly point a finger on a group of people. If I say that Jews are idiots, it is a generalization, I directly point a finger on a group of people. On the other hand, if I say, Judaism is idiotic, I criticize a system. Jews may be offended, but I criticize one aspect of their being, rather than criticizing them as a whole, because I am criticizing an aspect of their being, rather then directly and entirely criticizing them. And also, by this statement, I am not saying in anyway that Jews are idiots. From the same logic, when I say religion is stupid, I am not necessarily saying that those that practice a religion are stupid. An encyclopedic article, to maintain an objective tone, should as much as possible, not point a finger. It should be “encyclopedicaly” correct(in allusion to politically correct).</dd>

How you make that NPOV, you write “what is called religious persecution by Jews, is the persecutions by Jews against other people adhering to other religions?” Don't you see anything wrong here? The articles aim is to directly point a finger on a group of people, and not report, in a cold encyclopedic fashion the persecutions by a regime, a system etc. If you neutralize such article, you somehow disconnect it from its name. <font color="blue"><i>Fadix</i></font> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix"><sup><font color="green">(My Talk)</font></sup></a> 21:08, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I accept your argument on the semantics of the article name. However, I retain my position on NPOV. I admit that a finger is being pointed when writing on a subject such as this, but if the facts are there and properly documented, then that finger deserves to pointed. In other words, the article can be neutral without being neutralized, and need not be comfortable for the subject group while still being NPOV.<br />
It is unfortunate that those who most wish to write on this subject are the least capable of producing an article with NPOV. As a practical matter, that is more of an issue than whether an NPOV treatment of this issue can be done.</dd>

But that policy is not religiously motivated or about religion (the Israeli State that occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 1967 was secular, and Fatah, the major militant wing of the PLO, was/is secular).

<li><b>Delete</b> It took me a while to decide on this (and to be sure that my response was not POV), but the entire section seems to be unnecessary nonsense. Most groups of some identifiable type, religious, racial, sexual, etc, have committed some form of organised persecution or crime. It is simply difficult to justify the need or purpose of an entire section in this vein except to feed arguments to those against particular groups, often ascribing to modern groups (note the site does not consider extinct religious sects) the actions of their predecessors. And on that note, I agree with jayg that it would be problematic to academically ascribe the acts of ancient Israel (even <i>Yehudim</i>) as those of Jews, and to further consider them factual, even if many Jews would happily claim both of these statements as true (on that basis the article would be POV!). And then there may also be similar problems in ascribing the acts of the State of Israel as those of Jews, even if the Christian acts article included those done by Christian countries in the name of their Lord and Saviour. Again, this idea that it is an act of persecution of the group as a whole would be difficult to defend. --<a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 12:14, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This is perhaps a noble idea, but these articles are <i>already</i> POV OR disasters. WP editors have enough problems dealing with prickly subjects as it is, without <i>making up</i> new ones. Any religious persecution by or of religious groups should be discussed in the articles that concern each religious group. Making up this series does not serve any purpose I can see, except to stir up animosities. If this series is kept, I foresee recriminations and accusations and the like leading to a dozen RfArs within a month. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 16:47, July 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very strong keep</b> because religious intolerance is a real and important phenomenon, both past and present. It cannot be properly studied just focusing on victims, because then you lose sight of its causes. Moreover, the dynamics of religious persecution (with its ultimate aim of forced conversion) has nothing to do with etnicity, and is already touched upon, very briefily, in the article on <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coercion.html" title="Coercion">Coercion</a>. So the article must be properly expanded, not deleted,This applies to the whole series of "persecution by" articles: --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMario_Ferretti_1aec.html" title="User:Mario Ferretti">Mario</a> 17:04, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I wholeheatedly agree with you. For Judaism this article can be part of its conscience. However: Are you willing to help expand this article and its series? Are you willing to defend it against POV warriers? I myself tried to defend are more neutral POV for this article, and I was the only one doing so.

<li>Actually, all it's done is show exactly why this article should be deleted. Babajobu has still failed to provide a <b>single scholarly resource</b> which describes any of these things as "Religious persecution by Jews".

<li>Original research is where the person is presenting and/or justifying a novel thesis. There is nothing novel about this. I therefore reject the label of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Also, the article now names scolarly sources for the Modern State of Isreal section even if there is not an explicit References section yet. My complaint is that this article is still inadequately researched, missing important incidents that can easily be gleaned from authoratative sources while retaining lesser content that is only weakly justified. That is also grounds for deletion, but is not the same thing as it leaves open to door to new, improved article at a later time. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 19:34, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>EMS, Jayjg's tourretes-ish blurting out of "original research! original research!" is his way of avoiding the entire issue. There are plenty of citations in there.

<li>Of couse Jayjg is calling this "original research" to avoid dealing with the issue. So what? I suspect that his opinion is so biased that the sysops will discount it for just that reason. However, you still lack the support of people like me who approve of the topic, but not the article.

<li>This article is getting more ludicrous as it is expanded. Babajobu has essentially made a list of any situation he could think of in which Jews held any kind of power or autonomy. Anyone familiar with the Khazar kingdom's history will know that not only did the various religious groups in the Khaganate enjoy complete religious freedom, but that its <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khazars.html#Judiciary" title="Khazars">supreme court</a> included Christians, Jews, Muslims and pagans. The one incident that even comes close to persecution is the execution of a muzzein (reported only in Muslim sources) and the destruction of a minnaret in retaliation for persecution of Jews in Persia. Likewise, he has listed <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birobidzhan.html" title="Birobidzhan">Birobidzhan</a> despite his inability to recall its name. That province, of course, was settled by a few totally secular Jews who never held any real political power or composed more than a small fraction of the oblast's population. It's more clear to me now that this article was from its inception intended purely as a platform for Jew-bashing. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(talk)</a> 19:42, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Briangotts, yes, I suggested a section on the Russian oblast, and yet, for shame, could not remember its name. I was hoping that people who had more knowledge of it might contribute to that section. I forgot that such people were more likely to sit around on the VfD page trying to snowjob the whole topic rather than contribute their knowledge. Viva la Wikipedia! Brian, do me a favor on run over to the VfD on Religious persecution by Muslims (to which I contributed more than I did to the Jewish article), and show the same disgust and dismay that such a topic should be tackled.

<li>Don't hold it too long, as I wouldn't want to be the cause of any asphyxiation. The difference between that article and this is that one, however flawed it might be, documents numerous examples of a centuries old, ongoing phenomenon for which one could come up with thousands of examples. The proponents of this article have yet to produce a genuine example of religious persecution that did not take place in a single, 3500 year old source, and certain proponents (not naming names) then proceeded to list every single instance they could come up with (not many of those exist) in which Jews had any kind of power over others. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(talk)</a> 21:03, 21 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I listed the few instances in which Jews held power in between the displacement from Judea and the Yishuv. Why, perchance would I have made such a list, other than the virulent antisemitism that you assume motivated this article (and presumably somehow also the persecution by Christians and Muslims articles)? Is it conceivable that I made that list because this series of articles was intended to describe how <i>dominant religious groups misuse their power</i>? And as such, that it made sense to explore those rare situations when Jews, though in exile, wielded some power? No, no, it must just have been my virulent antisemitism acting up again, like a troublesome canker sore.

<li>This is really the first time I've ventured into a sensitive topic on Wikipedia.

The whole experience has left me so disgusted with Wikipedia, and with all this rampant ethnocentric autoeroticism, that I think I'll leave the touchy stuff to the flag wavers and return to Office Space-style material. As far as my profane invective, I'd say my invective was no saucier than yours, and while "bullshit" may be a very mildly profane word, "pungent ethnocentric bullshit" has the charm of being both evocative and accurate.

<li>Yes, yes. Especially the one on "Religious persecution by atheists" (French Revolution, communist countries), which was already being discussed before this whole VfD fiasco derailed it. That would have been the most shamelessly anti-religious of all. You know what, I think the people who wrote these articles just hate people. Yep.

<li>All these groups (atheists included) are too large and diverse to be lumped into some monolithic label as perpetrators of persecution. It would be more appropriate to address various persecutions that have occured in history in the relevant articles that discuss their more specific contexts. In fact, most of the content in all three of these up for vfd already seems to be handled in a less provocative way within other more balanced articles. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 01:30, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>The groups are not too monolithic to be covered as such in numerous other articles, so I don't see why this one should be different. And you cannot honestly tell me that there is a more balanced description of the displacement of Palestinians <i>anywhere</i> on Wikipedia than is in this article. My guess is that the Hebrew wikipedia covers it with less sympathy to the traditional Israeli perspective. More thorough, perhaps, but not more balanced. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 01:40, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Unfortunately, I think it's a common (xenophobic) human problem to project monolithic (particularly negative) behaviors, beliefs, intentions, attributes onto *other* people who are different than *us*. Reality is that people are individuals, influenced by all sorts of complicated unique variables that shape each person's outlook. As far as balance RE Palestinians... if we get more editors like Ramallite highly qualified to represent the Palestinian perspective [ multi-faceted of course&#160;:-) ], I'm sure there will be vast improvement. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 02:28, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> all three, the template, and everything else related to this project. It's just a bad idea, destined to piss off everyone at the same time. In wiki articles describing specific, documented historical events, I would support having a "religion X persecuted group Y" kind of analysis. But trying to create a general "people persecuted by religion X" topic is the wrong way of doing it, and extending it to all religions and atheism, while it may seem neutral in theory, will only serve to attract the ire of everyone at once. This topic will turn into an endless edit-war and flame-war, with each side claiming to be absolutely right and the only one backed by historical evidence; a little like what happened with the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> page. Furthermore, like Michael Snow pointed out, making a "persecution by religion X" topic implies that religion X is a harmonious monolithic group with a single clear agenda; there is no religion on Earth for which that is true. Trying to group all actions of all sects and sub-groups of religion X over millenia under a single "things done by religion X" topic is a gross oversimplification of a very complex situation. <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 22 July 2005</li>

<li>Polonius, I agree that the title is ambiguous and has caused problems. In my contributions to the articles in this series I've understood "religious persecution by..." to mean persecution of a minority religious group by a majority religious group, irrespective of whether the motivation for the persecution may have included economic, political, cultural, nationalist or other considerations.

<li>Babajobu, but that is the problem - it basically means that anytime anybody persecutes anyone else of a different religion, in any way, that it is religious persecution. This would mean that almost every war since <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> in Europe would be religious persecution of some group or another, and every incident by an Israeli against an Arab in Israel would be religious persecution, as would any incident against the Jews from 140 CE to 1948 CE, anywhere in the world.

It's pretty sad when all the article can do is cite the Hebrew Bible...how about the other parts of that Hebrew Bible that affirm the Jews as God's chosen people? You can't have it both ways, either all of the Hebrew Bible is accurate or none of it. This is not about "race" (what a weird thought!) this is about pure facts and logic. Wikipedia is not in the business of setting up the "relativity of religions" and such like. The fact remains, Christians and Moslems have killed millions of Jews over the last 1500-2000 years, and not the reverse...and now, to "hide behind the mommy's skirt" of the Jews' own Hebrew Bible is a mental distortion worthy of the Nazi hate machine.

There are so many articles about that already! Are you claiming that the Israelis (as Jews?) are RELIGIOUSLY "persecuting" the poor Palestinians??? Now you know that that is a load of crap! Israel is the most religiously tolerant country in the Middle East! (Errrr: How free are Jews in Iran or Libya or Saudi Arabi to practice Judaism?) No-one in Israel is stopping anyone from practicing any religion (plenty of mosques and such like to prove it), but Israelis do have a right to capture or kill TERRORISTS who want to kill Israeli citizens. (Ever heard of <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self_defense.html" title="Self defense">Self defense</a>?) <i>That</i> issue has no relevance to "Religious persecution by Jews". What is Shem saying? That we must also excuse Christian and Moslem violence against Jews over the last 1500-2000 years if this article is to be deleted?

As for the points you made: no, this article is not exclusively about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but some of the events which occured in that conflict will naturally be relevant. I don't necessarily deny that Israel is the most religiously tolerant country in the region (see earlier comments on this issue). I think Shem was making the commonsense point that even groups which are ordinarily on the receiving end of persecution can themselves occasionally act as persecutors, and if we are to reject the very idea of an article on religious persecution by Jews, then we really have to reject such "persecution by" articles generally.

<dd>Isn't that kind of backwards? "We cannot reject <i>a priori</i> the concept of religious persecution by Jews, therefore we should start the article and see if we can find some". I'm not impugning your motives or anything, just questioning the plan. It still reads to me like an article on ethnic cleansing and nation building; the modern Israel part is entirely such, I think unavoidably because the conflict is national-based, not religious, at least from the Jewish side. Israel was originally intended to be secular, Islam is still freely practiced along with pretty much every religion known to man. The Biblical part might be put into a religious persecution context in that it's in the "God told us to kill them" vein, but religion was pretty much indistinguishable from nationality at the time and my feeling is that in such a case, religion is subservient to nationality, much as is diet, clothing, language, etc. You wouldn't characterize Biblical conflict as persecution by people who don't eat milk with meat, for instance, but it's the same population whether you're defining them by nationality, religion, or diet. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 14:00, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Gzuckier, I don't think there is any way you can entirely disentangle religious persecution from nationalist, economic, ethnic, cultural, et cetera. The Republic of Ireland has been virtually emptied of Protestants since the state's founding. Was that due to religious persecution, or nationalistic persecution because of their association with Britain? Muhammad massacred the males of the Jewish tribe of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Qurayza_16f3.html" title="Banu Qurayza">Banu Qurayza</a>...was that religious persecution, or just an act of particular barbarity during an intercommunal struggle over power, resources, et cetera? Trying to come up with a single monocausal explanation for these examples and others is a fool's errand: there were lots of contributing factors, the motivation was complex. So for the purposes of these articles I've considered "religious persecution" to be persecution of a minority religious group by a majority religious group, rather than restricting it to cases in which motivation could be proven to be exclusively religious. No real-life cases exist of such perfect and idealized "persecutions for exclusively religious reasons". And yet persecution of religious minorities is a real and important phenomenon. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 15:10, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But writing an article on "religious persecution by Jews of Palestinian Arabic Muslims and Palestinian Arabic Christians but not of Lebanese Christians or European Christians or Bedouin Muslims or Muslimish Druze" is a bit like writing an article on "the color which is exhibited by objects which are blue before Jan. 1 1005 but after that date is exhibited by objects which are green". <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 18:16, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"The color which is exhibited by objects which are blue before Jan. 1 1005 but after that date is exhibited by objects which are green", surely that article, too, is worthy of a stub. Remember, I'm an inclusionist (See the tramautic-for-all-involved events that unfolded below in response to Ambi's post). Regardless, I think that if the article on <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Jews_5375.html" title="Religious persecution by Jews">Religious persecution by Jews</a> survives the VfD, it should certainly be expanded to include any instances of persecution of the other groups you mention. I don't think that's quite so jarring or arbitrary as the switch from one color to another that your new stub adopts at the change of millenium. I think they all fit neatly under "Religious persecution by Jews", just as persecuted Sudanese animists in the 20th century and persecuted Yathribi Jews in the 8th century both fit under <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Muslims_5cc6.html" title="Religious persecution by Muslims">Religious persecution by Muslims</a> <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 21:18, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b> I think this question is really about the validity of the series as a whole. There's no doubt that there've been persecutions by Christians and by Muslims. The question is whether there has been sufficient persecution conducted by Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, etc. etc. to justfy articles on <i>each one</i> of these faiths. IMO, the article on Jews provides no good evidence that there has been a history of <i>religious</i> persecution by Jews – <i>persecution</i>, maybe, but not religious persecution. Like Babajobu, I am an Inclusionist, but I don't think this article makes the case that its title implies. Change it to Historical persecutions by Jews, but don't pretend that it is part of a "neutral" series on religious persecution that inclues all faiths. That's hypocricy designed to conceal the fact that some faiths have a history of persecution and that others don't. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 22:20, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Historical Persecutions title isn't perfect, true. Part of the problem is the "by Jews" bit. Individual Jews may have been responsible for persecutions, just as individual Christians, Atheists or whatever may have been, but it would be absurd to list all persecutions by by individual Jews or groups of Jews. But "Judaism" is no better, since the belief system itself does not do the persecuting. Part of the problem lies in the fact that Jewishness as a belief and as an ethnic identity can't be clearly distinguished. There isn't really the same difficulty with most other faiths. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 08:15, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sujre about that; I think the "universal" faiths are more of an exception than a rule. Christianity and Islam, of course, and Buddhism I guess. But even then individual subgroups are tied to different nations. Coptic Christianity, Druze version of Islam, etc. and in the ancient world, I think distinct religions for each nation was pretty much the rule. Judaism has a funny spot, as it posits a universal God who everyone should believe in, but doesn't require adherence to the faith itself for anyone other than Jews. This of course is interpreted as some sort of superiority complex by.... here it comes..... get ready..... antisemites. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 14:16, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> This is the original poster of the article again. Maybe I can help shed some light on this, because it's clearly caused some confusion. I actually did first play this game in England when I was studying aboard in 2000. It was taught to me in the kitchen of our dorm by some local students as a drinking game. We then started using it as a means of dividing chores, or deciding who had to do a particularly unappealing duty in the building (kitchen duty for the week, for instance). Now, living in Los Angeles, I've played this game in many contexts. I'm not sure how else to explain it's real other than by offering my experience. I can't vouch for the universality of its name, of course. Perhaps the people who taught it to me renamed it, or perhaps those who taught it to them renamed it. I just don't know. All I do know is it's a common occurrence in my life, the lives of many people I know, to play this game. I'd ask you to not dismiss it just because you haven't happened upon it, and because nobody has chosen to write about it in his blog or on his site (as if being on a personal site confers any legitimacy anyway). Thank you.</p>
<p><b>DON'T DELETE!</b> Everyone should at least have the opportunity to learn the rules of this clever game. What group of roustabouts wouldn't want to take part in a game where one player per round is burdened with the label of Daddy's Favorite Porridge?! Please don't delete. I've played this game (and loved it), and want others to have the opportunity to learn the rules.</p>
<p><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> This game is of fairly recent origins, but it is legitimate. I've played it myself a few times. GodAmongMen 00:12, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is another of Striver's article creations. There is interesting material here, but it should be placed in an article on Islamic law re marriage. I am not sure that there IS such an article.

Oh, wow, how amusing, my article got a Vfd... and guess by who? If im not mistaken, this is the 4:th Vfd she has been puting on my articles.</p>
<p>Zora, why dont you just link it, or put a sugestion to merge or rename it? No, we must have a Vfd, it just would'nt be the same, whould it?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> If she want to rename, merge or link, she can sugest it, but not delet.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
My motivation for not having it in another article: It easier to link to it, since ther is 3 articles that result in this and ther is 3 article that can resolve it. It would not be fair to the other 5 articles if it would be put in one of the 6, if the reader wants to read only about this, s/he will have to searh for this in the article it will be put in. Hence, it is easier for the reader if it haves it own aricle, even, or just because, it does not contain so much information related to a single one of the 6.</p>

<hr />
<p>Well, we have the Shi'a contingent here saying to keep, in solidarity.</p>
<p>Regarding Striver's first point, re articles for various Arabic technical terms -- I presume that those articles are there because someone found them as technical terms in English books/articles/whatever, and felt that they should have an explanation. I gather that some editors feel very strongly that Wikipedia is not a dictionary, and would argue that any one-sentence articles on Islamic technical terms should be moved into the Wiktionary. Or they might be better in the List of Arabic terms article, whatever it's called. But I don't think the matter is urgent because the titles of the articles are so obviously foreign-language-technical-terms. No one is going to be confused.</p>
<p>However, "Recommended precautions" is a completely opaque and misleading title. If I google on it, I get 2,430,000 hits. 99.99% of which have nothing to do with sharia. So, the title is completely wrong. Could the content be slotted somewhere else? Yup, it is just a stub and could be put into <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">Sharia</a> easily. So why have an article with a misleading title and no content? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 21:38, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> Islam does not have the same view of marriage as the west have. In the west, most people consider marriage as based on love. So is not the case in Islam. In Islam it is based on worshiping God, and that diffrens needs a lot of explanation to make sence to a non-Muslim.</p>

<p>On 14 Feb 2005, this article was nominated for deletion. The final decision was a judgment call. I called it as a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:transwiki">m:transwiki</a> to WikiNews. We have since learned that transwiki to WikiNews is incompatible with GFDL. I am returning it to VfD for reconsideration.

<p>I recommend deletion because this is a news article, not an encyclopedic event. Wikipedia does not need or want an article on every non-notable crime. (It would be nice if we lived in a world where this was a notable crime but we don't. Similar incidents occur on a daily basis. I believe this got attention only because it was a slow news day.) There have been no significant edits to this article since 14 Feb (the day after the article was created). The article is an orphan. While low edits and orphan status are not deletion criteria, they are supporting evidence that this is not a requested article. A good WikiNews article already exists <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Gunman_opens_fire_at_upstate_New_York_shopping_mall" class="extiw" title="wikinews:Gunman_opens_fire_at_upstate_New_York_shopping_mall">here</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 21:32, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wikipedia should not be a repository for hadith dumps. If the "evidence" doesn't fit in the main article, then it should either be in Wikisource (?) or relegated to external links. As it stands, this article is completely incomprehensible to anyone who doesn't already know what nikah mut'ah is and why it is controversial. If that is added, then the article is just a repetition of the nikah mut'ah article. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 21:39, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article is not about explaining what Nikah Mut'ah is about, rather it's to represent the arguments used to validated its abrogation or the lack of using hadithes as sources.

<p><b>coment</b> The article does not interpret the hadith, it represent how diffrent famous scholars imterpreted them. A major difrence, and worth representation. furthermore, <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mut%27ah_%28marriage%29.html" title="Mut'ah (marriage)">Mut'ah (marriage)</a> presents the concept, not shows how the scholars interpret wheather it is allowed or not. The concept is one thing, the cholars view of wheather it is allowed or not is a tottaly diffrent matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>You're right, I misspoke. Rather, WP is not the place for extended discussion of interpretations of holy books, unless it's tied to a specific encyclopedic issue. When you're discussing a religious concept, that's where the compare and contrast of interpretations should come out -- in the article about that concept. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 15:51, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b>well as you said it your self "unless it's tied to a specific encyclopedic issue". In this case it tied to <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikah_Mut%27ah_1acf.html" title="Nikah Mut'ah">Nikah Mut'ah</a>. Howeverm, i do not agree that the "contrast of interpretations " should come into the article in this case, since ther is no contrast of interpretation regarding what it is and how it was reaveled. The contrast is about how and when it got abrogated. And that is a whole other issue than describing what it is. For example, a Jew might decide to enter a nikah, in that case s/he does not want or need to know about "contrast of interpretations " regarding if its abrogated or not, s/he only wants/needs to know what it is.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> For those calling this a vanity website. I guess you missed the points that SD.net is directly related to the STvsSW discussion (which has a Wiki entry) and SD.net has related sections ranging on other topics. It is not a vanity forum entry because it includes information on more then just the forums. Try researching the subject before condeming it.

<li><b>Keep</b> The whole internet subculture of "Star Trek versus Star Wars" has its own article. Many of the major players on the scene are already linked from the article. If the versus debate merits its own article, than so do the sites that best epitomize the debate (since discussing the sites on the versus article directly would only muddy it up,) such as Spacebattles.com and Stardestroyer.net. I also feel compelled to point out that Spacebattles.com only turns up 73 more hits on Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Pb7&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=spacebattles.com+-site%3Aspacebattles.com+-wikipedia+-encyclopedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Pb7&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=spacebattles.com+-site%3Aspacebattles.com+-wikipedia+-encyclopedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> than Stardestroyer.net does, has its own equally sparse article (Spacebattles.com) which suffers nowhere near the unfavorable attention that this one does. <a href="../../../g/m/t/User%7EGMT_ea1c.html" title="User:GMT">GMT</a> 19:19, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I am a former member of Stardestroyer.net, having been banned recently here: <a href="http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?t=72553" class="external free" title="http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?t=72553" rel="nofollow">http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?t=72553</a>. As a long time member, I am intimately familiar with the website and its forums, and this puts me in a unique position to judge the merit of this website wielding familiarity and no positive bias. I can honestly say that stardestroyer.net is unequalled in its technical commentaries and as a forum for discussing Startrek versus Starwars, and the various other topics it deals with are also noteworthy. Secondly, there is the matter of consistency. Others have already listed examples such as somethingawful.com, spacebattles.com and so forth - either these must also come up for deletion, or stardestroyer must stay. I do recommend an expanded entry however. PredatorX 10:26, 28 July 2005 (GMT+12)</li>

The point from Splash above is a entirely valid, via <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. Perhaps a more appropriate page title might provide resolution? However, information on what regular, timetabled, multi-stop railway services are available to UK railway users is encyclopedic, and useful. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 00:28, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Personally, I don't think the information <i>is</i> encyclopedic. There are rail lines between nearly every town, village, and city in the UK. To explicitly state so doesn't really impart information of encyclopedic note. I think the absolute most it warrants is mentioning under the operator's article, but none of the operators do so at present. I'm inclined to suggest that there is probably a reason for this: the information is not really encyclopedic. For consistency, and not out of spite, I'm going to add that other article to this VfD. I will let the editors so far know. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 02:00, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>As mentioned below, <i>lines</i> are (marginally) encyclopedic. The services that run on them at the moment are't. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 14:39, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>comment</b> There is something I don't understand. Looking at pre-existing pages, it seems it is encyclopedic to include the fact that a railway service <i>can</i> run between stations (for example <a href="../../../b/e/x/Bexleyheath_Line_e033.html" title="Bexleyheath Line">Bexleyheath Line</a>). It is also encyclopedic that a railway service <i>used to</i> run between stations (for example <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset_and_Dorset_Joint_Railway_7166.html" title="Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway">Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway</a>). I do not see why it is not encyclopedic to include the fact that a service <i>does</i> run between stations? That said, I'd be happy including many services on to a single page (although I am not sure whether a service should be linked to a particular train operating company). <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 11:11, July 20, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The difference is between <i>line</i> and <i>service</i>. Railway lines are encyclopedic - they last for a long time and even when they carry no trains they leave their mark on the countyside. Railway services are much more transitory and belong in WikiTravel not here. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 11:53, 2005 July 20 (UTC)</li>

However, in retrospect, I can see how this article might be promoting the airport to too much of an extent, something against Wikipedia policy. For that I appologize to anyone I might have offended. I'm fairly new to the site, so I suppose this article will end up being my first big "mistake" on Wikipedia. In the end, it's up to the administrators to decide on the future of this page. Either way they decide, this is just a learning process in what will hopefully be a long and contributing stay on Wikipedia.

<p>VFD isn't a court of opinion, but it's up to law enforcement to "bust" predators, not pejorative idiots. However, an article shouldn't just go on vfd because I don't like it... I just thought I'd state my opinion.</p>
<p>Alexa ranking of 153,797. Not doing anything original (besides ruining people's lives, of course); feds entrap predators all the time. I don't think we should have articles on websites, with exceptions like <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a>, and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. <b>Not-notable</b>.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is an inappropriate VfD. The website is clearly notable. It gets lots of press coverage, and has had national network coverage too. The article's well sourced with lots of credible, third-party references.

<ul>
<li>Grounds for deletion are that it's a non-notable website. Most websites don't deserve a place on Wikipedia, and I have a special black spot on my heart just for this one. The only reason it gets alot of coverage is to hype pedophilic fear. They entrapped 20-some predators? So what. That's really a pathetic number... they haven't done anything notable. 24 at 01:00, 20 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Entrap? Excuse me? I think you're a little confused at the definition of entrapment. First of all, only police officers can entrap anyone, by definition. Second of all, if they were law enforcement, they wouldn't be guilty of entrapment, as they never initiate anything... all "busts" are initiated by the pervert in question. Additionally, what on earth does whether or not you LIKE them have anything to do with NOTABILITY? Press attention, positive recognition from police officers, a nationwide network, what more do you want? <a href="../../../f/i/e/User%7EFieari_a4ce.html" title="User:Fieari">Fieari</a> 01:04, July 20, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Comment: The article was proposed deleted on the German WP and a clear majority voted to <b>keep</b> it. It was however unilaterally deleted, and the sysop Philipendula, who seems to have strong personal interest in the article, seems determined to delete a valid article about a well-known journalist and editor of one of the larger German newspapers at any cost. The German Wikipedia clearly has a problem with abusive behaviour from some sysops who delete articles in contradiction with community decision. The only argument for deleting I saw on the German Wikipedia was that he happened to be noble, and obviously some POV pushers with sysop access doesn't like nobles. Here on English Wikipedia we do however not accept such <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarian.html" title="Totalitarian">totalitarian</a> behaviour. There is no reason for deleting this article, but Philipendula should be desyopped at the German Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>For those interested in Google stats: The two used spellings of his name returns 216 Google hits.</dd>

<b>(1)</b> <i>clear majority</i>: on de:WP at the time I deleted the article, we got 4 votes belonging to this, two of them to "keep", two of them to "delete" it if there would be no more biographical relevance to see after the 7 days of discussion <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:L%C3%B6schkandidaten/7._Juli_2005#Albrecht_Prinz_von_Croy_.28gel.C3.B6scht.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:L%C3%B6schkandidaten/7._Juli_2005#Albrecht_Prinz_von_Croy_.28gel.C3.B6scht.29" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> (meanwhile one of the voters to "keep" changed his opinion!). I decided to delete the article because I didn't see any elemantary progress to this direction.<br />
<b>(2)</b> <i>totalitarian behaviour</i>: no comment on this.<br />
<b>(3)</b> After the deletion of the article, the author made very strong efforts to get the decision reversed (writing to all involved voters and in an offensive mode to me as the sysop; reinstalling the article many times and under different titles); at last he called for undeletion on the equivalent to <i>Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion</i>, but he got no support <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiederherstellungsw%C3%BCnsche#Albrecht_Prinz_von_Croy" class="external autonumber" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiederherstellungsw%C3%BCnsche#Albrecht_Prinz_von_Croy" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>.<br />
<b>(4)</b> The sysop Philipendula is only one of the about 7 sysops supporting my decision - <u>it is very unkind and incorrect to drop her name here</u>, where no one will be able to understand the background.<br />
<b>(5)</b> (and last) Belonging the relevance of this journalist (cause the author named the google stats): You may check th google results <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiederherstellungsw%C3%BCnsche#Albrecht_Prinz_von_Croy" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiederherstellungsw%C3%BCnsche#Albrecht_Prinz_von_Croy" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where I gave the links on three different spellings of the name. In short: The above mentioned 216 hits reduce to about 60 (reduced by google, hiding very similar results) - and all of them are pages either only <i>naming</i> Croy (most of them by the newspaper or affiliated pages) or blogs <i>written by</i> Croy himself, nothing <i>about</i> him.<br />
IMHO (and following the deletion in de:WP) the journalist is <b>not notable</b> but this is no vote, because I'm only part-time-visitor here and not familiar with the delition policy on en:WP.

<dd>The Handelsblatt is a leading German newspaper and is clearly notable.

The real reason for the illegal deletion on de: was something which looked like hatred against nobles. You have failed to cite a single relevant argument for deleting this page.</dd>

<li>The Handelsblatt is clearly an important newspaper in Germany (can be compared to <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>). I don't know how much you know about newspapers, but in Europe is a serious (not tabloid) newspaper with a circulation of 148,319 daily copies a fairly big newspaper.</li>

<li><s><b>Comment</b>.

<dd>The US is a lot bigger than Germany, so of course a major US paper will have a larger circulation than a German equivalent. (Actually, a better comparison might have been the managing editor of the WSJ, but I was too lazy to go look up who that was.) As for the award, I agree that Keller is more significant - which is why he has a <i>much</i> longer article.

(iii) I'd agree that German (or Albanian, or Lithuanian, or Bugandan, or whatever) "nobility" is no less noteworthy than British "nobility"; but really, I couldn't give two hoots about Croy's "nobility", though I find his continuing use of this name ludicrous, mildly disturbing, or both. I say he's worth inclusion as managing editor of a notable newspaper: for all I care, he might call himself Ras Albrecht X and wear dreadlocks. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 13:00, July 22, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If I understand German law correctly, "Prinz von Croy" is, legally, his surname, and has been from birth. (Former noble titles automatically became surnames when everything went to pieces in 1918, essentially.) So that doesn't indicate any particularly outré pretensions on his part, AIUI. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 00:15, July 23, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry for my partial ignorance there. But I had thought that people dropped the "Prinz", "Ritter", "Hochrattenfänger" or whatever immediately preceded "von", and that the more progressive types dropped the "von" as well. Anyway, to me his name is an irrelevance. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 02:57, July 23, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Why should people drop the "von" or their titles? Britons do use their titles, Italians do use their titles, Swedes do use their titles, so why shouldn't Germans? The vast majority of noble Germans use their title if they have any, and those belonging to former royal (souvereign) families do also use styles like "His Highness" etc. I essentially agree that the reason we should have an article about him is his position at the Handelsblatt, which is why I wrote about him, but I also find it mildly disturbing that people say his nobility doesn't matter when it seems to matter for British barons who get an article without being noteworthy in any other way. 83.109.156.172 05:42, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If I were born Josef von Bloggs, I'd be disturbed by the reminders of nitwit nobility as depicted by George Grosz and others, and drop the "von". Brits and others can and do drop their titles. Let's have some examples of articles about unremarkable British barons: perhaps these could be put up for VfD. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 05:53, July 23, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But "von" is not a title, but a name-part, just like "van" is in Holland, "di" is in Italy and "de" is in France (examples: <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominique_de_Villepin_ebd9.html" title="Dominique de Villepin">Dominique de Villepin</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonio_Di_Pietro_7bda.html" title="Antonio Di Pietro">Antonio Di Pietro</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_van_der_Stoel_5268.html" title="Max van der Stoel">Max van der Stoel</a>). Continental European names are different from English in that way. Predicates have historically nothing to do with nobility per se, and there are also un-noble families with "von" in their names, especially in Northern Germany. Would you really change your family name, as used for perhaps centuries, if you were born in Germany (especially when "von" (as generally, but not always, indicating nobility) and titles do have high social prestige), or in France, Holland or Italy? It's true that not all German nobles always use their titles. Richard von Weizsäcker, who is a Baron (Freiherr) and whose official name is "Richard Freiherr von Weizsäcker", did mostly not use his title in daily business, but that is something different from actually changing the family name. 83.109.162.34 09:01, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If my name were X Prinz von Y, I'd introduce myself as X Y, yes. (But why do you ask?)

<dd>Titles have high prestige in most of the society. Germany is no different from Britain in that way. I believe it's rather those who are not impressed by titles who constitute the minority. Germans are generelly focused on titles, if they hold a doctoral degree they always call themselves "Dr. [Name]", even in situations where the degree is completely irrelevant. 83.109.165.239 13:57, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have lived in Britain for quite some time, and can assure you that the huge majority of people I know are uninterested in aristocratic titles. (Granted, few of these acquaintances are readers of <i>Hello</i> or the <i>Daily Mail</i>.) I don't claim to have run any surveys. A doctorate is a different matter from a baronetcy or whatever they're called: you get to be a doctor by hard work (unless of course you use a degree mill). A doctorate may impress me to some extent; being a viscount does not. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 14:16, July 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And btw: the nobility was abolished in Germany after WW I, so there are no German nobility titles anymore. "von", "Freiherr" etc. are parts of the name, not titles. --<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenzweig_438e.html" title="User:Rosenzweig">Rosenzweig</a> 12:08, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is a confusing case, and a perfect time waster for many good editors. His job title certainly has a very executive ring to it. The imprint does indeed mention many people, none of which is this guy. On the other hand the press release did mention a position that makes him borderline notable (e.g. "Chef vom Dienst des Magazins der <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankfurter_Allgemeine_Zeitung_3701.html" title="Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung">FAZ</a>" – these guys don't hire just anybody to lead their magazine).

<dd>Ok - no doubt about that you're knowing what a managing editor is. But is Croy really the "managing editor"? The announcement with the information (<i>managing editor</i> = "Geschäftsführender Redakteur") about this is from 08.05.200<b>3</b> - and the actual imprint gives other names (<i>managing editor</i> = "Geschäftsführung"?) - for the same post? For the <i>Verlagsgruppe Handelsblatt GmbH</i> there are named Bernd Ziesemer (also named in the WP-article <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handelsblatt.html" title="Handelsblatt">Handelsblatt</a>) as editor-in-chief and the editor Julius Endert as responsible editor; for the <i>Handelsblatt GmbH</i> (the paper) there are named Ziesemer as editor-in-chief again and Andres Arntzen and Harald Müsse as "Geschäftsführung" - is to say, that the information given in the article obviously can hardly be verified - pfhh - but this will be my last piece on this entry - R1 is wright.
