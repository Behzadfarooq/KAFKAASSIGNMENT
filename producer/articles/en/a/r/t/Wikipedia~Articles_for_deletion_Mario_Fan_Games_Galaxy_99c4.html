Also, I really don't see how a passing, mispronounced reference on a television show automatically qualifies it as notable. <a href="../../../b/l/u/Super_Mario%7E_Blue_Twilight_DX_390c.html" title="Super Mario: Blue Twilight DX">Super Mario: Blue Twilight DX</a> is certainly notable; however, MFGG is simply a website that Blaze posted it at. If being on television is of itself proof of notability, then every person ever on a game show or making funny faces at the local news TV camera behind the news anchor is notable, and that's simply not the case. Now, if the author can show us a multitude of shows referencing the website, or a ton of press coverage, instead of one single instance, that would be a different matter and I'd gladly consider changing my opinion. -<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysticEsper_07d5.html" title="User:MysticEsper">MysticEsper</a> 07:54, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> 70.130.145.169, I am trying to accomplish something very simple: stating my point. In order to make a claim, I must back up my opinion with facts. Simply saying "This is a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> because I said so" isn't going to explain anything, and simply make me look like an idiot.

<li><b>Keep</b> Both this site and SFGHQ have been around for a very long time and without them, I don't think Mario fangaming or Sonic fangaming would have ever done near as well. There's a whole section for fanmade games and remakes and I think two of some of the biggest fangame sites earn it's spot. -<a href="../../../w/2E/a/User%7EW.A.C._126f.html" title="User:W.A.C.">W.A.C.</a> (7/26/06)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>; a single passing reference does not give notability, and the article's claims of incredible traffic are hardly supported by the (admittedly flawed) tools we have available to assess that: for example, the site's Alexa ranking is just 348,298, while Google returns fewer than 250 results when you search for the site's name. For a wholly internet-based entity, this is not impressive. My personal homepage does better on the Google test... — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 20:45, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Although I'm probably biased since I'm the administrator, <b>Keep, but clean up clean up clean up</b>. The site has about 3000 members on it and consumes somewhere in the range of 200 GB of bandwidth a month, which is a ton. The reason searching for the actual site name doesn't bring up that many results is that it's almost always referred to by its abbreviation: MFGG. I think the site is significant enough. If things like this can go completely unchecked, I see no reason why a website like this can't be included. As for the G4 mention, when the same story was reposted on the Attack of the Show website, it primarily mentioned the MFGG website instead of the Blue Twlight Game. A lot of this article needs to be improved though. Right now, the article only makes sense to those who are really involved in the website, especially with the terminology. The site is definitely signifcant enough to warrant its own article, but I would suggest a complete re-write. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowMan1od_7e39.html" title="User:ShadowMan1od">ShadowMan1od</a> 00:55, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowMan1od_7e39.html" title="User:ShadowMan1od">ShadowMan1od</a>. Notable website, GHit for "MFGG" gets 19,200 hits.

Note that <b>notability (WP:N) is an <i>essay</i> and not a <i>guideline</i></b>. Per <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">the offical policy</a> (WP:WIN), the article "should describe the site in an <i>encyclopedic</i> manner, offering detail on a website's achievements, impact or historical significance, [etc.]" It is doing this, (or could,) but needs a lot of cleanup. <i>See also: <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="m:Wiki_is_not_paper">m:Wiki is not paper</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a>. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHOzAu_f632.html" title="User:DavidHOzAu">DavidHOzAu</a> 06:19, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</i>

<li><b>Comment</b> Only about 10 (at the most) of the results on the first 3 pages are related to this site.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment doesn't matter</b> Because notability is in the eye of the beholder, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is an essay, it isn't even a guideline. (Essays are the furthest that articles in the Wikipedia namespace can get from policy.) Besides, GHits can only be used to rule in, not to rule out. (I'm sure there's a <a href="../../../l/o/g/Category%7ELogical_fallacies_0c01.html" title="Category:Logical fallacies">logical fallacy</a> about that, but this nomination is too close to ending for me to find it.) I suggest the article be considered on its technical potential for an encylopedic article, which is why I'm firm in the belief that {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} was needed instead of {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">afd</a>}}. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHOzAu_f632.html" title="User:DavidHOzAu">DavidHOzAu</a> 02:36, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment (found it)</b> Despite the somewhat questionable grounds of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, deleting on notabilty alone is clearly argumentum ad google (<a href="../../../a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_populum.html" title="Argumentum ad populum">argumentum ad populum</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a> in one), with the intent to generate an argument for deletion based on <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> grounds. (This is why I am forced to question all WP:WEBs where I notice that the rationale is based on fallacious arguments.) Also, saying "there's no search hits therefore it isn't notable" is like saying "<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html" title="Black hole">Black holes</a> don't exist because I can't see them." IMHO, AfD could function a lot better if were based on the <i>technical content</i> of the article (words, structure, style, etc.) instead of what is being talked about, which as I mentioned is <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">the offical policy</a>. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHOzAu_f632.html" title="User:DavidHOzAu">DavidHOzAu</a> 02:55, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep But Rewrite</b> - Fangaming is a very notable phenomenon (and even has its <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fangame.html" title="Fangame">own article</a>). Mario fangaming is particularly prevelent, and as the most undeniably comprehensive source of Mario fangames and fangaming resources, MFGG is certainly notable. In fact, MFGG is notable for historic reasons; namely, it was one of the first fangaming sites to survive for several years. That said, this article should be heavily rewritten to focus more on how significant MFGG is to the fangaming community, which I am willing to do. Also, as noted by DavidHOzAu, WP:N is <b>not official policy.</b> While WP:WEB is an official guideline, <a href="../../../p/a/g/WP%7EPAG_9804.html" title="WP:PAG">WP:PAG</a> states that <i>Guidelines are not set in stone and should be treated with common sense and the occasional exception.</i> Therefore, it is entirely possible (and, given the importance of MFGG to the fangaming community, probable) that MFGG may be exempt from WP:WEB. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Silvers_da83.html" title="User:Jeff Silvers">Jeff Silvers</a> 03:43, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The fact that the site focuses on a notable subject and has been around for a long time does not make it notable, though. <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> <sub>(t|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Syphonbyte_b9d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Syphonbyte">c</a>)</sub> 23:01, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Not neccessarily, though. I can prove this by counterexample: the most prominent site for information on the TOC2 protocol was originally a (relatively) obscure html file on an utterly non-notable site. The TOC2 protocol itself is notable, but the site that was the leading authority on it was not. <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> <sub>(t|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Syphonbyte_b9d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Syphonbyte">c</a>)</sub> 03:09, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think the difference would be that while the site would be the leading authority on TOC2, TOC2 is essentially just a system. This is a community instead of just a function that you can document. Mario fangaming is fairly widespread, and MFGG is essentially the hub for all of it (especially for fangaming in general too). <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowMan1od_7e39.html" title="User:ShadowMan1od">ShadowMan1od</a> 04:48, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> TOC2 is (along with OSCAR) the primary protocol for AOL Instant Messenger, so it's actually more widespread than Mario fangaming. Getting back to the main point, there is no notability by proxy. <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> <sub>(t|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Syphonbyte_b9d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Syphonbyte">c</a>)</sub> 05:36, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment again</b> I didn't mean it as in "MARIO FANGAMING IS REALLY IMPORTANT GUYS", its just the "main site" aspect. While that site wasn't notable, it was more of something that you could make write-ups and documents on rather than being a growing community that requires a main hub. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowMan1od_7e39.html" title="User:ShadowMan1od">ShadowMan1od</a> 22:47, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
