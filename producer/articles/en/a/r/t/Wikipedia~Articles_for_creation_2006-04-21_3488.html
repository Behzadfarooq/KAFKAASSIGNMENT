<p>This was a sporty road bike with an electric start version of the XL500 motor. This bike had the same fate as most Single cylinder bikes in the US poor sales. In fact most bikes were sold 2 and 3 years after production at reduced pricing. Like all single cylinder bikes in the US they get passed over for the quicker multi cyclinder bikes. This is unfortunate considering the very usable wide torque power band. The name comes from the once famous Dirt<b>F</b>lat <b>T</b>rack in California called Ascot.</p>

<p>Vivian Honan is one of Ashfield's notable losers. She is known for her perverse love for her dog "Bruno", and her obssession with netball. It has also been realised as of late that Vivian has emo tendencies, retiring to her appalling guitar playing when the world becomes too much to handle. In the Honan household she is known for her flatulence and can be easily avoided due to her signature odour which betrays her arrival. Upon meeting Vivian, one should greet her in the following manner "Hey loser, you suck", however be prepared for the inevitable "not as much as you do".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-21_3488.html" title="Edit section: Frog Bog (Intellivision game)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Frog Bog (Intellivision game)</span></h2>
<p>Frog Bog is an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intellivision.html" title="Intellivision">Intellivision</a> game made by <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattel_Electronics_072d.html" title="Mattel Electronics">Mattel Electronics</a>. The game is a simple contest between a pair of <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frog.html" title="Frog">frogs</a> over who can swallow the most bugs.</p>
<p>Frog Bog is designed to be played by two players simultaneously, although it is possible to play it with just one player. The player takes control of a frog that sits on a lily pad. Bugs fly through the air and the player must hop and catch them with his tongue. Gameplay continues until midnight, when the frogs finally sleep after a long day of eating.</p>
<p>The game has three modes of play and the players can choose to start the game at <a href="../../../d/a/y/Day.html" title="Day">day</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dusk.html" title="Dusk">dusk</a>, or <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night.html" title="Night">night</a>. The three modes vary in difficulty and are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy mode, in which all the player has to do is touch the controller disc and the frog automatically jumps in a preset arc to the other lily pad. If the frog nears a bug, it will also automatically deploy its tongue.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Medium mode, where the player's arc is again along a pre-determined path, but now he controls the tongue himself.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hard mode, where nothing is automatic. The trajectory of the player's frog depends on the direction of their game pad, allowing for more freedom of movement but also putting the player at risk of falling into the water. If the player falls into the water, they slowly swim back to the nearest lily pad, wasting vital time.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's notable that at night, when the background sky is completely black, the bugs flash yellow, as if they were lightning bugs. This allows the player to see them sporadically and greatly increases the challenge.</p>

<p>The Kingston Peninsula is a rural area surrounded on three sides by two of New Brunswick's major rivers, the Saint John and the Kennebecasis. The area of Kingston, New Brunswick was the site of the first major Loyalist settlement outside of Saint John. The first Loyalists arrived in 1783 and and by 1789 had established a thriving community including the Anglican Rectory, Union House hotel and the Trinity Church - all of which are still standing and actively functioning.</p>
<p>Other historic buildings still stand: the 1810 Carter House now functions as a tea room and gift shop; and the Macdonald Consolidated School building (1910), which is one of the first consolidated schools established by the Macdonald Foundation.</p>

<p>Archbishop Jovan was born on 28th of February 1966 in the city of Bitola and baptized as an Orthodox Christian with the name Zoran. He completed his primary school and mathematical high school in Bitola, and was an accomplished student. As required by Yugoslavian law, he served his military obligation in Sarajevo in 1985, and he started his studies at the Faculty of Civil Engineering in Skopje. He had finished the aforesaid Faculty before the time expected (in 1990), and enrolled the Faculty of Theology in Belgrade the same year, and was simuultaneously employed as a civil engineer with the Diocese of the Metropolis of Bitola.</p>
<p>He established the Metropolis Library in collaboration with the local University Library of Bitola, being the first librarian thereof. He had given a cycle of lectures in the premises of the library during his two and a half years long employment with the Metropolis. In 1993, he left for Belgrade aiming to intensify his studies of theology and graduated in June, 1995. He started his master’s studies the same year in Belgrade, at the Department of Systematic Theology (Dogmatics). At the end of 1995, he left for Greece (Thessalonica) for the purpose of learning Greek and enrolment of post graduate studies. He completed his doctoral dissertation on "The Unity of the Church and the Contemporary Ecclesiological Problems”. The work on his doctoral thesis gave this accomplished student a fine understanding with regards to issues of Church unity and Church Canons.</p>
<p>He was ordained to be a monk on 7th of February 1998, being named John (Jovan in Macedonian) and ordained a deacon with the same day. He was ordained into the rank of hieromonk on 8th of February 1998, and into the rank of a Bishop on 19th July 1998, being given the title Bishop of Dremvitza. He was assigned to be a vicar of the Bishop of Prespa and Pelagonia, also holding cycles of theological discussions and starting a thorough reconstruction of the Cathedral Church of St. Great Martyr Demetrius in Bitola besides his regular ministries. In March 2000, he was assigned to be Administrator of the Metropolis of Bregalnitza, and elected to be a Bishop of Veles and Vardar Valley in November 2000. He was enthroned at the aforesaid Bishopric on 4th December 2000.</p>
<p>He had answered positively at the summon to liturgical and canonical unity with the Patriarchate of Pec by the Patriarch of Serbia Paul, together with all his clergymen and faithful people from his Metropolis, being the only Metropolitan of the schismatic Macedonian Orthodox Church who answered positively. The liturgical and canonical unity with the Patriarchate of Pec of the Holy Metropolis of Veles and Vardar Valley, being under his jurisdiction in that time, was reached on 22nd June 2002. Several days thereafter, he was expelled from the seat of the Metropolis together with the monastics living with him, completely illegally and without a court warrant by means of brutal force by the Police of the Republic of Macedonia. On 23rd of September 2002, he was appointed an Exarch of all the territories of the Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric by the Assembly of the Serbian Orthodox Church. He had been detained under custody many times by the authorities of the Republic of Macedonia, which in fact created the schism of the Church during the times of communist rule, supporting the putsch of proclamation of the uncannonical autocephaly of the Macedonian Orthodox Church. He was elected a Chairman of the Holy Synod of Bishops of the Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric on 25th December 2003, after the constitution thereof.</p>
<p>He was sentenced to a suspended punishment one year of imprisonment for the criminal offence "performing unauthorized activities" because he had entered a Church aiming to baptise a female infant in 2004. The Court of Appeal in Bitola sentenced him to eighteen months of imprisonment in 2005 based upon the erroneous conclusion that his acts constituted the "incitement of ethnic and religious hatred, discord and intolerance". The charges and incarceration, drew the ire of the entire world, as all Orthodox Christian denounced the illegal jailing and drew rare but vocal support by a group Roman Catholic Bishops in Europe (COMECE). The charges of inciting hate stemmed from performing divine Liturgy, a Baptism and for consecrating two Bishops to his Orthodox Archbishopric.</p>
<p>He participated in many international symposiums and gave lectures on numerous seminars.</p>
<p>On 24th May 2005, on the Feast of the Ss. Cyril and Methodius, he has been confirmed by his Holiness, the Archbishop of Pec and Metropolitan of Belgrade and Karlovtzy and Patriarch of Serbia, kyr kyr Paul, to be Archbishop of Ohrid and Metropolitan of Skopje in accordance with the Nis Agreement. On the same day, there was an announcement of the Patriarchal and the Assembly’s Tomos for Autonomy of the Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric, the Chairman of whose Holy Synod of Bishops is he, himself.</p>
<p>Archibishop Jovan is a confessor of Orthodoxy and viewed in the Orthodox world as a martyr for truth in Macedonia.</p>

<p>Monteroni di Lecce is an Italian town with ca. 13,659 inhabitants. It is located in the Province of Lecce (7 km from Lecce) in the South-East of Italy (peninsula of Apulia, and particularly in the area currently called “Salento” and reported until recently also as “Terra d’Otranto”).</p>

<p>Probably the name Monteroni comes from Latin “Mons Tyronum” literally “mount of the spear-men” hinting its origin as a training camp for the Roman soldiers. In fact originally the Romans apparently established a military stronghold on the hill nowadays called “San Filii”. From this era of romanisation of the region coins and other archaeological material has been found and studied. During the Norman period the fief of Monteroni was part of the County of Lecce. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II (and also sovereign of the South of Italy and of the Kingdom of Sicily from his heritage from the Apulian Norman dynasty) in 1250 granted the fiefdom of Monteroni to the De Cremona, followed in this feudal office by the Montoroni family who held the fief until 1500s. It was the Montoroni who built the first Baronial Palace in the town in the original shape of a small fortress. When the fief passed onto the baron Lopez y Royo the Baronial Palace was enlarged and gained the current baroque style: it was then the XVI cent., époque of the rich and renown “Barocco Leccese” (Lecce’s typical Baroque). Monteroni di Lecce owes the baroque period also its Bell-Tower and the two chapels which were located in the central square (currently “Piazza I. Falconieri”) on the site currently occupied by the major church “Chiesa Matrice”. Feudalism in the South of Italy was abolished with the events following the French revolution when also the Kingdom of Naples became a republic and then a Napoleonic kingdom. Since then it was the “Municipality of Monteroni di Lecce” which took over and carried on the sorts of the fief of Monteroni.</p>

<p>A part from the above-mentioned Baronial Palace, Chiesa Matrice and Bell-Tower, the other major monuments include the Town Hall (XVII cent.) and the villas and mansions that the region’s aristocratic families build in the countryside around of Monteroni di Lecce over the XV, XVI and XVII centuries (this exploit of aristocratic country-houses actually took place throughout the whole area of “Valle della Cupa” on the South-West of Lecce). Inter al. in Monteroni di Lecce one can mention: Villa Romano (the biggest of Monteroni’s aristocratic estates), Villa Carelli-Palombi, Villa De Giorgi, Villa Urselli, Villa Bruni, Villa Saetta, etc. As for the more contemporary architecture “Velodromo degli Ulivi”, the cycling course where the World Championship for Cyclists took place in 1976, the “Ecotekne” campus of the University of Lecce as well as the university’s dormitories converted from the former tobacco-factories. Monteroni di Lecce is referred as a “University Town” thanks to those academic institutions and state-of-the-art university facilities.</p>

They converted from Hindu to Muslim in 16th century A.D. the same era when Mughals were concuring most of the regions of sub-continent. Sangoos claim themselves as the descendents of great hindu ruler Rana Sanga. These people are mainly farmers and also still keep animals such as cows, goats etc. Many others have also joined politics and also are in govermental services. Specifically the SAngoos are in a very small percentage as compared to other Gujjar tribes. The famous regions where they are in high ratio are <b>Gojra</b> and <b>Rahimkot</b>. They still follow the Jirga system and usually do not consult courts for internal disputes. The main leading family in the tribe is known as [Sardar<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardar" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardar" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>] Family and the head of this family is responsible for all intra- &amp; inter-tribe activities and he is the one resolving their disputes.</p>

<p>Arkansas Governor's School (AGS) is a summer program funded by the state of Arkansas and typically held at Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas. AGS targets gifted high school students that are up-coming seniors. AGS is intended to be fun yet educational, and while there are no grades, each participant is required to attend certain classes.</p>
<p>AGS is around six weeks long, running non-stop except for a small break at the beginning of July, and participants are discouraged from leaving campus, except for a few hours one specific day a week.</p>
<p>AGS is composed of area-specific classes and non-area specific classes. Students who apply to AGS are allowed to apply in up to three of the eight areas, only one of which each participant will be accepted in. The performance areas, Choral Music, Art, Instrumental Music, and Drama, require auditions to determine that participants are skilled in those areas. Applicants to the other areas, Mathematics, Natural Science, Language Arts, and Social Sciences, are not interviewed.</p>
<p>Each AGS participant is required to view the work of other areas, whether that means listening to Language Arts participants reciting poetry or going to the exhibits of the Arts participants. Participants are also required to see various films and listen to various speakers, all of which are educational in some manner, ranging many different fields. In some classes, discussions are held, and they often become heated, but they are eye-opening for all their heat. Some films and speakers are optional, and there are various optional fun activities, such as dressing a certain way or learning a new small skill, every week.</p>

<p>It is a mischievous deity that frustrated drivers pray to in the hope that the traffic lights will show there desired colours, although seemingly fictional, drivers repeat a their desires and either thank the god (known as God but not to be confused with the Christian deity) or they ritually curse as the custom requires. The God came into worship since the introduction of traffic lights in 1968 but does seem to be linked in some way with YHWH in his attributes as he is omniscient and it may be indicated that he is indeed an Angel. Indeed he is a being invisible to detection and is represented by a great red eye that dominates over its amber and green counterparts which are submissive to it.</p>

<p>In a mixed market economy, the basic economic questions are answered by supply and demand of goods and services, but there are varying levels of government intervention in the economy.</p>
<p>Usually, this intervention is a social safety net, providing public services such as health care, education, welfare services, and/or pensions, ect. Also, a government can intervene in the economy by determining minimum wages, labour standards, and regulate interest rates to influence spending or saving. Governments use subsidies to promote certain industries, and nationalize others if they are important parts of the economy, but do not want to be provided by the private sector because of the risks involved.</p>
<p>Most economies throughout the world are not completely <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalist.html" title="Capitalist">capitalist</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a> and therefore would be considered mixed market economies because the government and the citizens determine the country's economic future.</p>

<p>4PM (For Positive Music), is a male R&amp;B group best known for "Sukiyaki" from their 1995 debut album, "Now's the Time". "Sukiyaki", remake of a Japanese song by Kyu Sakamoto, is 4PM's most successful song that climbed and peaked at number 8 on Billboard's Hot 100 in February 1995.</p>
<p>Follwing a lifelong dream, the group was founded by two American brothers Roberto Pena Junior and Reney (Ray) Pena along with Larry FcFarland and Martiz Ware. They were originally known as "IV Real", who perfomed in local talent shows, in the suburbs of Baltimore, Maryland. The year was 1991.</p>
<p><br />
In 1994 an executive of Next Plateau Records approached 4PM after their performance at a record release party. A recording contract with Next Plateau Records in New York City was the result, and weeks later, they recorded their first and greatest song: "Sukyaki".</p>
<p>With the success their debut album, "Now's The Time", reaching international acclaim, it was not long before 4PM began touring Canada, the United States, and Asia. The debut album earned Gold status in the Canada, the US, and Japan, while being award Platinum status in Australia.</p>
<p>Like their first album, their second album ("A Light in the Dark") also gained international acclaim in 1997. In the follwing year, their luck appeared to run out.</p>
<p>In 1998, Martiz Ware left 4PM and Next Plateau went out of business. With these two setbacks the group took a hiatus until they decided to start their own record label. With the exception of Martiz, 4PM regrouped and launched their new company: Pena Brother Productions.</p>
<p>A few years later, in May of 2000, they began recording a self-titled album. This third album, titled "For Positive Music", would deliver a mix of Pop, R&amp;B, Hip-hop, and Latin style music.</p>
<p>As they themselves say: 4PM -- For Positive Music means "Music that does not contain explicit lyrics, does not promote violence, does not degrade women, music for anyone and everyone to enjoy. Our motto is and always will be... Stay Positive!"</p>

<p>Produced by Pro Co Sound, the ProCo Rat is a very simple circuit, based around a single <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operational_amplifier.html" title="Operational amplifier">op-amp</a> the LM308. The distortion is produced using a variable gain circuit with diodes shorting the output to ground to produce hard <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clipping_%28music%29.html" title="Clipping (music)">clipping</a> of the input waveform. This distortion stage is followed by a passive tone filter and volume control. This is exactly the same scheme as the <a href="../../../b/o/s/BOSS_DS-1_e800.html" title="BOSS DS-1">BOSS DS-1</a> distortion pedal. Note: When most pedal refer to a Proco Rat, they generally mean the Rat2.</p>

<p>The Rat is a popular pedal for modifying. Some of the possible modifications include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.diyguitaramp.com/rat.html" class="external text" title="http://www.diyguitaramp.com/rat.html" rel="nofollow">Ruetz Rat</a> which involves simply cutting one resistor to alter the tone</li>
<li>The original Rat pedals featured the LM308 IC which is now quite expensive. Recent Rat pedals now feature the Texas Instruments OP07DP. Other <a href="../../../o/p/a/OPAMP_77bb.html" title="OPAMP">OPAMP</a> ICs that people try include: NE5535A, LM741, TL071 FET-OP. Many install an IC socket to enable easy swapping of ICs.</li>
<li>2.1mm (<a href="../../../b/o/s/BOSS_f052.html" title="BOSS">BOSS</a> style) 9vDC adapter socket mod. Because the tip on the Boss style adapter is negative, one needs to install a plastic socket to avoid shorting out.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-21_3488.html" title="Edit section: register rotation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">register rotation</span></h2>
<p>IA-64 provides for register renaming which makes the registers appear to rotate. Register rotation is provided for the general registers, floating point registers and the predicate registers. Three additional registers, the LC (Loop Count), EC (Epilog Count) and RRB (Register Rotation Base) are also provided.</p>
<p>Register rotation is used for optimizing loops that are both counted or data-terminated. Counted loops are loops whose iterations are known prior to entering the loop, while data-terminated loops are dependent upon values calculated inside the loop.</p>
<p>The general, floating point and predicate registers are divided into subsets of static and rotating sets. The following is the subdivision:</p>
<pre>
     Register Set                       Static  Rotating
     General Registers (GR)             0-31    32-127
     Floating Point Registers (FR)      0-31    32-127
     Predicate Registers (PR)           0-15    16-63
</pre>
<p>The RRB register is used to rename accesses to the subset of rotating registers. A reference to any register in the range of the rotating registers is offset by the value of the RRB. Thus, if the RRB has a current value of 10, a reference to GR[48] would actually refer to GR[58]. The RRB value 'wraps' register values through the use of modulo arithmetic. Thus, the register values appear to rotate. Modulo-Scheduling</p>
<p>Modulo-scheduling overlaps multiple iterations of a loop using multiple rotating registers to represent a single variable within the loop. Most compilers currently allow for this type of optimization, but is generally only efficient for large count loops. IA-64 reduces the overhead for modulo-scheduling, making it efficient for small count loops as well.</p>
<p>The prologue of a loop fills the software pipeline, the kernel of the loop executes the loop logic, and the epilogue drains the software pipeline. The following code example extracted from [1] provides insight to the process:</p>
<p>Original code:</p>
<pre>
       for (i=0; i&lt;n; i++) {
            *b++ = *a++;
       }  /* copy string */ 
</pre>
<p><br />
Compiled Code:</p>
<pre>
       // setup ra, rb, LC, check n&gt;0
       prologue
       {
            ld8 r33 = [ra], 8
       }
       kernel
       .label loop
       {
            ld8 r32 = [ra], 8
            st8 [rb] = r33, 8
            br.ctop #loop
       }
       epilogue
       {
            st8 [rb] = r33, 8
       } 
</pre>
<p>Register rotation provides renaming of intermediate results from previous iterations, eliminating register copy operations in the loop body.</p>
<p>Epilogue Count</p>
<p>The EC register is provided to schedule the number of loop iterations required to drain the software pipeline. The LC register determines whether the kernel of the loop will be executed or not. If LC &gt; 0, the LC register is decremented, a 1 is written in predicate register p16, and the kernel is repeated. If LC == 0, then a zero is written to p16, and the EC register is examined. If EC &gt; 1, the EC register is decremented and the kernel of the loop is repeated. Only when LC == 0 and EC == 0 does the loop terminate.</p>
<p>This format allows the loop to be flattened, and the code executed in the epilogue is determined by its predicate. The following is an example of the code above utilizing an epilogue count register.</p>
<pre>
   // setup ra, rb, LC=n-1, EC=2, p16=1, p17=0
   .label loop
   {
        (p16) ld8  r32 = [ra], 8
        (p17) st8  [rb] = r33, 8
        br.ctop  #loop
   }
</pre>
<p>The following table summarizes the values on execution:</p>
<pre>
   Cycle   Stage
   Predicate    BR      Predicate
   Value        LC      EC
   p16  p17     p16     p17
   1    ld1             br.ctop         1       0       n-1     2
   2    ld2     st1     br.ctop         1       1       n-2     2
   3    ld3     st2     br.ctop         1       1       n-3     2
   ...  ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     ...
   n    ldn     stn-1   br.ctop         1       1       0       2
   n+1          stn     br.ctop         0       1       0       1
   after loop exit      0       0       0       0
</pre>
<p>After the first cycle executes, the predicate value of p16 rotates into p17, causing the store to be predicated on, and the branch instruction writes a 1 into p16. When cycle n is reached, the branch instruction causes the load instruction to be predicated off. While Loops</p>
<p>Modulo-scheduling is also provided for data dependent loops, such as the while statement. The loop condition is computed with a predicate register target in the body of the loop, as opposed to a comparison to the LC register. The br.wtop branch instruction will branch until a given predicate is false. Once the predicate is false, the br.wtop instruction continues to loop, but decrements the EC register. Only when the EC register is zero and the predicate is false, will the loop stop.</p>

<p><b>Those glittering butterflies, golden pouches and curvey flacons. Who is Annick Goutal and what inspires her romantic vision?</b></p>
<p>Alchemist and perfumer Annick Goutal embodies her namesake fragrances exactly. She believes in the sophisticate subtlety of nature and this pervades her personal style.</p>
<p>Goutal blossomed late, coming to perfume making after a career as a prizewinning pianist and model. She then met a man, separated from him, found herself alone with a baby (her daughter Camille), was diagnosed with breast cancer and married her childhod sweetheart. She went into the skin cream business with a friend and instinctively felt they were missing two things, fragrance and packaging. "My fingers remembered", she says, harking back to her experience in her fatther's confectionery. "I had acquired a great manual facility thanks to all the chocolate arranging. I had the idea of presenting the pots of cream like dainty packets of sweets. In beautiful handwriting we inscribed hundred of tags to go with the bags".</p>
<p>Then, in 1977, she met perfumer Henry Sorsana and spent the next seven years memorising ingredients and honing her talent as an extraordinary nose. The words were the same: note, harmony, key... I was back with music again, with that part of myself I had been sadly cut off from". Her first three fragrances, Folavril, Passion (her own personal perfume) and Eau d'Hadrien set her apart, and she opened her first salon on Rue de Bellechasse in Saint Germain. Each fragrance is a touchstone, a reminder of someone or something important in Goutal's life. "Like precious bouquets, gathering the rarest and most noble of natural essences, they are composed as a symphony, note by note, in an eternal quest for balance and perfect harmony". Her fragrance following is cult - once you have sampled the fruits of Annick Goutal you"ll be a devotee. The impalpable Eau d'Hadrien is a favourite among fashion editors, Madonna, Prince... even the Guerlain family comes to Annick Goutal!</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-21_3488.html" title="Edit section: LUZER">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">LUZER</span></h2>
<p>LUZER is a four-piece <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_pop.html" title="Power pop">power pop</a> band from a suburb of <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trenton%2C_NJ_4834.html" title="Trenton, NJ">Trenton, NJ</a> (Hamilton). Taking the essence of great <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_%26_roll.html" title="Rock &amp; roll">rock &amp; roll</a> from the last fifty years and spinning it into a refreshing original sound, LUZER first formed in the final days of the last millennium.</p>
<p><br />
LUZER has made a name for themselves appearing all across the United States, bringing their high-energy theatrical live performances from New Orleans to New York City, and everywhere in between. With heavy comparisons to their biggest influences of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_%28band%29.html" title="Queen (band)">Queen</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beach_Boys_6081.html" title="The Beach Boys">The Beach Boys</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>, it only seemed appropriate that their first national tour be in support of the country’s number one Beatles tribute act, Long Live The Beatles. Performing to these wide cross-sections of audiences across the U.S. only confirmed what LUZER had always believed. Good music is timeless and ageless, and although the band’s pop sensibility may be a harsh contrast to whatever the current flavor of the week is on commercial radio, there is a large mass audience of all ages just waiting for some future classic rock.</p>
<p><br />
Although citing influences ranging from <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_Light_Orchestra_bf45.html" title="Electric Light Orchestra">ELO</a> to <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thin_Lizzy_c1e8.html" title="Thin Lizzy">Thin Lizzy</a> is not unheard of in today’s music scene, it is certainly rare in a band who’s average age is barely 21. The band also possesses no shortage of musical versatility, featuring four drummers and three guitarists and keyboardists in a line-up four members. Led by singer/songwriter Tim Mahoney, the band is rounded out by Dan Seeth, Chris Volk, and Sally (on their primary instruments of drums, bass guitar, and lead guitar respectively). At it’s formation in late 1999, Tim, Dan, and Sally were fellow high school juniors, Chris merely a sophomore, but the band had decided from day one that this was to be their career. And they have not stopped since, releasing two E.P.’s, two full-length albums, and a live cd, all before the bands members could legally drink alcohol.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The band had always had a strong appreciation for <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classic_pop.html" title="Classic pop">classic pop</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_%27n_roll.html" title="Rock 'n roll">rock 'n roll</a>, but their newest full-length release Reset has really brought their influences to the forefront. Described by The Cincinnati City Beat as “an over-the-top rocker guaranteed to make <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garage_Rock_017f.html" title="Garage Rock">Garage Rock</a> poseurs shit themselves,” Reset’s completely self-produced fifteen tracks are the culmination of five years of performing, songwriting, and learning the full potential of the recording studio. The City Beat review continues, “Retro nods to the Beach Boys and Squeeze flaunt what so many bands lack -- depth. It's really hard to believe these guys are in their twenties."</p>
<p><br />
Albeit flattered by the notion of being mentioned in the same breath as their musical heroes, LUZER will be the first to shoot down the label of being “<a href="../../../r/e/t/Retro.html" title="Retro">retro</a>”. As Tim describes it, “You don’t want to rewrite great songs. You have to break down what made these songs great, and use those ingredients to make something new.” As the e-zine Fliggil put it, commenting on Tim’s songwriting, one listen to their newest album Reset will “easily distinguish Mahoney from the wanna-be’s of today’s mod-rock”.</p>
<p><br />
With bold career aspirations including reuniting the surviving <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beach_Boys_b7bd.html" title="Beach Boys">Beach Boys</a> to lend their harmonies to a LUZER composition, to starring as themselves in a full-length feature film biopic of the band, LUZER has no goals short of being the biggest band in the world. With the sheer amount of great music these young musicians have produced in their first five years, their plans to rule the world of music just don’t seem too farfetched.</p>

<p>Chronickah is an original Holiday created by a man who is known throughout the world, none other than the Don himself, Jose Sanchez, many, many years ago as a devised 10 Holy Day holiday that lasts from the Holiest Day, April the 20th, or 4/20, until April the 29th, or the last in the line of days of 4/20.</p>
<p>Not to be outshown by Chronickah Eve, being April the 19th, which is also celebrated as well, by the 10 days from 4/20 to 4/29 are the actual dates of Chronickah.</p>
<p>Chronickah is a time when friends gather together and celebrate through smoking God's green herb and munching out on treats. As well as partaking in what the Don originally called, "The Light and Unite" program, Chronickah needs to be known by stoners and commonfolk alike. Carry on the word of Chronickah and celebrate in the 10 Days of Four Twenty.</p>
<p>A song was written in the tune of "The 12 Days of Christmas" but is more commonly known as "The 10 Days Of Chronickah" Here is a sample of the lyrics: "On the first day of Chronickah, my true Nugz gave to me...a dub sack in a Philly On the second day of Chronickah, my true Nugz gave to me...2 for 15, and a dub sack in a Philly On the third day of Chronickah, my true Nugz gave to me...3.5 Grams, 2 for 15, and a dub sack in a Philly On the fourth day of Chronickah, my true Nugz gave to me...FOUR TWENTYYYYYY, 3.5 Grams, 2 for 15, and a dub sack in a Philly</p>
<p>I don't remember the rest of the words, but those first 4 days stuck in my head since I first heard them back in 1999!</p>

<p>The Beaconhouse Group is possibly the largest privately owned education system of its kind in the world. Established in November 1975 as the Les Anges Montessori Academy for toddlers, Beaconhouse has since grown into a large network of private schools, institutes, and universities, imparting distinctive and meaningful education to almost 110,000 students from pre-school to post-graduation. Through close links with leading UK universities, Beaconhouse also helps provide professional education and training to more than 6,000 staff members, enabling them to improve their classroom practice as well as obtain certificates, diplomas and degrees that have global recognition.</p>
<p>From its humble beginnings almost 30 years ago, Beaconhouse is today much more than just a school. Through distinctly independent divisions, it caters to the education and training needs of a diverse group of individuals of varying age, socio-economic background, and ethnicity. Apart from the group's flagship, the Beaconhouse School System, some of its key components include The Educators, a franchised school network with over 250 network associates in 80 cities; Beaconhouse-Informatics, a leader in IT training and education that is part of the Informatics International network spanning 5 continents; Beaconhouse Business School, which offers quality management science programs in collaboration with Curtin University of Technology, Australia; and Beaconhouse National University, based in Lahore, Pakistan, which has become the country's leading liberal arts university.</p>
<p>Equipped with the understanding and experience of three decades of school management, educational product development, teacher training, and curriculum development, Beaconhouse has in recent years started to move out of its home territory and has embarked upon an ambitious program of establishing private schools in cities throughout Southeast Asia, Southwest Asia, and the Gulf. The immediate success of Beaconhouse Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. is one testimony to this journey of globalization.</p>

<p>Fr. Michael Maher reluctantly left his parish of Holy Name of Mary in San Dimas to be the pastor of the new-born St. Paul flock. Bishop Phillip Straling, the bishop of the diocese at the time, blessed the 7.02 acres of land that the new church was to be built on.</p>

<p>Carini rocks. He is a Uruguayan goalkeeper and very underrated. He plays for the Italian Club Cagliari Calcio and is a part of the Uruguayan national team. He played against Australia in the 2006 World Cup Qualifier in November, 2005. Sadly, the Australians won, but Carini played very well indeed. He needs to play more games. Damn hags.

<p>The Collegiate Church of the Holy Cross and the Mother of Him who hung thereon is the parish church of the Devonshire town of Crediton and has a college of governors who oversee the long term welfare of the church and its worship.</p>
<p>The Church was originally the cathedral church of the ancient See of Crediton until Bishop Leofric, no longer wanting to be confined to a 'mere village' transfered the See to the larger and more culturally active city of Exeter. He left the Church with a college of eighteen canons and eighteen priests.</p>
<p><b>The Church Today</b></p>
<p>Today the church maintains its daily round of services, served by a Rector who is assisted by a curate, reader, and numerous assistant and retired clergy. Its principal services are sung by the church's famous choir accompanied on the Harrison and Harrison organ (refurbished in 2001).</p>

<p>In 1982, Kennedy F. Shortridge and Charles Stuart-Harris proposed that China, particularly southern China, is an epicentre for the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses [1]. This hypothesis was based on three observations:</p>
<p>1. The occurrence of a large number of viruses in domestic poultry notably ducks in the region.</p>
<p>2. The dense populations and close proximity of humans, poultry and pigs in villages and farms there.</p>
<p>3. The historical records associating China with epidemics and pandemics and, in the last century, the association of southern China with the emergence of the 1957 Asian and 1968 Hong Kong pandemic strains and the re-emergence of the 1977 H1N1 virus [2]. These records have been reinforced by the 1997 H5N1 incident that is considered by some to have been an incipient pandemic and a pandemic averted by the slaughter of poultry across Hong Kong SAR in late 1997.</p>
<p>The implication of this hypothesis is that some of the avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry in southeastern China could cross the host barrier and infect humans through reassortment in a pig with a prevailing human virus. This was the case in the 1957 Asian and 1968 Hong Kong pandemics. In addition, the H5N1 human infections highlighted that avian influenza viruses can infect humans directly without prior reassortment in an intermediate host.</p>

<p>Michael William Aldrighetti was born on July 8, 1989, in Joplin, MO, to Michael Teel and Jaimy Lizabeth Aldrighetti. Young Michael grew up in Scammon, KS. He had first lived in Roseland, KS, a mile away from Scammon. He was forced to move out after a house fire and his father going to prison for dealing with meth. Michael moved in with his great-grandma, Helen Simone. Everyone called her "Nana." She raised him like he was her own. Michael had a little sister, Johanna Lee Aldrighetti. She also lived with Michael and Nana. Michael stayed in Scammon until the seventh grade, then he moved to Columbus with his dad and grandma Emma Jean Aldrighetti. It was in the seventh grade that he met a young girl named Madalene Endicott. He liked her, but she wasn't interested. Michael moved on to other things. It was again in high school, he began to like her again. As a sophomore, they had a computer class together. Michael always flirted with her. He didn't know it, but she liked him. Things eventually sizzled down and they went their separate ways. The next year, as juniors, they fell for each other again. They were "talking" when Jason Witt, one of Michael's best friends, died of a gunshot to the head. It hit Michael hard, but Maddie was there for him the whole time. The day after, November 19, 2005, they got together for the first time. They went on to break up twice, but are still together. Michael manages to balance Maddie, work, and school while making straight A's. He hopes to become valedictorian of his class. He is very bright and is a good person despite the hard times he faced in his childhood.</p>

<p>It was the fall of 1986 and there wasn?t a whole lot of noise being made in the Boston hardcore scene except by Slapshot who were riding high after the release of their debut 12" EP, ?Back on the Map?. After bumping into each other repeatedly at shows and parties, a few of us local riff raff got together and decided it would be a good idea to form a band ourselves. After several months of shameless self-promotion we actually got off our asses and in February 1987 moved into a rehearsal space near Fenway Park to get down to the business of writing and rehearsing songs. Rather than rehashing the classic Boston sound, we leaned more towards more metallic stuff like Discharge, Broken Bones, Battalion of Saints and Motorhead. We also took a few cues from New York bands like the Cro-Mags and Agnostic Front, although I think it was less of a musical influence from A.F. and more the fact that Glenn?s voice sounded strikingly similar to that of Roger Miret. After writing a handful of songs we made our live debut opening for Corrosion of Conformity at T. T. the Bear?s in Cambridge on May 24th and the band was off and running. Thanks to the assistance of fanzine mogul/booking agent Mike Gitter we became a fixture on the local scene over the following months opening up for pretty much everybody who came to town- the high point being an opening slot on a bill with the legendary Suicidal Tendencies. Also during that summer we played our first of many hardcore matinee shows at CBGB in New York. As a coup of sorts, we ended up playing just under the headliner, Uniform Choice, but after both of NYC?s own Breakdown and Warzone. Needless to say, many in the crowd didn?t take to kindly to us playing over Warzone, one of the scene?s most established bands at the time. We were still wet behind the ears AND we were from Boston. Plus we weren?t really very good yet. We did eventually befriend most of the great NYHC bands of the time: the previously mentioned Agnostic Front, Cro-Mags as well as Sick of It All, Raw Deal (aka Killing Time), Token Entry, Rest in Pieces and Sheer Terror, but I don?t think the folks down there ever really forgave us for that first gig. Or at least they made sure not to show it too much.</p>
<p>On the recording front, in January of 1988 we finally went into the studio for the first time and laid down 8 tracks: 7 originals as well as a cover of "Tied Down" by Negative Approach. All 8 songs were briefly released as a demo tape but the first 4 tracks were subsequently issued as our first vinyl release- a 7? EP on Vortex Records, a new label started by Mark McKaye of Slapshot. [For all you collectors out there, of the 1000 pressed there were 800 copies on black vinyl with either red or grey covers (some of which were rather haphazardly numbered as well), 100 on green vinyl with green covers, and 100 on clear vinyl with white covers.]</p>
<p>About the time the Vortex EP was coming out we were busy inking a recording deal with the newly established NYC-based Hawker Records, a division of Roadrunner Records. We were back in the studio, this time at Synchro Sound (which was formerly owned by the Cars and is where Ric Ocasik recorded the Bad Brains ?Rock for Light? LP) recording our first full-length LP ?Balance of Terror?. As a side note, none of the Hawker recordings, including the LP and the 3 tracks from the ?Free For All? live compilation, are included in this collection. Roadrunner retains all rights to these recordings, and perhaps they?ll see fit to release them in the future. Because we didn't have a version of "Why Must They", the only "hit" from the LP, to include we went ahead and re-recorded it in April '04 and it is included herein for your listening pleasure.</p>
<p>Before the "Balance of Terror" LP was released in the spring of ?89 there were two additional recording sessions: the ?Free For All? live at CBGB Hawker Records showcase of which 3 songs were included on the compilation and another studio session, our first with Tom Hamilton, which included one new original and a Battalion of Saints cover for the Thrasher Magazine Skaterock Vol. 7 compilation.</p>
<p>Shortly after the LP?s release we were on our first and only tour of the US- which I thought in many ways mirrored Spinal Tap's "Tap Into America" tour. I won?t waste too much space on meandering ruminations, but the featured highlights included performing amidst a blizzard of insects in an Iowa cornfield, a heavy metal ?battle of the bands? at a Ground Round outside Seattle, and being stranded with a flat tire in the middle of the desert. I suppose that?s just nitpicking since at least none of us got arrested or killed, although Keith was nearly mistaken for a purse snatcher by the St. Louis police. And of course there were plenty great shows too, like playing with D.I. at the Country Club in L.A. and with The Accused in Seattle.</p>
<p>After returning from tour we were eager to get writing material for a 2nd LP unfortunately it became apparent that Hawker wasn't doing to well and the label soon folded. After a number of false starts we eventually returned to Synchro Sound in April ?90 to record a new 5-song demo with Tom Hamilton twisting the knobs again. The aptly titled ?Demo 90? contained 4 of the finished cuts and was sold as a cassette at our live shows. The previously unreleased 5th song, ?Passing Time?, is presented here for the first time ever.</p>
<p>After several months of figuring out what to do with the demo, with the assistance of our friends the immortal Biohazard we scored a new recording deal with Maze Records. Unfortunately fate was not on our side again and that label closed up shop shortly afterwards and before any progress was made recording a second LP.</p>
<p>The band continued bravely on and continued playing shows into ?91 but eventually, in the end, frayed nerves and just plain old ?growing apart? resulted in the departure of both Glenn and myself. Wrecking Crew continued on in several incarnations afterwards so this is not a complete history, just the end of the first chapter</p>

<p>Dathomir is a low-gravity world located in the Quelii sector. The planet is inhabited by the Witches of Dathomir, a group of Force-sensitive women who ride fearsome rancors. These witches live in different clans that include a group of of dark siders calld Nightsisters. The "Singing Mountain Clan" and the Nightsisters are at war with eachother-and with visitors who fail to show the proper respect.</p>
<p>Dathomir is even feared by the Empire, though it holds one of the most secure prisons in the galaxy. Only the most daring would even go close to the planet of Dathomir as it can onl be acessed by special charter transport operated by the government, or by civilian skilled pilots. Besides the rancors, valley labyrinths, witches are a constant threat to Dathomir.</p>
<p>And Dathomir is a planet of the Aurillian Village, where Force-Sensitive splinter bands of Jedi meet. Dathomir is known for its tar pits, sarlaac, winding valleys, and misty falls.</p>

<p>Before attempting an exposition of the topic, it is imperative to define the key concepts: “HUMAN RIGHTS”;” RULE OF LAW” AND “EMERGING DEMOCRACIES”. Human Rights are those rights which the international community recognizes as belonging to all individuals by the very fact of his humanity1. Judicially, Human Right was defined by Kayode ES0 (JSC) in Beko Ransome Kuti V AG Nigeria2 as a right which stands above the ordinary laws of the Land and which in fact, is antecedent to the political society itself. The rule of law in a nutshell means that everything in government must be done according to the law. The concept of the rule of law was made popular and given clarity by professor A.V. Dicey when he espoused the three major levels upon which a rule of law principle and practice should be based. These he reeled out to be: Equality before the law (of all subjects); Supremacy of the constitution (of all land); Fundamental human Rights (a guarantee of all subjects). The concept of democracy would be better imagined than defined for according to Kaunda3, “democracy is a concept that defies a precise definition. Although a precise definition of democracy may be a source of confusion to scholars of all persuasions, its connotation and implication are not in doubt. In Democracy, power belongs to the people, the common man. In other words power belongs to the electorate in the main which power when given to elected representatives should be used for the good of all. Amongst the many hallmarks of democracy include such attributes as independent judiciary; enjoyment of fundamental human right; free and fair elections etc. Emerging democracies is therefore a term used to refer to countries which recently began embracing the tenets of democracy. Nigeria is a perfect example of an emerging democracy. In its 45 years after independence, she has experienced 16 years of democratic rule albeit intermittently. From the above definition it is clear that there is a nexus between the three concepts defined supra.</p>
<p>The current wave of human rights campaign is not a recent phenomenon in the Nigerian legal history. Constitutional guarantee of human nights was adopted in 19594. It has been agreed by commentators that this was largely due to the recommendation of the Willinks Commission on the minorities. The first thing to note therefore is that the introduction of the doctrine of human rights into Nigeria constitution can be traced to her colonial history. Since the emergence of Nigeria as a nation in 1914, she has had several constitution introduced into the legal system. Some of the constitutions were foisted on her by the colonial overlord, while others were fashioned by the Nigerian people. The easiest attempt at constitutional government for Nigeria was the Clifford constitution of 1922. It must be remembered that the constitution which operated in Nigeria prior to independence were designed by the colonial administrator to achieve specific political objectives of the colonialists without any formal attempt by the colonial overlord to safeguard human right in its totality. For instance, the Nigerian (Constitution) Order in Council of 1951 was aimed at introducing representative democracy into the country5. No doubt, all these efforts of the colonial government could be said to be acceptance of a major aspect of human right, which is the democratic ideal of a right to self determination. The inclusion of the doctrine of human rights into our constitution can thus be reflected in the heterogeneous nature of the country and also upon fear of the minorities for their development in a country that was gradually moving towards self determination. Consequently, they began to demand for the creation of more states based on ethnic groups. By 1957, this problem had reached some dimensions that it could not be ignored by the constitutional conference of 1957-1958. Instead of creating more state as demanded by the minorities, the British government entrenched some fundamental human right in the constitution in accordance with the recommendation of Sir Henry Willinks commission. These Rights were immediately incorporated and entrenched in the Independence Constitution6.</p>
<p>The Nigerian state reflects the distinction between human rights and fundamental human right. The later can only be prefixed to a right when such right is enshrined in the constitution. Nigeria, because of her colonial heritage adopted human rights provisions which are “civil” and “political” in nature rather than “socio-economic” The 1979 constitution is said to be the strongest affirmation of Nigeria’s commitment to a comprehensive body of human rights. In comparism with its predecessor, the 1963 constitution, the 1979 constitution provisions were trenchant. There were many innovations in the 1979 constitution relating to human rights7. The issue of socio economic rights has remained a reoccurring decimal in Nigeria constitutionalism. The 1979 constitution had in chapter two incorporated these rights under the heading “fundamental objectives and Directive Principle of State Policy”. The extant constitution8 also has similar provisions in its chapter two. However, what has generated much controversy about the fundamental objectives is that they cannot be enforced in the law courts. See S. 6(6) (c) of the 1999 constitution. This provision is rather unfortunate. Indeed, all the sections of human rights are interdependent, indivisible and equally important. For instance, the right to life in S 33(1) of the constitution can be better enjoyed when and where the economic, social, educational and environmental objectives in chapter 2 are realized. Here, the provision of good roads, clean and safe drinking water, adequate shelter, suitable and adequate food etc (some contents of the directive principle) will play a significant role. Moreover, the need for social and economic right is felt more in the developing nations nay emerging democracies, where a large percentage of the population live under subsistence condition. The position of the council of Europe on this mater is reflected in its Declaration on Human Rights, Democracy and Development: The community and its member states draw particular attention to the universality and indivisibility of human rights and the obligation of all states to respect them. They stress the important role of development assistance in promoting both economic, social and cultural rights as well as civil and political liberties by means of representative democratic government based on respect of human rights”9</p>
<p>It is not in doubt that the United Nations has performed creditably in the area of standard setting in the protection and promotion of human rights globally. Between 1948, when the Universal Declarations of human rights, the first concise and comprehensive human right instrument was adopted and now, the world has indeed witnessed a plethora of Covenants, Conventions, Declarations Principles and Standard not only proclaiming, but also protecting and promoting human right both at the world wide level and the African Continent. Sadly, the world body has not been hundred percent successful in the area of implementing and creating the desired awareness for these human rights instrument. Nigeria has signed and ratified a lot of these instruments, but they are hardly enforced locally in our courts. Of course, the legal status of the International Instruments in our local courts varies. Declarations and principles for instance have no binding effect, and it has been argued that they undoubtedly have moral and political force and provide practical guidance to the states in their conduct. The election of a democratic government in Nigeria Six years ago was a beginning of a new era - the building of a Nigeria founded or democratic value, social justice, fundamental human rights and the rule of law. The government was fast to realize that Nigeria having been a beneficiary of the international community’s insistence on a regime based on human right and democratic principles, It was imperative to ensure that all her people are able to enjoy all the human right provided for in the constitution and in the international and regional human right instrument that she have signed or ratified. The reason for the new commitment was not for fetched. Nigeria had just emerged from a 16 year period of military rule, and it is agreed that human right under military regime is an aberration 10. The government therefore set up a NATIONAL ACTION PLAN for the promotion and protection of human fight (NAP) which was its response to the recommendation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.</p>
<p>For an International Instrument to be binding in Nigeria, It must have been by virtue of S.12 (1)11 enacted into law by the National Assembly. Nigeria has only domesticated the African Charter on Human and People Right.12. The implication of this according to the Supreme Court or the case of Ogudu v the State13 is that Nigeria has adopted the African Charter as part of her municipal Law and the provisions of the Charter covering economic, social and cultural rights are enforceable in Nigeria as chapter four of the constitution. Aside this, what will be the position of other International Covenant e.g. Int’l Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Right (ICESCR). The Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) etc? These conventions although ratified by Nigeria are as yet to be domesticated. The effect will be that they are only morally binding and cannot be enforced in our courts. In the case of Gani Fawehinmi v Abacha14, the court was of the view that no decree precludes Nigerian courts from adjudicating cases complaining about violations against the African Charter which is protected by Int’l law. Similarly, in Oshevire V British Caledonain Airways 15, the court of appeal held that “it is useful to appreciate that an International agreement embodied in a covenant or treaty is autonomous of the municipal laws of contracting states as the contracting parties have submitted themselves to be bound by its provisions which are therefore above domestic legislation. Thus any domestic legislation which is in conflict with the convention is void. Democracy is a bed fellow of civilian rule. The hallmarks of a civilian rule is the consent of the people which is epitomized in the constitution as agreed by them and under which everybody irrespective of rank must be subjected. In Nigeria, as in other democratic states worldwide, the constitution is the supreme law of the Land. 16. An unseverable relationship exists between human rights and democracy and in order to protect, preserve and guarantee these rights, they are entrenched in the constitution17, which is the supreme law within the polity.</p>
<p>These rights so far guaranteed have helped to check the excesses on the exercise of political power and has also focused the attention of government on the individual rights and fundamental freedoms as the basis for democratic governance and attainment of social order 18. There can be no genuine democracy without human empowerment, accountability and popular participation. For democracy to thrive and survive in Nigeria and Africa, human rights must be protected enforced, and guaranteed. Indeed, the beauty of democracy especially in a presidential system of government is the deliberate determination to ensure good governance in the polity. Good governance on its part implies the safeguard of equity and fair play in the protection of the liberty of the citizenry, individually and corporately. This is a function of the co existence, co-exerting and co-functioning of the tripartite statutory organs of government. These organs of government are the executive the legislature and the Judiciary. The judiciary is generally referred to as the arm of government statutorily saddled with the role of interpreting the law of the state. The need for the judiciary is founded upon the doctrine of separation of powers, the rule of law and protection of the fundamental human rights of citizens in a representative government like ours today; hence the judiciary is described as the last hope of the common man. S.6 of the extant constitution vests the judicial power in the court both at federal and state levels. The primary duty of the court especially or the administration of justice is to receive, hear and determine each case that is brought before it in accordance with the provisions of the applicable laws, irrespective of the personality involved. Since 1999, the Judiciary has been alive to its duty, particularly at the Supreme Court. However, Nigerians were shocked, when an Abuja magistrate court ordered the arrest of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) leaders for alleged, picketing exercise by labour to ensure the implementation of the agreement reached between the labour and state governors on the price of petroleum products in the country. Similarly, in 2004 Justice Olokoro of an Ikorodu High Court sitting in Lagos summoned top government officials and human right activists to appear before him. The court made the order following an application by the NBA Ikorodu branch to invite them as amicus curie to address the court in the enforcement of the fundamental rights of 350 applicants, who were arrested and detained from between four to eleven years without trial at Kirikiri prison, Lagos for various offences.</p>
<p>To ensure that the judiciary live up to its billings of enforcing human rights, the constitution must ensure its total independence; sound persons should be appointed to the judiciary; improved condition of service and improved equipment and facilities should be provided; constant training of judicial officers should be carried out. Etc. Also, to facilitate efficient and prompt enforcement of human rights, judicial interpretation should be value oriented 19. The Human Rights Commission, although established20 during the military era is a major milestone in the annals of the development of human rights in Nigeria. Its core aim is to create an enabling environment for extra judicial recognition, promotion and enforcement of human right thereby facilitating the government’s implementation of its human right treaty obligation and providing a framework for public enlightenment and dialogue on human rights, thereby reducing the incidence of controversy and confrontation. The commission is empowered to deal with all matter relating to the protection of human rights as provided by the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and other international treaties to which Nigeria is signatory to. The commission no doubt has recorded giant strides in the more prominent task of instituting a national culture of protection, promotion and respect for human rights. The role of Non Governmental Organizations (NGO) in enlightening the public on their rights, its attendant breaches by government agencies (chiefly amongst which is the police) and the means of seeking redress cannot be overemphasized. NGO’s are organization whose funds are totally independent of government sources. By their nature NGO’s are independent of government funds, and this has encouraged neutrality in carrying out of their duties without fear or favour. Further, Human Rights Organization plays a significant role in the development of the rule of law. Such organization like the Civil Liberties Organization (CLO) established in 1978, Constitutional Right Project (CRP); National Association of Democratic Lawyers (NADL); Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR) etc, have helped in areas like exposure of human rights violations, humanitarian assistance to victims of human rights violations, information, education and conscentization of the people. Democracy demands complete protection of human rights of the citizens. Limitation for the enjoyment and enforcement should only be imposed by the judiciary by restrictive measures and machinery which exists through redress in courts in the event of breach. The rule of law will prevent arbitrariness and anarchy.</p>

Mildred Lewis Rutherford (1851-1928)</p>
<p>Mildred From Miss Rutherford's Scrap Book, vol. 4, April 1923 Mildred Lewis Rutherford Lewis Rutherford is best known for her Confederate memorial activities and for her books on the South. She wrote twenty-nine widely read books and pamphlets, including The South in History and Literature (1907); What the South May Claim; or, Where the South Leads (1916); King Cotton: The True History of Cotton and the Cotton Gin (1922); and The South Must Have Her Rightful Place in History (1923). For three years (1923-26) she also published Miss Rutherford's Scrap Book, a monthly periodical. In addition to writing, Rutherford lectured widely at Confederate Memorial Day celebrations and at United Confederate Veterans and United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) engagements.</p>
<p>Rutherford was born in Athens on July 16, 1851, into a wealthy patrician family with deep roots. Prior to the Civil War (1861-65), her father, Williams Rutherford, and her maternal uncles, Howell Cobb and Thomas R. R. Cobb, were among the state's slave-owning elite. Rutherford attended the Lucy Cobb Institute, a finishing school for girls in Athens, and after graduating in 1868, she taught history and literature in Atlanta. In 1880 she returned to Athens and became the principal of the Lucy Cobb Institute.</p>
<p>A tireless advocate of the "Lost Cause" version of southern history, Rutherford served as the president of the Georgia division of the UDC from 1899 to 1902, and as the historian-general of the national organization from 1911 to 1916. Within the Georgia division, Rutherford promoted educational Courtesy of Hargrett Rare Book and Manuscript Library, University of Georgia Libraries Mildred Lewis Rutherford work in Appalachian Georgia and advocated the use of UDC funds for building facilities at the Rabun Gap–Nacoochee School. She also served as a vice president of the Stone Mountain monument project.</p>
<p>During a time of shifting gender roles, Rutherford harkened back to "Old South" ideals about a woman's proper sphere. Although she defied conventional female behavior both by becoming a public speaker and by remaining unmarried throughout her life, she publicly advocated traditional societal roles for women. She joined the Georgia Association Opposed to Women's Suffrage in 1914 and remained a vocal opponent of woman suffrage and of the Nineteenth Amendment until its ratification in 1920.</p>
<p>Rutherford fell ill in 1927. Late on the night of December 25, while she was convalescing, her house caught fire, and many of her personal papers and belongings were burned. She died the following year, on August 15, 1928.</p>

<p>'Only If You Want To' is the original name given to the song 'Only If...' by Enya, and is found on an early Japanese promoitional issue (a CD sent to shops to play as background music). It sounds vastly the same, except for the French Lyrics after the third chorus being completely absent, and the lyrics "you follow the sun" sung in the first verse instead of the later "you reach for the sun". As expected, the original song is not found on any official Enya album.</p>

<p>Procedure Quick List</p>
<p>Smoothbeam Laser This is a laser procedure in which a beam of light at a specific wavelength is applied to the skin and is absorbed by the collagen in the skin, as well as sebaceous glands.</p>
<p>What is Smoothbeam Laser used for?</p>
<p>Smoothbeam Laser is used for acne, acne scarring on the face and back. It is also used for wrinkles. The laser works by targeting and heating the collagen and sebaceous glands in the dermis while protecting the epidermis. A cooling device cools and protects the skin’s surface.</p>
<p>Who may have Smoothbeam Laser?</p>
<p>This laser procedure may be used in women and men, teenagers to older patients. Any skin type may be treated. Many acne patients choose to have this procedure in addition to their ongoing medical acne treatment. In those patients whose acne has resolved but they still have scarring, the Smoothbeam Laser helps improve the scars.</p>
<p>Is Smoothbeam Laser safe?</p>
<p>Smoothbeam Laser is a safe and effective method of treating acne, and acne scarring and wrinkles. The procedure is performed by a nurse with supervision by a physician, or by a physician.</p>
<p>What are the possible side effects from Smoothbeam Laser treatment?</p>
<p>Possible side effects include hypopigmentation (lightening of the skin in the treated area) and hyperpigmentation (darker skin in the treated area) and redness. Although scarring has been reported this is unusual. Occasionally, this laser is not effective.</p>
<p>Is Smoothbeam Laser painful?</p>
<p>When the laser is applied to the skin, patients feel some stinging, similar in sensation to the snapping of a small rubber band against the skin. We therefore have our patients apply an anesthetic cream to the area being treated for 30 minutes prior to the procedure. This ensures patient comfort during the treatment.</p>
<p>Are there any pre-treatment procedures?</p>
<p>Our nurse or physician will consult with you and review the pre-treatment procedures. The skin being lasered must not be tanned. If the patient has a history of cold sores in the area to be treated, a prescription for an anti-viral medication will be given to you by the physician to be started the day before the laser procedure and taken for a few days afterwards. Patients who have had Accutane for acne may not have laser for at least six months (and possibly one year) after stopping Accutane.</p>
<p>How is Smoothbeam Laser performed?</p>
<p>After the patient has had the topical anesthetic cream on for 30 minutes, the patient is placed in a comfortable, relaxed position. The Smoothbeam handpiece is applied to the skin to deliver the laser light. A cooling device is used at the same time so that the patient feels a spray of coolant on the skin just before each laser pulse. Dark glasses are worn to protect the patient’s eyes from the light.</p>
<p>How long is each treatment?</p>
<p>The treatment takes approximately 20-30 minutes. Generally patients may return to work or to their usual activities after the laser treatment. Patients usually experience some redness, which may last one to two days.</p>
<p>How many treatments will I need?</p>
<p>In general, patients have two to six treatments, approximately every four to six weeks. This will be determined by your dermatologist.</p>
<p>How will I look after each treatment?</p>
<p>The appearance of the skin after Smoothbeam Laser varies from patient to patient. Most patients have some redness of the treated area with little or no discomfort. This may last from an hour to a day. Most patients are able to return to their usual activities right away.</p>
<p>How do I take care of my skin after the Smoothbeam Laser treatment?</p>
<p>Cool compresses applied to the treated area help to reduce redness, swelling and discomfort. Gentle skin care is advisable after each treatment. Avoid scrubbing with abrasive cleansers. It is important to protect all your skin from the sun using a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher every day as well as sun protective clothing.</p>
<p>When will I see results?</p>
<p>Results become visible gradually after two to six treatments. New collagen formation starts after the first laser treatment, but takes time to become visibly improved.</p>
