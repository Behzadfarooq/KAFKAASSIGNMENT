<dd>Bzzzt, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a>, and misleading too. Measuring the river on the map <i>is</i> also OR. Of course, other people have already measured the lengths of rivers, and published the results, so we don't even have to do the measurement in te first place. Also, street names are entirely arbitrary, so being the longest in London isn't in any way notable, particularly as some continuous routes may have more than one street name. Sorry, but there's nothing anywhere which mandates that we need to be the repository of all information ever. This list <i>so</i> fails <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and therefore also <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. If this is the best we can do, it simply boils down to te fact that in this case (as in so many others) the best we have isn't good enough. This solution is no more acceptable than simply copying a chunk out of someone's research paper because we don't know anything about the subject. If nobody else has published the lengths of these streets, neither can we. I urge any closing admin to bear this in mind before considering if this is simply "interesting". 07:07, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Weak keep</b></s>, per Kappa. These are facts that can be determined from information in the public domain, and independently verified (though WP is not for original research) by following a route with a sufficient measuring method. A simple sort by "longest" isn't original research, and provides information which some people clearly find interesting. On the other hand, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an almanac or indiscriminate collection of facts and trivia.

<dd>"Interesting" <i>is not</i> a valid inclusion criterion. "Verifiable", however, <i>is</i> a valid inclusion criterion (required, in fact), but this list doesn't meet that.

</dl>
</li>
<li>I think you're all missing the point here. <b>Original research</b>, people. Kappa's statement that this might belong here is provably false, since the list is indisputably original research (go on, just <i>try</i> finding some circumstance which makes this <i>not</i> OR). The <i><b>one and only</b></i> way of obtaining this data at the moment is to do the measurements yourself, and the <i><b>one and only</b></i> way of verifying this data is to repeat the same measurement process. Thus, the article is unavoidably OR, and cannot be verified independently of the original data.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Notwithstanding the anon's argument above, I don't see any OR here. In fact, if there is one thing that should be fairly easy to list it's street length. Although instead of measuring it myself, as suggested above, I'd depend on an established reference such as <a href="http://www.microcolour.com/ldn_memory_map.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.microcolour.com/ldn_memory_map.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd>Your vote is evidently misinformed, because your reasoning is patently false (no offence). If you don't see any OR, it is either because you don't know what OR is, or it is because you're deliberately ignoring it. Your suggestion of using the A-Z is <i>still</i> OR. Wikipedia thrives on <b>source-based research</b>, but excludes <b>original research</b>. To summarise <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, OR is any research that introduces <b>new information</b>, SBR is any research that uses only <b>existing information</b>, though you are allowed to present this information in a different way - what's important is that nothing is done to the information. For the list of rivers, we are taking the already widely-published figures for various rivers, and arranging them by length. We're doing nothing new (Google for <i>Nile km</i> and you'll see what I mean). For the list of London streets, the data is generated by measuring using maps, or by physically measuring the route itself. In either case, we get raw data that we didn't know before - this is <b>new information</b>, therefore it is <b>original research</b>. Follow? What matters is not whether or not it has been measured, but who measured it and who published it. Since it appears that Wikipedia is the first to publish the fact that Western Avenue is 11.8 miles long to the M25, this is OR. The fact that this page is OR is not even up for debate, as it is indisputable fact. One deciding factor is its value to Wikipedia weighed against this fact. It is my opinion that, because nobody has <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITEd</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> (forgetting for a moment that this being <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> means that no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> exist), and that it can't be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, the very little value this list provides is not worth setting the dangerous precedent of essentially allowing OR into Wikipedia.</dd>

Absolutely no reason why this information should not be presented in a neutral way, but again I don't see anyone actually seriously challenging the accuracy of this information, so it becomes a bit absurd to demand sources.

Also, it would appear that the measly technicalities you're relying on to get this page deleted are pretty shaky. I personally think every redlink needs to be deleted immediately and the info is pretty useless but I'm not bothered about OR and to say that pillars are being smashed isn't accurate.

<li>In defense of 82.15.28.195 I think the OR concern is arguably a legitimate one, not a "measly technicality", but also not a clear-cut case.

<li>Let's turn this discussion on its head. Assume for the moment that there is no OR issue here. If this were not OR, there would already be a list somewhere in a credible and reputable publication stating literally the lengths of the various streets in London. Reputable sources for this would include <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordnance_Survey_7313.html" title="Ordnance Survey">OSGB</a>, various map publishers, and perhaps academic research. A trawl of OSGB turns up no such list. Google for the top five on the list as it stands produces only three pages of entries, including some lists of streets by name, none of which contain lengths. There are some documents related to TfL describing traffic schemes, but nothing giving the total lengths of all of these. Restricting the search to .ac.uk yields no results. Thus, there is no list, and as such the statement that the list is not OR cannot be true. Add in the fact that the talk page actually contains the methodology and <i>confirms</i> that Wikipedians have been applying it, which as stated is clearly aimed to produce new primary data; this reinforces the fact that it is <i>undisputably</i> OR. The clinching factor in deciding "Is this or is this not OR?" is this: according to the map sources, what are the N longest streets in London? If they can't tell you, then they're not the real source of this information. When you have taken the measurement from the map and recorded it somewhere, the map is not the source of that data, your records are. As for this: "<i>Perhaps the editor who feels strongly enough to backchat every vote on this page ...</i>", perhaps <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz">Deiz</a> needs reminding that AfD is <i>not a vote</i>, but <i>discussion</i>. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> - what you might perceive as "back-chatting the votes" (TINAV), is actually engaging the "voters" (TINAV) in the discussion about their reasoning, particularly to establish what <i>they</i> think, beyond "<i>per X</i>", to see what we agree on, where we differ, and where our views diverge. 03:31, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

One, Purley Way is 3.6 miles long, and Two) Purley Way is the tenth longest street in London. Item one can be checked from the map, although that has accuracy issues — if I reference the original source given and get a different answer to that published, can you truly say that it's a verifable fact? Item two is not verifable, to verify it was item 10, I would have to measure every street, and hope that I hadn't missed the same streets as the original author.

I'm not proposing that we waive NOR willy-nilly, but that we recognize that some types of content lie on the border of NOR (for example, plot summaries for books or films). If the street lengths in this article come from measurements off a map (and if so, let's get the cite for that map), then is that original research, or just reproduction of published data, since the map is published and the street lengths are on the map in a non-numeric form? I can see both sides to that argument. I take the view that if the map is published, then the measurements are not original research, and they're verifiable. If the article contains measurements made by some guy with a tape measure or a really long piece of string, then the article still stays but needs a {{<a href="../../../v/e/r/Template%7EVerify_1f97.html" title="Template:Verify">verify</a>}} tag.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm sorry, but to claim that a map of roads does not contain accurate information as to the exact length of each is ridiculous. Any map which does not contain that information is pretty worthless. This argument is entirely analogous to a table published in French, which someone translates into English and still cites as a source. Just because some people are unable to read distances off maps, just as some people are unable to read words out of a book, does not condemn us all to map dyslexia. Locating visual facts on a map sheet is no different to locating particular sentences in a book and including them in a history article. In fact, it might be rather easier to see which is the longest road than to find a particular mention of something. The only thing which writers of an encyclopedia do is collate information. This requires people to organise data and present it in a way which is useful to readers. If editors are not permitted to do that then someone might just as well pull the plug on all the wiki servers right now, and save the elctricity. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 00:45, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There's a few components of original research in reading street lengths off of a map, and an additional one in trying to list the longest streets in a given area. There are a number of problems to contend with that make the issue much different from reading text. For one, what measurement tool is used? If a ruler by hand, then the scale of the map <b>greatly</b> influences the answer that will be had from the measurement, but so does the ruler used. Different measuring tools will come up with different answers for the length . How is that accounted for in the results reported? Some rulers have greater accuracy than others, even the thickness of the lines on the ruler will affect the result. How are curved streets handled? Are they considered at all? The choice of what to consider as one street is a problem. Where does the measurement stop if the street changes names? What precision is to be reported in the answers and how did one arrive at that confidence level? If the map is electronic, what tools are used to measure the lines, and how does the algorithm work? All of these items are judgement calls that are innapropriate original research. And no, ignore all rules cannot set aside any of the major content policies. You can't have a POV article just because you want to ignore the NPOV policy, and no "consensus" can do that. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 03:07, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The difficulties you suggest in translating the data off the map are really not quantitatively different from the difficulties anyone faces when trying to prepare an article from different sources. It is my experience that different sources disagree with each other, and editorial judgement is needed to choose which versions to include in an article. I have also seen the result of someone who plainly does not understand a source then trying to write an article. Articles do not get scrapped because people make mistakes interpreting, they get corrected. Normally when editors have a difference of opinion over content, they fight it out and a consensus on the correct interpretation is reached. Just so here, though I have yet to see any real suggestion that people are arguing the factual content is incorrect. I am sure there are many wiki editors who have the source material on their own bookcase and the necessary ability to read a map to check for themselves that information here is correct. I regard the existence of such an accessible method of checking as making this article very much more readily verifiably than many others which might have a long bibliography which is however not immediately to hand. I remain of the view that a strict interpretation of NOR as suggested by some people would mean that this encyclopedia should totally be deleted. It is not possible to create a synthesis of data without doing original work. That is why such a synthesis is specifically permitted, indeed last time I read it, was mandatory.</dd>
<dd>As to major policies. A perceived violation of a policy is not grounds for deletion of an article. It is merely grounds for initiating a debate over whether such an article should be deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Calling the determination of the length of a street from a map for "origianal research" is stretching it a bit. I mean, if the map is available, the work can be checked, and hence such info can be made verifiable.

<li><b>Comment</b> To check the length of any street, you can check the map for that street and measure it. That is bordering between OR and verifable due to accuracy in remeasuring, but could be seen both ways. <b>However</b>, to check that street is the 10th longest, you have to measure <b>every</b> street in London, hope you were accurate, and hope you didn't miss any. So, to verify fully any <b>one</b> item in that list, you have to do <b>everything</b> again. The latter problem, to me anyway, is what make this not count as verifiable. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 09:53, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, I found this one not so convincing because it relies on the amount of processing and expertise required. I think that we should expect that in some cases a lot of expertise and processing is needed to understand how the sourced information is supported by the source. I find the argument of <a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> given below much more convincing and decisive, unless we cite a map that provides all required information. -<a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumiere_50cb.html" title="User:Lumiere">Lumière</a> 18:43, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Indeed, this is another important issue. Where are the beginning and the end of a street often cannot be determined from the map irrespectively of the amount of processing allowed. A formal criteria could be stated in the article, but the information required by the criteria (such as what is private or public) might not be available. This alone is a strong case for original research: the sourced information is not uniquely determined by the source. -<a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumiere_50cb.html" title="User:Lumiere">Lumière</a> 15:28, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's somewhat beside the point. If you can't point at the source showing the information you need, it's not the source of the information. In this case, you can't point at a London A-Z or OS Landrangers of the area that states categorically the length of Oxford Street. We've heard plenty of reasons why this <i>is</i> OR, but what I (and others) would desperately like to hear before some admin mistakenly closes this as a "keep" (IIRC, they're supposed to weight the <i>reasons</i>, not the <i>votes</i>) is the reasons why people think it's <i>not</i> OR, in relation to the list itself (i.e. not excuses such as "if this is, then everything else is"). Particularly, why they believe that it's not the <i>measurement</i> that makes it OR. 09:27, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. What a strange debate. It seems sooooooo obvious to me that a map is a published source capable of verifying the length of a feature marked on it, and that using that information is not original research.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>The required information is not on any cited map: where a street begins and ends, for example when the street changes name, cannot be found on the map. Often one would need to physically go on the site or rely on local non-published knowledge.</li>
<li>It's either a list of non notable entries (and thus against What Wikipedia is Not <s>and possibly against copyright policy</s>) or, if you think it is more than that, it is against No original Research.</li>

<dd>Reasons for delete that I don't like:
<ol>
<li>It's difficult to measure with good accuracy.</li>
<li>It's a complicated process to list all streets and order them.</li>

</dd>
<dd>I don't like these reasons because they assume that it must be simple for anyone to see that a sourced information is supported by the sources, which is not a policy requirement. For example, translation from German to English is not against NOR. Also, to see that a scientific statement is well supported by scientific sources might require a level of expertise that only a few expert-editors have. -<a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumiere_50cb.html" title="User:Lumiere">Lumière</a> 11:22, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b>. While my vote is still at delete (not bolded, JJAy&#160;:) I want to mention that I don't think it is appropiate to remove the guts of an article — basically deleting it — while it is still under offical discussion for deletion. (I haven't reverted the removal, as if the result is keep, it will be done anyway, and if the result is delete, it would be pointless.) I don't see anything explicitly forbidding it in the Deletion policy, but the afd notice does ask people not to blank the article, and taking the majority of the text is going against the spirit, if not the letter of that policy. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 13:44, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, since its not really clear where I should put this point which has cropped up repeatedly above: no source of information is exact. Tables of scientific values all have limits to their accuracy. Arguing that a map is not a suitable source because of the inherent inaccuracy of obtaining data from it is not a helpful way to decide this point. All it means is that there is a limit on the accuracy of the data. Again, if all data subject to errors was deleted, there would be none left on wiki. A more interesting question is whether this use of the maps violates the copyright of the originators. I am sure that the aim of the map makers copyright conditions is to prevent other people making copies of their maps, which is certainly not what is happening here. Also, if I pick up a text book and use information tabulated in it, then I would not expect to be taken to task by the authors for using that information without permission. As I understand it, the information content is not copyright, only the actual presentation of it? What is presented here is only exerpts from the total of information, and is not unique information as many companies have independently gathered the same information.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 00:57, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Question</b>. Would an article that simply list all the streets in London with their length, assuming that everything is verifiable, be acceptable in Wikipedia? This question is not about the verifiability issue, but about What Wikipedpia is not (<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">this section in particular</a>). One of the comments above says that entries in a list must be notable. This kind of answers my question, but which part of WP policy says that? -<a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumiere_50cb.html" title="User:Lumiere">Lumière</a> 02:08, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Lumiere, i don't think it helps this debate that you go through and change things which you have written and others have already responded to. It makes their responses nonsense, which is unfair, and retrospectively does not allow them to respond to your changed comments, which is also unfair. Please stop doing it. I can see that you have corrected your own arguments where you have found them to be mistaken, but instead of changing them, just continue by stating your changed position.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I would interpret noteablity as being a relative as well as absolute term. it means what is worth including, as well as what is widely accepted (as distinct from what is widely refuted) The wikipage you cite suggests that a sense of proportion is needed. So a complete list of all street lengths in London would be unacceptable, but a list of noteably long ones would be includeable. On the other hand, wiki is not paper, which is say it does not have the same space constraints as a conventional encyclopedia. In a paper volume there is a real sense that if one article goes in, another must come out. That does not apply here. So wiki can afford to include articles on relatively minor topics. Wiki resources are creaking at maintaining a free service, but I think the issue is numbers of people wanting to read it, not the still relatively small volume of information which makes up the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 10:13, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, with regard to your first paragraph, nobody as far as could see had made any reference to the comment that I deleted. Really, I felt that it was somehow totally ignored. I will check again, and if I see that some had made some reference to this comment I will be happy to put it back.

<li><b>A suggestion.</b> We could create a sub-page in which pro-delete and neutral editors would agree on the main reasons for delete, the best way to formulate them, etc. and a new section below in which these reasons will be copied and all editors could comment on them and try to obtain a consensus about whether or not these reasons are valid. If we succeed to have a consensus on only one reason for delete, then the article should be deleted. If, for every proposed reason for delete, we obtain a consensus that the reason is not valid, then we will keep the article. Otherwise, I guess that we will continue to seek a consensus until the decision will be taken by whoever is in charge. My feeling is that only a few main reasons for delete will be proposed, and this will focus the discussions around them instead on around individual votes or comments. I know that I am not very well known, and already I am attacked as a troll, spammer, disruptive, etc. by a few (and also for making many modifications to my own comments, but this one is well deserved), but I still propose this idea for what it's worth. -<a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumiere_50cb.html" title="User:Lumiere">Lumière</a> 16:18, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
