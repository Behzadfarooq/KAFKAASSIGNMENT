<p>There are 500 breeds of dogs. Any of them can be mixed and anyone can name the mixes anything they want. (E.g., see <a href="http://www.achclub.com/modules.php?name=Breeders" class="external text" title="http://www.achclub.com/modules.php?name=Breeders" rel="nofollow">American hybrid "registry"</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/o/Poodle_hybrid.html" title="Poodle hybrid">Poodle hybrid</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_hybrids_and_crossbreeds.html#Casual_crossbreeds" title="Dog hybrids and crossbreeds">Dog hybrids and crossbreeds#Casual crossbreeds</a>.) I realize that WP is not paper, but mostly what can be said about <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed-breed_dog.html" title="Mixed-breed dog">mixed-breed dogs</a> is that they might have some characteristics of either parent, or not (if you also look at <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maltipoo.html" title="Maltipoo">Maltipoo</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schnoodle.html" title="Schnoodle">Schnoodle</a> you'll see what I mean). We've discussed this within the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Dog_breeds_df79.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Dog breeds">dog breed project</a> before and feel that all these do is create multiple mixed-breed-dog articles. We're leaving in <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockapoo.html" title="Cockapoo">Cockapoo</a> because it's been around long enough to be the only mixed-breed name to make it into the dictionary, and <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labradoodle.html" title="Labradoodle">Labradoodles</a> are so common as to be found in just about every puppies-for-sale list everywhere, with <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldendoodle.html" title="Goldendoodle">Goldendoodles</a> getting pretty close, but I'm hesitant to open the floodgates for articles about everyone's mixed-breed dog with an invented name. Also recommending AFD for <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maltipoo.html" title="Maltipoo">Maltipoo</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schnoodle.html" title="Schnoodle">Schnoodle</a> . <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 17:54, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The sheer number of google hits makes it notable, sure, but if you look at the various web sites that provide information on these dogs, these sources are not credible.

These sheer numbers doesn't mean anything, because they aren't reliable sources. Tons of ads for puppies? A couple amateurish "breed clubs" web sites.. dogbreedinfo.com. At most the reliable information provided on these designer dogs comes from casual mentions in magazine articles about the current trend with designer dogs - these articles focus on Go to amazon and search for maltipoo. You won't find anything. There are a couple notable exceptions, such as <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labradoodle.html" title="Labradoodle">Labradoodle</a>, there is a distinct history. - <a href="../../../t/r/y/User%7ETrysha_c63a.html" title="User:Trysha">Trysha</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../t/r/y/User_talk%7ETrysha_3f4c.html" title="User talk:Trysha">talk</a>)</sup> 03:17, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The problem is, you cannot define what a "fooApoo" is. Other than "it will have aspects of a foo, and a poodle, but you really cannot predict which set of aspects". Yes, the ads are out there, but it's all marketing hype. They simply aren't breeds, and if you wanted to have an NPOV article about them, it wouldn't be a "dog breed" format article as these dogs hybrids cannot really be described in any meaningful way - The article would be an article about the marketing success of selling hybrid dogs. More breeds than these have been added, the result of those were all adding redirects to the apropriate hybrids page.

<li><b>Delete</b> in the strongest possible terms. These are never considered dog breeds. I overheard a conversation in a <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> pet store recently and even the salesgirl was describing a "moodle" as a crossbreed to the sucker--oops--I mean the customer. The sellers of these crosses cannot even agree on what they're called--"moodle"??! The fact that such things rate on Google thanks to ads from sellers cannot be taken seriously.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>More importantly, User Msc44 is not correct: there are not significant distinguishing remarks to be made for these crosses, so the result is a proliferation of articles that all say the say basic thing, to wit: this is a cross between a poodle and a .... they have varying appearances blah blah blah, with a photograph.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Unfortunately the celebrities that have these mixed breed dogs are doing a disservice to purebred dogs. It's a shame that you can take two different breeds of dogs, breed them and sell them for a disgusting amount of money. What they should be doing if they want a mixed breed dog, or even a purebred dog for that matter, is to go to the pound. That would help stop BYBer's and puppy millers from making a buck off of this "newest fad."

<dd>Actually I don't care a whit about whether dogs are purebred or not. Most of my smart, talented, beautiful dogs have been mixed breeds. But I'm not trying to create articles on Wikipedia about Semidachshunds, Craussies, Labrasheps, or Golden Shepherds. I must admit, though, having started this thing months ago and having promoted it, too (not doing articles on random mixed breeds), I think I am starting to be swayed by the preponderance of Internet occurrences. I'm just still not entirely convinced that one can legitimately say anything other than "it might...or might not...be like its parent breeds." And I'm not quite sure where one draws the line on "worth having an article for"--100 internet occurrences? 1000? <i>Mumbling off into the night...</i> <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 05:05, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: the problem is not that the article has incorrect infromation, the problem is that the article CANNOT have accruate infromation because - there is no way to define what one of these dogs will look like.

If we're keeping those because they are notable, who defines which poodle crosses are notable and which are not?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also, the article can easily have accurate information by describing what most poodle crosses inherit from each parent, and where there can be variations. If there is enough variation between breeds for people to seek out specific poodle crosses, then there must be enough variation to explore in a Wikipedia article. -<a href="../../../v/o/n/User%7EVontafeijos_b6bc.html" title="User:Vontafeijos">Vontafeijos</a> 04:19, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
