<li><b>Comment:</b> I made sure to look up "Martingale paradox" on Google, Google Scholar, and MathSciNet, to make sure at least the term was not common; I found only one paper on MathScinet (which also turned up on Google Scholar) and few hits otherwise on Google. So I wouldn't really recommend a redirect, but I guess redirects are cheap, so that would be ok with me. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 00:30, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Wikipedia works on a consensus, and I dissent from this deletion. Just because an article may need cleaning up, does not mean it isn't legit, and doesn't have references. Just look at the <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleeping_beauty_paradox.html" title="Sleeping beauty paradox">Sleeping_beauty_paradox</a>, it is marketed as a fictional paradox, which is trivial and was posted to a usenet group by a kook claiming to go to MIT. At least my results are backed up by concrete mathematics, which as you say may be trivial. But the math behind the results is not. Why don't you debate marcov chains with me, and see how well you understand them? --<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntiochCollege_3d1b.html" title="User:AntiochCollege">User:AntiochCollege</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntiochCollege_61e0.html" title="User talk:AntiochCollege">(Talk)</a> 8:51PM, 14 September 2006 (EST)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Consensus is general agreement; it does not require unanimity. Furthermore, the Sleeping Beauty paradox is non-trivial and <b>coherent</b> (and I don't believe Jamie Dreier is a kook or a liar, either, at least not in this context). Your article is largely incoherent. More specifically, it's a series of attempted proofs that are invalid and/or severely under-specified, even though the statements being proven happen to be true. I'll outline what appears to be salvageable on the discussion page. Emurphy42 01:45, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> That's because it's just starting up. We are currently in progress of setting up our website and decided to give Wikipedia the first go so people would know what it's about before hand. This is a very large database and we knew our article interested many people by our fanbase on livedigital and myspace alone so we decided to create a comprehensive article showing the basis of the show before we air it that way people aren't left in the dark. And by fanbase we mean the people (well over a thousand) who have seen our earlier work when it was under the title "The Fallen" which we had to change because of issues with ABC Family over their new series.
<p>So again now that I have explained that please give me a valid reason as to why this should be deleted. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Shintou (<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShintou_17ca.html" title="User talk:Shintou">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Shintou_5d73.html" title="Special:Contributions/Shintou">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li>The reason is in your very explanation, where you state that you "decided to give Wikipedia the first go". <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a publisher of first instance</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:22, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Can we just <b>Speedy Delete</b> this? The comment above sums it up fairly well, it's not an encyclopedia article, but a means to preview an up and coming production for the audience. This isn't what Wikipedia is for. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:28, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Do all of you disregard anything your members have to say and just point out anything you see unfit and prod at it until the world agrees or is there a special club wankers like that can join?
<p>Yes it is a form of a preview but there is basis behind it. The script has already been released and clips have been shown, and once the whole thing is finalized which will be soon, it will go straight to the internet. Now then I don't see the point of wasting everyone's time by deleting it right now when you could wait a few weeks and let us post up a full (over 40 minute) episode. It's not logical to waste all of that time.</p>
<p>And if this is an advetisement then what the bleeding hell do you call you ctrl+alt+del article? It's basically the same exact thing except with pictures of the comic strip and by the end of the week we will have screen caps on it so what's the bloody difference? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Shintou (<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShintou_17ca.html" title="User talk:Shintou">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Shintou_5d73.html" title="Special:Contributions/Shintou">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>"trivial coverage" does that not include mention/interviews on various radio stations? Such instances have occurred both on the "DJ Glowsticks" radio show, located in New Brunswick, canada, and in ermac's radio show several times throughout his "web" career. Also, my site has been around for near three years, and no, I don't know what this "Alexa" is all about. I never signed up for any such service. If you wish, I can provide my awstats traffic info, but even when I WASNT updating for months, I was getting over 300 uniques daily. At my best, I've gotten over two thousand. Also, I see MANY "lesser" (by lesser, I mean lesser in webfame, fanbase, archive size, and such, not lesser quality) webcomics that DO have articles here. <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v87/Cthon98/Misc/april.jpg" class="external free" title="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v87/Cthon98/Misc/april.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v87/Cthon98/Misc/april.jpg</a> &lt;-- Check it out.

<li><b>Comment</b> As far as I know, it's possible for webcomics to fit the WP:WEB criteria, (<a href="../../../w/h/e/When_I_am_King_bad5.html" title="When I am King">When I am King</a> has non-trivial coverage, <a href="../../../p/v/p/PvP_f9e8.html" title="PvP">PvP</a> won a major award, etc) so "it's impossible to meet the WP:WEB criteria" is not true. Please also note that notability is not a popularity contest, so citing things like fanbase, archive size, "webfame" do not matter. For example, <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Kirk_Kim_a193.html" title="Derek Kirk Kim">Derek Kirk Kim</a>'s Alexa ranking always falls very low (partially because he has a very sporadic update schedule), but he's won three major comic industry awards (Eisner, Harvey, Ignatz), so he gets an article. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 23:02, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It depends. I've seen interviews used as sources before, but different types of interview give different types of fact-checking. For example, the NPR interview in Derek Kirk Kim's article gives a synopsis of who he is, the works he's done, and the awards he's won. But the interview itself, including things he talks about, are primary sources (see <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>). And that's not the only article about him (not to mention he passes other criteria). It also depends on how it's mentioned - you didn't say which radio station interviewed you, and the times it was broadcast, so nobody could (even if they were inclined to) get a transcript or a recording of the interview, so it's still unverifiable right now. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 00:14, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

We <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">prefer</a> someone other the creator of the primary source to create an article on the wikipedia, especially if the editor is new (as it raises suspicion whether the article was created for sake of promotion rather than to help the wikipedia). --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> <sub><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitaphane_f38a.html" title="User talk:Mitaphane">talk</a></sub> 04:12, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Main reason I submitted it was because I saw several other photocomics on there, some of which had only been around half as long as mine. That and the TKT article had mention of my comic, and a link to an article page for Nukeland, but the article page was lacking, so I thought I'd put something there. I really wasn't attempting to do it for self promotion (otherwise I would have included links to comics I felt to be my "best of") - <a href="../../../c/t/h/User%7ECthon98_6cbc.html" title="User:Cthon98">Cthon98</a></p>

<dd>i actually disagree with this. "Weird Al" songs fall into three categories - songs that are direct parodies, songs that are indirect style parodies, and his polkas. In each case, a lot can be said about all three.

The example I tend to use here is that my father would be able to cite chapter and verse of why such-and-such a Rolling Stones B-Side is of massive significance to the band's evolution, but in the general public's eyes that simply isn't the case. Where Al is concerned, I'll grant that his singles are automatically notable, but there really needs to be something significant about his album tracks to warrant them having their own articles. Despite what some contributors have said here, I just don't quite see that it reaches that level. Amusing song, though, no doubt about it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 23:41, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Per nom. DSCWP returns no link on google except wikipedia. Geocity page is down due to bandwitdh limit (how is that even possible?), alternative contain a photo album of obvious fakes with "DSCWP" stamped on. Painkiller is the only poster on google group, and the posts at the blog mirror Painkiller edits on wikipedia so it's safe to assume it's his too. Someone else might bother to check myspace and aol. A little digging on Painkiller supposed myspace (my eyes hurt) account show that he claims to be Toshiro Reinhardt, whom according to himself is the alias of DSCWP's leader. Googling Toshiro Reinhardt links to other blog and fake political parties that I won't link to for fear of giving them undue wikitraffic.

<li>Excuse me, but those pages happen to total over 1,000 hits. This webcomic is highly anticipated, and a website is being developed. There is no reason to delete this article, for this webcomic will be released on its own domain in less than 20 days. This article is being finished tonight, complete with pictures, and will be professional. I have no idea why you would delete a professional article, when little 11-year old girls are making unprofessional character pages for their favorite shows/movies. Your deletion is a personal vendetta, and I know you're the one from the talk page. Good day. Oh yeah, and your Google search is unrealible, since you included quotes.

<li><b>Comment</b> (as a fan and the one who originally started the article, I don't know if I should vote or not). I haven't been able to find any specific notability criteria for webcomics, first of all (and - correct me if I'm mistaken - there's no actual policy regarding notability as a criteria for inclusion), so I had no way of determining whether this deserved an article or not. However, what's wrong with having an article on a non-notable topic so long as the information contained within is verifiable and NPOV? <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECameoAppearance_b323.html" title="User:CameoAppearance">CameoAppearance</a> 07:11, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There's a variety of verifiable things that can be found about me, MacGyverMagic, on the web. Still it's not a good idea to make an article about me, because I didn't do anything of note. You should apply the same to webcomics or any other topic. If a webcomics fails to get any sort of Alexa ranking and Googles badly one can assume it doesn't have enough readers. While we're not paper, we can't include everything that ever existed upon the face of the earth. Allowing every single webcomic in would mean Wikipedia could be used to advertise new comics and WP is not a place to advertise. Webcomic guidelines are included in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. And while notability is heavily debated, a complete lack of it, is generally seen as a valid reason to exlude something. Hope this helps. Try taking a look at Comixpedia. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:31, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Usgnus said that elementary/primary are often kept, regardless of perceived notability. This is true, but not because they should be.

<li><b>Comment</b>: That the article's claim about the circumstances of its recognition as a Flagship School of Promise "appears to be false" seems to be false itself. In fact, the article's statement that "The school was the first elementary school in the county to win the state's Flagship School of Promise" appears to be <a href="http://www.scasa.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=47" class="external text" title="http://www.scasa.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=47" rel="nofollow">true</a>. The awards were first given in 1999 and no Oconee County school won. In 2000, both J. N. Kellett Elementary and West Oak High won in Oconee. Hence the wording "The school was the first elementary school in the county to win the state's Flagship School of Promise". Thus, this explicit claim of notability seems fully supported. Given the size of the state of South Carolina, the number of schools in the state, and the relative poverty of the district compared to others in the state, this seems to be a genuinely notable award and the circumstances of the win at Kellett only make it more notable. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 11:24, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> First I note that you did not respond my point that Silensor cited <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> as a guideline when it is a failed guideline. I presume from that you agree that that qualifies as ridiculous? Part of the reason Silensor's posts are so annoying is that everyone now insists that I go through an spend the time and effort explaining why almost nothing in his essay is relevant for this school. I'll list some of them here. (Maybe I should just make an essay "problems with Silensor's school essay and just post it in in an equally unhelpful and robot-like fashion") But just a few that have problems in general or in this case. 1- most Wikipedians are not eventualists so if we play by consensus this is very weak. 2- under this argument firehouses and town squares and city halls all need their own articles or need to be included. Are we prepared to do this? This argument also conflates keeping the articles with having the content somewhere (possibly merged). An argument for retention of information is not necessarily an argument for keeping an article. 3- why not we imposed such a rule on <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> where the people in question have far more uniqueness that is obvious from a google search than random elementary schools. 4 - close to irrelevant without such a system in place. 5 is the strongest argument for keeping these schools and it is a good one from a pragmatic perspective. However, we don't include small bands or minor academics on the same basis. It isn't clear to me why schools should be different. 6 is almost a strawman argument which I've never actually seen on either <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> discussions or school AfDs. I'm in total agreement with the response there. But since no one has asserted it in this AfD it is irrelevant. 7 Obviously irrelevant to the case at hand since Jimbo was talking about highschools and this is an elementary school. 8 there are independent reasons for including cities (such as the fact that almost any biography article mentions where soemone is born, so there is a consensus that this fact is in some sense notable). In any case if this is a consistency issue I wouldn't mind merging or deleting some small town articles. 9 Is not a grammatical sentence but if it is an argument for consistency then I agree with that. However it isn't at all clear from 9 why the consistency (assuming that's what he means) should be to keep them all. <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> are applied in consistent fashions. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:54, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>JoshuaZ, Silensor's writing of an essay is in fact awesome. When it fell out of the awesome tree, it hit every branch on the way down. If you're making the same argument again and again, there's no reason to write it again and again. Silensor's reasoning on keeping schools (which is, in fact, a field where there's essentially no policy that applies beyond <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, so you have a tremendous amount of latitude) is the same in multiple cases - why would he want to repeat it again and again? Why would we want him to repeat it again and again? Everyone who's arguing for deletion of primary schools is making the same tired argument, even when it clearly doesn't apply (like this school, which has established indisputable notability) - to call him rediculous is <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">just plain mean</a> in addition to being <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiably</a> false. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:00, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>JoshuaZ, you seem to misunderstand the meaning of the word "consensus". You're asking a fellow admin to ignore the opinion of a member of the community when determining consensus. The whole point of requiring consensus is we don't do that. We don't exclude those an elite few disagree with. Now, you're certainly not alone in opposing Wikipedia's policy of requiring consensus to exclude certain topics. Most critics of Wikipedia are appalled that "just anybody" can contribute. They think only a select group of "qualified" people may participate (typically "qualified" means people who think like themself). You obviously agree with them, and think you're one of of those "qualified" people, and Silensor (and presumabely me) is not. If you want to edit an encyclopedia that excludes those you disagree with, then......... --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:45, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Although my initial challenge has been refuted on one point of fact, I do not believe that it fundamentally changes the validity of my argument that the award, unlike the vast majority of awards we use as a criteria for assessing notability, appears to be non-discriminatory. If all schools are given the award, does that make them all sufficiently noteworthy for inclusion? There are often multiple winners in any given county, and therefore its value should not be overstated. The default presumption for elementary schools is unlike secondary schools, and inclusion because an area is poor, or because the segmentation is so small as to make every school unique by definition (and thus notable) is clearly extending the logic to an extreme.

<li><b>Keep</b> per the reasons that are described at <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_Schools_46ba.html" title="User:Silensor/Schools">User:Silensor/Schools</a>. I applaude Silensor for putting together such a page. I have been considering the merits of doing something similar for other topics that I care about and now have a working model. I must say I find it odd that <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> found Silensor's remarks ridiculous. To site a proposed guideline that failed to reach consensus is not ridiculous, given the high bar for concensus. I certainly don't know the inside-baseball scoop on votes. But when I look at the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> page and the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> page I see that both are <b>proposed</b> guidelines--not offical policy. Yet on page after page of these kinds of debates, exclusionists love to reference <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> as though it were writ in stone. At worst, Silensor should have referenceed <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> as a proposed guideline that he agrees with. As for creating a page with his arguments for keeping an article and then pasting it into one of these page--it's a good idea. It saves space and it suggests a consistency of thought regarding the issue. It is esspecially appropriate in this kind of case, because his argument is not about whether this school has sufficeient notabiltiy or not (in which case specific arguments about the school whould be expected). It is a general case argument that notability concerns are mis-construed here. I tend to agree. The whole notablity thing to me is unfortunate--but obviously other people have differing views. On way in which these debates go is what is the proper notability criteria. These argumets are usually <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analogical.html" title="Analogical">analogical</a>. Is the current case more like A (for example Bios and music) with high notablity requiements or more like B (for example Towns) with lower notablity requirements. Reasonable people differ. But I think Silensor grasps an essential point in arguing for very low notablity requirements for elementary schools--they are important part of almost everyone's life for an extended period of time. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> claimed (rather ridiculously, I thought&#160;;)) that if we include articles about elementary schools we must also include articles about every town square and every firehouse. No, the analogy is wrong. Elementary schools play a role in all people's lives far different from that of town squares and firehouses. I think Silensor could have framed this point better. He used the term 'unique', which others rightly pointed can't be the deciding feature. Everything and everyone is unique is some fashion. Rather, what shapes the identity of a school (and thus, in some sense its uniqueness) is the people that go there. The underlying theme in Silensor's argument is that Wikipedia has to connect to things that are importantly relevant in people's lives. I agree with this. Over the life of a school (elementary, high school, college) thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people will pass through, sepending 6 hours a day in the earliest years of their lives. Those schools have a significance to people far more than a band, or a town square, or a fire house. That significance confers a certain notablity. It transcends any awards etc that a school may have won. In this way, schools--all schools are like towns--even the smallest towns. They are a central aspect of our lives (whether we recognize it or not). On this argument, elmentary schools are NOT different from high schools and colleges regarding notablity and should be treated the same. That anyway is what I take from his argument, and I tend to agree. Obviously others disagree. Finally, while I have been critical of JoshuaZ's comments, I commend him for taking the time to create his own page in response to Silensor's arguments. I find more merit in Silensor's claims than JoshuaZ does, but obviously some arguments are stronger and some weaker. But this is exactly the kind of reasoned debate that I think is the Wiki way. JoshuaZ in many ways has the harder path. Not only does he have to deal with the general "meta-level" claims raised by Silensor et.al., but he must also deal with the specific claims from those who fight this battle on the traditional notablity grounds. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 20:54, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is nice to see something which is an actual response to what I posted. However the argument that since everyone is affected by schools is simply irrelevant. If the poeple who are being affected are not notable than whether or not they were affected doesn't matter much. Furthermore having an affect on everyone's lives clearly isn't enough by analogy. Everyone is affected by their parents. That doesn't mean every single parent in the world merits an article. People are changed by their pre-school day-cares. Should we have special articles for each pre-school? Furthermore, I would argue that in many ways people are affected far more by their town halls where all the decisions for schools and other institutions arise. Similarly I can make an argument for inclusion of firehouses- there isn't much more of an effect than what one gets from saving lives and possesions. And firehouses are frequently used as voting locations and town meeting places central points of the democratic tradition that transcend any other issues. They really aren't that different. This is why for things like <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> (despite the fact that profs influence 1000s of students in some ways far more directly than a college itself) we insist in those cases of having real criteria and not this blanket keeping. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:05, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also as to the matter of being on a harder path- I'm not on a harder path- I don't want all schools to be deleted I want real consideration to go into whether or not a school is kept. If a school has specific claims of notability then by all means it should be kept. This is not the case here. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:06, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> There are two points in reponse. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> offers this response to the "affected by" analogy, "having an affect on everyone's lives clearly isn't enough by analogy. Everyone is affected by their parents. That doesn't mean every single parent in the world merits an article." Parent's of course have a huge affect on their one or two or twelve offspring. If we found a parent (foster or otherwise) who looked after 25,000 children over the course of his or her live, that would be notable in of itself. Not just because it was so rare (although that would be true). But because that one person (or that one school) touched so many lives. The second point is the intimacy of the effect. Without a doubt, town halls and fire houses, and police stations (and state and national capitals) all have a profound impact on the quality of lifes. But it is almost always a invisible, distant impact. Many people don't know their city councilman, or state legislators, or even their congressmen or senators. and tend to be quite ignorant (often happily so until something goes wrong) about what these people do. But they understand and remember and think about what their schooling was. There is a day-to-day intimancy that makes schools different from the other cases. Regarding the analogy between professors and schools, there are also two points. <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> is about notability of academics--in a sense a subset of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I have argued that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is the wrong level of analysis for schools The second point is that <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> is of course not policy, but a guideline. I actually think that it is TOO restritive, for essentially the reasons that <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> suggests, "...profs influence 1000s of students in some ways far more directly than a college itself) we insist in those cases of having real criteria and not this blanket keeping."; but with the opposite outcome. I read this as a reason to lower the bar on <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. Again, I find these notablity debates to be so much red-herring. Notablity, as I read <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is a shorthand way of evaluating the veriviability, realability, and NPOV of an article. It can also be used to assess whether the article violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> about not being an indiscriminate collection of information. Those ARE the policies of Wikipedia. No one (that I have seen, but it would be easy to miss) has argued that this article or many like is not verifiable, not based on relaible sources, does not have an NPOV. It does not fall under any of the 7 categories on Not and Indiscrimate Collection of Information. I think where there are real concerns of an article violating THESE polices, notablity can be a way of judging the issue. But too often, debates about notablity overwhelm all other issues. This shifts the debate from the merits of the article vis a vis policy, to debates on the merits vis a vis <b>AN</b> instrument to assess policy. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 21:59, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>- JN Kellett is, no doubt, a small elementary school; however, it has done so much to gain noteriety. The school has become known as a technology model school. The teachers go to extensive training to be the best at what they do. The Red Carpet School award, while applied for by almost every school in the state, is only awarded to those schools who show excellence in student conduct, friendliness, and staff capability at all times. This school deserves to have its own wiki site. To think that every elementary school, fire department, and court house will desire to have its own wiki page is completely unrealistic. Despite the vast spread of the internet, there are still some people who have no idea what a wiki is. I feel that those schools, fire departments or court houses that desire to take the time to make a wiki site, should be allowed to do so. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12.166.131.128 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.166.131.128_0956.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.166.131.128">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It would be ridiculous to delete this article about a surgeon of worldwide acclaim. Shame on anyone who deletes this article. He is even refered to in several other Wikipedia articles. One of the ironies of Wikipedia is that few people do this to puny minor Hollywood psuedo celebrities of little cultural significance. Meanwhile, somebody like Dr. Meltzer, a pioneering surgeon, known worldwide by people who ought to know about him, who spent decades in medical school and perfecting his craft, of important historical significance, gets put on this list by ignorant people without a clue. People need to STAND DOWN from this kind of Wiki behavior unless they can demonstrate some reliable reason for doing so. There is none in this case. Removing this article would violate written Wikipedia policy. Nobody commenting has shown good basis for removing it. I VOTE NO, regarding its removal.

<li><b>delete</b> As much as it pains me to give the black-ball to another Plastic Surgeon, with all due respect, as a practicing Plastic Surgeon myself, I'd submit that Dr. Meltzer is not someone widely known within the field of plastic surgery despite a clear expertise in a <i>very</i> specialized area.

<dd>(after edit conflict) <b>Comment</b> Actually, Dr. Oliver's comment enhances Dr. Meltzer's encyclopedic worth by virtue of being an expert in (as you note) a <i>very specialized area</i>. In an area that is under-represented in Wikipedia (relevant to <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">systematic bias</a>), after the late <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Biber_6a15.html" title="Stanley Biber">Stanley Biber</a>, Dr. Meltzer is probably <i>the</i> most notable SRS surgeon. He is certainly the most prolific in the US. In deleting this article, we sharply decrease Wikipedia's value in being a comprehensive source of knowledge in this area. Unless, of course, the area of <a href="../../../g/l/b/GLBT_c305.html" title="GLBT">GLBT</a> related articles (and in particular transgender-related articles) is, in itself, not worthy of encyclopedic inclusion. Please don't interpret that as a Strawman because I'm not contending that anyone here is arguing that. Rather, I want to emphasize how relevant the Dr. Meltzer article is to Wikipedia's desire to overcome systematic bias and be a free source of knowledge to all--in <b>all</b> areas of encyclopedic merit. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 18:50, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would disagree with your rationale somewhat. If we're to catalog contemporary or historic physicians, I think there must be some threshold as to someone's notability. In medicine you've got to assess their historic signifigance in the field, academic achievment (did they publish extensively or produce influential sentinal papers), professional status (were they leaders in their field) , and consider other ways for which they've gained noteriety. Dr. Meltzer is clearly not going to meet at least the first three of those milestones if you poll other surgeons I'd argue. A "comprehensive" source would certainly contain entries on transgender issues, but featuring a successful surgeon who performs the operation but is otherwise lacking in historic/professional stature is diluting things too much I submit. Again, it pains me to argue against inclusion of a physician someone has felt enough about to profile and this isn't a slight against Dr. Meltzer. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroliver_c7f0.html" title="User:Droliver">Droliver</a> 01:58, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You missed my point entirely, sir. The problem with your rationale above centres around the "otherwise lacking" and "if you poll other surgeons". This is not peer-reviewed, firstly. Secondly, Dr. Meltzer is at the top of his <i>specialised</i> field and is thus notable. Thirdly, when I started the article, it was not that I "felt enough about" the subject, rather that WP was incomplete without mention of Dr. Meltzer for all the reasons I have previously stated. - <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli-oops_e331.html" title="User:Ali-oops">Alison</a><sup><a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAli-oops_b892.html" title="User talk:Ali-oops"><font color="DarkRed">✍</font></a></sup> 03:28, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would concur with Ali. His stature among his peers is only relevant in the regard (in respects to notability) of whether or not he is viewed as an expert in his field. I would think a Biologist specializing in elements of Creationism is not highly noted for "historic/professional stature" among other biologists, however if those biologist concede that he is the "expert creationist" in their field then he has notability in his field for the benefit of a wikipedia. Remember, wikipedia is geared towards the reader and those who will be moved to want to research and look up such information in an encyclopedia. There are far more people interested in who is the expert of SRS surgery then in "who do the plastic surgeons regard highly among their peers". <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 04:23, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

"Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy" -wikipedia gets 30,200. In Google news, "pulmonary thromboendarterectomy" gets 0 hits. "Sexual reassignment" gets 58.

Secondly, take a step back for a moment and think what is more likely to be searched for on Wikipedia. An article on SRS or Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy?

<dd>My point was that SRS is a rare bird and that a Google search is not necessarily a good representation. Any case, I see the cruft (<a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a>) will likely stay-- it seems WP has critical mass of SRS enthusiasts. It's just like how the inventor of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuticles.html" title="Neuticles">Neuticles</a> got their own article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. In my opinion, the only medical procedure more controversial than sex reassignment is abortion. With how much various groups that are a part of the religious right get riled up by the concept of SRS, the surgery is, in my mind more notable than a "Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy" or most other procedures. Given the controversial nature of the operation, I feel that the surgeon that appears responsible for around 50% of the surgeries is notable enough for inclusion. --- <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethling_7cd1.html" title="User:Bethling"><font color="#BB45AA">The Bethling</font></a><a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBethling_721d.html" title="User talk:Bethling"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 05:11, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. The raw vote total is 6-3 Delete. One of the Keeps is Weak. So the numbers say Delete. As to arguments, not meeting <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a strong argument if true. My analysis is that it <i>is</i> true. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> asks for actors to have appeared in "well-known films" and so forth. Regardless of its artistic merit, <i>Brand Upon The Brain!</i> is an indepentt 90-minute black-and-white silent that has, at least not yet, attained the status of "well-known" as far as I can determine. I'm not seeing a counter-argument to overcome the failure to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. So with both numbers and argument favoring Delete, I so close. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 09:41, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>Comment: It was my understanding that the cast links were part of the article stub. (I apologize if that’s not the case. I just thought Wikipedia wouldn’t want “dead links” if they could help it.) I also think there is a misunderstanding as to what the film is or who plays what. When the stub was created random people from the film were listed in alphabetical order. The film is new, but I also thought Wikipedia prided itself on keeping up to the moment and being ever-changing. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.185.104.214 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.185.104.214.html" title="User talk:24.185.104.214">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.185.104.214_910f.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.185.104.214">contribs</a>) 22:34, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>Another Comment: I have in fact seen this film, and can say that this person is in fact a lead role. I am disappointed by people's inability to correctly analyze article information before making snap judgment posts. It saddens me that people jump to the worst before actually reviewing the true information. This article and its information deals with independent film/a Canadian film maker/and film history. If in fact independent film/film festival films, or film history, does no interest you - or you don't know a geat deal about it, I wonder if perhaps you should refrain from posting. Just because information does not fit into what you personally are interested in, or does not show up on YOUR radar, does not in fact mean it should be "chucked out". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.185.104.214 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.185.104.214.html" title="User talk:24.185.104.214">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.185.104.214_910f.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.185.104.214">contribs</a>) 18:44, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li>This is not a dictionary article about a word. It is an encyclopaedia article about a concept in philately, i.e. a particular pairing of stamps. We delete articles on concepts if they are <i>perpetual stubs that cannot be expanded</i> (because no information from sources beyond the stub content actually exists), although in some cases article merger is the better solution. The obvious target for such a merger here would be the as-yet-unwritten article on postage stamp printing, which would explain for starters how cliche replacement can result in tête-bêche pairs. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:07, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

The majority of this article is still about the Y2k problem, with basically one paragraph which is actually about the "year 10,000" problem. As Uncle G's source on this also mentions the possibility of a year 100,000 problem, and as the creation of <a href="../../../y/e/a/Year_100%2C000_problem.html" title="Year 100,000 problem">Year 100,000 problem</a> is therefore possible but undesirable, merging seems the best course to me. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 13:41, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>All modern computer systems store dates as a number of days since January 1, 1900.

The only <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> issue about year 10,000 is that Excel formatting routines can't handle displaying the value.

<li><b>Keep</b> There is another aspect of the phrase 'Year 10,000 Problem' that is not in this article, but could be. We use this phrase in our software development group and I have heard others use it in others groups with an ironic twist. It describes a problem that would require a systematic examination and overhaul of all the code to address a theortical problem whose real significance approaches zero. "That's a Year 10,000 kind of problem--let's leave it for my successor." We also have occasionally used this rather non-ironically to describe in a generic sense any kind of problem that would require large scale code examination for a payoff, that while perhaps important, does not produce new features and is not very sexy. Obviously this by itself would not be the basis for inclusion in the article. But if my description of the phrase had wider currancy and was verifiable, it would provide a non-crystal ball componant for the article that would be useful. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 13:25, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This appears to be a non-notable game, as far as I can tell. It's self=described as a "standalone" so that seems to influence its impact. I've prodded it twice (one time it was seconded), and the prods have been removed without improvement and without discussion. I'm bringing it to the community for further input.

<li>OK, I'm the author, so I'm biased (obviously I'd hope it stays but equally accept the will of the wiki); the only comment I would make is that use if the word 'standalone' is intended simply to note that this is not just a supplement for an existing game, but a game in its own right, albeit using the HeroQuest game engine under license. --Mark Galeotti 14:54, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for now. It is lacking any independent reviews. I have no problem with it coming back if it proves a success and that can be documented. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 22:36, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Fairly notable recent release in the RPG community by a notable RPG author, and the first game apart from HeroQuest to use the HQ system.

<p>I am nominating a series of biographical articles.

Since this is an important topic for the show, I have created a List of top winners in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and copied the information in each article I've listed for deletion. If this nomination fails, then I request the removal of List of top winners in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire as it will be redundant. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> <sub><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitaphane_f38a.html" title="User talk:Mitaphane">talk</a></sub> 07:06, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep/Comment</b>. I don't think a mass nomination is appropriate because not all of these persons are on the same footing. In particular, it seems to me that Carpenter achieved bona fide renown and in addition was involved in more than one event likely covered by the press. My keep applies to Carpenter's article. In addition, I'd like to comment that I'm not sure I see how a list of non-notable people would be worthy of an article. If these articles are deleted, the newly created list article should also be deleted. Finally, I think the tactic being employed here is ill-advised and against the spirit of AfD. It creates a de facto referendum on whether content should be presented in one form or another instead of focusing debate on the suitability of content for this encyclopedia. AfD should be about content, not form. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 08:12, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (nominate only the non-notables of the list). A spot check also produces <i>Nancy Christy was the <b>first woman</b> (May 8, 2003) to win the top ($1,000,000) prize on the United States game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.</i> You can say what you want, but to be the first woman to do something, is notable (even if it's a bloody game show) I don't think a mass nomination is in order here either. There's at least two people in this list who deserve an article in my view and if someone doesn't deserve their own article, it doesn't neccesarily mean a list of WWTBAM winners is not notable. This needs a different approach. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 08:49, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><s><b>Keep all</b>. While Wikipedia isn't an indiscriminate source of information, neither is it a paper encyclopedia. Major winners of gameshows should be notable enough for inclusion. <b><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrisvegas_f939.html" title="User:Brisvegas">Brisv</a><i><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrisvegas_Esperanza_b205.html" title="User:Brisvegas/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a></i><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrisvegas_c8ec.html" title="User talk:Brisvegas"><font color="red">gas</font></a></b> 09:39, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</s> After mulling over some more, I figure that since the entries would still be listed, it makes no major diifference. Changed vote to <b>neutral</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> the Carpenter page at least, <b>Listify</b> the others. Carpenter's WWTBAM victory was very notable in it's own right, (citing press coverage.) The other winners may be notable enough to list, but not on their own page in my opinion. AfD Precedent says spelling bee winners et. al. are considered notable. It should be noted that Carpenter's first AfD nomination resulted in a No Consensus. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk">Roninbk</a> 12:14, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Each article should have their notability judged individually. For example, Bob House is not notable for anything except winning on the show, while <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Olmstead_f48c.html" title="Kevin Olmstead">Kevin Olmstead</a> is notable not only for winning the show, but for the fact for a long period he held the record for the highest winnings on a game show, and is also a founder of <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Academic_Quiz_Tournaments_ff4a.html" title="National Academic Quiz Tournaments">National Academic Quiz Tournaments</a>.--<a href="../../../n/o/n/User%7ENonpareility_99db.html" title="User:Nonpareility">Nonpareility</a> 14:21, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I vote keep for all (as independant articles) with varying levels of conviction. <b>Strong keep</b> for Carpenter, as he was a genuine celebrity for a few months; <b>keep</b> Olmstead, for reasons listed above; <b>keep</b> Cullen due to his success on multiple game shows (he was also part of Jeopardy's Ultimate Tournament of Champions); <b>weak keep</b> for all the rest. Who Wants to be a Millionaire was <i>really</i> popular in its prime, and it has always had a good sense of its own history (compared to shows like Wheel of Fortune, which never talk about their past contestants). I think we can spare some space for every million-dollar winner. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 14:58, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete]</b>Their 15 minutes of fame are over unless the TV exposure led to some notable carrer in movies, TV, or whatever which itself makes them notable. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 01:18, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I have to agree that a mass nomination is not appropriate here. There is no question to me that Carpenter (since he was the first winner) and Olmstead (since he held a game show record for a few years) should have their own pages. While I'm not sure that each and every winner should have their own page, I do think every page should be decided individually.--Jatterb 17:42, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I also agree mass nomination is inappropriate, and Carpenter and Olmstead should definitely be kept, with the others weakly kept. (Many of the articles include substantial information on the million-dollar question, which, in my view, is borderline encyclopedic.) I did suggest redirection for non-notable people (or, I should have implied, for biographies that don't state much more than what they are notable for) in the talk page for Kim Hunt. Hunt could have been redirected to <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire_%28US_game_show%29_de5d.html" title="Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)</a> if article content was an issue.

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> (<b>Neutral</b>; see below). This is more something that should be in the film entries themselves. This list is not even restricted to a specific plot. Any plot similar to another will do. More focussed lists like List of animated films about animals (to include Madagascar, The Wild, Shark Tale, AntZ, A Bug's Life and Finding Nemo) for example would work much better. The lack of focus means it's a indiscriminate collection of facts, which WP is not. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 08:30, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's a pretty interesting collection of trivia, but it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and I think it also qualifies as an "unmaintainable list." The criteria is so vague, we could probably put nearly every movie ever made on it, if we sat down and thought about it. It lists two films about Wyatt Earp as having similar plots, but you could say that about any two biographical movies about the same person. Given the loose criteria, why not include the various film versions of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> -- and others based on them (ie. <i>West side Story</i>)? As well as the hundreds of other films based on Shakespeare, mythology, the Bible? They would certainly qualify as "having a similar plot." And that way lies madness...or a fun party game.

<li>The introduction to the article states that what it is documenting here is the phenomenon of competing studios either coincidentally or deliberately releasing movies with very similar premises, at the same time (e.g. in the same season, or year).

Also, when Joe O'Donoghue wrote his anti-Newsom poem at Beyond Chron that speculated that the Mayor was gay, the Board of Supervisors responded by &lt;a href="<a href="http://www.sfweekly.com/Issues/2005-06-29/news/smith.html" class="external free" title="http://www.sfweekly.com/Issues/2005-06-29/news/smith.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfweekly.com/Issues/2005-06-29/news/smith.html</a>"&gt;censuring Joe O'Donoghue.&lt;/a&gt;</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The difference, Mr Ferguson, is that the articles on ANSYS and Oracle are not written by anybody connected with the companies in question. While admittedly, you might not be related with CD-adapco, the fact that this is your first edit of the Wikipedia strongly suggests this opinion. Wikipedia is not an advertising medium.

<p>Simply put, I don't know what to make of this. That the manuscript exists is largely backed up via the references provided (I'll take BookCrossing as a source independent of the subject of the article). That it's notable is somewhat more debatable, given that it "is not in bookshops yet" and therefore appears to be a 100-page manuscript floating around the place. To give credit where credit is due, this began life as what looked like a Dan Brown-inspired viral-marketing page and now makes a lot more sense. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 09:40, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Forgive me please if this is the wrong method to comment. Unlock Reality has reported readers in Canada, California, The Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, The Isle of Man, Guadaloupe, Switzerland, and probably a few more. It is a Bookcrossing Success of major magnitude, if nothing else.
<p>It has spawned over 20,000 websites which makes it a phenomenon of our times. I mean what else do you know which is unpublished which is getting that kind of attention. These are points I ask you to consider.</p>

<li>This article appears to be part of a campaign of stealth advertising to publicize a forthcoming book. The claim about 20,000 web sites made above is wholly unsubstantiated. (At best, it is the substitution of counting Google hits for actual research.) The only mentions of this manuscript (which is improbably both an "old manuscript" and yet "copyrighted") are on the book's own vanity web site, on self-submission web sites, and on press-release web sites such as PressBox (where the contact information for the press releases refers back to the self-submission web sites). I've yet to find <i>anything at all</i> that isn't part of this self-publicity drive. The only evidence that this manuscript is getting any attention at all is published on those web sites, and thus could be completely manufactured <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astroturfing.html" title="Astroturfing">astroturfing</a> for all that anyone can tell.

<li>Response, the link I added to the page represents a considerable number of readers from around the world, each with a link to their profile on Care2 and contactable through their messaging service. The 20,000 or so recorded hits on Google is a fact in itself and reflects an interest in the topic. The link to websites and discussion groups which is on the page, if followed lead to many individual’s contributions, all of whom showed an interest. To suggest this is all manufactured is frankly ridiculous. These are all very real people who have enjoyed this work, and are worthy to be respected as researchers in their own right. Especially those who took the time to make actual reports.

<li>The "20,000 or so recorded hits on Google" are not research, and are merely occasions where the two words "unlock" and "reality" occur in succession on a web page.

<li>Reliable Sources. Here you are presented with reports from the general public who have first hand experience of reading this text. That would be a reliable enough source in a court of law, so why not here? Here we have not one or two witnesses, so to speak, but a considerable number, and as I said, on the Care2 site, these are linked with people’s profiles, allowing each to be contacted through the messaging service. These are eyewitness accounts of people's experience with the text. It is difficult to judge these unreliable, while not being insulting to them.
<p>Apart from that, the link unlockreality.org was produced to show participation by the public, and if followed leads to many website blogs stories and discussions. The Care2 group alone has over 3,000 members yet we have Uncle G telling us "The only evidence that this manuscript is getting any attention at all is published on those web sites." With respect, surely these 3,000 or so members on one of these sites is evidence that this manuscript is getting real attention.</p>
<p>I don't think anyone is daring to say the text does not exist.</p>
<p>Through the method provided by Bookcrossing, this text has made its way round the world. That is noteworthy. People from all round the globe are confirming that fact, and that evidence has been presented here. Can we dismiss that?</p>
<p>We go to medical experts to get a medical opinion and you would accept that as reliable here, No? Well Unlock Reality is a book, and it has gone to book readers for its opinions. These people are witness to its existence, its travels, and its value in their opinion. That is the evidence they bring to this table.</p>
<p>I love what you are doing here by the way. This is an excellent project.</p>

<li><i>Here you are presented with reports from the general public who have first hand experience of reading this text.</i> — No. What we are presented with are a number of postings on a web site, whose authorships we have no way of determining.
<p><i>The Care2 group alone has over 3,000 members</i> — Given that the very first message from one of those "members" on the group's main page is "my name is barbara Smith i like to play bowls out side and go to bingo and go over sease for holidays by the way i ane not veary good at spelling i wuld like to meet inturesting pople so i cane get to know them reley well", the membership count of the group is clearly not a relevant metric. Counting the number of purported people on the page that you actually linked to gives a number that is a couple of orders of magnitude smaller: 22. But as with all such discussion fora, we have no way to know that these are in fact real people at all. Even if they were, there's the fact that those are the very same people that have submitted press releases about this book to PressBox and other web sites, to take into account.</p>
<p><i>People from all round the globe are confirming that fact</i> — No, they actually aren't. There's nothing outside of the vanity and self-submission web sites, and even they tell us that there's no book yet. There's nothing to indicate that this isn't a campaign of stealth advertising to publicize a forthcoming book. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:27, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

As I see it what is happening here is a search for independent conformation of the fact that there is genuinely a movement of interest behind the text Unlock Reality (UR) and that it is a genuine publication. I argue that the below links to the records of a court case in the UK’s High Court and several resulting articles from different independent news outlets are such conformation.</p>
<p>The case involved someone attempting to infringe the copy write of Unlock Reality (UR) held by Iindividual Self-Discovery Trust and place it without their permission on the Internet in order to make a profit. Such an attempt in of it self is proof of a wide spread interest. The subsequent case, proof of the existense of the Iindividual Self-Discovery Trust and a broad interest in UR the numerous articles about the court case further proof.</p>

Uncle G, your decision to quote a random profile disappoints me. Here it is again:</p>
<p>The Care2 group alone has over 3,000 members — Given that the very first message from one of those "members" on the group's main page is "my name is barbara Smith i like to play bowls out side and go to bingo and go over sease for holidays by the way i ane not veary good at spelling i wuld like to meet inturesting pople so i cane get to know them reley well"</p>
<p>Not sure where you found this, but I suggest your point would have carried more weight if you had selected one of the people reporting on reading the text in question. Say I discovered that Barbara Smith whom you quote is actually a member here too, what would that say about this group? Nothing I should think.</p>
<p>The court papers, now that is a different story.</p>
<p>signed Tmonome Sept 15th</p>
<p><br />
Been studying your definitions and have a couple of questions, which might help me to make the article better. This one for instance:</p>
<p>Your reference says: “An opinion is a view that someone holds, the content of which may or may not be verifiable. However, that a certain person or group expressed a certain opinion is a fact (that is, it is true that the person expressed the opinion) and it may be included in Wikipedia if it can be verified; that is, if you can cite a good source showing that the person or group expressed the opinion.”</p>
<p>Now it appears to me that people’s opinion of Unlock Reality is a vital fact to be proven here. Uncle G tells us there are 22 people in the group I linked to, who express an opinion after claiming to have read the text, but he also points out these might not be real people.</p>
<p>I respond by pointing out that this particular group have links to their profiles, and can be contacted through the Care2 messaging service. When you ask for proof, what exactly would satisfy this situation? Who would it take to make contact with enough of these 22 people to establish the fact?</p>
<p>And when we see 3,000 members of a group dedicated to the text in question, while it is possible for memberships to be duplicated, is it fair to assume that none of these people are real?</p>
<p>And when a search turns up over 22,000 hits when you Google the texts name, and at least 80% of the entries in the top 100 are directly related to the text, can we really assume all of these are fabricated? Even in a court of law, which employs the strictest sense of justice, we hear about reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>We have evidence from British High Court papers that The Individuals Self-Discovery Trust exists as an entity recognised by the court. Those papers also prove the court accepted their connection with the text enough to make a ruling in their favour. The fact that someone felt it was worth the effort and expense in breaching this copyright, indicates there must be a demand making it worth that risk.</p>
<p>Given the verifications provided by the courts, is it reasonable to conclude that all the interest which we see in Unlock Reality is fabricated?</p>
<p>Here is a test for you. Just look at the Care2 site, go to the archives, and see how long it takes you to count the postings in each thread, and while you are there, see the variety and ask yourself what manner of person could fabricate all this?</p>
<p>We are being asked to discredit comments from this site because it may have all been fabricated. I say looking at the actual evidence, the site itself, this is not a reasonable conclusion any reasonable person could possibly come to. And if I am right on this, the article should stay to be improved upon. <b>No Deletion.</b></p>

<p>Just a note to say I have added the high court references, as I conquer these are vital to the article.</p>
<p>I note you have an article in progress about the Course in Miracles. This was also a book distributed in manuscript form for a time, which had a similar enthusiastic following. At which point did it become worthy of consideration here? Any book or music or work of art might benefit from a mention here, but does that fact exclude admission? I think not, as I find many things listed here which can be bought. So are we saying Unlock Reality has to be in the best sellers list to warrant inclusion? That would be like saying, far from being against supporting organised promotions, you actually award the ones who are successful.</p>
<p>I’m sure admin will have noted I personally have done my best to take advice and bring this article up to the standard required. I see something unusual happening here, something real, which I feel deserves a mention. I look to the discretion you have to not exclude this.</p>
<p><br />
The measure that the book satisfies is that it is real, and it is of interest. There is sufficient evidence presented in the article to prove that in any court, and indeed one High Court has already ruled on it.</p>

<dd>Regarding the article on <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_e1cf.html" title="A Course in Miracles">A Course in Miracles</a>, I'd suggest the notability would stem from such things as the commercial success of the book (including foreign language translations), the fact that it has been controversial (and not just as a result of litigation) and possibly even the way in which it has integrated itself into pop culture. "Unlock Reality" may well end up achieving all these and more, but until it has then I'm not sure it's a fair comparison. Additionally, the fact that one specific article on a similar topic exists doesn't necessarily mean that any given article on the same topic need to exist. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 08:41, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Reasons given for Course in Miracles inclusion:</p>
<p>commercial success</p>
<p>has been controversial</p>
<p>has integrated itself into pop culture</p>
<p>Boiled down, what makes something suitable for inclusion in an encyclopaedia is:</p>
<p>It exists</p>
<p>It is of interest</p>
<p>If one is actually looking at this from a neutral point of view, we are not allowed to judge the level of interest, but merely need to establish it is there to satisfy the criteria. IMHO</p>

<p>I would like to object to the repeated use of the word astroturfing in describing activity surrounding Unlock Reality. Having read the article on astroturfing I must point out that there has been no evidence put forward to indicate in any way that such a practice is taking place. No evidence to indicate that any of the people showing support are other than genuine individuals.</p>
<p>Genuine Grassroots movements tend to follow the path of least expense, it would appear, and that makes sense, if you think about it. Just because astroturfing efforts attempt to mimic these movements by following similar paths, that does not give you or anyone the right to brand something phoney or dishonest, with no evidence to back you up. That is not assuming good faith in any way.</p>
<p>When I say: “People from all round the globe are confirming that fact” referring to the books travels — Uncle G replies “No, they actually aren't.”</p>
<p>It is fully wrong for him to say that. He has no proof to deny this is happening. Just because he does not accept the sources does not mean it is not happening or that he can declare it is not happening. Actually they are, Uncle G.</p>
<p>Also Uncle G tells us:</p>
<p>“What we are presented with are a number of postings on a web site, whose authorships we have no way of determining.”</p>
<p>That is not strictly true either. It has been mentioned several times that each of the names which would confirm the books far travels have links to profiles. Each person could be contacted and asked to send a postcard whose postmark would confirm their location. Like I have heard said here, we have lots of time, and the cost of messaging these people is free. I’m surprised that none of you who are assuming good faith and seeing this from a neutral angle are making any suggestions to help me here.</p>
<p>I see a lot of Deletes, but we are thin on the ground for positive suggestions. No one with some imagination here who can put what is happening in a way that reflects what is known and satisfies your criteria? There is a lot there to just dismiss out of hand. I would be grateful for your help.</p>

“Dear Mister Galileo the fact that not one single established scientist has bought your arguments should be a sign to you. The fact that you have done so much scientific activity without any notice at all from Reliable Sources is in itself suspicious, and is a pattern we have seen before. We do not have to prove that the sun orbits the earth. You have to prove that it is the other way around……….”</p>
<p>The validity of reasoning and the collaborating evidence presented constitute the salient pieces of this discussion, surly not who is presenting them. How does one become an ‘established Wikipedia editor’ – I presume by putting forward sound arguments, thus the un-established become the established. Why not have just a few editors in a closed room? Because doing it in the open and letting anyone who wants to particapate allows the ‘un-established’ to be heard also. I find the overt snobbery being displayed here quite something.</p>
<p>It is written above that the burden lies with those who wish to establish that Unlock Reality is notable.</p>
<p>Well it would appear that it is. The Dalai Lama has a copy as does the Arch Bishop of Canterbury. These two men represent the religious and spiritual concerns of countless millions of people. Millions of people who take notice – or find notable – what these men do and read.</p>
<p>The Internet is awash with sites, members and postings, each one representing someone taking note of UR, i.e. finding it notable. The idea that this vast number of entries is the work of one person or group is just absurd. We are not talking about 5 or 10, there are literally tens of thousands.</p>
<p>There are several (at lest eight I have counted) newspaper stories about Unlock Reality's High Court case – when was the last time you saw 1 newspaper article on an un-notable story – let alone 8?</p>
<p>Un-notable hey?</p>
<p>Tony H - 16/09/06</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
What I feel makes this text notable now is that is has gone as far as it has in manuscript form. There is nothing which even comes close to this.</p>
<p>We could take a few steps and confirm the books travels round the world, or rather than dismiss this altogether, take a neutral view of the internet activity for a moment, by seeing it as a fact that there is a huge amount about this which appears on the internet, which by its nature cannot be fully confirmed but also cannot be ignored, then we still have pictures with exact times and place of very notable people, the Dalai Lama and The Arch Bishop of Canterbury, considering the work, and a High Court Judge ruling with several offical news stories filed as my friend Tony mentions.</p>
<p>We live in a world where, internet phenomena exists as a fact. More and more, not less and less things will be affected by the many free avenues the internet provides, and respectfully, you should have a way to deal with that which is actually neutral to reflect your stated philosophy.</p>
<p>People using the public forums which the internet provides are expressing their right to free speech, and just because some might abuse this, that does not make it right to dismiss the majority of genuine people expressing their views. If you don't feel these voices are worth considering you might want to ask yourself why Rupert Murdoch recently spent $580 million to buy Myspace?</p>
<p>And indeed, why is Myspace included in Wikipedia as it is soley comprised of "a number of postings on a web site, whose authorships we have no way of determining." as Uncle G puts it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace</a></p>
<p>You might argue that the sheer number of entries on Myspace makes it unlikely that they are all fabricated, which is exactly the same arguement we are making for UR. And when you consider the resources available to someone at Mr Murdoch level, we might well ask which is the stronger arguement of these two.</p>
<p>This is a reality you have to deal with if you really do intend to look at things in a neutral way, not something you can just brush away because it is not perfect. These thousands of internet entries may not carry full weight, but they must be allowed to carry some weight in the light of what supports them.</p>
<p>There is a lot being said here, and I trust it will all be considered.</p>

<dd>The argument regarding MySpace is, with respect, utterly fallacious. The article on the site is (or at least should be) about the <i>site</i> itself, rather than anything which is on it. Say what you want about lonely teenagers writing about their existential angst and how such-and-such a band is the coolest thing on the planet, but the site has become notable for a variety of reasons. Not the least of these is the fact that it is, to put it mildly, <i>massive</i> in terms of numbers of users.</dd>
<dd>What we're <i>not</i> in the business of, though, is treating someone or something's MySpace page as proof of anything much beyond their existence. Keep an eye on the AfD listings for a few days and you'll see a series of unsigned bands and wannabe actors having their pages nominated for deletion. Those arguing that the article should be kept will frequently cite a MySpace page.</dd>
<dd>In other words, the site itself is notable but everyone who has a page on it is almost certainly not so. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>)</dd>

<p><br />
I contend that ‘Notable’ means, ‘worthy of note: significant, interesting, or unusual enough to deserve attention or to be recorded’.</p>
<p>There is an inherent problem here, part of what it is to be ‘notable’ is to be unusual. Unusual entails ‘out of the ordinary’, ‘different to the norm’ or even unique (as may be the case with UR).</p>
<p>The point is that UR’s notability is inextricable linked to it’s unusual nature, which in tuАrn means that ‘similar examples’ or parallels with pervious decisions taken on this site and examples are irrelevant and will be hard to find and if found would serve to show it to be less notable.</p>
<p>Therefore I contend that those who say UR is not notable should have to produce similar examples of unpublished books with a list of attributes comparable to an international following, thousands of websites, getting attention from world spiritual leaders and at the centre of a high court action, in order to establish that UR is mundane/ordinary and not ‘notable’.</p>

<p>I note that the Wikipedia test for notability for people is also recommended for use with books.</p>
<p>From previous comments I read here it appears I wrongly assumed that Unlock Reality’s relatively high Google hit count was not to be considered in determining its notability. I see now that it is an alternative factor recmmended which can be used, which you have dedicated a page to explaining, entitled the Wikipedia Search Engine Test, also referred to as the Google Test -- Does the subject get lots of distinguishable hits on Google or another well known search mechanism?</p>

<p>Excuse me Guy.</p>
<p>Your site provides a means for me to tell you why I feel this topic is suitable under your terms to be included in your publication, and now you are criticising me for making use of it. Aren’t you meant to be presuming good faith, or did I just imagine reading that here somehwere?</p>

<li><b>Comment: <i>to Tmonome</i></b> Make the argument once, and concisely. Personally, you're either trying to win by either fatiguing us into not reading through the AfD or by spewing an <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proof_by_verbosity.html" title="Proof by verbosity">Argumentum verbosium</a> and that just makes me and other editors sick. You don't need to defend something over and over again and then harass people who vote against what you think with lengthy speeches for the lost cause of trying to change their minds. Most people won't read what you have to say anyway if you can't say it in less than a usual paragraph. And most people don't change their minds, much less give an AfD a second thought. Vote, give a brief discussion of why you voted the way you voted, and move on. Oh...learn how to format your contributions to a discussion too. Because you screw up the aesthetics and flow of a page with an unwieldy, unformatted post like you've spewed (repeatedly) above. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 07:19, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Respectfully, it is not my book. The remainder of what you say may be true, but many feel this manuscript has done more than anything in manuscript form before it, and deserves a place here now. Notability is about being unusual not just being famous. It is unusual now. I invite you to provide an example of something comparable to prove me wrong.</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. The odd focus can probably be rectified with a title change (to what? Not sure, but it would need to either be stricter on what is defined as "tropical" to disclude Australia, Iran and others or be more inclusive so's to get them in). Citations shouldn't be too hard to find, since there are (I presume) already articles on the various countries named. As for the fact that it's a magnet for nasty things, so is at least 25% of the entire 'pedia. This one hasn't yet attracted anything untoward that I can see. That all being said, the fact remains that there's already articles on "[Country] at the [Year] Winter Olympics", so perhaps this is superfluous. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 11:06, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. As per above. It is a dull topic, and there is unlikely to be many widely available sources for this topic to be written to an encylopedic standard.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. One of my biggest pet peeves on Wikipedia are articles with what the nom calls an arbitrary focus, but I'm not sure this qualifies. The idea is that countries that basically don't have a winter still have athletes that compete in the Winter Games is an interesting one that should be covered somewhere, but since its such a minor topic anything more than a sentence would mess up the balance of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_Olympic_Games_94a5.html" title="Winter Olympic Games">Winter Olympic Games</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom and Pavel Vozenilek. Silly, misleading unencyclopedic trivia "gee whiz" article. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. There is no obvious reason why a country without marked winter seasons or in generally warmer climates can't have people expert in winter sports (you don't even have to have mountains). Skiing is huge in Iran (which is not "tropical" anyway). It rarely snows in London, does this mean that its odd to have skiers in London etc etc. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:39, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - "There is no obvious reason why a country without marked winter seasons or in generally warmer climates can't have people expert in winter sports (you don't even have to have mountains)." - yes there is.

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. If I have counted correctly, discounting assumed puppets and single-purpose accounts, the raw totals are 6-2 Delete. That does not include the nominator, who changed his position to Keep. So on to the arguments. While I might not count the "votes" of single-purpose editors, I will give account to their arguments, if cogent. In favor of deletion, the point is made that , basically, he fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. In reply these points are made: (1) He was, at least for a while, a regular columnist for the daily newspaper in a small-to-medium-sized American city. (2) He has a website, which apparently attracts enough attention to get him interviewed on NPR. (3) He's had a book published by Brigham Young University, which has to be considered a publisher of some note. (4) He's got some comedy records, which while apparently self-published have gotten airplay on <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Demento_8e58.html" title="Doctor Demento">Doctor Demento</a> which is a nationally syndicated show. (5) His site was noted in PC Magazine as one of the best 99 undiscovered websited6</p>
<p>Taken together, those are reasonably strong arguments. It's true that the only one of these that might meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is "well known and independent award" -- one could make that case that getting on PC Magazine's "best 99 undiscovered websites" is an independent award of a sort by a notable magazine. On the hand, there were 98 other "winners", so that's questionable. Basically, I can't see that he meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. But WP:BIO "is not intended to be an exclusionary list".</p>
<p>Back to the commentors, we see a couple of editors basing their comments on verification. The article may have been partly rewritten when they made their votes, but anyway the NPR interview and the PC magazine bit seem to verify much of his story. His book is on Amazon (albeit out of print). So the no-verification arguments may be discounted, somewhat.</p>
<p>Still, in spite of the fact that the Keep position does make a good argument, I don't see it as <i>enough</i> stronger for me to discount that after all, of eight real commentors, six think the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 19:19, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Who is this guy? Perhaps a perusal of his brief but thoroughly enlightening official biography, posted on his website in handy color-coded timeline form will answer your question. <a href="http://www.ericdsnider.com/misc/the-official-biography-of-eric-d-snider/" class="external text" title="http://www.ericdsnider.com/misc/the-official-biography-of-eric-d-snider/" rel="nofollow">(bio)</a> As you can see, he's done a lot more than insult somebody on the radio. That's not even what he does. His founding of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_University_4ac9.html" title="Brigham Young University">Brigham Young University</a>'s first comedy troupe, the now-defunct Garrens (1993-2001) and his weekly humor column, "Snide Remarks," (still published weekly on his website, and read by hundreds, if not thousands, of subscribers) easily made him the most well-known--and controversial--figure on that campus in the late 1990s. He is still very well-known in certain circles. If his brother hadn't created his Wikipedia entry, I was thinking about doing it--maybe eventually, if I ever got around to it.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Eric may not be the most celebrated celebrity on the big screen but he sure does know how to make fun of them. I feel that someone who has published as much as him and in as many mediums as him deserves an entry. His writings have appeared in publications throughout the state of Utah, California, and (I think) Oregon. His movie reviews have been published on credible websites and he has been featured fairly regularly on the radio. His columns are fantastic, his movie reviews are entertaining and informative and his music is hilarious.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The subject's name sounds somewhat familiar, but this article does not emphasize strongly enough the activities which would have placed Snider before a national audience.

<li>Mr. Snider is an established performer and writer with a recognizable influence. As an up-and-coming artist with an ever-growing following, the matter of his being a public figure is unquestionable. The biographic details of the article are relevant to illustrate the genesis of the artist's perspective. I find the article unbiased and encyclopedic in nature and in no violation of Wikipedia policy. <b>Recommend to keep</b>. A. Amini 14:48, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'll second this - "If Encyclopedia Britannica and Who's Who are your standards, you've got a lot more deleting to do." What makes Wikipedia great is its inclusion of various miscellany including TV shows, bands and much more obscure stuff than Eric Snider. He is a prolific writer, film reviewer, parodist and humorist. Absolutely no reason he shouldn't have a page here, as long as the information provided is accurate.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I don't see how people can say that he isn't a notable person yet the publications that he writes for are He currently writes movie reviews for HollywoodBitchslap.com as well as RottenTomatoes.com. Both sites are credible sources for movie reviews, both sites have entries here on the Wikipedia and Hollywood Bitchslap's entry even lists him on their page as one of their author's. He may not have attained the fame of hollywood movie stars but he does have a fairly large fan following. The great thing about the Wikipedia as was mentioned before is that you can learn about anything. I understand removing entries for people that haven't accomplished much and create their own entry but removing an entry for a writer who has accomplished so much. He has recorded CD's and yes people bought them. He has published his humor columns in books as well ane believe it or not, they sold too. Eric is a notable writer, possibly the only one that I read on a regular basis.--Jasonlesliewright 05:22, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - I haven't contributed a lot to Wikipedia, but I wanted to weigh in here anyway. For what it's worth, he's had several appearances on Dr. Demento, was interviewed on "On the Media" on NPR and his Web site was recommended in PC Magazine as one of the Top 98 undiscovered. If that doesn't qualify him for inclusion, so be it. Nonetheless, I vote for the site to remain.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Subject is a published author and musician, has received national attention from three different media outlets (USA Today, NPR, and PC Magazine), has a following that extends beyond friends and family, and caused enough of a stir with the "Junket Whore" article to be banned from all future press screenings by Paramount Studios.

<li>I object to the deletion notice because I don't see what criteria my article meets that would warrant it being deleted. I am an illustrator with several published books, awards and reviews. This is in common with most of the other illustrators on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_illustrators.html" title="List of illustrators">List_of_illustrators</a> page. Are they all going to be deleted?
<p>I understand that it would be better if someone else had written the article, but all the information on it is simple fact, I'm not making any claims I can't back up, so the information would be the same if someone else typed it.</p>
<p>My article will only be found by people browsing the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_illustrators.html" title="List of illustrators">List of illustrators</a> page, who would, presumably be looking for examples of illustrators, unless that page too is to be deleted?. I myself found several interesting illustrator pages with information I hadn't seen before. Is it impossible to believe other might do the same and find my page interesting and informative.</p>
<p>This was my first foray into Wikipedia and I had thought I would continue to help it expand, sadly I'm not so sure now.</p>
<p>Jagosilver 19:13, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
</li>
<li>Thank you for replying, I have removed the Biography and Methods sections from the article as I can see they are not encyclopedic enough, or appropriate for Wikipedia.
<p>However, the information that is left in the article is almost identical in terms of content to <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Staake_eeff.html" title="Bob Staake">Bob Staake</a>'s page for example. If my article is still deleted it would seem that the only reason for this would be the name of the user who creates the page. This seems like a very weak basis for a decision to be based on. Presumably the user who created the <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Staake_eeff.html" title="Bob Staake">Bob Staake</a> page could well be Bob himself, or his aunty, as the user in question has not used their real name for a username.</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It may seem trivial to some, but O&amp;A take their relationships with rivals and former friends very seriously, and they often require so much explanation and detail that would take too much space on O&amp;A's wiki page. O&amp;A themselves have stated that their show is like a soap opera with relationships budding, growing, souring, falling apart, and so on. This page helps explain and inform these relationships to new listeners unfamiliar with O&amp;A's show, old listeners who have lost track of these relationships (many still don't know why Dice is no longer a friend of the show because his falling-out is a very recent event), and other inquisitive minds. Considering O&amp;A's recent return to terrestrial radio and the fact that their show is being syndicated to new cities just about every month now, there are more and more people just discovering their show who will want to know the background of the show, including these relationships. —GLENN THE TOOL 22:27, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename</b> and <b>Keep</b>. Something like 'Boil over (sexual connotation)' would make it clear that the article was NOT about when water at 212°F over-flows a pot. The term is well known in the Detroit area.

<p>"Keep article" Not only is the term widely known in the Metro-Detroit area, but if you google it you will find many references to the term Boil Over</p>

<li><i><b>DO NOT DELETE</b></i> This article clearly demonstrates that Samuel Green has been and will continue to be an influential personality both in the field of rap music and in the domain of Zionist activism. Green's popularity is wide and expanding: his web presence is substantial, his radio show is widely popular, and he has received the assistance and endorsement of many very notable musicians and Jewish leaders. Clearly, the Wikipedia-reading public deserves to know about Samuel Green, his music, and his politics as presented in this article. --66.65.185.70 13:04, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>DON'T DELETE</b> In addition to Samuel Green's many high-profile radio guests, note Samuel Green's significant coverage in the popular press: (list from his website)</li>

<p>'Rapping For Our Rights' - London Jewish News, 18.01.02</p>
<p>'Hip Hop Home' - Ha'aretz, 04.01.02</p>
<p>Also, Samuel Green passes the notability test for musicians in multiple ways: First, he has a weekly two hour radio program (thus, he receives more than the required media exposure time.) In this vein, his radio program's podcast is quite popular as per Apple subscription rankings. Furthermore, he has been the subject of a BBC biography program. Additionally, Green has created something of a new genre with his politically charged rap music; "The Zionist Rapper" is a novel phenomenon.</p>
<p>Green's poor performance in the "Google test" is simply the result of the commonality of his name (as any "John Smith" would fail this test as well).</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Other executives of YBF were VfDed a while ago - see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ben_Pickering_ad74.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ben Pickering">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ben Pickering</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Greg_Smith_%28politician%29_1f65.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Greg Smith (politician)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Greg Smith (politician)</a>. The article does not cover these claims to be a media commentator (or established just to what extent) or why YBF is important that its executives count as notable in their own right. I agree one doesn't have to be an MP or devolved assembly member to be notable in politics but that does not in itself make everyone notable. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 09:55, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> trying to separate the debate on the AfD itself from all the personal abuse and lack of understanding of Wikipedia practices. For a page to exist in Wikipedia it must prove inherent notability in itself. Claims about being "a media commentator" on an AfD page are not enough - if this is relevant information and makes the subject notable, <a href="../../../b/e/_/WP%7EBe_Bold_2c3b.html" title="WP:Be Bold">be bold</a> and add the information to the page. In regards the role of YBF you need to prove not that the organisation is notable (that's a case for any AfD on it, for the record I would support keeping that article) but that being the executive of it confers notability on the individual. As I note above other executives have had pages created on Wikipedia and AfDed (with considerably less fuss). <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 11:43, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Please go to <a href="http://nexusnovel.wordpress.com/purchase-books/" class="external free" title="http://nexusnovel.wordpress.com/purchase-books/" rel="nofollow">http://nexusnovel.wordpress.com/purchase-books/</a> you will find hyperlinks there to purchase "Nexus" from major book chains previously mentioned. The subtitle has not been entered on the sites except for chapters.indigo.ca, which is probably why you had difficulty locating it in your search. If you do a search of books by KW "Nexus Deborah Morrison," it will also come up. The book can be pre-ordered from any of these sites until its distribution date in October.</p>
<p>In terms of notability this term is of course subjective but note that Deborah Morrison has previously published "Mytical Poetry." "Nexus" will also be distributed throughout Canada, US, UK, Australia and in other English speaking countries. The novel is notable due to its themes and connection with other novels in mind-body-spirit genre stated in my article.

And this book does not appear to meet them yet. Like I said above, I have no objection to this article being recreated should the book become notable in the future. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 22:35, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Note that there is also a proposed guideline for books <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> which this book would probably fail since there is a specific note on books yet to be published. I invite anyone interested in participating in the discussion about this proposal by the way. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 20:47, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I understand your reasoning. If you wish to delete the article, I will recreate it once the book is out and some sales figures are available. Until then, instead of a separate article is it okay to reference the novel under <a href="../../../n/e/x/Nexus.html" title="Nexus">Nexus</a> under == In literature == section?{{unsigned|Al192}</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per crystalballism and spam. If the best references one can come up with include a promotional blog, we can safely assume that this is not respecting the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> principles. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 20:47, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>As I said if you wish to delete this article, go ahead. When I wrote the article, I did it out of enthusiasm after having read a pre-publication copy of the book. I wouldn't expect individuals unfamiliar with the book to share in that enthusiasm. The novel will do well on its own merits and once it is successful, then I will resubmit a more extensive article with better references. Thank you for your comments. They have hepled me to better understand the requirements of Wikipedia, which I will incorporate into future submissions.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I wholeheartedly agree. I'm tired of sweeping gibbon references from an article that makes no valid claims to notability and has no sources.

<p><b>Response:</b> I do not see how this is an advertisement for a website. It is an explination of the service that a schedulizer provides college students. If you want to edit the article to make it more general (which I already did once) then you are free to. Also, there are no other articles about this type of service, which is growing rather quickly.

<li><b>Comment</b> The assertion made by Arbusto that this man is a graduate of a diploma mill is incorrect. To put it properly Arbustoo should have written that it is his opinion that <s>Tyndal</s> is a diploma mill. However, a reading of the Wikipedia article (Specially the parts not written by Arbustoo, which is rather convenient) will show that Tyndale is a highly respected school in Christian Theology. Further, Tyndale paid its fine and is still a school in Texas which is "issuing" degrees. If it were a diploma mill, Texas would shut the school down. Next, Arbustoo writes <i>doesn't even crack the top million</i> and in another of his AfD's he wrotes <i>doesn't even crack the top two million</i>. One supposes if it was ranked 101,000 he'd write, <i>doesn't even crack the top 100k</i>. Finally, he asks, <i>How does he fit the criteria</i> of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> after I wrote how he fit the criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. A quick reading of that section is all one needs to see that he easily fits <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. He is a published author, well respected in Christian circles and asked to speak at Christian colleges/universities, and even outside Christian circles (As noted above with the link to National Georgraphic) is considered notable. How one can read my first comment and then ask seriously, <i>How does he fit the criteria?</i> is beyond my ability to comprehend. I urge those who do not have a knee jerk negative reaction to Christians or Christianity to look into this further and reconsider their positions.<a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> 14:39, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Where on the nom. did I call Tyndale Theological Seminary a diploma mill (Your misreading and false claims are linked to your <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lance_Latham_64dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lance Latham">other votes</a> in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_St_Clements_University_Network_ecf4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/St Clements University Network">AfDs relating to me</a>)? Also cite the outcome of the Tyndale court case, please. Secondly, you must establish notability with sources. Your list of video credits which list Ron Bigalke under "special thanks" does not meet any of the requirements(note: how some people in that list have a PhD by their name, well Bigalke claims to have one, but it is absent from that list).

<p>Article violates most of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, most especially by using weasel words to make NPOV attacks against people and institutions. Possibly legally-actionable.

<p>Firstly, the article information is <b>unverifiable</b>. It cites a few unreliable sources (most unofficial, speculative fan sites) to somehow claim that Napoléon Bonaparte, Pippi Longstocking, James Bond, Scooby Doo, Jack the Ripper, Veronica Mars, and thousands of other characters who have appeared in disparate fiction, as well as a lot of real historical figures, are all somehow related. To that end, it confuses the fiction of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phillip_Jose_Farmer_256d.html" title="Phillip Jose Farmer">Phillip Jose Farmer</a>, the fiction of countless other authors, and the unsourced speculations of many Farmer fans, and as a result is <b>useless as a source of factual information</b> (second reason to delete). I have checked some of the websites used as "sources" and found that they base their character associations on speculations that have no basis in any of the original published fiction these characters appear in. For example, is stating that <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Malone_b561.html" title="Sam Malone">Sam Malone</a> is descended from an 18th century meteorite survivor something that is supported by anything in an episode of <i><a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheers.html" title="Cheers">Cheers</a></i>? I've seen every episode of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sopranos_69e1.html" title="The Sopranos">The Sopranos</a></i> more than once and there's no indication that <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Soprano_ac73.html" title="Tony Soprano">Tony Soprano</a> is a cousin to the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corleone_family.html" title="Corleone family">Corleone family</a>, which is nonsense because the <i>Godfather</i> films are fictional within <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sopranos_69e1.html" title="The Sopranos">The Sopranos</a></i>. Some of the statements made on the page are patently ridiculous (Frank Black from <i><a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium_%28TV_series%29_b678.html" title="Millennium (TV series)">Millennium</a></i> is the nephew of <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edith_Keeler_80a3.html" title="Edith Keeler">Edith Keeler</a> from <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i>?). I see some books are mentioned as sources, but are they anything more than speculation either? Thirdly, though being fancruft isn't an official deletion guideline, this article is pretty much <b>300 kb of fancruft</b>.</p>
<p>I know that users <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookworm857158367_aed8.html" title="User:Bookworm857158367">Bookworm857158367</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> have put a lot of work into this and might even vote to keep it. I suggest that another non-Wikipedia website might be best to host it, as it fails to meet both <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 16:54, 15 September 2006 (UTC). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 16:54, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Regretfully delete</b> - as much as I am an enthusiast of the Wold Newton universe, this has no real place on Wikipedia for the simple reason that the entire foundation of Wold Newton is speculative geneaology, emphasis on the speculative. At best, the list should be limited to what Farmer has published in <i>Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life</i> and <i>Tarzan Alive</i>, although that's also just Farmer's own speculation, so I hesitate at even that. Keywords are original research, non-notability (especially the fan-produced stuff) and verifiability. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 17:08, 15 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Additional comment</b>: Has anyone considered doing a Wold Newton wiki on Wikicities? That may be the best place and/or depository for profiles of this kind. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 17:10, 15 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A wiki would be an <i>excellent</i> venue for this sort of information. It could import Wikipedia's GFDL-licensed pages on all of these characters, and maybe add to each one the speculation that links them to the WNU. I would even be willing to host this page in my userspace for a short time after it is deleted so it could be copied to the appropriate Wikicity. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 17:15, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Though I guess there's a certain innate ballsiness of trying to connect Hercules, Tony Soprano, Star Trek, The Little Mermaid, and Lord Peter Wimsey into one big story, this is neither encyclopedic nor verifiable. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 17:14, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>Yes, it should be deleted. Only the geneology from Farmer's two books should be included here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Go ahead and delete it if the majority opinion is that it's not suited to an encyclopedia. I can certainly move it to my own web site at Wetpaint if that's considered appropriate. I don't think it's any more "dumb" than any other type of pastiche fiction or more frivolous than many of the other articles already on Wikipedia, but it's not worth fighting over.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not sure that you could do that, since your website seems to be licensed under Creative Commons. I could be wrong here, but I think that you need to have GFDL to be able to have content from Wikipedia. I agree with several editors above in that I think that creating a Wold Newton wiki on Wikicities would probably be the best solution, in which case you could just transwiki this article to it. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 15:31, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Bookworm <i>can</i> legally re-use the information. All he has to do, if he wants to copy Wikipedia's content onto his site, is follow the instructions laid out in <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html#Reusers.27_rights_and_obligations" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights#Reusers' rights and obligations</a>. But he has to make it clear that the CC-BY-NC license does not apply to any sections on his site that re-use Wikipedia's content, GFDL applies to them instead. This is similar to the practice of other lawful Wikipedia mirrors. For example, <a href="../../../a/n/s/Answers.com.html" title="Answers.com">Answers.com</a> claims "All rights reserved" on their content, but specifically points out in <a href="http://www.answers.com/main/legal_notices.jsp#terms" class="external text" title="http://www.answers.com/main/legal_notices.jsp#terms" rel="nofollow">their terms of use</a> that the Wikipedia content they use is GFDL, and this notice also occurs on every page on their site which includes Wikipedia content. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 17:47, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>If you remember the Dangerous Alliance, You had Rick Rude as U.S. Champion, Steve Austin was TV Champ, and Arn Anderson/Bobby Eaton had the Tag Titles.</p>
<p>Paul E. Dangerously (Heyman) would often talk of the only missing piece to the "Championship Grand Slam" was the World Championship (held by Sting).</p>
<p>The whole point of the D. A. was Paul E wanting revenge on WCW for firing him as a commentator, He still had his manager's license though, so he felt by having all the titles in his stable, this would have been the ultimate "Screw You" to WCW and he could hold their toes to the fire to meet his demands or threaten to walk and take his boys with him.</p>
<p>Back to the point, while it hadn't been brought up during "Hulkamania 2.0" era or the nWo era or the Vince Russo era, The Grand Slam was brought up in the past.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.117.65.html" title="User:205.188.117.65">205.188.117.65</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/5/User_talk%7E205.188.117.65.html" title="User talk:205.188.117.65">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_205.188.117.65_f8b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/205.188.117.65">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep the Article</b></li>
</ul>
<p>If anything, the NWA stuff either needs to go or have it's own page.</p>
<p>NWA and WCW were seperate and their titles should not be mixed and matched.</p>
<p>However, the WCW Grand Slam article should stay because it was brought up in the past before Bischoff came in and brought Hogan and the rest aboard and things became more storyline/angle driven.</p>
<p>In the 80's to the early nineties, NWA/WCW announcers like Jim Ross and Gordon Solie would talk about Triple Crowns and Grand Slams and the like.</p>
<p>And I do remember the Dangerous Alliance and Paul Heyman talking about winning the Grand Slam and screwing over WCW like the last guy said.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Maybe it should be deleted because it's unencyclopedic, but it's worth saying that to me Wikipedia proves more and more to be a good (or maybe the best) starting point for my searches, whether I'm looking for knowledge or just for some good links related to a topic. From this point of view this article is pretty useful. I think that one of the strenghts of Wikipedia is that it's much more than just an encyclopedia.</li>

<li>No speedy deletion criterion applies. The article says "can't a child express his beliefs in a religion today or what!". The answer is, in some countries, "yes". But that doesn't affect one iota what one may write at Wikipedia, which is not a bulletin board, not an advertising billboard, and not a general free wiki hosting service. It's an encyclopaedia, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox_7923.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a soapbox">not a soapbox</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> Can you clarify? (I don't think we're in disagreement here, but I am truly curious to expand my understanding of speedy criteria) If I saw this article I would have speedied it under A7 (db-bio) as a "group of people" that doesn't assert the importance of the subject. My thinking would be that a religion neccessarily implies a group of followers, historical or current, and that without that assertion of notability, a religion such as this would qualify as a speedy. (Just so you know <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a>, I've got your "on notability" on speed dial (ie. on my user page)) Cheers <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 17:57, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. This does lead to an interesting question though: No religious doctrines are verifiable. It's possible to verify their existence, but the mere fact of their posting is enough for that. So we have to consider the notability of a religion. This is where it gets most interesting imo: I don't think it's at all possible to come up with objective criteria to do that that would not lead to afd miscarriges of justice. Can someone point me to where to continue a discussion about this issue (pref. on my talk page)? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_b339.html" title="User:Dave">Dave</a> 22:52, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>That is conflating determining whether a religious doctrine is <i>true</i> with determining whether the article on that doctrine is <i>verifiable</i> by readers.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have swapped the 'Scottish Musicians' label with 'Scottish People', seeing as the article outlines the fact that DJ Rankin is in fact <i>not</i> a musician.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> Are you the same Alkivar that contributed to the comments section on youtube regarding 'rankin - the truth'? Then you're an american who hasnt heard of a UK 'artist'. Well im in the UK and while Im sure your quite popular and talented I cant say ive heard of you either&#160;:P . If you check the links on this article you will see for yourself that Rankin is popular and well-known - maybe not amongst your social peer group - but popular nonetheless. Yes he does fail on WP:MUSIC so the removal of his status as a musician is a sensible one the whole section of 'controversy' covers the fact that he isn't a musician which precisely the reason why he is infamous. Besides, a lot of notable DJs do not conform to WP:Music as they play record not make them. He is more of an internet phenomenon really. Considering his considerable influence on so many kids of a given age both in ROI and the UK I think his article should stay. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 80.177.65.182 (<a href="../../../8/0/2E/User_talk%7E80.177.65.182.html" title="User talk:80.177.65.182">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.177.65.182_0479.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.177.65.182">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>Put your willy away and stop waving it about. I wasnt questioning your musical credentials, just the fact that they arent relevant here. I repeat that you seem to be basing your decision on the fact that YOU havent heard of him rather than actual research. Maybe you should ask the likes of Brisk, Hixxy and Scott Brown (especially Scott Brown) about the songs of his that Rankin ripped off...sure he's a nobody to the hardcore scene, in fact Rankin doesnt even play hardcore as such anymore, but he's still a big draw to the kids and getting more famous and indeed infamous by the day. All you got to do is look on google or any fileshare prog and see how many reference to Rankin there are. He might be a nobody to you and your contemporaries, but he's a somebody to hundreds, if not thousands of kids in the UK AND the US 80.177.65.182 12:21, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The fact is that in a sense he is a nobody. But because of his antics, all these kids think he isn't and have badgered promoters and event organisers to book him on the basis they thought he was ALREADY a big name DJ. One club/bar booked him on the basis he was the single most requested DJ. Look at the pics on his website playing to 1000's of kids...he don't look like nobody to them. Its a curious situation but one I feel should be documented considering loads of kids are emulating Rankin and think what he does is 'what DJs do' - I have heard so many kids say this in defence of Rankin it's depressing... Also if folks will give me a bit of time, I will add a few more sources over the coming days, as the likes of 'cant sleep clown will eat me' seem intend on wiping anything unsourced 80.177.65.182 12:49, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article appears to have been edited suitably. Also, the statement 'anonymous contributions do not count on AFD' is untrue. The rules state 'Unregistered or new users are welcome to contribute to the discussion, but their recommendations may be discounted, especially if they seem to be made in bad faith'. At least two of the above discounted contributions are valid and made good points. You say 'Rankin is a nobody to anyone who matters in the UK Hardcore scene', but that fact appears to be the whole point in the article! (especially before the recent edits). As a final note, I personally <b>have</b> heard of DJ Rankin, and am well aware of the scale of his fanbase - it is huge. And he tends to play euro trance, not happy hardcore. To summarise, users have made changes to the article that correct the issues raised initially, and thus the article should stay. <a href="../../../e/l/t/User%7EEltyrub_3cee.html" title="User:Eltyrub">Eltyrub</a> 10:20, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

He is notable due to his thousands of fans (more fans than a lot of other artists) and the article (while covering some negative activities) is all verifable fact. You think this guy is a figment of somenoe's imagination or something? What kind of sources would *you* like then? Ill find them for you. 82.42.98.242 10:44, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Instead of looking for problems, how about finding solutions. Look at google, look at youtube, look at yahoo, look at mp3.com, look at the fact that the guy was an independent fansite ffs. 82.42.98.242 21:40, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. In response to 82.42.98.242, Google is a search engine which can be utilized to find reliable sources, but is not a reliable source itself. MP3.com returned 1 hit for an unrelated "Ricky Rankin", but nothing for "DJ Rankin" or "Gordon Rankin". What I see here is an article about someone who has a small following of fans and foes as a result of his plagiarizing notable trance musicians. In search of reliable sources, DJ Rankin scored zero hits in the LexisNexis database, nor was I able to find any kind of mainstream or alternative media coverage of this person using Google or Yahoo. What we're left with at the end of the day is a few low quality Youtube videos and a vanity page from a blogging site.

<p>Hello? Is anyone going to give a sensible reason for deleting this article? Why is it only the people saying to keep it can come up with reasons. Look at all the references to him on other people's site (myspace etc), look at the gallery on his website, look at the fact that he has a independent fansite (not many artists can boast that), look at the fact that he played to 1000s of people and then sit there and say the guy isnt notable. So he's not had mainstream coverage in the media, thats because hes gained popularity outisde of the mainstream media. Theres plenty of source material linked on the page itself and to dismiss the sheer quantity of results on google and more important their actual content as irrelevant is frankly laughable. 80.177.65.182 12:12, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think the intention in the article is to correct the myth amongst teens that DJ Rankin <i>is</i> a notable musician - so if he doesn't meet notability criterior set in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> it makes sense. This doesn't mean the article should be deleted, just that it should be considered less of an entry about a musician and more an article about popular culture and youth culture on the internet. <a href="../../../e/l/t/User%7EEltyrub_3cee.html" title="User:Eltyrub">Eltyrub</a> 17:49, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I strongly recommend some of you androids look at www.mixstreet.net.

<dd>I agree the "What's New" columns may not be the best of references, but they were the best I could do on short notice. It was the facts in them that I wanted: several nationwide (US) television appearances, a massive demo in the Superdome, an important court case, and a patent actually granted. He has stirred up a lot of publicity over the decades. Here are 4 short notes in Science about Joe Newman's battles with the patent ofice: "Newman's "energy output" machine put to the test", by Marjorie Sun, Science July 11, 1986 v233 p154(1). Newman's motor: does it work or doesn't it?", by Marjorie Sun, Science, March 29, 1985 v227 p1558(1). "The endless siege of implausible inventions" by R. Jeffrey Smith, Science, Nov 16, 1984 v226 p817(1), and "Newman's impossible motor; the patent office does not believe that Joseph Newman has built a generator that is more than 100 percent efficient, but New Orleans does", by Eliot Marshall, Science, Feb 10, 1984 v223 p571(2) They have some of the same facts as the "What's New" articles. .<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardamon_ba9d.html" title="User:Cardamon">Cardamon</a> 02:49, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Wikipedia's pretty sensitive about critical bio articles, and this article hasn't been properly sourced (a few external links dropped in do not a proper-cite make). No prejudice against recreation if <i>properly</i> sourced, <i>and</i> with a more <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral POV</a>. --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:44, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Why delete it when you can simply change it to make it better? It's not hard to change a POV to NPOV (and I have attempted to do so just now, see my edit), and sources can always be added. I actually have Newman's book somewhere, which would provide good sources for his claims if I could just find it.... -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 06:46, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Newman's machine was the subject of much debate and controversy in the 1980s and 1990s, garnered much media attention, and even got the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Bureau_of_Standards_1592.html" title="National Bureau of Standards">National Bureau of Standards</a> involved, as well as university physics departments. It's still a subject of curiosity; I for one was glad to find this article on Wikipedia, and I would have tried to create one if it didn't exist. The fact that he was actually awarded a patent makes him notable. Yes, the article can use some NPOV editing (I notice this is being done) and citations, but many articles start out lacking in those respects and eventually evolve into something better. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 06:46, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
