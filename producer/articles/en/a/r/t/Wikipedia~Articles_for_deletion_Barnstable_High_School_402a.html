<li><b>Keep</b> We have near-complete agreement that high schools are inherently notable.

<li><b>Keep</b>- pointless nomination thanks mostly to the numbers of votes <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_a17f.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive">schoolwatch</a> can turn out. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 14:10, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Pointless comment. AfD is not a vote. Do you have an actual <i>argument</i> as to notability, other than the argument-by-assertion made by RFerreira et al? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:02, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia's decision-making process is about consensus, and the consensus is that all schools are notable. Just see the general results of how many schools have been deleted at the schoolwatch link I provided for further proof of that. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 17:06, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is no consensus that "all schools are notable." When an AfD results in "No consensus," that's effectively a "keep," but it still means--um--"<i>no consensus</i>." <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 17:45, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, if the consensus at schoolwatch is that all schools are notable, and the editors from there can show up in large numbers to influence AFDs however they like, and no consensus = keep, then all deletion nominations are efforts in futility, and my above comment about pointless nominations is right. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 18:11, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> There is no consensus all schools are notable, primarily evidenced by the number of school AfD's that end in no consensus. Largescale opinion spamming by a wikiproject (as you've describe above; I'm not stating the wikiproject actually does this) may be effective, but it doesn't prove consensus. Your logic above is flawed and just demonstrates an example of gaming the system.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:26, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think that there's any effort to take advantage of the system. I think the reason School AFDs continue to be such a problem is that there is a small, vocal minority that would mostly like to see all but the most popular schools' articles deleted and a large majority of editors who have declared consensus that schools are notable and that verifiability needs to be the factor considered in AFDs. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 19:39, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How odd, I would think that there is a small but vocal minority that wants to keep all schools and that most editors don't. Given that most of the keeps in these AfDs come from established schoolwatch editors (by your own description) and that frequent deletes come from editors who don't have anything to do with school articles at all the above claim is very hard to understand and seems to border on projection. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 19:54, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment, actually... School AfD's are such a problem because neither side of the debate has the majority they wish they had, and there is no incentive for both sides to sit down and try and hammer out a good faith compromise (and the views are so far apart I'm not even sure compromise is possible). I'd say it is a pretty safe bet that this will go on <i>ad infinitum</i> as long as Wikipedia exists. If a majority exists at Wikipedia, it is the teeming mass of editors who just don't care one way or another.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:11, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hah. Probably more true than most of the school editors would want to admit. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 20:29, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - ForbiddenWord wrote "a large majority of editors who have declared consensus that schools are notable"...I just visited schoolwatch, and there's a handful of editors that have expressed opinions on the talk page there, but not at all a large number of people, and there's no listing of editors that endorses ForbiddenWord's opinion. Ironically, there is, instead, a statement that the project was going to remain neutral.... <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 21:44, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
