<li><b>Delete</b> these should of been speedied. They are non-notable fan works from the same mailing list as the first one and by extention of this been should of been speedy deleted.

<li><b>Delete</b> these actually were marked for speedy but the tags got removed before anyone could act on it. In addition to the non-notable nature of the work there are also verifiability issues since the only source is a restricted mailing list. The fact that the articles keep getting reposted in detail also suggests they are being copied from that restricted list, creating potential copyvio issues. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 12:55, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is a 'free encyclopedia' in the sense that you don't have to pay to look things up... as you would for a paper encyclopedia or other electronic encyclopedias such as Britannica's. It is NOT a 'free webhost' in that you aren't allowed to use it to post any material you would like... only material which one would expect to find in an encyclopedia. Now, people have made 'encyclopedias of Middle-earth' and thus you see alot of Middle-earth articles in Wikipedia... but nobody would ever make (or buy) an 'encyclopedia of unfinished fan RPG material set in Middle-earth'. It's just not the kind of thing ANYONE is ever going to need a handy encyclopedic reference guide to. What you should do is post your materials to geocities or some other web-host site. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 19:25, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Haha, I like how he voted twice in one edit. That, errr, says something about him. And his argument basically boils down to us being intolerant of other people's opinions? What? That's not what this is about. This is about determining whether or not content merits inclusion in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> All this discussion is entirely non sense, while there is no real argument against these texts. Sockpuppets for deletion, and others for keeping it. This only proves that wikipedia is not a free encyclopedia, and this can't be trusted for that precise reason. This is dictatorial, and many intolerant views...

<li>What a terrible mischaracterization. "Sockpuppets for deletion"? LMAO. Look at my edit history, I am no sockpuppet. You, on the other hand, only have edits on this page and the pages for deletion in question.

<li><b>Comment</b> I can assure you that YOU are a sockpuppet. Your attitude, and your non respect towards others who don't agree with you proves that you are a sockpuppet. And yes, I have no more interest on wikipedia, because of the hostile reception to these few articles that does no harm to the encyclopedia, but improves it. This enriches the encyclopedia, but blatantly you can't see it.

To those who have saifd keep, a question: would you expect to find these articles in Encyclopedia Britannica?

<li>Anyone can nominate any page for AFD, sure.

And a large number of the borderline cases which are nominated survive the AFD process. That's what consensus is all about.
