<p>The result of the debate was delete. The sources presented do not appear to satisfy our guidelines, and several of the "keep" recomendations that are based upon notability are thus unverified. At least two "keep" recomendations are given with the caveat that notability appears to arise from vanity press alone. Given this, the delete outcome is a matter of <i>sources</i>.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, it is true that Maxwell is known with in Adventism.

<li><b>Obvious Keep</b>. The first thing I'd like to say is that I've already added four powerful references to the article A. Graham Maxwell. Compare that to the six references supporting the much longer article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventists" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventists" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventists</a> (two of which are mine).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Second: If someone is interested in expanding the article by writing on the upbringing of A. Graham Maxwell and his early life, they are very welcome to do so. Realize, of course, that many people are only remembered for their life's work and goals, not lesser experiences. Joseph Goebbels is known best for being Adolf Hitler's Propaganda Minister. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels</a></dd>
<dd>At least for me, I am more interested in those details about Goebbels. And while some persons don't want to see evidence documenting the "final solution," I don't mind someone making a Wikipedia article out of it.</dd>
<dd>According to everything I know, the only encyclopedic significance of Graham Maxwell is the schism he has created in the Seventh-day Adventist church:</dd>
<dd>"A faction in the church rejects the historic Christian belief that Christ died vicariously for our sins and accepts, instead, the controversial theology of A. Graham Maxwell." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventists" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventists" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventists</a></dd>

<li><b>A Comment That Proves Indisputable Notability:</b> Here is a great quote documenting why A. Graham Maxwell is a notable figure: In reference to Christ's atonement and the Division of Religion at Loma Linda University, David P. McMahon wrote, "In this department are those who repudiate the historic Christian doctrine of the substitutionary atonement in order to embrace 'the moral influence theory.' In fact, the moral influence theory has widely permeated West-Coast American Adventism. It has such a stranglehold on the church's principal financial base that the leaders of the church appear paralyzed and frightened to touch it." David P. McMahon, <i>Ellet Joseph Waggoner: The Myth and the Man</i>, p. last. - In the cited references, Maxwell admits that he is accused of teaching the moral influence theory. --<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerspicacious_39a9.html" title="User:Perspicacious">Perspicacious</a> 12:03, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Could you please explain in more detail Maxwell's contributions to the moral influence theory (either theologically or in relation to its spread in the Adventist Church)? Or even better, add that explanation to the article? I can't tell how the two are related, since moral influence theory is not mentioned in the body of Graham Maxwell, nor is Maxwell mentioned in <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atonement_%28Moral_influence_view%29_4978.html" title="Atonement (Moral influence view)">Atonement (Moral influence view)</a>. If moral influence theory is Maxwell's claim to notability, the connection between the two must be made much clearer. - <a href="../../../r/y/n/User%7ERynne_b8d8.html" title="User:Rynne">Rynne</a> 16:26, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>1.</b> Desmond and Gillian Ford, (1982) <i>The Adventist Crisis of Spiritual Identity</i> pp. 124, 141, 142.</p>
<p>[Chapter 9 in this reference is titled <i>Enquiry's Progress</i>. Here, Gillian Ford tells a story of an Adventist journey written in the style of the classic book <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>. The story begins as follows]:</p>
<p>An earnest seeker for truth, Enquiry was his name, was wandering through a certain country, looking for sign-posts along the way. In the midst of a desert, he saw afar off a man seated on a rock with his head in his hands. "Maybe this man can direct me to some more fertile place," thought he to himself and hastened towards him.</p>
<p>"Good-day friend. My name's Enquiry, and I am seeking for the garment which will protect me in the coming earthquake. Can you help me?"</p>
<p>The man seated on the rock, Confused was his name, sighed deeply and wrung his hands.</p>
<p>"I wish I could, sir, but I need help myself. For I too have heard that there's an earthquake coming. They say that it's already rumbling, and folks round here are afraid that the whole town will be destroyed."</p>
<p>[Enquiry and Confused gather up their belongings and set off to travel along the highway. Here's the part I like. They arrive inevitably at Maxwell's house].</p>
<p>As they trudged south, they came to a place called Pretty Hill, and seeing a light, thought to ask for rest that night. They approached timidly, fearing that they might be turned away, but were warmly greeted from afar off by two figures on the porch who greeted them most cordially, and welcomed them like brothers.</p>
<p><i>Tender-heart</i>: "Our names are Love-alone and Tender-heart. There are no words used in this house such as blood, or wrath, or penalty, or punish, or propitiate. We teach that the architect can be trusted."</p>
<p>Enquiry and Confused found the hosts most congenial, the stay most comfortable, the beds soft and the food easy to digest. And as they talked together, Confused especially felt at ease, for he had often been told that the architect was a stern judge, ready to throw a ton of bricks at all who displease him. Thus he had grown up afraid of him. But Enquiry grew very quiet and thoughtful, and caused Confused to ask if all was well.</p>
<p><i>Enquiry</i>: "It seems to me that I could not really trust a God who took evil lightly and did not punish those who murdered, stole and dealt unjustly. The blueprint speaks with those words of which you do not approve."</p>
<p><i>Love-alone</i>: "But those words are mere figures of speech. For though the blueprint speaks of judgment—such judgment men bring on themselves. They reap what they sow. The architect himself does not act out in judgment, because he is love and cannot act against himself. As for wrath—it is merely that the architect gives up on men, when after much patient coaxing, he cannot win them. And blood and penalty! Did the son of the architect have to die to 'pay for our sins'? We say not. It was to show that he loved us so much that he would die to prove it.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Weber, Martin. (1994) Who's Got the Truth, <i>Making sense out of five different Adventist gospels</i>, pp. 15-34.</p>
<p>Here are some pertinent quotes:</p>
<p>"Obviously, all of these spiritual leaders have much to contribute in terms of gospel truth, or they wouldn't have their large followings of thoughtful Seventh-day Adventists." p. 5.</p>
<p>"Reading <i>Servants or Friends</i> makes obvious why Graham Maxwell is so popular with thousands of thoughtful Adventists." p. 15.</p>
<p>"I wish I could accommodate Dr. Maxwell's desire to be left out of this book, but because his view are cherished by thousands of Adventists, I would be remiss not to consider them worthy of inclusion in this analysis. And so I have proceeded without Dr. Maxwell's participation."</p>
<p>"He feels so strongly that I should not include him in these pages that he contacted the denominational publishing house with which I was arranging to print this book. He asked that they not publish it if it includes my chapter about him. Out of respect for his wishes, the book editors there complied with his request. Consequently, I am publishing this book personally with the Home Study International Press."</p>
<p>"To summarize: The name Graham Maxwell is well-known and beloved by Adventist around the world; he is too significant a thought leader to ignore." p. 33.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> David P. McMahon wrote in his book, <i>Ellet Joseph Waggoner: The Myth and the Man</i>, in reference to Christ's atonement and the Division of Religion at Loma Linda University, and I quote: "In this department are those who repudiate the historic Christian doctrine of the substitutionary atonement in order to embrace 'the moral influence theory.' In fact, the moral influence theory has widely permeated West-Coast American Adventism. It has such a stranglehold on the church's principal financial base that the leaders of the church appear paralyzed and frightened to touch it." p. last.</p>

<p><b>GOD WILL NOT KILL THE WICKED</b>—The present author’s research study, The Terrible Storm, is the most complete collection of Bible-Spirit of Prophecy material on this subject. Revelation 14:9-10 predicts a terrible storm of God’s wrath is soon to fall upon the incorrigibly wicked. But Satan wants the Third Angel’s Message repudiated in the minds of men. In place of it, he substitutes a different message: “Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow you go to heaven anyway.”</p>
<p>In spite of a multitude of clear statements in the Bible and Spirit of Prophecy, for over two decades Mike Clute taught the false doctrine that God never has, and never will, execute capital punishment on the wicked. In recent years Mike went into universalism, the teaching that none of the wicked will ever die. That evil teaching is solidly denounced in Great Controversy, 537-539.</p>
<p>This error, which Paul Heubach used to teach in the 1950s and 1960s at La Sierra and Walla Walla (he was the one who taught it to Mike), is being taught by Graham Maxwell of Loma Linda University (Graham Maxwell, Servants or Friends? Another Look at God, 1992). Maxwell says he has a “matured” view of God, which helps him see that the “many references in the Bible to God’s destruction of the wicked” must be understood as God’s “just using a figure of speech.” --<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerspicacious_39a9.html" title="User:Perspicacious">Perspicacious</a> 05:50, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
