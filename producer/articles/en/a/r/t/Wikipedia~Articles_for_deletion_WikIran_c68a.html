<dd>May I ask why you put the word encyclopedia in quotes, as if to suggest that it's not a real encyclopedia? So, from your perspective, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, but this one isn't, right?&#160;:) That's nice. Now, the history of the article you mention was started by Zereshk, and if he's involved with wikIran, the copyvio issue is a bit moot. But there's another thing, which makes that point even more moot. It's released under the GFDL as well, just like Wikipedia, so someone can easily go there and put the attribution there if it's missing. Right? I mean, that is the entire purpose of the GFDL, is it not? <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloodlands_6a95.html" title="User:Floodlands">Floodlands</a> 20:17, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW, also please note that linking WikIran (being a small wiki) "should be avoid", according to our policy. I see that to some extent the spamming of Iran-related pages has already been began.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 06:27, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Which policy is that? I've been looking through the policy pages, and can't find anything that says Wikipedians aren't allowed to link to small websites or wikis. That's nonsense. As an admin, you're really shouldn't make things up. If an editor incorporates text from wikIran or another public GFDL corpus provider, they can also add an attribution link. By virtue of that fact alone, your claim is incorrect. By the way, why the antagonism? You want to delete this article, that's fine. But please do not make false accusations of "spamming" against other users. Assume good faith, and leave your sarcasm at the door.

<dd>Actually judging from the history of articles User:Fesenjoon looks to be the more active user. But this is a moot point. The importance of any website is the quality of its content, <i>not</i> the quantity of users involved. What's interesting is that this wouldn't even be an issue if this site experiences what another editor here calls the "Slashdot effect" and achieved significant notability. I'm sure you would still use that "one-man-show" bit as an excuse for deletion, but you would never be able to dispute the notability criteria. What is nice to see are the other editors here who are positive in their outlook, desiring to delete now, but recreate later when notability is attained. And it is also of note to mention that these editors refrain from making accusations and the use of a sarcastic tone. Wikipedia needs far more positive, level-headed editors like that. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloodlands_6a95.html" title="User:Floodlands">Floodlands</a> 20:26, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>: Some so called admins are already taking it upon themselves and deleting all links to WikIran articles on WP.

<dd>That comparison is totally out of line. There is no way you can pass off adding links to wikIran as "spamming" especially considering both the nature of the site and the fact that Zereshk has been by far the most active editor in the sphere of Iranian articles here on Wikipedia. Respect and manners go a long way in this world. Before his arrival, the vast majority of Iran articles were mere stubs. Accusing a long-term editor of his class, expertise and sincerity - not to mention all the incredible amounts of time he has dedicated to Wikipedia - of spamming is in, to put it bluntly, incredibly bad taste and is a borderline personal attack. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloodlands_6a95.html" title="User:Floodlands">Floodlands</a> 01:04, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Have you got any proof of this? Are you referring to those named here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Aucaman#Remedies" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Aucaman#Remedies" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>? It could have an impact on the article's content, if the article is saved - I still maintain my keep vote, but think that such details should be included if they are true.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 21:19, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An interesting point: WikIran was started on 7 May (according to the history of its main page), which is coincidentally the same date as the remedies concluded for the Aucaman arbitration, which set out topical bans <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Aucaman#Remedies" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Aucaman#Remedies" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. I think there is a fair point here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Zereshk&amp;diff=69747577&amp;oldid=67322405" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Zereshk&amp;diff=69747577&amp;oldid=67322405" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Personally, I think WikIran is just the first of many, created because collaborate projects work better when the editors are unified behind a certain editorial line rather than the despair and futility that Wikipedia generates - and what's wrong with that?--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 21:45, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
