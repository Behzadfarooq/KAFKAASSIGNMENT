<li><b>Comment</b> If not made clear by the nom and previous comments, the owner of Gladys (Jim Lebinski) is the one who is the main contributor to the wiki article (<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames.lebinski_2692.html" title="User:James.lebinski">User:James.lebinski</a>), as evidenced by the recent news article. The wiki article has existed for less than 3 weeks. It survived the previous AfD after the author was encouraged to make it more encyclopedic, but as a result the article is now bogged down in minutiae. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatr67_a209.html" title="User:Katr67">Katr67</a> 04:29, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> In light of my previous comment, and per the nom, although I have a soft spot for plastic cows, the mention of the Wikipedia article in the local paper makes me agree this is a serious <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatr67_a209.html" title="User:Katr67">Katr67</a> 04:29, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Looking at the first AFD I'm wondering if people realize that verifiability is not actually a criteria for keeping an article. Lots of non-notable things can be verified but that doesn't make them worth of inclusion in an encyclopedia. Its got to be notable first. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 04:36, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Regular keep because <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">WP:Verification</a> is established. <a href="../../../t/r/i/Wikipedia%7ETrivia_16ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Trivia">Interesting/Trivial</a> items are allowed.

<ul>
<li>Right. Verifyability in and of itself is *not* a reason to keep an article. Just because a reporter writes an article that verifies your buttocks are hairy and do indeed exist does not make them worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. Trivial subject = not notable. "The opposite exists also: things that are interesting without being really important. For example, the Guinness Book of World Records contains, apart from many world records that are "important", several "trivia" world records. So wikipedia will not mention each and every "world record" that is interesting, but only those that are also important." How is this cow important? Don't forget the conflict of interest either, or do you think that's a good thing? <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 05:27, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Like I said, agree it's <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIVIA_c4e2.html" title="WP:TRIVIA">WP:TRIVIA</a> and you seem to agree it's verfied (thanks for the <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:UNCIVIL</a> reference to my buttucks). For conflict of interest, at least five non-creator non-anon editors worked on this article since it's creation a few weeks ago.

<ul>
<li>That was a generic your. Nothing to do with your personal buttocks. Simply an example to point out ridiculousness. It wasn't uncivil at all. If I had meant it to be uncivil I would have said something like, "Now lets take the example of Oakshade's hairy ass...but I didn't because that would be uncivil. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 06:08, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trivial subject is not the same as not notable. They can be. What you should've said was Trivial subject&#160;!= notable (Trivial subject does not equal notable). - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:41, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> It doesn't appear to me as if anything about the article's changed. That leaves the COI issue. COI is not necessarily a reason for deletion, though. Verifiability, NPOV/encyclopedic tone, and "no original research" are all met. The article could probably use some cleanup, but that's also not a reason for deletion. That leaves self-promotion. I notice that the author of the article the nominator of this AfD cited is also the author of one of the article's sources, though, and that that earlier article was written in 2003, meaning this author knew of the piece and its artist long before the article existed. It seems possible to me that Mr. Spinelli took an interest on his own, so I'm inclined to give benefit of the doubt in this case. I also think it's a bit soon to renominate the article, but I suppose the new information is a decent reason. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 06:38, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Well researched, well documented article on a road side folk art attraction. New Jersey has its <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucy_the_Elephant_cee0.html" title="Lucy the Elephant">Lucy the Elephant</a> and there is <a href="../../../e/l/s/Elsie_the_Cow_33a5.html" title="Elsie the Cow">Elsie the Cow</a>, an ad campaign. I disagree that triviality is equal to non-notability. The "hairy ass" analogy doesn't fit. There is no more information beyond the single sentence about a "hairy ass" but this article is more than a single sentence. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 06:43, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEep</b> if only because if you can't wait at least a month before resubmitting an AfD, I can't believe you are making this proposal fairly. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:45, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Bzzt. That's not a valid reason to keep. Besides, it was nominated by a different person. No one here has yet proven this cow is notable in the wider world. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 06:53, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, it is a valid reason to keep, since you'll see people remove nominations all the time upon realizing that the situation has been recently discussed. Furthermeore, that it is a different person is also irrelevent, since in this case, there's no apparent ignorance of the prior deletion issue. Ergo, I stand by my keep. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:16, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- while this renomination appears to come from another editor, the arguments remain the same -- verifiability and notability. It appears, now, to be verified; notability is not something that happens overnight. If this nomination were six months after the <i>"keep"</i>, I could understand and accept that it failed. Two or three weeks does not, of itself, give the opportunity for the Outside World to declare its interest. If the decision is to <b>delete</b>, then I reiterate my earlier suggestion, that the text be ported to the author's User-page, so that it can be archived, rather than being dematierialised without warning. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 08:26, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Aside from notability and verifiability, does it bother anyone else that the cow's owner wrote a Wikipedia article about said cow, and was then featured in a seasonal newspaper article (which was to be expected as the cow has some local notability) where he said "Just look up Gladys the Swiss Dairy Cow" on Wikipedia? I don't think Wikipedia has to take itself so seriously that we can't include a little regional folk art here and there, but I feel like we are being used for self-promotion. As far as I can tell, the only reason Gladys will become notable is <i>because</i> she has an article on WP. Isn't that some sort of logical fallacy or circular-something-or-other, possibly phrased in Latin?&#160;:) I think the cow keeper means well, but the promotion angle bothers me a lot. As the nom said, we're not here to promote cows. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatr67_a209.html" title="User:Katr67">Katr67</a> 08:58, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>All but one of the outside articles written about his subject came <i>before</i> this article was created. As Wikipeidia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a crystal ball</a>, I don't think anyone, including the original author, could've predicted another outside article written on this subject and that it would include info about the WP entry. The reporter of the recent article actually wrote about this subject before in April. As always, we <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> of not only the editors, but even the reporters of the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 16:22, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>AUTHOR ABSTAINS</b> Morning Katr67 - I can understand how you might feel that there is a COI in my having referenced the article, however, there is nothing further from the truth. there is no commerical interest for me in this art, it is not connected to any business venture, and there is no value in self-promotion here, other than shating the information itself.
<p>The only reason I commented on the article was to note its existence ion anticipation of the significant public interest that a front page article generates. You'uu note that I said "you can find the history of the artwork on wikipedia" - which is a perfectly legitimate thing to say wihout even a hint of a COI - a refernce to a reliable source of veruified information on a notable piece of art, not a commercial shill.</p>
<p>One other idea - shouldn't the fifth fromt ( yet another....) page article in a huge newspaper be enought to pass notability?</p>
<p><b>Final thought - I've revealed my identity through my sign in name - had I something to hide or a COI - I could have selected a pseudonym and none of the previous comments would even be possible. There is no COI and nothing to hide.</b></p>
<p>BTW - Tony Spinelli from the post did in fact aggressively pursue the article - he pursued me for it, which means it passed the review of his editors and the rest of the publishers at the post.</p>
<p>This is more than a christmas display guys - I'll edit the details to better conform today.</p>

<li>You were right on one point: more than one media outlet has "covered" this fake cow statute. I'm not going to engage in an argument on whether or not the Connecticut Post is a local media outlet, especially since we appear to be on the same page. If some choose to consider South Western CT as a large enough coverage area to be considered a national or even regional outlet, so be it. I don't think this articifial cow, covered in different types of paint can possibly be considered "notable." Stretch, twist, and bend the definition of notability until it snaps, at the end of the day the inclusion of the cow article won't break Wikipedia, inclusion just calls the legitimacy of WP into question. I understand how this would seem notable to someone living in the area perhaps.<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienter_8af3.html" title="User:Scienter">Scienter</a> 18:39, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

You've had several sources cited.

<li><b>Interesting concept of a "notability threshold by distance/global scale of notability"</b> - From what I read that notion really isn't supported in wiki policy - seems like the consensus is that the notability test already is passed - multiple non trivial mentions exist, and wiki policy doesn't to my knowlegde address a minimum grographic scale of impact. Can you provide a reference to policy guidance that says "how" notable something must be by geographic disstance? If not, I'd suggest that you defer to the consensus on the apparently resolved notability issue.--<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames.lebinski_2692.html" title="User:James.lebinski">James.lebinski</a> 17:08, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This was a close one for me. I am concerned by the <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAuto_aa00.html" title="WP:Auto">potential self-promotion</a>, particularly that I understand that the author of the article is also the artist painting the cow. Additionally, there are, what, hundreds of these plastic cows? (There's one in the University of Chicago Law School cafeteria, for example.) I don't see how this particular plastic cow is more notable than all the other cows. On the other hand there is media coverage - but media coverage of a plastic cow is still...you know, media coverage of a plastic cow. Still, I'm not a fan of a new AfD right after the old one closed - though the old one was pretty "messy," for lack of a better word, so I maybe can see some justification there. On balance it's probably the <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAuto_aa00.html" title="WP:Auto">WP:Auto</a> concerns that swing my vote. Cute cow, though.

<li>Every artist has to self promote himself, else they just cease to be notable. Therefore our measure of notability is not the degree of self-promotion but the sources referenced. If there are sources that call it art we have to note that and if sources call it notable we also have to take that into account. If we go after our <i>impressions</i> we should not try to make a encyclopedia. <a href="../../../r/o/u/User%7ERough_6479.html" title="User:Rough">Rough</a> 19:52, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sure, just as every company needs to advertise - but <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESpam_8b43.html" title="WP:Spam">not on Wikipedia</a>. I don't at all mind that the artist self-promotes in the media (I'd think he was crazy if he didn't), nor does it matter how much they self-promote. It's self-promotion <i>through Wikipedia</i> that <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">concerns me</a>.

<li><b>Thanks Bob -The POV of the article is on the work, which is the one and only subject of this article.</b> The article itself makes no mention of the artist. The published articles do identify the creator, but that's a byproduct.
<p>You might be surprised to note that each of the cow parade cows to which you refer are indiviudually notable works of art by other reputable artitsts - selling in some cases for hundreds of thousands at charity auctions.</p>
<p>This work has noting to do with the cow parade, which makes it especially unique, and when coupled with the ongoing nature of the piece, it becomes especially notable.</p>
<p>The notability issue appears to have at least some consensus leaning towards "notable". Perhaps the number of people aware of the sculpoture who are currently arguiing its notability may be a proof point in itself.</p>
<p>The COI piece is open for debate - but per Wiki policy ( I think) is not a reason for deletion in and of itself = especially in the very grey area of communicating facts about a notable work that has no commercial or other finnancial links.--<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames.lebinski_2692.html" title="User:James.lebinski">James.lebinski</a> 17:08, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I take your point about the artist not being mentioned in the article. However, I think that is exactly backwards and points out the WP:Auto problem. An article about a piece of art <i>should</i> mention the artist. But this article has a hard time discussing the artist, because it's written <i>by</i> the artist - that's where WP:COI comes into play. Is WP:COI a reason to delete? No - but it's a strong argument against notability, and that's why I'm on the deletion side. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 17:44, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Great debate trials. I wonder about your definitions however. Assuming we're not debating the veracity of the coverage - What exactly is a scrap of coverage? How many more media mentions are necessary over what time period to assume substance in your definition? How many more individuals must view the work or the published reviews? On the surface your characterization could be seen as terribly subjective.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>From an obhective measure - the exposure of this art will not substantially increase with wikipedia listing - only the encyclopedic documentation of it will- which does improve wikipedia - bedause its virtual nature is the very thing that allows this breadth of topic to be covered in way not possible in paper based media (ok thats an opinion) . However, in this case, more than three years of pre-wiki notability, almost a dozen articles in three pubklications by more than five individual journalists, TV coverage, and award winning appearances appear to factually contradict your characterization.</dd>
<dd>I've read the POV/weight reference and find no policy based merit in citing that - what specific language did you intenbd to apply?

<li><b>Keep</b> This folk art or performance art work has demonstrated notability by virtue of numerous newspaper articles and TV coverage over a 3 year period. Its notability is better established than the vast majority of pop culture subjects which have Wikipedia articles. Wikipedia editors are absolutely not the final arbiters of what is or is not art: for them to give their opinion of the work is original research per se.Do the self proclaimed art experts also want to delete <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christo_and_Jeanne-Claude_590a.html" title="Christo and Jeanne-Claude">Christo and Jeanne-Claude</a> because a structure with fabric wrapped around it is not art?

<li>This article is practically orphaned.

<li>Not only does the article exhibit a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> for the author, it is promotional in nature. There is not one word about reaction or reception of the "performance art" at any of the venues that were mentioned in the article (except for one "honorable mention") - this almost is written in a journalistic diary style and not in the style of an encyclopedia (it is almost written from the viewpoint of the cow).

<li>I am also leery of one local newspaper "supplying" all of the references for this supposedly-significant piece of art (the last "reference," the <i>Monroe Courier</i> article makes no mention of it whatsoever). I would put it on a par with a local newspaper mentioning a particular family having a six-toed cat that plays table tennis... unless there is an independent source demonstrating more than the ability of getting a little promotion in a single local newspaper, I feel compelled to urge <b>delete</b> as a NN advertisement. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 23:46, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Two mentions of the reaction exist - in the form of two awards in consecutive years, not just one. One was 'best appearing float" the other honorable mention</p>
<p>I'm hard pressed to see how the content or tone is promotional. Ask yourself&#160;:If I wasn;t honest enough to identify myself as the primary contributor would you feel the same way. I argue that the historical narrative of the work is unbiased. Style help would be graetfully received as edits though.</p>
<p>The sources referenced contain plenty of verifiable quotes on the reation to the art. Perhaps another editor would like to dig up the news articles to add those to the article????????? Maybe that would even be a way out of the COI jeopardy ( which we've established is not a reason for delietion I think?)</p>
<p>I think one picture per work is about right to present the image, glad to have other editors delete those that are unwotrhy. Question If picasso painted cows, which of subset his works would you propose wasn't worthy of a picture in wikipedia ( ok that's just stupid - but my point is valid nonetheless)???</p>
<p>I've added another reference from two more newspapers ( I could use some help formatting, and I still need to dig up the photo credit/author from the courier) in the refernces section - so I'll ask a similar question to the one before just what number of published references are needed and from how many sources?</p>
<p>You may wish to re-red the courier article - the presence of the art at a charity benefit haunted house is mentioned. I'll grant you thatis is a brief mention.</p>

<p>You've done well to paraphrase my self deprecating humor for the layman. When I wrote "Ok that's just stupid" after the picasso comment a lot of ordinary people wouldn't have gotten the joke.</p>
<p>Now onto the ntability topic. As Uncle G writes, notabiilty dioes not lie within the realm of opinion, youir, mine or anyones. This article clearly passes each of the notablity standards set in the policy and as such, your challenge to notability must be a depate of the policy and the facts here. My argument remains that this meets the definition of notability. Your job must now be to offer affirmative proof that it does not.</p>
<p>On two side notes</p>
<p>1) That charity benefit was attended by more than 2000 individuals ver three days, generating more than a on of non-perishable foods for a shelter. It's been going on for years and also has multiple media refernces - Someone mught just want to write a wiki on that as well, because iot arguably passes the wiki notability test too.</p>
<p>If you were truly born to delete cows you better hurry, because I just got an e-mail from a national publication seeking to follow up on Gladys.

<p>You may wish to see the previous debate on the "local" reference to the publication, as well as to note that there are many articles, and many publications over many years. Perhaps then you could offer facts to supoprt the "local" opinion.</p>
<p>You may also with to review uncle g's treatise on notability.</p>
<p>Further, the fact that you agree that this is extraordonary art is counter to your argument, and the fact that your nome is not yet notable is one indicator that said condition is not a given.</p>

<dd>There is no proof you can give that you won't be turning Ms Gladys into money in the longer term. Then we'll all be waking up to the fact that you used that Wikipedia entry to gain coverage in the local press, and the local press articles to cement the status of notability in Wikipedia. Where did I say it was art? I'd appreciate <b>if you didn't put words in my mouth.</b> And feel free to assume bad faith, I don't mind. But <b>no, I don't think it's art</b>. Just because my garden shed is painted, doesn't make it art. And my gnome is not notable because I haven't tried to promote it. Because I don't care. About the contents of Wikipedia, I do care. Finally, I don't share your sense of worship for Uncle G and prefer to use my own judgement. The purpose of AfDs is not that one person puts forth a notion and the rest follow like sheep. The purpose is to get a variety of opinions and find a consensus. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a>&#160;<small>•</small>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 13:39, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lets examine the discusuon thread a bit further, but I'd prefer to stay within a fact/policy based disciussion - which can reduce the level of emoition involned. Aplogies for any ruffled feathers to date.</p>
<p>1) Can you support your claim that The Post is "local" and implication that therefore the coverage was insignificant</p>
<p>Here's my fact based argument from <a href="http://www.medianewsgroup.com/mngi/newsgroups/connpost.html" class="external free" title="http://www.medianewsgroup.com/mngi/newsgroups/connpost.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.medianewsgroup.com/mngi/newsgroups/connpost.html</a></p>
<p>"The Connecticut Post is located in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and publishes a morning newspaper seven days a week and is distributed primarily in Fairfield County, the most affluent county in the United States. The Connecticut Post also publishes the Westport News, Fairfield Citizen-News, Darien New-Review, and the Norwalk Citizen-News, weekly newspapers, known as the Brooks Newspaper Group, distributed in Fairfield County and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Daily Circulation: 77,469 Sunday Circulation: 89,306"</p>
<p>Fact: More thah 75 thousand people at a time have seen this art and articles aboiut it on the front page of this periodical ( and others) in several articles over many years</p>
<p>2) The good faith policy reference was to my contribution, not your dissent. I already assume your good faith in challenging this contribution, and I respect it - oitherwise I'd be crazy to spend such energy refuting it, and I may just be crazy anyhow. In short, I think that according to wiki-policy you must assume my good faith in making this contributiion, and therefor not consider what you think might happen in the future. On the top of that presumption you have my testimony in this AFD that I am actying in good faithe with significant content to back that up.</p>
<p>3) The facts do not support your argument that the wikipedia article is used to draw media attention. All but one of the published references were months or years before the creation of the enty. The press had noticed the topic long before this content was wiki-d. The order of events goes new and media coverage ( and lots of it) then wiki article. Not the reverse.</p>
<p>4) I accept that you do not consider this art and apologize for implying that you did. we now have agreement on a point that is irrelevant to the discussion at hand, and not a criteria for deletion in any event. Personal opinions just don't count per policy though. Compliance with notability does.</p>
<p>5) Uncle G's well wrtitten comments ( ok thats opinion) that accurately portray notability (ditto) was the reference here, not the contributor. His position, per wiki policy is that the subject passes notability - again I invite you to present a fact based counter argument that combinbes your judgement with wiki-policy.</p>

<li>Well done Samsara. A perfectly excuted Esquive, but your are in line for the factual version of a Carton noir, especially for returning the favor of putting words in my mouth.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To the fact-cave yet again...the other bobs advice notwithstanding......</p>
<p>A fact based counter argument is as follows:</p>
<p>The language reads exactly as pasted. However, the notabiilty point was not conceded, nor did the position change. Read a bit more carefully, the senstence means that anyones subjective agreement that this work can be called art is simultaneously a subject of disagrement, which can never be resolved ( de gustibus) and most importantly a topic of irrelevance to the AFD. The fact is, whether you or I think this is art is of no consequence to the discussion nor is it a reason to delete per wiki policy. That viewpoint has not changed one bit.</p>
<p>To be honest, You've stumped me on the second part. I followed the link and still have no idea what your non-notabilty refernce is, but if you'll explain in non-wiki magic links, I'll try to answer.</p>
<p>Finally, You are factually correct in that a single, and most recent of more than 7 properly referenced non-trivial independent news articles contains a quote from me that mentions the existence of the wiki-article. If you follow the date math it goes like this: First comes more than 6 notable referemces, then a wiki-article, then yet another news article in which the wiki-article was mentioned as a minor point. The genesis of the most recent news article was not the wiki-article - you'll find date-stamped proof of the pre-existing intent of the reporter to cover the story in the first AFD. The cause was instead the previous notability of the work from three years of coverage, more directly it was a follow up to the "moving" piece six months later. Moreover even if you stike that article from the record - the notability test is still passed. Add in the good faith policy, coupled with the fact that others tell me coi ( however unfounded) is not a reason for deletion and there is no case. Again, Notability was met years before the publication of the most recent article.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Media coverage in and of itself does not make something notable, only verifiable. Everything written about in a local paper is *not* inherently notable because it appeared there.

<li>Media coverage is only an indicator, an adjunct in determining notability, but it isn't the *only* thing that confers notability on a topic. So far, it has been the *only* argument for notability. That isn't enough to prove notability. There's an article in my local paper today about a local plumber who helps old people with plumbing problems. He is verified, but being mentioned by the press alone does not make him notable. What actually makes this cow notable? (and more than *just* verified - no one is arguing that the cow isn't verified.) Verification is only one part of notability. It isn't the whole story. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 20:05, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>This one is pretty academic PSchemp, and I believe that you are incorrect. The primary notability policy is explicit, and im my opinion is contrary to your assertion, applying the policy to the coverage of this topic is exactly the thing that has objectively determined notability:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the record:</p>
<p>...a topic is notable if it has been been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself. <b>CHECK</b></p>
<p>What constitutes "published works" is intentionally broad and includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, published reports by consumer watchdog organizations and government agencies. <b>Many Newspapaer Articles in differemt papers - Check</b></p>
<p>The independence qualification excludes all self-publicity, advertising by the subject, autobiographies, press releases, and other such works directly from the subject, its creators, its authors, or its inventors (as applicable). <b>Many Authors/Reporters/Photographers, All from Independent sources, Check</b></p>
<p>Triviality is a measure of the depth of content contained in the published work, exclusive of mere directory entry information, and how directly it addresses the subject. <b>Multiple articles, in depth written discussions, Check</b></p>
<p>For the other Bob - your poiints weigh heavy on me in terms of not wanting to stifle legitimate discussion and avoiding the whole "own" thing. However, the notability psotion being argured is just plain inaccurate here. I'm a wiki-user of only a few days, and I've foundd the fact based content to back up the notability position rather easily.</p>
<p>Seems to me that seems to me that a more experienced user could process the data just as objectively and probably more efficiently to arrive at a policy conclusion.</p>
<p>Meeting the primary criteria is in fact, accorfing to policy the *only* argument needed</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> THREE newspapers does not equal "many". SO a reporter at one of them has a soft spot for your cow. That still isn't "many".

<li>Most people would include "three" in the "MULTIPLE" catagory (that's alot more newspapers writing about this than alot of subjects on WP).

<li>Sorry otherbob, I can't stay out of the fray - fact wise anyhow. Pschemp - its actually four newspapers. Based on previously established notability i'll offer that that the only furthering of the art is when it is carried back to the workshop to create the next piece. Gladys is art - not an empire! Wiki is the right place for the article Proof point: a free vanity website could be instantly created, and not subject to peer review, nor notability, nor any wiki rules. You'll note that none has ever existed, and that the ONLY references on the web are the idependent sources themselves.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have to go this way for now. It is written about in 3 local papers. So we have multiple sources. That means it is not OR and is verifiable. Now, the question is are these sources non-tivial? I'm not convinced that they are. But given the recent vote, I'm willing to let this stay for now. Having said that, additional sources would make this an easier call. Also given the dates and detail, one wonders where all of this data came from. Was all of it from those seven or so newspaper articles? The pictures show that the cow does exist with several paint jobs. One other point for keeping. The fact that this cow is repainted so often may make it unique which would be notable in and of itself. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 01:04, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
