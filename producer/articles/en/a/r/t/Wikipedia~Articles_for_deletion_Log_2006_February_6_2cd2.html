<li><b>Note</b> There is sufficient debate not to have a "speedy" keep. I think that any notability should be prerequisite for list inclusion in lists such as this, so several stubs wouldn't be a bad outcome to this: they would provide an instant test over whether a product was useful or just more link spam. I have started cleaning up the lists that are in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_software_5eec.html" title="Category:Lists of software">Category:Lists of software</a>, including <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_wiki_software.html" title="List of wiki software">List of wiki software</a> (partly by rming external links and non-notable products). But one list at a time! Some of the articles in the wiki list need to be stubbed. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_UML_tools_faa6.html" title="List of UML tools">List of UML tools</a> is my most controversial List AfD, but it also has:
<ul>
<li>one of the highest level of link spam</li>
<li>so many programs which are non-notable</li>
<li>very little effort to clean it up and keep it clean has been made (people have even thwarted past efforts to remove the external link cruft)</li>
<li>an unmaintainable (or at least unmaintained) breadth of focus (see discussion page on last question of AfD)</li>
<li>the category includes all of the programs in the list and some which aren't in the list</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Petri_net_tools_61a8.html" title="List of Petri net tools">List of Petri net tools</a> does need a clean-up, but people have been making efforts to do so. I haven't yet touched it. Again: One list at a time. There's no reason to move these lists back to the original articles. But that's not an excuse to keep poor lists. Categories should be used when they can provide enough information. Lists should be kept to the same standard as if they were kept in the original article. This list hasn't been kept to that standard; the link spam is just terrible.</li>

<dd>46 external links when only 17 articles are in wikipedia. Even rming external links for blue links, this is 29 external links &amp; 17 internal ones. Since notability should be a criteria for inclusion in the list, a list shouldn't have more external links than internal ones.

<dd>Hmm. The elinks for softwares that have an article can be removed. No problem. What I see a problem is, with "non-notable". Who decides that? I can tell you: this is very slippery ground, especially for such a low edit traffic article as this is. If you remove a certain product, the contributor can be very upset if you have not a clear concept what goes on the list and what doesn't. They will quickly create articles. I don't think this is very helpful. --Adrian Buehlmann 16:26, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The external links for blue linked software should go. At least some of the external links in the External links section should go. Notability should be dictated by <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28software%29_dfdb.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (software)">Wikipedia:Notability_(software)</a>. This is one reason why I'm in favor of a cat, rather than a list: the notability of every tool (article) would be tested through an established procedure, rather than turning to a spam-filled list. If a tool doesn't warrant a stub article, it doesn't warrant inclusion in a list. Contributors should not be upset by any bold removal--they can create stubs or argue notability.

<dd>I look a little time and started looking closer as some of the redlink entries. Take GNU Ferret, for example. Looking at the Ferret web site, there's really nothing that deserves an article of its own. It's a work in progress, and statistically, most projects at Ferret's level of development are doomed to wither and die. It certainly doesn't meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28software%29_dfdb.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (software)">Wikipedia:Notability (software)</a>, for whatever that's worth. But, as one example in a list surveying the field, it certainly deserves a mention. I could write a GNU Ferret stub, which would certainly improve the blue/red ratio, but it would be making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/Wp%7Epoint.html" title="Wp:point">wp:point</a> for no good reason. As time goes on, some of the red links will turn blue, and new entries (of one color or another) will get added.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Yeah, sockpuppet is a slight misnomer here for the policy, but the spirit of it that the raw number of comments by recently registered or anonymous editors carries little weight here needs some name, and it's most typically used in the "sockpuppet" sense of somebody inventing myriad personas to agree with them. If users of nohomers.net want to save this article, use logic and reason, persuade other wikipedians why it should be kept. Just a lot of votes saying "keep" when you are new here aren't going to go far, that's part of why the name of this process was recently changed from "Votes for Deletion" to "Articles for Deletion", to clarify that it's not a simple vote, it's a discussion to come to a consensus of the community. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWingsandsword_3b20.html" title="User:Wingsandsword">Wingsandsword</a> 08:01, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - I think NoHomers is a very important part of the online Simpsons community.

<li><b>Keep</b>: NoHomers is probably the most popular Simpsons forum on the internet. Hell, it even recieved a mention in the season 6 commentary by Matt Groening. Keep it. Removing it from Wikipedia would be a slap in the face to all the people who over the years have made NoHomers what it is. --Wastelandsw 10:27, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Alexa rank does not suggest notability, however much arm-waving might go on. The argument that other cruft justifies all cruft is not persuasive, and there is no verifiable evidence of significant external coverage. Google and Yahoo searches for inbound links reveal very little external interest, most users ever online was 471. It claims a bit over 10,000 members, but there is no way of verifying this or telling how many of these are still active (so that doesn't sound like a "huge" community to me). <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 11:13, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The site does not claim to have 10,000 members or over 1,200,000 posts. That is listed right on the site. That is besides the point. In this case, the notability has not been gained because it's huge (however, the size is quite decent), but because of different things that have already been listed. Those reasons are relevant.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>&#160;: sorry, but this (soon-to-be) deletion seems to be entirely unreasonable. just because the site has decided to flood wikipedia with sockpuppets does not mean it is not notable. it has been mentioned by the writers and voice actors of the Simpsons on the DVD commentaries, twice. it has held personal, direct question and answer sessions with three other Simpsons executive producers (different ones from those who mentioned it on the commentaries). both current executive producer Al Jean and former executive producer Mike Reiss have submitted public statements to the board. It has been referenced directly on the show itself. It has at least three Simpsons animators registered as members. <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alt.tv.simpsons.html" title="Alt.tv.simpsons">Alt.tv.simpsons</a>, which has an article, has had less direct interaction with writers/actors/animators of the show, has never been referenced on the show's DVD commentaries, and has never been referenced on the show itself. And no, its numbers are not enormous, but considering it's a unofficial, privately-run forum with a specific topic, it's pretty large. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamieli_47f3.html" title="User:Jamieli">Jamieli</a> 12:26, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I think this just barely makes it under the wire of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> (if the claims of commentary on dvd and other evidentiary claims supporting notability are true). I note that if you parse the language of the WP:WEB section, a case can be made for both keep and delete. Criterion: "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." Is the DVD commentary a fit? First we have to look at all claims and decide whether that's "multiple." Fairly easy to say the DVD is non-trivial. But does <i>mention</i> in the dvd render nohomer "the subject" of this published work? I would say no. As stated in the exclusion section immediately following, this does not include "a brief summary of the nature of the content." I vote weak keep because of the (possibly trivial brief summary) mention of nohomer, but nevertheless in apparently <i>multiple</i> non-trivial published works. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 15:24, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> If a fan site can be major enough to have an influence on the show itself, than it should be worthy enough to be a Wikipedia article.

It seems that this site was created by members only for the publicity, internet sites should not be given wikipedia articles because of their instability. Who knows how much longer that this site will be around anyway? Sure, it was mentioned by the Simpsons creators, but only because it's one of the few large simpsons forums out there. I can understand why Alt.tv.Simpsons has it's own article, because it was a pioneer and is still well known after 15+ plus years. Only the initials of nohomersclub were used on the show, and in the background so only members would get the reference.

<li>Really pushing the boundaries of notability here chaps... IMO Test Umpires are not inherently notable, unless e.g. seriously prolific to the point of record breaking (like 100+ tests) or famed for their character / personality.

<li><b>Delete</b> — Rather than having a red link in an obscure list, it would be better to simply create a stub article on any program to be added to the category and let it be fleshed out later. Stubs are much more encyclopedic than red links.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b>. As long as we're citing wp:not, "Mere collections of internal links, except for disambiguation pages when an article title is ambiguous, and for <i>structured lists to assist with the organisation of articles</i>." This list article has structure not reflected in the corresponding category. There is no policy or consensus against having a list and a category with the same scope.

<li><b>Note</b>. I agree that lists can be fine. I made no complaints about lists of links in the AfD. However, the only "stucture" this list lends is in licensing. So why not create two subcats to the main category accounting software? The reason for this AfD is that the cats are more maintainable than this list &amp; the list, itself, adds very little (licensing). --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 08:27, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>It would be harmful to sub-split a category with only 34 articles. This list page is the only way to have all the items on one page, yet still sorted. Okay, so it currently sucks. It could use further breakdown by purpose, or maybe a short description of every item. It can be improved. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 08:32, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Why would it be harmful? I actually think having a cat of Free accounting software would be useful, as it could be cross-listed under the Free software cat. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 08:42, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Because there would no longer be a single place where you could see all the items. One of the purposes of a category is to guide the reader between its articles.

<li>This isnt a duplicate of the first Knox page, which i only saw once, and it basicly just talked about how hes a clay animator, and it didn't have much info on it, and it didnt even list his movies (when i saw it anyway), and i dont even think the first Knox page has the same title (i think it was Knox claymation or whatever). This page was most likley created by someone who didn't even know Knox had a wikipedia page before.

<li>so abunch of people all around the world, who dont know him personally and have NEVER talked to him, yet still knowing about his work dosn't make him notable? the guy has atleast 2 million fans, i think he deserves a article. Why wouldnt he? That "notability" thing even said something about the person needing to have atleast 5000 fans, or have sold 5000 CD's(in his case, DVD's)..the guy has sold over 6000 copies of his movie....and this is a 18 year old guy (who started when he was 15).

<li><b>Keep!</b> This guy is a major geek icon. His works ARE notable. I mean, King of the Portal? 5 times? On Newgrounds? Having the most Top 50 movies on Flashplayer? Not to mention the fact that he's put out a DVD that's made truckloads of cash? Admittedly, this article needs a bit of a tune-up, but it still should be kept! This guy is an internet VIP! But, by all means, delete the Villain page. Sincerely, 67.173.8.132 21:14, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep!</b> Knox may not be famous or important in the real world, but he is definitly internet famous. I think it is reasonable for him to have a single page about himself, his works, and how he creates them. On the otherhand I think the Villian page should go.

<li><b>Comment</b> How did you think of that one? The longer the article, the worse it is? And lots of the pages have been hugely re-done to avoid being a game guide, and instead become a databse of information (I myself have worked on the <i>economy</i> and <i>quests</i> articles). If the pages are game guides, then can be cleaned up. Deleting them is way too drastic. There are series for a number of other games, and I dont see them up for deletion - <a href="../../../u/n/i/Image%7EUnion_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg_5679.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg/20px-Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="12" longdesc="../../../u/n/i/Image%7EUnion_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg_5679.html" /></a> <a href="../../../d/u/s/User%7EDussst_2af3.html" title="User:Dussst"><font color="blue"><b>• | ĐÜ§§§Ť | •</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../d/u/s/User_talk%7EDussst_df82.html" title="User talk:Dussst">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dussst_7b36.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dussst">C</a></sup> 21:28, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep.</b> I am not interested in RuneScape at all, and I've seen all these articles mauled badly, both by vandals and well-meaning but inept editing. They are certainly very high-maintenance, and a magnet for fancruft. It does seem, however, like there is too much legitimate, encyclopedic content on RuneScape to fit in a single article. For this reason, I'd prefer it if the articles were kept, and were cleaned up to meet Wikiepdia's standards. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> 09:53, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete insignificant articles</b>. As all RuneScape players should know, the game site has its own forum, which would be clearly more suitable and more attractive to RuneScape players wanting to know something about the game. Much of the information in the pages are available in-game as well, meaning that posting articles specifically on skills and quests seems to be redundant. As a RuneScape player myself, I do not pay much attention to articles and simply "pick up" on the game information while playing. --<a href="../../../y/u/n/User%7EYunzhong_Hou_a8d2.html" title="User:Yunzhong Hou">Yunzhong Hou</a> 14:10, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b>. Runecraft is a very notable game. These articles, while somewhat different, are very similar to several other series of books or games that have multiple articles.

To dismiss these articles as pure <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">fancruft</a> doesnt hold much weight when compared to how many minor articles have been created for other series like LOTR.

<li><b>Keep All</b>. ScottyBoy is right. Objectively we can't look at the game as a fringe piece, because there are a lot of players out there. And so if we treat this similar to other major works, most notably the LOTR series, a serious change to the format of ALL these works would be necessary.

<p>If one looks at this proposed article for deletion it is very well written and done in a manual style fitting Wikipedia, however I don't see this as a strong point as to why this article should stay. There already exists an article where Dartmouth fraternities and sororities are described. (<a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_College_Greek_organizations_1a1b.html" title="Dartmouth College Greek organizations">Dartmouth College Greek organizations</a>). So why is there a need to have a seperate article for each fraternity chapter? It seems like an overkill. Granted, these chapters are old and notable but then again there are quite literally hundreds if not thousands of chapters of any national fraternity which bear the same characteristic. What's to prevent the floodgates from opening and have many individuals use Wikipedia as some <i>de facto</i> free web service such as <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geocities.com.html" title="Geocities.com">geocities.com</a> to advertise their greek chapters?</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The references you describe are to individual chapters of national fraternities. However, these are local fraternities without association to any national organization. They also all have significance to the campus. Phi Tau was the first coed house and one of the early fraternities on campus. Kappa Kappa Kappa was even the second local fraternity in the nation. --<sub>└</sub><i><sup><a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith120bh_b04a.html" title="User:Smith120bh">Smith120bh</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../s/m/i/User_talk%7ESmith120bh_4622.html" title="User talk:Smith120bh">TALK</a></sub></i> <sup>┐</sup> 03:46, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I agree with Smith120bh. The arguments against the pages you reference are that they are chapters of national organizations. The same cannot be said of Phi Tau, Kappa Kappa Kappa, or Alpha Chi Alpha. They are indeed old and notable, as Dysepsion has already conceded, but he is in error when he suggests that there are hundreds or thousands of chapters bearing the same characteristic. They are unique. Tri-Kap is the 2nd oldest fraternity in the country. Phi Tau was the first coed fraternity at Dartmouth College, all the more notable given the initial acrimony when the College first integrated. Given that the primary argument for deletion was based on the erroneous presumption that these articles refer to one chapter out of hundreds or more, when in fact, these are unique organizations, I ask that the articles on Phi Tau, Kappa Kappa Kappa, and Alpha Chi Alpha be kept. --Jedsa 04:16, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, the cited AfD's were all local chapters of national fraternities, and so could be merged with the national. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Phi_Delta_Alpha_76d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Phi Delta Alpha">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Phi Delta Alpha</a> was an article small enough to be merged with the list of fraternities, but these articles are more complete and well written.

<li><b>Keep</b> For one thing, it's bad form to nominate three separate (and arguably unrelated) articles for deletion in one vote. As others have noted, the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phi_Tau_c98d.html" title="Phi Tau">Phi Tau</a> article, for example, is not about a local chapter of a national fraternity, but an independent organization that has its own unique history. In fact, the history section is a very notable component of this article, as it documents the fraternity's decision to break away from the national fraternity organization over the issue of segregation. I don't think that could be adequately rolled into a sentence or two in a larger article. The fact that these articles get a paragraph or two summary mention in another article is no more a reason for their deletion than, say, deleting <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_in_Brazil_d4a0.html" title="Religion in Brazil">Religion in Brazil</a> would be justified because religion is mentioned in a paragraph or two of the main article about <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>.--<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKharker_c115.html" title="User:Kharker">Kharker</a> 15:40, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with several of the above comments regarding the fact that this is a unique and local fraternity, as opposed to a national fraternity with dozens or hundreds of chapters. In addition, one should consider the history and interesting name as facts that add to its value. 23:25, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with many of the statements above concerning the uniqueness of local chapter history and individuality. It is important to keep in mind that unlike chapters of national fraternities, local houses are all individually autonomous organizations with networks of alumni that have been accumulating for decades. Each house is individually responsable for uniqiue social, campus, and community service initiatives. To merge these articles (not to mention delete them), would be a misrepresentation of the Dartmouth greek system and the greek system as a whole. 18:30, 8 February 2006</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Most of the above make a good point, but I see no reason not to allow a unique, individual house its own page. Though the metaphor is not entirely correct, it would be like deleting an individual church and just lumping it into the "Church" category. If it is, indeed, a truly unique environment, let it stay.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>- Alpha Chi deserves it's own page. it's a local fraternity and it's sweet. keep it please.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I agree with Smith120bh-- there is NO national chapter of Alpha Chi Alpha. It is a very unique house with it's own history; much of the information unique to this organization would have no place under the general Dartmouth Greek organizations entry.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I routinely tag these articles with clean up tags even if they are on AfD. This way if they survive AfD they will appear on the various cleanup lists for further attention. I don't think that the fact that an article is tagged as cleanup automatically gives it a pass to stay. This article, as it is written right now, has little or no context. Also, the fact that an article is on AfD does not preclude it from being cleaned up.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Non-notable cafe. Sounds like small music venues that exist dozens-at-a-time in every community in the civilized world. Not sure what happened with the reviews.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Another one of those <i>Cambridge, Massachusetts</i> articles that've been popping up on AfD during the past few days. While there are references to this venue (i.e., even the more specific <i>+"all asia cafe"+cambridge</i> yields 12,400 hits), the article itself reads more like a restaurant review than an encyclopedic article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a travel guide.</a> --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 05:50, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. While I completely agree with the second sentence of the nomination, I don't think that makes it non-notable or non-encyclopedic. Perhaps I am becoming an inclusionist, but it's an institution in its area, and that's good enough for me. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 05:53, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not every small café deserves their own article. Furthermore, the precedent seems to be to delete articles on small local businesses even if they have local notability (I remember a couple such articles about restaurants in Princeton coming to AfD; I voted "weak keep" on both and I think they both failed.) I'm sure this café is less notable than those places. On top of that, I think a lot of bars and cafés here in Minneapolis will get a high google number because they're listed on a lot of local venue sites, band sites and other such crud. Nonetheless, the only such venues in Minneapolis that deserve an article are probably the Quest (venue) and <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Avenue_db93.html" title="First Avenue">First Avenue</a>. I would hate to see thousands of local café articles and this could set a really bad precedent. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka">Grandmasterka</a> 06:53, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't see where this place is an "an institution in its area" as Bikeable said. The links on the article certainly don't support that.

<li><b>Keep</b> but merge the other seasons into one big article. There's plenty of movie references on The Simpsons, and with it being one of the most notable shows in the history of TV, I don't see why they shouldn't be covered. Possibly, TV references and the like could also be included and the whole thing changed to "Cultural references" or similar. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 12:54, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, but where are their dedicated power grids under existing highways and pick-up/drop-off units for the batteries at exits?

Are wiki pages only for projects that you can go to the store and buy? There are many aspects to active development that are done prior to physically putting nuts and bolts together. The car is notable now because it is a ready-to-go design that solves many of the foreign oil dependencies that are such hot topics right now. Skweiner 17:58, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>We wish the car the best, and hope it succeeds, and once it does, please come back and make sure the article is well-written.

Some <a href="../../../f/u/t/Category%7EFuture_products_e7eb.html" title="Category:Future products">future products</a> are found on Wikipedia, but typically they're by established notable companies, where the likelihood of the product being released soon is very high. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 01:30, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep if cleaned up</b>. Currently much vanity in the article, but I think he is notable enough. <i>DeVol appears on national television and radio programs to discuss a variety of economic topics such as CNN’s "Moneyline" and NPR’s "Talk of the Nation."

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. Obviously not standard vanity, as the author worked on dozens of articles that aren't particularly related. An article shouldn't be deleted simply because its author didn't properly wikilink the content and holds a favorable view of its subject. As <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> notes, there doesn't seem to be any genuine notability dispute. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 15:36, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Cyber per se is an "English" word that means more than Information Technology or the Internet or E-commerce. Cyberservices therfore enhaces the e-services which can be wider and more modern if not the "in" thing for the real world of Computers as most games use this term too. I am for rentention of this term due mainly that the English language is an alive language that need more useful and more meanigful "terms" to keep it in most contemporary, illustrative abd descriptive about the Internet related services.

<li>In the guidelines, <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid_neologisms</a> does not state that a neologism is automatically deleted, but suggests a "google" test. There are over 100,000 hits in Google, and over 10,000 hits in Groups! Further, if you do a search within results, you will find that this term is over 10 years old, having been in use since 1995. Perhaps the most <b>notable</b> proponent of this term in the USA is the <a href="http://www.google.com/u/NCSA?sitesearch=www.ncsa.uiuc.edu&amp;q=cyberservices" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/u/NCSA?sitesearch=www.ncsa.uiuc.edu&amp;q=cyberservices" rel="nofollow">National Center for Supercomputing Applications</a>of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

<li><b>Very weak keep</b>. It's not a neologism; if anything, it's a word that <i>was</i> in wide use in the early (commercial) Internet era and even previously, but has now been largely supplanted by other, more specific terms referring to particular services, ranging from <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_commerce.html" title="Electronic commerce">electronic commerce</a> to <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_banking.html" title="Online banking">online banking</a>. The "cyber-" prefix seems to have peaked in the 1990s. I would keep it as a historical concept, but note that is is now somewhat of an archaicism, with a list of links to more up-to-date articles. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 18:10, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I concur with MCB on NCSA's use of "cyberservices". NCSA is a research institution; its historic use of "cyberservices" is unrelated to this article's use of cyberservices.

It seems like a euphemism used by developing countries to make industries like <a href="../../../c/a/l/Call_center.html" title="Call center">call centers</a> sound more exciting. If that is the case then it should be documented as such. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_8.html" title="February 8">02-08</a>&#160;22:10<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span></li>

<p>I was cleaning this up and the more I cleaned it up the more I doubted it. It is the sole work of User:Heavenonearth, who has no other contributions, and conveniently forgot to mention that most of the "several doctoral degrees" are from unaccredited institutions, or that the one that wasn't was from an institution accredited only to first professional degree level. The "more than twnenty books" drops to two when you go to Amazon, and the sales ranks are 350,000 and 650,000 respectively (although it is a "proper" publisher, albeit one which restricts itself to evangelical Christian output - reviewing the authors list, nons leapt out at me as names I recognise but it's a couple of decades since I was active in the evangelical movement). It has been edited by Gastrich and socks, which does not <i>necessarily</i> make it <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">vanispamcruftisement</a> but does raise a red flag.

<dd>comment: Afd is not a place to present ultimatums, you cannot say improve this or it will be deleted.

<dd>However, I can call for scrapping most/all of the current content, and creating a proper article instead. Claims of scientific foreknowledge in the Koran (and Bible) may well deserve a mention in an encyclopedia, if presented in the proper way, but I hope we can agree that the current article is useless and needs to be disposed of. - <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Rosoft_96ed.html" title="User:Mike Rosoft">Mike Rosoft</a> 10:05, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Would that be disposed of so that people could build on its existing content? This isn't a one strike and your out system. I don't quite see how "needs improvement" became equated to the "needs to be deleted for XYZ policy violations" we so frequently see.--<a href="../../../p/y/p/User%7EPypex_3906.html" title="User:Pypex">Pypex</a> 22:40, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To say that this article needs improvement is a gross understatement. In its current form it simply has no place in an encyclopedia, and no article at all is better than this one. I don't think it would be of any use as a basis for an actual entry, either; but if somebody (you?) wants to, I won't prevent him. But the condition is that there must be somebody interested in it. Until/unless this happens, there is no reason to keep it around indefinitely. (After all, it can always be undeleted should there be any need for it.) - <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Rosoft_96ed.html" title="User:Mike Rosoft">Mike Rosoft</a> 22:31, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry about this, I really am, but I keep coming back to this one. What troubles me here is that the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Francis_Muir_5bfa.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Francis Muir">original AfD</a> got bogged down in personalities and meatpuppetry, and the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Francis_Muir_%28Second_nomination%29_d046.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Francis Muir (Second nomination)">second debate</a> did not actually address the fundamental issue: it's all very well for <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarvatus_255c.html" title="User:Larvatus">Larvatus</a> to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proof_by_assertion.html" title="Proof by assertion">assert</a> that this is a "notable and well-loved" Usenet personality, but that's not actually evidence as such. I have spent some time looking around this one and found that (a) he has fewer Usenet posts in the archives than I do, despite an allegdly much longer history (yes, quality beats quantity, but the entries are often mundane). His publication list is short, not indicating a prominent academic, and a Google search also turns up under a third of the hits that I get. I am absolutely convinced of my non-notability, so I find my self asking: why are we keeping an article on someone who is apparently less notable in the fields for which he is supposedly notable? Especially when its creator and main defender is a self-confessed blowhard who has a history of questionable judgment (see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_WebEx_and_Min_Zhu_67fe.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/WebEx and Min Zhu">this arbitration case</a> and this <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Larvatus_079f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Larvatus">deleted vanity autobiography</a>). So I come back to comparing with standards I can visualise. My friend Tony Raven is a long-time Usenet poster, who Googles more than Muir and turns up more on the archives; he has a publiscation list, a PhD, is director of Southampton University's spinoff programme and has started a few moderately successful companies. I guess if the bar is set at the Muir level I ought to be clicking that red link. But I don't think it is (although my personal standards for notability are quite likely above the community norms). - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 13:21, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, seems notable enough, with a decent list of publications and fame on Usenet. He even had an asteroid named after him, which is more than can be said for a lot of people who have their own Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 14:36, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think the subject meets notability standards independent of the asteroid; but I also think the asteroid naming itself indicates notability. If it's worth listing the asteroid names (as Wikipedia does), it makes no sense to exclude identification of the individuals asteroids are named for. "Who was Mr/Ms X" is a reasonable question for someone looking at that list to ask, and, since Wikipedia isn't running out of cyberspace, it's a reasonable question for Wikipedia to answer. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 15:14, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Cleanup</b> — The person looks notable enough, but for me, the fact that there are "alternate nicknames" for this person really drag down the article. I suppose he is an active contributor to Usenet, but I'm an active contributor to MSN Messenger, yet nobody calls me by my nickname,&#160;;-) I suggest that the usenet references (particularly) the names be removed.

<p>The article seems like nonsense. It has been over a decade since I saw the <i>Transformers</i> episode <i>"The Gambler"</i> so I don't remember whether this character actually appears in it or not, but judging by Google hits, this character doesn't exist in <i>Transformers</i>. "Gyconi" gets Google hits from Transformers sites, "Don Paquito" only gets Google hits about a hotel in some Spanish-speaking holiday resort. I also searched Google for "Vegeres", which the article mentions but fails to explain what it is, and got no sensible results. Also note that the Gyconi article was full of mentions of Batman, Robin and the Joker on Cybertron, which anyone who spends all his life in his parents' basement watching 24-hours <i>Transformers</i> marathons knows to be utter rubbish, as the copyrights of those characters belong to different companies. I think this is some kind of joke article. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 14:14, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Distinguished professorship is generally given by the faculty member's University.

<dd>I said it was a sufficient claim/assertion of notability to meet the Wikipedia threshold in that regard, not that it proved notability. The original nomination for deletion indicated no claim/assertion of notability. And I would think it should be apparent that an academic who achieves tenure and an endowed chair is, by objective standards, more notable than any of the minor celebrities (pornographic video performers, unsigned draft choices by professional sports leagues, Pokemon characters, etc) who are by consensus deemed notable. And I'm puzzled by the argument, often seen here, that an individual is no more notable than anyone else having the same credentials, bypassing the question of whether simply having the credentials is itself notable. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 15:17, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Kinu argues that the title of <i>Distinguished Professor</i> isn't good to go by. 45 papers in 27 years isn't so much, especially for a clinician, who can gather large amounts of data from the patient that he treats. Besides, the journals that he publishes in (Neurology, J. Neuroimmunology, Ann. NY Acad. Sci) are on the weak side. Aand let's look at it like this: if he was known for any advance in the field this fact would occur to anyone in that field and it would say so in the article. Instead, the article is a collection of biographical trivia, nothing beyond a CV. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 01:50, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>On what do you base your assertion that Neurology (Lippincott-Williams-Wilkins, informally the "Green Journal") is a journal that is "on the weak side?"

<li>I'd call <i>Neuron</i> a strong journal. <i>Brain</i> is also good, then there is <i>J. Phys.</i>.

<li>Those journals are indeed strong journals. However, none of them even will even consider a paper that has to do with clinical neurology.

<li>Are you asserting that the title of Distinguished Professor at the University of North Carolina can be bought? You're going to need to prove that, because it's a pretty wild assertion. There's no way UNC would have conferred this title on Dr. Howard without the consensus of their Academic Senate, no matter how much endowment was offered. Also, if you read his articles, he's pretty clearly a leader in the field of single-fiber EMG for myasthenia diagnosis; he pioneered major refinements in the technique.

<p>Seasonal spacefiller from Forbes magazine. I don't believe a list of fictional characters lited in order of made-up net worth is encyclopaedic at all, at best there could be a small note that it happened on the Forbes article to show they have at least a rudimentary sense of humour.

<li>Every shred of info about any of the characters is made-up. The characters are fictional. However, Forbes is good for nothing if it isn't good for its list, so why not add it to the articles.

<li>I would dispute the assertion that Forbes is "good for nothing if not good for this list" since the ability to pluck a figure form the air for the net worth of Scrooge McDuck hardly speaks to the fitness of Forbes to cover real-world issues.

<li><b>Keep and expand</b> - I recall seeing a fair amount of news coverage on the 2005 list (which is linked), but the page only has the 2002 list. Shouldn't be too hard to write out an intro paragraph and incorporate new information. The list provides an interesting reflection on pop culture and social values. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Graham_a3b5.html" title="User:William Graham">waffle iron</a> 23:21, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> or Smerge. Lots of magazines have annual columns; doesn't make them notable enough for their own article. I would bet that the majority of the Forbes regulars don't even have Wikipedia articles. This article is just a reproduction of the Forbes article and is borderline copyvio. I recall that there were a number of errors and omissions in the 2005 version; it was just in fun and doesn't hold up to scrutiny. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">02-07</a>&#160;00:12<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Someone recently raised concerns over the copyright status of such lists but had to be selected by a panel not a vote to have status.

<li>You raise a valid point. Not deleting this article is postponing the inevitable. We are almost knocking on the door of such lists not being a part of WP policy. Hundreds of such lists have already by deleted. That's why I say merge, since the information is of interest though, and Forbes is both notable and verifiable.--<a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEsprit15d_69ef.html" title="User:Esprit15d">Esprit15d</a> 14:24, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

As this is a web resource, vanity article or not "probably" is not an excuse. And wher are the standards set to define that?

<dd>True, but since 62,960 of these are from their own homepage I stilll dont think this is a very good result.

<li>Keep. Why are people saying "Wikipedia is not a commercial, for-profit advertisement service."? This is in no way a commmercial or for-profit website. The people running the website have no particular interest in getting more people to the site since virtually every law student at a big school is aware of it already. A ton of far less notable sites have unchallenged wikipedia entries because they deal with computer- or technology-related topics that wikipedia editors are typically more interested in. I have no affiliation with the site and thus no "vanity" interest - I'm just saying that this site is definitely well-known among a large group of people and is thus undoubtedly encyclopedic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> If Brian Leiter's Philosophy Gourmet deserves a page, this site surely deserves a page. The list of posters is a quick reference for posters new to the board who have trouble with the way the board works. Unlike other message boards, there are no avatars, no personal pages, no sigs, no images, nothing. It is helpful to have a place to find basic information about the most influential people on the board. As someone who has been using Xoxohth for most of its existence, I recognize many on the list of prolific posters. I would hardly expect this to be the case with new posters. The acronyms section is also indispensable to users who are new to the board. Otherwise, there's a steep learning curve to properly use and understand the board. 208.63.200.3 02:58, 2 August 2005 (UTC) (Graham Wellington, QC [as above])</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Keep. This website is an extremely valuable source of information for those either going to law school or thinking about going to law school. This website is starting to be mentioned by scholars (Posner, Leiter) and has been mentioned by the Dean of Admissions at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. This website is growing and more people will be looking for information on it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Very strong keep. This website is becoming a more and more important source of information to law students and even to admissions committees of law schools. As a result, people outside of XOXOHTH have begun taking notice of this site. The Dean of Admissions at the University of Pennsylvania Law School has mentioned XOXO, as have legal scholars such as Brian Leiter. The relevance of this website is continually growing, and soon each of the 100,000+ prospective law students per year want to learn more about XOXO.</li>

<p>there is obviously an atempt on the part of biased parties here to keep legitimate studios from being listed. Asiaerotica is a pioneer in its genere, and the attempt to delete information on the studio is tantamount to censorship of a REAL and VALID part of the online adult industry landscape. Wikipedia is not there to support the vested intrest of an intrenched few, it's about listing and giving information on the full diversity of the subject matter at hand. This is especially important with regard to groups like Asiaerotica which seek to "think different" about the adult industry. Obviously, some here deem that important to suppress. Who's profits are they trying to protect? And where is the central "authority" on what is a legitimate and valid "adult" endevour? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Chinggism (<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChinggism_1358.html" title="User talk:Chinggism">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chinggism_145a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chinggism">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Leave as is Well it is beginning to look like the "porno" section on Wikipedia is a popularity contest. To delete valid information is censorship. And I dont mind incuring the ire of the powers here that be. It is obvious that information to supress information on a valid producer, no matter how "obscure" by whomever's standards is biased in my opinion. There is no accepted academic board on this topic. There are vested commercial intrests and those that seek to warm up to them. I feel that to delete the entry, espcially in this field is an attempt to limit imformation on what is going on in this genre to the same crap that is popped up in our faces at every turn on the web. No matter how many usernames you submit under.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Chinggism (<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChinggism_1358.html" title="User talk:Chinggism">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chinggism_145a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chinggism">contribs</a>).</small></p>
