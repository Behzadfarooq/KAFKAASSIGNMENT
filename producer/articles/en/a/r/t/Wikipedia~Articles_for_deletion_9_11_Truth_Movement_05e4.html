<p>This suffers from the same faults as the recently-deleted <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_7_7_Truth_Movement_0fd2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/7/7 Truth Movement">7/7 Truth Movement</a>, which is to say that there does not seem to be any evidence that this movement actually exists. (As one user says on the talk page, " Every time I stumble across this article, I'm confused about just what exactly is the "Movement"?") The article cites numerous books by various authors, speeches by various politicians, studies by various academics, protests by various groups, and even famous individuals such as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Sheen_87eb.html" title="Charlie Sheen">Charlie Sheen</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Flynt_1649.html" title="Larry Flynt">Larry Flynt</a>. What it does not cite is any evidence that these people belong to any common organisation, or even that they are in sympathy with each other. This article appears to be very carefully written, constructed to give the impression of impartiality, while in its very existence it promulgates the idea of a single "movement". As such, it violates Wikipedia guidelines on original research and opinion. The most notable groups and individuals questioning the official 9/11 narrative are listed at the category "Alternative theories of September 11, 2001 attacks". In making this nomination, I am explicitly not questioning the validity of questioning the American government's description of the events surrounding 9/11, but I am urging the community to <b>delete</b> this specific misleading article. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 10:46, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Either keep or merge it with the article "Alternative theories of September 11, 2001 attacks" (maybe as a re-direct) but <b>Do Not</b> delete it. If it is merged or re-directed, then all of this information should be in the "Alternative theories" entry (maybe a sub-section of that page can be called "9/11 Truth Movement" and all of this information can be copied accross.).

<li>valid point, but perhaps we need to apply a standard for notability as a movement. certainly, the civil rights and other "movements" have been referred to as such by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Can the same be established for the 9/11 Truth Movement? --mtz206 19:25, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. For me, the sole real requirement of a movement is that it is moving in a definable direction. According to this article, half of the 9/11 Truth Movement believes there were no terrorists, half believe there were but the government helped them. Half are communists, half are right-wingers. Half want a Congressional enquiry, half want a revolution... you get the picture. I don't think this is a question of notability, just existence. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 20:43, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Movements can have fairly diverse beliefs and goals. The Civil rights movement encompassed MLK and Malcolm X. The <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-life_movement.html" title="Pro-life movement">Pro-life movement</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-abortion_movement.html" title="Anti-abortion movement">Anti-abortion movement</a> encompasses people opposed to ending all life (fetus or adult) and those who would bomb abortion clinics. I can't really speak for the 9/11 truth movement, but the unifying belief seems to be a desire for more information about 9/11 than is currently available, not conspiracy theories about what happened (although that defines a segment of the movement). I think it's reasonable to expect that sources other than WP refer to it as a movement. If not, that may mean the article should be retitled and/or refocused, not necessarily deleted, although that could be an option. An Amazon.com search brings up <i>9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA</i> <i>Inside Job: Unmasking the 9/11 Conspiracies</i> and <i>9/11 Revealed&#160;: The Unanswered Questions</i> using the phrase, though these would all seem to be ones written from advocates for it. Google books also brings up <i>Unhinged: Exposing Liberals Gone Wild</i> and <i>A Real 9/11 Commission.</i> Google scholar<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%229%2F11+truth+movement%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%229%2F11+truth+movement%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and Google news<a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=%229%2F11+truth+movement%22&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=%229%2F11+truth+movement%22&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> turn up hits too. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Ð¨Ð¸Ð·Ð¾Ð¼Ð±Ð¸</a> 21:46, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

There is also a veteran's 9/11 truth group. As a movement, they hold local and national meetings within the United States and in other countries. It would be an insult to all these people to not respect them as belonging to a movement, which they claim to do, in the Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'll build on my sentiments and repeat my question noted above: while many historical movements also represent a loose group of people, they have gained such notability/notoriety as a "movement" mostly due to media and popular culture <i>calling</i> them a "movement."

<li><b>Comment:</b> The 9/11 truth movement's common goal is to question the official account (which <i>is</i> the media account) of what happened on 9/11. According to Princeton University's <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=movement" class="external text" title="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=movement" rel="nofollow">WordNeta lexical database for the English language</a>"movement" may be defined as "a group of people with a common ideology who try together to achieve certain general goals". <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/45/M0454500.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61/45/M0454500.html" rel="nofollow">The American Heritage Dictionary</a>defines "movement" as " "an organized effort by supporters of a common goal". The 9/11 truth movement has held many national and international meetings since 2002, with a common goal to answer the many and disturbing questions which were not addressed by the 9/11 Commission Report. Therefore it would be an act of censorship for Wikipedia to deny this entry in the encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPureLogic_0f7c.html" title="User:PureLogic">PureLogic</a> 21:55, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The so-called movement, according to this article, have no common ideology. They have no common goals. They share a scepticism about official accounts, but for wildly differing reasons. The example of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_King_d548.html" title="Martin Luther King">Martin Luther King</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_X_92fd.html" title="Malcolm X">Malcolm X</a> given above demonstrates this - they may have had wildly differing personal beliefs and ways of achieving their goals, but they also shared a common drive towards a more equal society, where "black" did not mean "second class". The people gathered together in this article do not share a clear perception of the current state of affairs, or a common goal (at least according to the article), and they are not working together to acheive anything. The 9/11 truth movement, as a formal organisation, does not exist and has not held a single national or international meeting since 2001. Specific groups have. It is an example of the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> bias of this article that these groups are being lumped together as a non-existent movement, when some of them deserve their own articles, and some are just, if you'll excuse the term, a couple of loons with a photocopier and/or access to email. All verifiable information on individual groups from this article should be kept in some form or another, just not in this one, POV-pushing place. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 08:39, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> This discussion seems to have boiled down to whether or not the <i>collection of groups, individuals, and researchers questioning the official account of 9/11</i> can be called a movement. Crucially, if the definition of 'Movement' is judged by the community to be misleading then should the article be deleted, or should the term <i>9/11 truth movement</i> be renamed to use more clearly defined terms, such as <i>9/11 truth demographic</i>? 81.156.195.227 23:52, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's just silly. How do people talk: "The rank-and-file among protesters are becoming more interested in the 9/11 truth movement."

<li><b>Keep</b> Belive me when I say that I understand the anger at the massive POV pushing by some users who follow this movement here. I've had to deal with alot of it and am quite frankly tired of some administrators who do nothing to stop it because of fear of "looking like a bad guy" because the users are organized here and would gang up on them calling them "unfair". But this, unlike the "7/7 Truth Movement", actually has some backing in the U.S. and does name itself by the name "truth movement" which in my honest opinion does not make the title "POV". If the administrators and users actually want to do something about the mass POV pushing in 9/11 articles, instead of deleting articles that reasonably deserve a page on Wikipedia they should demand that admins do something about the revert wars/POV pushing that goes on in every single 9/11 article on wikipedia. Not just warnings and reverts but actual blocks and bans for POV pushing and refusal to adhere to the consensus. Otherwise we'll be at this forever.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 23:54, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The most casual investigation is enough to show that this, in fact, is a grassroots 'movement'. This movement does have a diversity of points of view, but they all coalesce around an underlying conviction that the truth, far from being properly revealed, seems to be purposely hidden. Considering the immense change brought to our â€˜post 911 worldâ€™, the truth about that day must be made plain and clear. The 911 Commission Report did more to raise questions than to answer them. Now, as more government secrecy and apparent deception comes to light each day, large numbers of people demand answers. All the elements of a â€˜movementâ€™ are therefore present; thereâ€™s a focus, a welling of popular interest, and a resistance by authorities to satisfy this search for truth. --<a href="../../../k/o/l/User%7EKolateral_339b.html" title="User:Kolateral">Kolateral</a> 04:24, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

Half the nation believes in the official story and half the nation doesn't- for exact figures see the latest Zogby Poll results at <a href="http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20060522022041421" class="external free" title="http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20060522022041421" rel="nofollow">http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20060522022041421</a>. There is an enormous attempt to drown out the most serious issues raised by the 9-11 Truth Movement with Straw Men attacks, disinformation, and of course heavily subsidized propaganda pieces produced cooperatively by the government and corporate interests. We don't know how long it will take for the 9-11 Truth Movement to come of age, but according to Bill Moyer's MAP of the Eight Stages of Social Movements, so well articulated in his book- Doing Democracy <a href="http://www.newsociety.com/bookid/3694" class="external free" title="http://www.newsociety.com/bookid/3694" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsociety.com/bookid/3694</a>, we are entering Stage Four- The Take Off Stage. After years of activism, street demonstrations, organizing, the mainstream television network news is interviewing 9-11 Truth activists on the evening news, and we are being featured on the front pages of newspapers. Another major international 9-11 Truth Conference will be held in Chicago June 2-4th. All social movements pave the way for those to come and build upon the work of those before them. Humanity has never been faced with so many serious problems; the Truth Movement's experiences/history will help the movements that follow it, if humanity is to learn, evolve, survive and thrive.``Carol Brouillet</li>

<li><b>Keep, absolutely</b> - The term "9/11 Truth Movement" covers any group of people who question the official story of 9/11. It does not signify a particular organization, such as the "9/11 Truth Alliance" or "From the Wilderness". An organization such as <a href="../../../a/n/s/ANSWER_Coalition_1a54.html" title="ANSWER Coalition">ANSWER</a> might have a faction that is interested in promoting the "9/11 Truth Movement". This is a term of discourse that is widely used. I can do a wikipedia search for <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_movement.html" title="Peace movement">Peace movement</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_literary_movements.html" title="List of literary movements">List of literary movements</a> and get a result. Similarly, it is of value to keep this topic, because I have a feeling the "9/11 Truth Movement" will be ongoing for quite some time and some folks might like to know about it even if others wish it didn't exist. As to the aspersion "POV Fork": has anybody noticed the incredible volume of content that is posted on this topic? There are folks who would like to document a cultural phenomenon and this is a legitimate place to do that. Wikipedia has room for these pages, it is not wrong to have them, except that some people, arguable with their own point of view, do not like this point of view and wish to quash it by resorting to every nasty wikipedia trick they can find. Even if the 9/11 Truth Movement is wrong, and 9/11 was in fact everything the mass media says it was--basically 19 Arab hijackers who were able to pull off the crime of the century, nothing more, nothing less--<b>why shouldn't the opinions of those people be documented</b>? Some might argue that the world is <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_earth.html" title="Flat earth">flat</a> and that it's <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turtles_all_the_way_down.html" title="Turtles all the way down">Turtles all the way down</a>; I notice that wikipedia documents those ideas. Should those articles be put up for deletion as POV, or maybe they should be merged together? I dare even one of the proponents of deleting <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_Truth_Movement_a967.html" title="9/11 Truth Movement">9/11 Truth Movement</a> to propose such an action.

<li><b>Keep</b> There seems to be a misunderstanding, this group wants more information and a new investigation, that is their common goal. MLK and Malcolm X both wanted equality for blacks, though they believed it was possible via different channels.

It is errie how these are being put up for deletion so close in time, no insinuation meant. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0faults</a> 19:55, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The title is misleading. The word 'truth' in '911 Truth Movement' is a form of <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspeak.html" title="Newspeak">newspeak</a>. There isn't really any truth involved in the actual movement. Which really isn't a movement either.

<li><b>Keep</b> Though I've commented above, I hadn't actually made an explicit recommendation yet. I disagree that this article presents the same case as the "7/7 truth movement", that it is not a movement, and that it is not notable. I don't see strong reasons for deleting the article, only for improving it. I would recommend that the article be retitled <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_truth_movement_3d2e.html" title="9/11 truth movement">9/11 truth movement</a> (lowercase) though. While some might not like the name, movements, etc. are given the name they themselves use. For example, the article on the U.S. <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_spying_program.html" title="Domestic spying program">domestic spying program</a> is called by its euphemistic name <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist_surveillance_program.html" title="Terrorist surveillance program">Terrorist surveillance program</a> since that is the more or less official name. My recommendation does not constitute an endorsement of the group, only a position on whether it warrants an article. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Ð¨Ð¸Ð·Ð¾Ð¼Ð±Ð¸</a> 07:07, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into one of the existing articles that cover this viewpoint already, for that is what it seems to be, a viewpoint rather than a movement. <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">CovenantD</a> 15:37, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
