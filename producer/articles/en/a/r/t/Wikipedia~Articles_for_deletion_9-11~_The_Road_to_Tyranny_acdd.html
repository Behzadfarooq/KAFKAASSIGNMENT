<dd>Wikipedia is not <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDB_38d9.html" title="IMDB">IMDB</a>. Stub is never meant to be a permanent status. In this case, it's far more useful to have it point to <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Jones_9070.html" title="Alex Jones">Alex Jones</a> and give it the context of a series from that documentary maker than have an essentially empty stub. As the sparse IMDB site indicates, there's very little promise for the article on its own. As it stands it's just pushing the agenda of the film. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 14:45, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's no media coverage of this film whatsoever, no Ghits other than people pushing the film, no critical third-party discussion of it or its contents, and short of transcribing the film (and using WP as Alex Jones' soapbox), what would go in this article?

<dd>I'm not saying delete <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Jones_%28journalist%29_0860.html" title="Alex Jones (journalist)">Alex Jones</a>. I'm not saying we shouldn't talk about his documentaries.

This movie was already on WP prior to the creation of this article, and would have been much better served with a redirect to <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Jones_%28journalist%29_0860.html" title="Alex Jones (journalist)">Alex Jones (journalist)</a> than the POV-pushing content that currently exists.--<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 19:09, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article has not been improved at all by recent edits. I do not know what WTS 01 and NWO are supposed to stand for, and this article presumes that I do. Likewise, the "Burning of Rom" means nothing to me. Rome? Or are we talking about ROMs? This is not encyclopedic, it is a list of things that happen in a possibly nonnotable film, and even if it were to receive the huge amount of cleanup that it demands, I seriously doubt whether the result could ever be appropriate here. I can't imagine this being useful in an encyclopedia. When people want movie reviews, they go to IMDB.

<li>What I guess that it would really need to be encyclopedic would be reactions to the film from both supporters and detractors of Jones. Also, the archive.org batting average is a pretty good indication of notability, but I wouldn't mind seeing further evidence (comments on it by noted academics would go a long way).

<li><b>keep</b>: Significant project of very noteworthy individual. Again, this sort of AfD seems to serve no other purpose, aside from being a distraction, than to dismantle articles that do not conform with the nominator's pov. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 21:41, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>When the article was AFD'd it consisted of nothing more than a quote from the movie for the specific purpose of citing for a discussion on <a href="../../../s/e/p/Talk%7ESeptember_11%2C_2001_attacks_4957.html" title="Talk:September 11, 2001 attacks">Talk:September_11,_2001_attacks</a>. Striver has since attempted to improve the article to encyclopedic standards but has only a movie outline and metadata (user comments) from archive.org. There's sources for this article other than the movie itself. I'm not asking to dismantle it, I'm saying that properly belongs on <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Jones_%28journalist%29_0860.html" title="Alex Jones (journalist)">Alex Jones (journalist)</a> until there's enough content for it to stand on its own. I'm holding off on editing the article to give Striver a good faith attempt to create an encyclopedic entry, but if you reduced this article by <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, you'd be left with nothing more than already exists on [[Alex Jones (journalist).

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I'm sorry if you took it that way. Without actually looking up the definition of "bogus", I basically take it to mean "not valid".

<dd>Hello, I'm Alex Jones, a syndicated radio and television host based in Austin, Texas. And for many years I have been exposing the criminal activities of the global elite, also known as the New World Order. And this collection of power mad megalomaniacs has been using a successive string of terrorist events to usher in their corrupt world government. A world government where populations (their own documents show) will be herded into compact cities, will be issued national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips. But in this film we are first going to look at some historical examples of tyrants and governments and oligarchies alike using crises, in many cases terrorist events that they themselves perpetrate against their population ...</dd>
