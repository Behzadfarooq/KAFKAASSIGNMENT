<li><b>Keep</b> on both accounts. The last time SRB2 was due up for AFD (four months ago or so) it was proven that the article needed some work, but was <i>far</i> from advertising. Googling "Sonic Robo-Blast 2" turns up 30,000 results, and several people have worked towards adding more information to the article to help prove it's notability (mentions in magazines, for example). Sonic: Time Attacked I'll give you - 470 results on Google. But I really like the fangame, and the website for it isn't even up anymore - how does that even constitute advertising if there's essentially nothing to advertise? Time Attacked is one of my favorite fangames, and, well, that's good enough for me. Here's a thought: If you're so worried about "peacock claims" (<i>man</i> I hate Wikipedia Slang), edit the article to remove them rather than jumping on the delete button. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 09:03, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Can you direct me to some notable mentions of the game in popular magazines? The only thing I can find is <a href="http://clipper.ship.edu/~af0916/srb2/press.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://clipper.ship.edu/~af0916/srb2/press.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which is on the Talk page, not the article. A couple fleeting mentions in single issues of publications don't exactly constitute notability in my view—neither do your subjective views of the game. I also don't see any information in the article supported by <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>. --<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowking_Man_5da9.html" title="User:Slowking Man">Slowking Man</a> 09:13, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Reviewing those scanned articles, these are really trivial mentions. One mention is one sentence and a screenshot, another is a screenshot and a caption, and one is a three-paragraph capsule that doesn't say much more than "This is a Sonic fangame using the Doom engine." They're not really substantial, and not sufficient material for an article. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:55, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Holy crap, you guys are like an inconsiderate, rabid pack of wolves! At the very least, keep SRB2. What might not seem notable to you might be very notable to somebody else, and the article has quite a bit of information on it. Besides, it's worth noting that Gamesmaster is actually a fairly popular gaming magazine in the UK, if I recall properly. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 21:32, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Notability is not a opinion, something is either notable or its not. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 21:35, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Bullshit. What's notable to you is might not be very notable to me. You think stuff about Wrestling is notable, so much so that you seem to support there being seperate articles dedicated to various <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_Saturday_Night%27s_Main_Event_results_f165.html" title="WWE Saturday Night's Main Event results">WWE events and outcomes</a>. That's not notable at all, to me. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 22:34, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>BlazeHedgehog is succinct at the very least. The assertion "Notability is not a [sic] opinion, something is either notable or its not," is so far off the radar that it touches the edge of psychopathology. Who would make such a self-centered statement except for a mind that exists in a universe of one or someone trolling for a bit of agro? <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 01:17, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>BS yourself. You may not like wrestling, but articles like SNNE ARE notable. I couldn't care less about things like Dora the Explorer, but they are notable. These fan games also fail <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 22:49, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>TJ Spyke not only seems to have missed BlazeHedgehog's point but is now actually making Blaze's point and refuting the one TJ made earlier. I strongly suspect mere trolling for the sake of starting a heated exchange. Notability is in the mind of the beholder unlike the lunacy about absolutes asserted here. Some people need to review what they write before entrying the fray in such a defenseless state--if their goal is to contribute and not subvert the process of discussion. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 01:17, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Again. Gamesmaster isn't exactly a small, trivial publication publication. To quote it's <a href="../../../g/a/m/GamesMaster_%28magazine%29_4932.html" title="GamesMaster (magazine)">Wikipedia article</a>; "GamesMaster is the biggest selling multi-format video games magazine in the United Kingdom, even outselling its critically acclaimed rival Edge." So the largest videogame magazine in the UK isn't notable enough? Might as well get rid of it's Wikipedia article, then, eh? And get rid of articles like Metroid Prime 2D, and, well, every other game featured in that Gamesmaster article (most, if not all of which, have Wikipedia articles, and, no doubt, Gamesmaster found them <i>through</i> Wikipedia). Infact, let's torch all homebrew software completely! I mean, have you ever seen <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cave_Story_6d82.html" title="Cave Story">Cave Story</a> printed in a magazine? I haven't! Get rid of it! It's full of weasel words! I mean, "the game has received praise from gamers worldwide."? There's no way to prove that! <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 22:55, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You might want to try reading <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, trivial mentions don't count. 1 sentence and a small picture is a trivial reference. Also, pointing out another article that shouldn't exist is NOT justification to keep another that doesn't. If you see an article that you think shouldn't exist, nominate it for deletion. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 23:02, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But I won't nominate it because I know it's notable. You see, I was being facetious. If I nominated it for deletion? A million Cave Story fans would come forth and smack me down, telling me "No, we like this game and it's notable". I'm sure SRB2 fans would likely do the same if they knew it was up for deletion, but guess what? I can't tell them otherwise I'll get accused of sock puppeting or whatever the hell it is you guys call it. And you don't consider that the slightest bit unfair? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 23:07, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd take on a million Cave Story or Halo Zero fans if I didn't already know about the substantial coverage of those games in game publications. If you went and found sources that could be used to write this article, then sure, I'd change my tune in a second. Until then, you're unlikely to convince anyone with handwaving. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 10:16, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>And Google results suddenly mean nothing towards popularity, now?

Infact, I am quite certain that had SRB2 been put up for AFD on it's own (instead of being lumped together with a long dead project under a blanket term), the result of this vote would be pretty much identical. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 10:54, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What matters is sources. The long-dead game is pretty much a non-issue; most of this discussion seem to be about Robo Blast, which is apparently somewhat popular but about which there isn't enough verifiable content to say anything. Come up with that content. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 11:02, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I just find it confusing that, here at Wikipedia, whether an article like this gets kept or deleted depends soley on which side of the bed you guys woke up on that particular day. What was a nearly unanimous keep turns sharply into a unanimous delete for what seems to be absolutely no reason whatsoever. It's like a roll of the dice, and unfortunately for SRB2, this roll came up snake-eyes. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 23:51, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't think that really means a whole lot, seeing as I doubt the PSP version will really get off the ground, and the DS version's mere homebrew. How is THAT particularly notable, then? The article I'm reading doesn't cite many, if any, major sources about its notability, and using ports of the title as notability seems pretty tenuous at best.

<li><b>Comment</b> First off, I'll save the zealots the time in stating that this is a single-purpose account and I am involved with the project. Honestly, I don't give a damn whether or not there is an article or not, but it just doesn't make sense in the internet age to immediately delete anything that doesn't have a specific licensed publisher for a console. I've met two random freshmen that came onto my college campus that knew about the game, one even playing it frequently, without me or any of my friends mentioning it. If the word of mouth is that strong, I simply do not see how it isn't notable, despite not being all the rage at Gamestop in bringing in the pre-orders.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I have said before, the article sucks. It keeps getting more and more fancruft added onto it every week, it seems, and its obviously subpar in terms of writing and setup. However, personally I'd consider that true on many articles about official parts of the Sonic series, and even worse, in many parts of the encyclopedia in general. Look at the article on <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Sonic_452d.html" title="Super Sonic">Super Sonic</a>. There's clearly an excessive amount of fancruft with no citations or any standard Wikipedia policy. I agree that passing mention in magazines is not assertion of notability, and neither is decent results on the Google test, however, if the main thing that decides whether or not something is notable at this point is whether a company made it or not, then Wikipedia has seriously dropped from its ideals. Whatever happened to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good faith</a> and old fashioned common sense? If policy is the only reason this article should be deleted, feel free, but please make sure to delete the rest of the fancruft swarming around the wiki, starting with the deletion of the articles on practically every video game character, feature, and backstory on here. They're clearly fancruft with no assertion of notability. I don't care if this article lives or dies as long as I see some consistency around here. -<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysticEsper_07d5.html" title="User:MysticEsper">MysticEsper</a> 09:20, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I'll just respond to the last part. Believe me, we are trying. But as you can see here, it's not as simple as just nominating something. The fancruft is getting out of hand, and there a dedicated few patrolling trying to scrub non-encyclopedic content from good articles, but remember that pretty much everytime someone removes some cruft, two more people add some to other articles, making it an uphill struggle. Don't take this personally, as it's neither an attack on you or this game, it's about whether or not the article conforms to Wikipedia polcies, and some people think it does and others think it doesn't. The problem is that people seem to get hung up on one particular policy and ignore the fact an article fails on other issues besides that. (<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is a good example of one that people focus on exclusively whilst ignoring other issues.) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 10:41, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Policies? I thought most of them were just guidelines, including the ones cited for reasons this article should get the boot. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 19:30, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Honestly, I don't see why there is so much enforcement of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> to begin with. Obvious vanity needs to die, but simply because something isn't the biggest thing in the world shouldn't nullify as it as important enough for an article. The real incredibly problematic part of notability, especially with web content, is how incredibly difficult it is for even genuinely notable internet material to find legitimate press coverage, especially in areas that simply aren't as gigantic as others. Unless something is some kind of gigantic runaway hit such as <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> or another similar phenominon and gets tons of press, I simply have no idea where I'd look to find sources. For instance, I have no idea where I'd find some press coverage, of, say, <a href="../../../8/-/b/8-Bit_Theater_2a8a.html" title="8-Bit Theater">8-Bit Theater</a>, but I wouldn't imagine going and trying to delete it for notability, because it's clearly popular and well-known in many circles, but even it only has the official website and forums linked as sources. The issue is that I'm sure someone who doesn't read webcomics at all could easily come and find said article and try to delete it as vanity/fancruft because they simply aren't familiar with it themselves, despite being a very well-known website. Where would one draw the line between notable and non-notable on internet projects/websites? The entire system seems incredibly vague here, and it's obviously clear that even Wikipedia doesn't know, as something that was a complete blowout as notable one AfD is now a nearly complete blowout in the opposite direction, when honestly practically nothing has changed in terms of the article content (and in fact, I'd say it's vastly improved in structure since the first time it was put up on AfD). There really needs to be some kind of tangible way to determine what is notable and what is not that isn't based on anyone's opinion, and as far as I'm aware, that simply doesn't exist. -<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysticEsper_07d5.html" title="User:MysticEsper">MysticEsper</a> 05:11, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep, renominate separately</b> I disagree with the lumping of these two articles together, which is totally non-standard; this is going the wrong about deleting two separate articles. SRB2 is a lot more notable than Sonic: Time Attacked, but both were notable last time I checked. That aside, <i>making the presumption that fan games are automatically non-notable is a <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallacies_of_definition.html" title="Fallacies of definition">fallacy of definition</a> and is simply not correct.</i> Can one prove unequivably that it something is not notable by lack of evidence? <i><a href="../../../d/e/n/Denying_the_antecedent.html" title="Denying the antecedent">No</a></i>.
