<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-13_3339.html" title="Edit section: [ [Offshore drilling in BC- by: Darren Wong] ]">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">[ [Offshore drilling in BC- by: Darren Wong] ]</span></h2>
<p>There are three moratoria that protect the B.C coast from offshore drilling; Provincial, Federal and First Nations. B.C. was the first to pass a moratorium in 1971 because they wanted to prevent Alaskan oil tankers from going through the Hecate Strait, Dixon Entrance and Queen Charlotte Sound (Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (g)) in order to protect the environment from oil spills. The Federal moratorium was introduced in 1972 when Canada decided not to approve any more West Coast offshore exploration permits. Thus for over 30 years at all levels of government it has been clear that the environmental risk from offshore oil has been judged to be too risky to accept. Currently there is a proposal to begin offshore oil drilling in British Columbia. Supporters argue this will economically benefit B.C. Even if this is true, the risks to the environment and First Nations cultures far outweigh the potential economic benefits. Offshore drilling is not the panacea for British Columbians since B.C. does not require salvation. Potential environmental damage is the greatest risk of offshore drilling. These risks are hard to estimate, numerous and complex. Environmental impacts will be felt from exploration, development as well as production. Seismic testing is an essential first step in the exploration for oil and gas. Air guns are used to send out bursts of sound into the rock looking for characteristics of oil-bearing strata beneath the ocean’s bottom. This noise is known to cause hearing, behavior and visual damage to fish, fish larvae and whale migration routes (Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (f)). Close-range seismic noise can seriously injure and even kill fish. The fish populations will continue to fall over a number of days. Seismic testing also disturbs birds causing them to abandon their nest and birds diving for prey would be exposed to the noise of the seismic survey operation. Following successful seismic testing, drilling is the next risky task that occurs with both exploration and development of offshore oil deposits. Rotary rigs are mounted on the seabed or free floating to find out if the strata’s contain oil. Mud is circulated through the drill string to remove drilled out rock cuttings. The disposal of rock and mud cuttings is a contaminant issue. Drill cuttings may settle on the seabed affecting the animals living in the sediments of the ocean floor. With that, the drill cuttings may be transported over larger areas due to the current. One product of drilling a well is produced water, it is initially 100 percent formation water but may be mixed with seawater when the injected water breaks through to the producing well. Produced water contains hydrocarbons, dissolved mineral salts, sulphur, barium, iron, strontium and small amounts of heavy metals and can range in pH from neutral to acidic. Cooling water is used to remove heat from equipment such as top-drives and draw-works. Seawater is drawn from the ocean and passed through a heat exchanger. When the seawater is in the heat exchanger, the water is deoxygenated and sterilized by electrolysis, which releases chlorine form the salt solution. The temperature of the cooling water may be 20 to 30 degrees over the ambient temperature. The seawater is then discharged back into the ocean. After successfully finding oil, commercial production is yet another risky stage. Oil spills could be from exploratory drilling which would release small amounts of oil or from actual oilrig production, which would have a greater chance of a large oil spill. Small oil spills may occur because of over activity in an area where the oil is getting drilled (Ministry of Mines, Energy and Petroleum Resources (a)). The B.C ferry, Queen of the North, had an estimated 220,000 liters of diesel fuel on board along with 23,000 liters of lubrication oil (CBC (c)), that is an example of a small oil spill. The Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 just off the coast of Alaska released 43, 216, 000 liters of oil (Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (a)). Thus, if a spill that large can happen there, it can happen here as well because our wind and tidal currents are similar to that of Alaskans. In 2002, the Prestige, a tanker that sank off the coast of Spain, released 562, 100 barrels of oil, which is equivalent to 89, 936, 000 liters of oil (Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (a)). This was considered to be 16th largest oil spill in the world (Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (a)). Offshore drilling in Newfoundland and Labrador had 138 spills less than 1,000 barrels during exploration drilling and production between 1997 and 2002 (Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (a)). The probability in Nova Scotia for a tanker carrying 150, 000 barrels of oil to spill is 1 in 83 (Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (a)). That could happen in B.C. As a British Columbian, I believe the one percent risk is not worth the threat. The proposed project in the Cook Inlet includes drilling of four exploratory wells and production of 140 million barrels of oil over a 20-year production period (Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (a)). The prediction is that there will be 484 small spills (less than 1,000 barrels), and a 19 percent probability of a large oil spill (more than 1,000 barrels) over the life of the project (Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (a)). This shows that spills are a common and inescapable occurrence in the offshore oil development. The Cook Inlet risk assessment estimates the risk of spills that B.C. can face. B.C. has a wide range of species; over four hundred species of fish, six thousand and five hundred species of invertebrates, a hundred and twenty one species of birds and twenty nine species of marine mammals (David Suzuki Foundation (d)) on the coast. Just exploration threatens these species. The severe wind and the tidal current patterns in B.C. would guarantee that oil would hit the coast and areas of great ecological and economic importance. An oil spill may cause fish to leave an area and fisheries can uptake hydrocarbons into commercial fish thus tainting fish flesh, giving it a foreign flavor and odor (Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (d)). This would have a tremendous negative impact on our fishing industry. The ensuing devastation of the ocean would obviously harm tourism, as well as the sports and commercial fishery (David Suzuki Foundation (b)). It would ruin the B.C. economy that we have worked so hard to build.</p>
<p>The Coastal, Haida, Da’naxda’xw, Gitxaala, Gwasala, Haisla, Heiltsuk Kitssumkalum and Qualicum first nation group along with many other first nation tribes also oppose lifting the Federal moratorium because of cultural and environmental concerns (CBC (e)). Currently the First Nations hold most of the power because their land claims have not been settled with the Federal and Provincial governments. The First Nations have rights and are entitled to make decisions about the use of their land; this includes regulating offshore oil development on their territory. The Haida nation has declared title over the Queen Charlotte Islands as well as the seabed resources of over half the Hecate Strait and 320 kilometers out into the Pacific Ocean (Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (a)). First Nation and treaty rights receive constitutional protection under section 35 of the Constitutional Act of 1982:</p>
<p>. . . . must be an element of practice, custom, or tradition integral to the distinctive culture of the aboriginal group claiming the right. To be integral, a practice, custom, or tradition must be of central significance to the aboriginal society in question-one of the things which may be the culture of the society distinctive. The practices or customs and traditions which constitute aboriginal rights are those which have continuity with the practices, customs, and traditions that existed prior to the contact with European society. . . . (Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (a)).</p>
<p>The First Nations have been in B.C. for thousands of years, establishing rich cultures and traditions based on the ocean environment. These cultures and traditions are immensely strong, especially their connections to life styles and economies that are dependent upon the resources of the land and sea (CBC (e)). An impact to the ocean will impact not only the food source itself, but the way of life of coastal people (CBC (e)). The risk to the livelihood of coastal First Nations is not worth the potential financial benefit that could be gained through offshore development, this is not even guaranteed. An oil spill may destroy everything, causing irreversible harm to the traditions and lifestyles of the First Nations. The Sinking of the Queen of the North has become increasingly worrisome for the First Nations regarding long-term impacts on traditional shellfish harvesting areas. As mentioned above, if offshore drilling occurs the potential for oil spills are extremely high. The wind pattern and currents patterns in B.C. would guarantee that the oil would hit the coast and areas of ecologic and economic importance (David Suzuki Foundation (d)), and irrevocably harm the First Nation environment. Further, it is unclear how they would benefit from the promised economic gain, yet they have the most to lose.</p>
<p>Even if there are great economic benefits, it is important to determine who benefits. The First Nations will not benefit from offshore drilling; it is more likely that their environment would be harmed because of it. Governmentally, the Federal government would not benefit as much as the provincial government. If oil is found, B.C. would end up wealthy and may be more likely to act independently of the Federal government. For example, health care is a provincial issue but the Federal government helps fund the province hoping that it will live up to Federal expectations. If the province is wealthy enough and does not like it, then the Province could act without Federal money and ignore Federal wishes. Alberta is currently thinking of this. The Federal government spent over $5 billion subsidizing the frontier exploration under the National Energy Program of the 1980s, it pumped out $1 billion in oil (David Suzuki Foundation (c)). “The true benefits are political. The BC government can say that it’s trying to jump-start the economy, and it gives some coastal communities hope that if they just wait long enough, their ship will come in. But that is merely wishful thinking - a fish tale - and for the sake of the coast’s ecology and economy, we mustn’t take the bait.” David Hocking (David Suzuki Foundation (c), 2001). B.C. derives the benefit and the Federal government is burdened with more of the risk.</p>
<p>The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a reciprocity treaty signed between Canada, the United States and Mexico. It states that if we find a resource (in this case oil), we would have to sell it to the United States and Mexico if they want the resource, at the same price we would sell it to Canadians (SICE Foreign Trade Information System). Many people argue that offshore drilling would create local jobs. In reality, that is just not the case. Very few jobs would be created per dollar invested (Ministry of energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (f)). Some long term specialized jobs may be created, which would need specially trained crew and may not be given to locals, but puts local jobs at risk (David Suzuki Foundation (d)). Some locals may be given jobs like servicing and fueling the vessels, but they would be short termed. Renewable energy like wind power creates twice the number of local jobs per dollar invested (David Suzuki Foundation (d)). John Hunter, B.C.’s oil and gas industry consultant, said that the industry has improved technology and safety standards to deal with potential environmental concerns. In 2004, the Terra Nova platform had a mechanical failure, which caused about 250 barrels of crude oil to be spilled in the waters 350 kilometers southeast of St. John’s, endangering many birds. Technology has definitely not improved well because this oil is now sitting over dozens of clam beds that are significant food sources for the First Nations (CBC (a)). People also think that since our technology has vastly improved we would successfully drill oil and benefit from it. They are somewhat correct. Technology obviously improved between 1970 and 2000; therefore they think we should drill because we have the technology to do so. But they did not realize that in those years the price of crude oil has also vastly increased. In the 30 years, technology has improved and the price of oil has significantly increased. Technology would just be getting better and better. So, what would we lose if we wait another 30 years? We would lose nothing! The technology for drilling would improve and the price of oil would be worth much more.</p>
<p>For over 35 years governments have understood that the environmental risk from the discovery and production of offshore oil and gas was too great and not worth the possible economic gain. B.C.’s economy is robust and depends on tourism and a healthy environment. We do not need the money at the expense of the environment or First Nation’s culture.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-13_3339.html" title="Edit section: Jerry's Alley">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jerry's Alley</span></h2>
<p>Jerry's Alley was the lounge of the Russell Hotel in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. Jerry's Alley, or "The Russell" as it was commonly known, was a unique place in Southern Ontario, as it was a virtual "Ground Zero" of the alternative music scene from the late 1970s through its demolition in 1996.</p>
<p>The Russell Hotel was owned by Jerry Russell, who was an employee at St. Catharines' General Motors Assembly Plant #2.</p>
<p>While the hotel itself was primarily a low-rent residence for pensioners and fixed-income adults, the lounge was a haunt for everyone. In a small city the size of St. Catharines, 'alternative' space was at a premium, and Jerry's Alley somehow managed to accommodate prople from most walks of life. On any given night one could see skinheads, punks, faux-Rastas, metalheads, nerds, leather-scene gays and old-time alcoholics interacting in a (mostly) peaceful manner.</p>
<p>Jerry's Alley was primarily a live-music venue, and presented hundreds, if not thousands of live acts over the years. The bands ranged in scope from small regional acts such as Problem Children, Bitter Reality, Tension, and Brontocrushrock to relatively well-known artists such as Bad Brains, DOA, Alien Sex Fiend, and the Forgotten Rebels.</p>
<p>Bands who played the Russell were not entitled to any kind of 'star status'. The 'stage', such as it was, was a 1' rider in the North West corner of the bar. The audience easily interacted with the bands, which added to the DIY, anything goes mentality of the club.</p>
<p>On nights when no live bands were scheduled, records were spun by a handful of volunteer disc jockeys on a begged-and-borrowed PA system which more often than not only broadcast in the right channel. Featured DJs included Dirk, Mick, Lawrence, Alisa, John, Laurie, Morgan and Pete, but essentially anyone with more than two records in his collection could come in and spin. Records played were generally well-known Canadian punk and new wave acts from the late 1970s to the late 1980s, but the appeal of Jerry's music selections was the diversity. In any given night one could hear everything from Black Sabbath top Grace Jones; from (neo-fascist skinheads) Skrewdriver to Peter Tosh.</p>
<p>The Russell was also on occasion used as a venue for municipal fundraising, such as in the case of the "Better Him than Me '93" party to collect food for the Niagara Regional Food Bank.</p>
<p>The Russell was informally divided into two large rooms; a 15' bar in the front, along with a pool table and several tables and chairs, and the back room, which was essentially empty except for a candy vending machine and a rather dubious looking toilet.</p>
<p>Despite the possession of narcotics being unlawful, there was a defacto "don't ask, don't tell" policy in place in the lounge. As long as the manager and regular bartender, Lucy, didn't see or smell narcotics consumption, it was tacitly permitted in the back room. This was particularly welcome in the winter months, when sub-zero temperatures made smoking dope in the actually alley beside "Jerry's Alley" impractical. The back room suffered frequent electrical shortages due to faulty wiring, which added to the whole "Istanbul" vibe of the place.</p>
<p>Also somewhat questionable was the admissions policy in Jerry's Alley; many people known to be under the Age of Majority in Ontario (19 years of age) were allowed in, despite being legally prohibited from the premises. Some evenings this was commonplace, when other times the law was strictly enforced, and there never seemed to be any reason for this disparity.</p>
<p>The bar itself underwent a few aesthetic changes throughout its lifetime, mostly under the guidance and labour of volunteer patrons who prefered to treat the establishment better than their own homes. In 1993, a large mural was donated by several patrons. The artwork consisted of a collage of pop icons, ranging from Lon Chaney to Adam West's Batman; from Betty Grable to the Clash's Joe Strummer.</p>
<p>During its lifetime, Jerry's Alley was subject to several closures, sometimes brief and sometimes extended. These closures were generally due to breaches of fire codes, occupancy regulations or other municipal bylaws, and on two separate occasions Jerry's Alley was closed due to fire.</p>
<p>The first fire occurred during the day, when the bar was opened early to attract customers attending the Niagara Grape and Wine Festival Parade. On this occasion, the Fire Department's efforts to extinguish the blaze, which began in the back room, were hampered by the fact that many of the already impaired patrons refused to leave the premises, and the brief theft of an idling fire truck parked outside the hotel.</p>
<p>The second fire closure, which applied to the entire hotel as well as the lounge, was the eventual downfall of the business, which was left closed for three years before being demolished in 1996.</p>
<p>In 2002, a project documenting a winter night at Jerry's Alley was begun by documentary film-maker Morgan Lewington. Submissions to this ongoing project can be sent to jerrysalleyinruin@hotmail.com</p>

<p>Billy Boyo is one of the more recognizable dancehall reggae artists of the 1980's, much like contemporaries Little John and Little Harry. Born September 21st 1969 to the name Billy Theophilus Rowe, in Kingston, Jamaica. He was in the circle of Henry "Junjo" Lawes and his Volcano sound system. He recorded one album with Little Harry (DJ Clash Vol. 2 )under the guidance of Lawes, released by Greensleeves, and another album was recorded by Silver Kamel, titled Zim Zim. Though recorded in 1983, it was not released until 2003. Most people haven't heard of Billy Boyo because of the few tracks he actually recorded. "Jah Jah made me to M.C." and "Boyo in the Area" are easily two of his finest songs. Zim Zim doesn't even come close to comparing with his tracks on DJ CLash Vol. 2, when it is obvious he is quite young. He died of a brain tumor in 2000, although it was a myth that he and Little Harry were shot together in the 1980's.</p>

<p>The Indian Shores Social Athletic Club (ISSAC for short) is a rather exclusive organization created for seasonal campers at Indian Shores Resort in Woodruff, Wisconsin. The club has no dues, goals, or agendas. The only requirement is that all members have fun. Meetings typically take place in the bar at Indian Shores, while various types of alcoholic beverages are being consumed. Members are well-known in the area for their unique garb - green sport jackets decorated with coasters from various bars and taverns. The president of the club is Tom Hausheer, and the vice president is Dan Gore. The number of members is always increasing, so it is difficult to say exactly how many people are involved in the organization. ISSAC members represent themselves in numerous activities, both in and out of the campground, spreading the fun to all who are willing to listen to polka music.</p>

<p>Jack Landreth began his radio career in 1985 with WLS in Chicago. After a 6 month stint with Paul Harvey in 1991, Jack moved to “The Loop” in Chicago, the country’s first “hot talk” station.</p>
<p>In 1993, Jack moved to warmer climes in San Diego with KFMB. In 1996, moved to Nashville to program an FM station just out of bankruptcy, WWTN. Turned it into the 2nd FM talk station in the country (WWDB in Philly was the first), and soon enjoyed programming talk. In 1998, Jack moved to Tucson as Director of AM programming for SFX Broadcasting.</p>
<p>In 2001, Jack accepted a PD position with Infinity Broadcasting in San Antonio, TX. After 2 years in Texas, Infinity moved Jack to Las Vegas, where he accepted a long term position with Infinity’s (now CBS’s) KXNT and KSFN.</p>
<p>While at KXNT, Jack has shifted KXNT’s focus to an information based format, now currently ranked at the top in the market. At KSFN, Jack came up with the “Spike” format, a combination of Hot Talk and Sports, with an emphasis on entertainment.</p>

<p>The influence of myofunctional habits on cranio-facial development and orthodontic problems has regularly been reported in publications since the era of Edward Angle. More recent studies show that crowded teeth and jaw discrepancies are not always hereditary, but can be caused by the way a child swallows and breathes. Orthodontic treatment rarely includes therapy for these myofunctional problems. The soft tissues control dental position and should be treated in conjunction with any orthodontic appliance therapy.</p>

On May 22, 1973, the <b>St. Paul of Chartes Sisters</b> (SPC) accepted the task of the management of the school. In essence, Saint Vincent's Academy is Candelaria Academy with a "Catholic flavor".

<p>203.109.123.139 08:16, 12 July 2006 (UTC) It was Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's comrade who inked his death certificate.</p>
<p>This man was Shah Nawaz Khan, a major general in the Indian National Army. He headed the Committee which was set up over a decade after the alleged death of Subhas Bose by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to probe the mystery.</p>
<p>Shahnawaz Khan, General Officer Commanding in the Indian National Army came from a Punjabi Musalman family which had served in the same “Punjab” regiment since 1857. He used to recall that this regiment was officered by English subalterns from one or two families. He was himself grateful to be the first king’s commissioned officer. His loyalty to the British arose due to generations of service to the Raj and personal bonds with British officers for many years. Shahnawaz Khan was a freedom fighter in the INA [also called as Azad Hind Fauz] along with Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. Shahnawaz Khan belonged to Meerut province in Uttar Pradesh India and was part of a famous legal battle with the British in which his colleagues Major Sehgal &amp; Major Dhillon were defended by Jawaharlal Nehru.</p>
<p>Shah Nawaz Khan was a prisoner of his circumstance when the Japanese captured him from the South Asia theatre. It was not his war and he did not know what he was doing in an alien battlefield. It was a cynicism he carried with him even after the Japanese turned him and other prisoners to the Indian National Army (INA) for commissioning. It was not until Netaji arrived on the scene to take over the reign of the fledgling INA that things began to look up for them. Netaji at once set out to transform a demoralised army into a first-rate fighting force that was motivated and raring to go.The betrayal of Indians by the British at Singapore where they took care of their own kind and left Indian officers and men to fend for themselves, destroyed the bond. Netaji's magic worked on every soldier and before long, Shah Nawaz was under his spell too. Shahnawaz joined the INA and became a trusted lieutenant of Netaji. Although he did not exemplify himself in war, he remained loyal to Netaji till the end of the war.Kohima fell to INA's Subhas Brigade on 8th April under the command of Col. Thakur Singh (2IC). Moirang fell to INA on 14th April, Col. S. Malik raised the Tri-color flag. The wonderful work done by Major Gen. Kiani's troops, and by Subhas Brigade under Shahnawaz Khan's command allowed INA to surround the British troops in Imphal for around three months.</p>
<p>In August 1945, Japan's rout in war and the report of Netaji's death in an air-crash, took the wind out of the INA mast. There was no leader left who could keep the army together. Surrender was the only option that remained. There was resistance to the idea of surrender at first. Many preferred death to surrender. I was told that if it had not been for Colonel G S Dhillon, even Shah Nawaz and a few others would have followed the Japanese tradition and taken their own lives in the face of defeat. When the INA soldiers were disarmed and led by Lord Mountbatten's victorious army to stand trial in Red Fort, the English had not anticipated the spontaneous outpouring of support for the soldiers. The English, who already had their plates full, did not want another trouble on account of the trial. In any case, the English had already tasted rebellion within its own army ranks when its Indian units had marched into Imphal to clear INA's occupation. Another mutiny was not in their interest. Meanwhile, India discovered three new heroes during the Red Fort trial - Shah Nawaz Khan, P K Saighal and G S Dhillon. He was tried for treason against the king-emperor in the Red Fort where the last emperor of India, Bahadur Shah II Zafar had also faced the victorious British after the 1857 revolution failed. Along with Shahnawaz, a Sikh officer called Dhillon and a Hindu officer Shahgal were facing the same judges.For the Indian National Congress, which was, at the time, searching for a issue to keep the fire of the freedom movement burning in people, latched on to the chance and jumped to the defence of the INA soldiers. Even INA critic and Subhas Bose baiter, Jawahalal Nehru spoke in their defence. Of course, those who had the eyes to see, knew it was the politician and not the patriot, in Nehru who advocated the INA case. Nehru made other observations too. He had watched with particular interest Shah Nawaz's rise to popularity. Shah Nawaz was a Muslim, and it suited Nehru to foist the former for political gains. So, when independence came in 1947, Shah Nawaz was given a berth in the Nehru Cabinet</p>
<p>Shah Nawaz Khan was the man whom Nehru chose from among 60,000 men of the INA, to give a name, a title, a ministerial berth, and after 10 years, a place at the head of an inquiry committee to probe Subhas Bose's disappearance.The Committee began its work in early April 1956 and came out with its report within four months. The report concluded that Netaji "met his death in an air-crash, and that the ashes now at Renkoji temple, Tokyo, are his ashes." It recommended that government take the ashes to India and build a memorial. The committee worked for four months, during which it travelled under government mandate to various countries "gathering evidence", before declaring Subhas Bose's death on August 18, 1945, in the air-crash in Formosa (now Taiwan). At that time, many people, including Capt Yadav, a former gunner officer of the INA Ancillary Unit, were least surprised that the committee's itinerary did not include a visit to Formosa.</p>
<p>Capt Yadav remembers Shah Nawaz Khan as a meritorious soldier who surrendered to the lure of Jawaharlal Nehru's largesse and, thereby, let down the INA and its Netaji.</p>

<p>Born in Los Angeles but raised in Shrewsbury, Louisiana (a small town a few miles west of New Orleans), Richard Bernard began his career as a <a href="../../../d/j/_/DJ_27a5.html" title="DJ">DJ</a> in 1988 by performing at parties around the neighborhood. As his notoriaty grew Cheeez eventually began acting as a show <a href="../../../d/j/_/DJ_27a5.html" title="DJ">DJ</a> for several local rappers. Around the end of 1992 he was introduced to a female <a href="../../../m/c/_/MC_92a5.html" title="MC">MC</a> named <a href="../../../m/i/a/Mia_X_8f1f.html" title="Mia X">Mia X</a>.

Throughout 1993 and 1994 <a href="../../../m/i/a/Mia_X_8f1f.html" title="Mia X">Mia X</a> and Cheeez performed at various nite clubs and auditoriums throughout the southern United States. He also performed at several nite clubs as the house DJ.</p>
<p>In 1995 Bigg Cheeez was introduced to a large group of gifted rappers and DJ's from New Orleans who all seemed to be connected to each other in one way or another (i.e. went to school together, from the same neighborhood, were related etc.). These artists would become the legendary hip hop group known as the Psycho Ward. In early 1997 they would release the album titled www.psychoward.com</p>

<p>KUTPM is steeped in <b>Malaysian values</b>. The Malaysia tradition and diverse culture feature significantly in the design of the KUTPM emblem; portraying a distinctive Malaysia identity. The icon, a graphic representation of a scholar, is inspired by a Malaysian cultural talisman, the 'keris' (dagger). The rectangle that forms the hilt of the 'keris' is a stylized rendition of a mortar board and it is also to signify the dynamic progress of the University, akin to the phenomenal success of the advances in Information Technology.</p>

<p>Samuelson's "Foundations" may be the most important book on mathematical economics ever written. This remarkable book thoroughly treats every area of modern economic theory -- from international trade to portfolio theory -- in an elegant and concise manner. Every equation derived is done so methodically, without the logical leaps that typify most technical textbooks and monographs. Altough the mathematics of the book are what gives "Foundations" its great authority (see Samuelson on "The Apotheosis of the Calculus"), Samuelson's prose is lucid and engaging. This book is absolutely essential for any student of technical economics.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-13_3339.html" title="Edit section: Christopher Hassan">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Christopher Hassan</span></h2>
<p>It t'was a brisk January morning in the bustling New England city of Boston. In the very sterile room of Brigam and Womens Hospital, Maryann and Daniel gave birth to the stunningly handsome Christopher Daniel Hassan. Christopher was an instant celebrity among the young female nurses, as he had eyes of the bluest skies. Christopher and his parents lived in Back Bay in Boston for the early years of his life until they moved to Watertown to make room for his new sister Leah. In 1993 the Hassan family moved from Watertown to North Attleboro, MA because Chris' parents both were employed in Providence, RI at the time. Christopher attended North Attleboro Middle School, and then Bishop Feehan High School in Attleboro, MA. His parents felt that a private high school was far superior that the public schools that North Attleboro offered. Christopher did not enjoy the Catholic school very much at first, however it grew on him as he ended up becoming the captain of the varsity track team as well as dating the captain of the varsity cheerleading squad. After excelling in track and field in his early years of high school, Chris went out for the football team his senior year. This proved to be a costly mistake. On a cold, wet Friday night, playing against Somerset High School, Chris tore his left ACL, MCL and miniscus. His football career was over.... In 2003 Hassan graduated from Bishop Feehan to later attend the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. After his first two years of steady partying, Chris decided to take his education to the next level. He decided to study abroad. He attended DCT International Hotel &amp; Business Management School in Luzern, Switzerland for 6 months. During his stay he was fortunate to meet people from all over the world (including his present girlfriend Caline who is from Rio de Janiero)as well as being able to travel. He attended Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany with his college friends Misty and Ryan, before taking the train to Holland, Belgium, and Italy over a two week period. To complete his education at DCT Chris was required to get an internship at a hotel. As of 7//12/06 he is employed at Topnotch Resort &amp; Spa in Stowe, VT. He works primarily as a bellman and conciege, however he has also cross-trained at the front desk, laundry and the spa. This page was inspired by fellow bellhops Phillip Annacone and Scott Boire.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-13_3339.html" title="Edit section: Summary">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Summary</span></h3>
<p>The One-Hour Documentary examines the issues surrounding drilling for crude oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This Film Exposes to viewers the risks involved in crude oil drilling, and how it might upset the balance of the Arctic Plain. The film also showcases the cultures of the Gwich’in Athabascan Indians and Inupiat Eskimos that rely on the wildlife in the Refuge for their existence. The film shows how Gwich’in peoples fear that their caribou hunting season will be severely impacted by drilling, oil development and Oil Pipelines in the refuge. Directors Bo Boudart and Dale Djerassi also cut to America's Automobile industry and shows how improved fuel-efficent vehicles and fuel standards and the development of Alternative Energy Resources and Technologies, Mainly Solar and Wind Power, can help America lose it's addiction to oil. The issue of oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge brings to focus the wide debate over energy conservation vs. unbridled consumption. It also dramatizes the choice between technologies based on fossil fuels and those that draw upon renewable, efficient, and non-polluting energy resources. The Film's Website also states: <i>"Humanity does not need to destroy an irreplaceable wilderness in order to generate power, heat homes, and travel about. The new paradigm is a mode of living with the Earth rather than extracting from the Earth."</i></p>
<p>The Film often employs Wide-Angle Shots of the Refuge, and features award-winning composer William Susman directing the film's music.</p>

<p>Atta Kim is a prominent Korean photographer that recently opened his solo show at The International Center of Photography in New York. His work incorporates time-duration photography, and juxtaposition of computer-rendered images of humans. Significant for his portrayal of 'dormant' life, Kim's work often takes a flurry of activity and transforms it into a ghostly shell, or juxtaposes images of vital natural activity with those of humans encapsulated and frozen in time.</p>

<p><a href="../../../d/o/n/Donna_Summer_5c96.html" title="Donna Summer">Donna Summer</a> is the self-titled album produced by <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quincy_Jones_c1bf.html" title="Quincy Jones">Quincy Jones</a> in 1982. The album became a Top Twenty hit on the Billboard Album charts and produced three Top 40 singles in the US. "Love Is In Control" was a top ten smash, and returned Summer to dance music after her 1980 rock release <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wanderer_17ee.html" title="The Wanderer">The Wanderer</a>. The follow-up single, "State of Independence" was a international hit, and the third single, a ballad titled "Woman in Me" reached #33 on the Billboard Hot 100. Several other tracks are noteworthy, particularly "Love Is Just A Breath Away" and a track from Bruce Springsteen titled "Protection". Springsteen had written the song "Cover Me" for Summer, but his record company convinced him to keep the song. He wrote "Protection" to replace it, and it was recorded as a duet. The duet has not been released, but Springsteen and the E Street Band recorded the music and the backing vocals for the track as released. "Mystery of Love" was reported to be the second single release, but James Ingram's label did not approve of the release unless he recieved a duet credit.</p>
<p>The final cut, the classic jazz ballad "Lush Life" caps an eclectic album, and Summer has reported that it was the hardest song she ever recorded. Summer was pregnant during the sessions, and "Rolling Stone" magazine reported that Jones taunted Summer with jibes such as "if you can sing better than <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaka_Kahn_0078.html" title="Chaka Kahn">Chaka Kahn</a>, you've got to prove it by me" and their relationship may have been strained. Summer was nominated for Grammy's in the rock and R&amp;B categories for her work on this album, and Quincy Jones was nominated as "Producer of the Year." Some critics complained that the LP was over-produced and heavy-handed, but as with most of Summer's albums, time has been very kind to this release, and it out-shines bigger releases by contemporaries.</p>

<p>Michael "Deko-ze" Babb was born in England, but grew up in Saskatoon, Canada — the city where his career began in 1991. Deko-ze's first residency was at a local gay bar called "Numbers", which later moved / renamed to "Diva's". He then went on to establish / co-own a highly regarded nightclub / production company called “Plastic Puppet Motive” (PPM).</p>
<p>After years of hard work and brick-laying, he established himself as western Canada's most recognized dj / ambassador. A relocation to Toronto, Ontario in late 1997, led to Deko-ze's emergence as a leading force in the local scene. He has been labeled "Canada's hardest working DJ"; frequently playing gigs in nearly every Canadian centre — big and small! With numerous gigs in the USA, UK, Germany, Taiwan and Mexico already under his belt, Deko-ze is now focused on further increasing his presence internationally.</p>
<p>MIX'N IT UP</p>
<p>Deko-ze regards electronic music as an artform; a natural extension of his classical training in piano.</p>
<p>He believes music should induce a wide range of emotional response, but ultimately programs to create energy and positivity.</p>
<p>If forced to categorize, Deko-ze would best be defined as a House DJ.</p>
<p>In a scene that has become overly segmented, Deko-ze is increasingly unique: he is recognized for his ability to seamlessly fuse music of multiple genres (deep, funky &amp; hard house; tribal; progressive; tech-trance; techno).</p>
<p>Deko-ze's energetic and charismatic stage presence, engaging personality, and original musical style has uniquely cultivated a huge following in both the gay and straight scenes.</p>
<p>STUDIO PRODUCTION — Deko-ze is currently working on independent studio projects, as well as in collaboration with local DJs / producers: Gavo (Juno Award winner, Gavin Bradley); Josh Ewert; Sydney Blu &amp; Ludikris.</p>
<p>“THIS TIME” by Deko-ze N' Gavo to be unleashed by Release Records, Summer 2005.</p>

<p>Elijah Spellman was born on <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wednesday.html" title="Wednesday">Wednesday</a> <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_25.html" title="April 25">April 25</a> in the Year of Our Lord <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwalk%2C_Ohio_a6e1.html" title="Norwalk, Ohio">Norwalk, Ohio</a>. He is the middle child of three sons. His father has one-eighth <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherokee.html" title="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> blood and prominent English roots. On his paternal grandfather's side, Elijah is a descendant of English-born Massachusetts Puritan <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Endicott_0dd2.html" title="John Endicott">John Endicott</a>. On his paternal grandmother's side, he is a descendant of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_of_England_590f.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII of England</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Ball_Washington_f840.html" title="Mary Ball Washington">Mary Ball Washington</a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>. His mother, whom he nicknames as his <i>Queen Mother</i>, is the product of German and English ancestry on her biological father's side. Elijah’s maternal grandmother is a mixture of Italian and Irish roots.</p>
<p>At the age of seven in the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autumn.html" title="Autumn">autumn</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, he and his family moved to Buckhannon, West Virginia. They moved into a three-bedroom house surrounded by four towering <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugar_maple.html" title="Sugar maple">sugar maple</a> trees in the city's "north-end" section. Much to his dismay, the two front trees were torn town by the city in the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>. For the first few years of residency there, Elijah became intensely intrigued with the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography.html" title="Geography">geography</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wildlife.html" title="Wildlife">wildlife</a> of his newfound West Virginia home.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2001, Elijah’s parents bought their house as well as the two-storey four-bedroom house next door. They moved into their new home which was constructed in 1920. By doing this, they increased the size of their property one-fourth the size of a typical residential city block in Buckhannon.</p>
<p>After years of befriending neighborhood kids, he was introduced to the acclaimed <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System_5602.html" title="Super Nintendo Entertainment System">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>. The two games that most influenced his inner core were <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_World_902a.html" title="Super Mario World">Super Mario World</a> and <a href="../../../a/_/l/The_Legend_of_Zelda%7E_A_Link_to_the_Past_75bb.html" title="The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a>. The colors, buildings, and music seen and heard in these games enchanted him so much that he developed a passionate love for both architecture and music. The most drawn building in his private archives is the <a href="../../../t/a/j/Taj_Mahal_9d41.html" title="Taj Mahal">Taj Mahal</a>. Other drawings include native <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animals.html" title="Animals">animals</a> of West Virginia, and also many floor plans for opulent mansions.

<p>Elijah Spellman has several heroes of both genders. There are persons he absolutely loves, has much in common with, has high admiration for, and persons he patterns himself after. Included in his list are <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chad_Michael_Murray_5e90.html" title="Chad Michael Murray">Chad Michael Murray</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/v/Raviv_Ullman_8115.html" title="Raviv Ullman">Raviv Ullman</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Lawrence_9d76.html" title="Matthew Lawrence">Matthew Lawrence</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Timberlake_c6d4.html" title="Justin Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, Emperor <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus.html" title="Augustus">Augustus</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonardo_da_Vinci_1ee9.html" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, King <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XIV_of_France_d0a6.html" title="Louis XIV of France">Louis XIV of France</a>, <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristin_Kreuk_c5a5.html" title="Kristin Kreuk">Kristin Kreuk</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/v/Beverly_Mitchell_70b9.html" title="Beverly Mitchell">Beverly Mitchell</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christina_Aguilera_233a.html" title="Christina Aguilera">Christina Aguilera</a>.</p>
<p>Of all his most favorite of heroes, besides Jesus Christ and a fellow high school classmate, his quintessential hero is <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jefferson_1b17.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>.

Since 1996, the special vocal style of The Warrior Gospel Band has pleased lovers of Gospel music in and around Austin, Texas. The exciting sounds of “The Warrior Gospel Band ” with their foot stomping and heart rendering music draws upon the historical Gospel Quartet experience in America.</p>

<p>The Warrior Gospel Band is the custodian of a vocal tradition that dates back to Pre-Civil War years, where Slaves escaped the torment of the cruelty of slavery through Spiritual songs and celebration. It is a tradition that transcends jim crow, black codes, segregation and discrimination. The Warrior Gospel Band sings and plays Gospel. At their best, their singing pulses with a fervor that far surpasses secular concerts. Their down home music style reflects a facility and fervor that recalls the great Gospel groups of the past and the spirit of a people who refuse to be broken or embittered. Their chordal patterns and powerful rhythm lifts the spirits of all who are blessed to hear them.</p>

<p>86.20.186.183 21:39, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Fans of Syd Barrett owe Malcolm Jones more than he'll everprobably get, not only was he responsible for producing the bettersolo sessions he's also took the time &amp; trouble to document "TheMaking Of The Madcap Laughs" in a booklet of the same name.Last month I went to his home to interview him, listen to someof the outtakes &amp; try &amp; persuade him to let me reprint hisTheMaking Of The Madcap Laughs' booklet.I should however explain that I didn't particularly ask aboutthe 1969 session details etc purely because they are alreadycovered extensively in "The Making..." For those people withoutthis book I hope you forgive that and if you do ever get a copyyou'll understand why I didn't ask about those kinds things... Firstly, before I switched my recorder on, Malcolm played mesnatches of Ramadan, Lanky pt's 1 &amp; 2, Opel &amp; Love You (slowversion) etc. Ramadan / Lanky seemed better than I'd expected.</p>
<p>They are very loose 'acidy jams' sort of like a lot of stuff in1968. They seemed very freeform &amp; reminded me of The Soft Machine,Syd's contribution was not particularly self-evident but the tracksare still good.</p>
<p>I'd heard Opel before but Love You (slow version) was verynice &amp; I hope it like the other outtakes sees the light of daysoon. What else can you say, it is slightly different... ThenMalcolm explained that he only plays snatches of songs to peoplebecause of some Bowie stuff he played to a guy who then put it outon bootleg. He then produced a tape with "Pink Floyd - BackingTrack" written on it. [no it didn't sound at all like Syd]</p>
<p>He wasgiven this in 1968 by Roy Featherstone (his boss) who didn't likethe direction the Floyd were heading along; he wanted a secondopinion. I switched on my cassette &amp; the interview was underway.</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: There's definitely a melody there, it's obviously a backingtrack for something they'd thought out in some form.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: She was a millionaire?</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Have you heard that?</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: No... Untitled?In the Beechwoods? John Latham? (lookingthrough the recording titles in Malcolm's booklet)</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: I often wondered on those tracks (pointing to book) cos in thestudio somebody says "Oh this is what it's called". On Silas Langthere's a line in it that goes "the land in Silas stands" &amp; Ialways assumed that was just the engineer getting the title wrongand I actually went through on the early albums &amp; tried to listento every lyric to see if there were any alternate lines that wouldhave been early titles.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: Sunshine - Wondering &amp; Dreaming etc.</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: yeh</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: y'know the Octopus single that came out, it was released inFrance with a picture cover...</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: They always did in those days, that was virtually standardprocedure. I mean England was the last country ever to botherabout those, certainly on the first runs I think virtuallyeverything had picture covers. I don't remember it to be honest.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: It looks like in Syd's style</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: I doubt whether it would be, I'm sure if we'd any requests forSyd to do something it would have come through me at the time. Ifthey'd rung up EMI, EMI would have come round to me. It's probablysome young kid, whose as enthusiastic as the rest of us, but I'monly guessing.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: Have you seen any of Syd's drawings at all?</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Yeh a few, but I've probably seen a lot of them withoutrealising.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: Do you know what's happening with Peter Jenner &amp; Andrew King?</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: No, last I heard of them Peter was doing the Blackhill thing,but I'm not really sure what Andrew King is doing.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: I've heard that Peter's managing Swan's Way... &amp; Billy Bragg</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: He always had good taste.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: I think Andrew's forking for Westminster Music.</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: You're joking, really..</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: Well he's the guy who signs the copyright letters to us.</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Won't be Andrew, doesn't sound like his style.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: Were you still working for Harvest when 'Barrett' wasreleased?</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Just, I was just about to leave, I think it came out just asI left or just after. I'd seen the sleeve but I don't think I hadthe record. I had to write back to EMI &amp; call them &amp; ask them tosend me one.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: What did you think of it&#160;?</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Mmmm. Alright. Except I was quite pleased when Time Out saidthat my tracks were better...though they'd done better stuff, whenI listen to some of their recordings...</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: You've listened to some of their recordings,</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Mmm, just even the other tapes. It's quite nice to hearpeople sort of making cock-up's in the studio but they could haveused better cock-up's with Syd in a slightly better mind.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: The way they coupled take 1 of Feel onto take 5 of If It's InYou is misleading.</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: There was something odd now I remember.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: Have you any idea how many copies of Madcap were sold&#160;?</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: It didn't sell at first</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: It went gold</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Well I wish I could give you the total figures, cos when Iwrote to EMI when I was trying to get this stuff I did released,the first thing I did, was write to the royalties dept to be sneaky&amp; find out what it's sold. And they suddenly found out that they'dunderpaid royalties so that meant Syd got a few grand. But it'sstill on catalogue &amp; I still get royalty statements &amp; it's amazingto see, I mean it's not available in so many countries as it usedto be but it's fascinating to see it's still in the catalogue inJapan, France, and America.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: Were you responsible for any of the recent T Rex releases?</p>
<p>(Malcolm also had quite heavy T Rex connections)Malcolm Jones: (shakes head sideways) I find it amazing, if EMI give away -or let someone else release their stuff then why can't they do thesame for Syd? At one stage I felt like just putting it out &amp;saying sue me if you want but one of the reasons I particularlywanted to go through EMI was so they could pay Syd..just because ofhis royalties, I dunno if he still gets them.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: But the thing is the Pink Floyd as well..</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: That's what I was saying about the contract, I never knew withSyd, Bryan Morrison said he was going to re-negotiate a contractfor Syd on his own; because he would be getting, in those days onSyd's solo stuff; Well I don't know what the Floyd got but theywere probably getting something around 6% royalty, so that's 1 1/2%each...So if that carried on on that basis that meant on his solostuff he got a quarter of 6%. I never knew if that happened ornot.</p>
<p>Pause while I load the "new" Syd Barrett tape into Malcolm'shi-fi. Last time I said the first track was not "Swan Lee" due toall the usual fuck up's. This is now the sound of me eating mywords. Meanwhile the tape begins..</p>
<p>SWAN LEE</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Swan Lee..the bass doesn't sound right, probably is. The basssounds a bit fussier than I remember it to be.</p>
<p>SCREAM THY LAST SCREAM</p>
<p>Syd sounds posh when he's singing, he's got a rounded vowelsound y'know? All his 'o's are 'O's. (Syd appropriately singsMOuses.)</p>
<p>VEGETABLE MAN</p>
<p>Like the previous track, this version is similar to thosefound elsewhere so there was little to comment on. We were lookingthrough the tape listing at the back of Malcolm's book, trying tofind where these two tracks could have come from. Since thisversion of Vegetable Man is close to the 'Unforgotten Hero' versionwe wondered if it could just be an overdubbed 'Unforgotten Hero'take.</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: What also happened, I'm only guessing, was that if that wasthe 4 track tape they might mix it down to stereo &amp; add some otherinstruments, playing along as you mix. There's no point intransferring it onto another 4 track - you might as well mix it &amp;save a generation of tape. So the only place that overdub willexist will be on the stereo master. That happened to me once withsomething else &amp; we had to go all the way back...</p>
<p>MILKY WAY</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Whose tape is this? There's no echo or anything to suggestit's recorded in a studio. It sounds like he's doing it foroverdubbing though, strumming acoustic through the whole solo.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: He does that on Opel.</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: ...leaves gaps</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: I can't believe this would be left out of 'Barrett'</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Seems odd if it was...sounds like the same guitar as Dave'sstuff, I don't remember him having an acoustic guitar. (track ends)</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: He is pretty together there isn't he&#160;?</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: He is everywhere except on those 3 Dave Gilmour tracks.</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: That's... (Syd makes a slight mistake).. y'see that I think isan acceptable mistake whereas the stuff they put on, I don't thinkthat it shows the songwriting process or whatever he's doing; thathe made a mistake &amp; that he knows to go back &amp; so on, whereas theMadcap things they did just made him look a babbling fool.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: It tends to play up to the lunatic image.</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: That's creating an image for somebody who didn't necessarilydeserve quite as bad as that. (2nd version ends)</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: I think that's better than some I've got.</p>
<p>DARK GLOBE</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: Is this one of yours?</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: No. I have got other versions of this. It sounds as thoughsomeone's adding echo to identify it as their bootleg rather thananybody else's.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: That's happened before...</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: I always liked this one actually, this song.Ivor Trueman: What was your reaction to the version that came out, were theother versions better?</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: I think so yeh, a bit sad really, something is, after a whileyou get used to some the more you hear it &amp; you forget how good theother things were.</p>
<p>INSTRUMENTAL</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: There's a bit, a chord sequence that comes from Silas Lang,the bit there is the chord sequence of "the land in Silas stands"...that semitone up thing sounds quite unusual...did Syd ever likesaxophones?</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: (See the Miles book for what I said here.)</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: I don't recognise it but certainly the guitar style is Sydishisn't it&#160;?</p>
<p>OPEL</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: This is Syd. It annoys me that people, whenever I've playedanything for anybody..</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: But this hasn't come from you, it's from EMI</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Then why don't they release it?</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Is the song complete, the whole thing goes on for 7 mins orso.Ivor Trueman: I think so, except Syd doesn't sing the line "I'm drowning,I'm drowning"</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: The whole pathos comes in the line 'I'm drowning', that's thewhole... Perhaps it's just on the tape that he sung to me then? That does sound almost exactly, well to my ears, exactly the sametape.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: Without that line..</p>
<p>THE WORD SONG / UNTITLED WORDS</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Don't say anything, let me just... At the beginning there'ssomething odd about it that I couldn't fathom. There's a certaintimbre on his voice that's not there it could just be the tape,it's his style. It is Syd. Don't suppose is has a title has it?</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: People call it The Word Song or Untitled Words</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Syd's not said what it's supposed to be called?</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: I don't know.</p>
<p>BIRDY HOP</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: I've never heard this before, where's this meant to have comefrom? Did it come from Abbey Road? Y'see if it come from AbbeyRoad then it's a different story than if it came from ManchesterSquare or whereever..EMI Manchester Square have always said theyhaven't got it.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: They said that about STLS/VM.</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: I'm just wondering if I ever sent them a cassette of the stuffI've got, in which case it could just be in somebody's drawer, coswhen I wrote to Terry Slater, I'm just trying to think if I senthim a cassette or not; he's the AR guy who I was trying to get torelease the stuff-he'd never even return my call.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: Perhaps he didn't like it?</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Well yes, but all he'd have to do is look in the sales figures&amp; find out how many Syd Barrett albums they've sold. It's just apurely commercial venture isn't it? Nothing to do with whether helikes it or not. There's plenty of people who do, but he justnever returned my call. I wrote four time &amp; then I rang up &amp; hesaid "Oh no the person you need now is Dick Landser", who I used toknow when I was at EMI. Who is shall we say, an aging bald man whoputs out all the Geoff Love albums &amp; all that stuff. So whythey've referred Syd's stuff to him I've no idea, and I actuallyrang up one Friday &amp; said 'look I've had all these people.. tworecord companies that I know of want the stuff, are you interestedor are you not?' And I spoke to his secretary, this is about 4o'clock in the afternoon &amp; she said 'Oh he's gone to lunch &amp; won'tbe coming back today'. I left my name, he knows me or remembers mefrom those days, and I never even heard.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: What about the last Harvest compilation, the Art SchoolDancing LP, I mean Syd got a track on that?</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: yeh, Oh sure there's people there who are interested., thosethings are rather silly because, it's like when they did the DaveEdmunds thing. The Dutch put a really great Dave Edmundscompilation out &amp; I wrote to EMI and said if you do the equivalenthere ring me up 'cos I've got all the longer versions of things, &amp;it would make it slightly more interesting. And it's the same withthe Harvest stuff. Somewhere, and I really don't know where I'vekept an acetate of "Singing A Song In The Morning" with Syd on. (Julian's note: Probably the same acetate that turned up on the 'Rhamadhan' RoIo)</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: Religious Experience</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: yeh, and it actually said on the label 'Religious Experience'. It was before we even changed the title &amp; y'know "ring me up" I'mnot going to find it if EMI weren't interested; nobody did anythingabout it, it's really sad, cos it'd make it more interesting thanit was.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: Did you produce that session?</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: No, my name's on the label, all I did was mix it. PeterJenner produced the original track &amp; it was really rather messy,and it was a really good song, y'know a catchy tune.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: a commercial hit..</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: yeh that was it, here was me saying 'hey this is a greatrecord here but it's a bit messy' &amp; so I rubbed Syd out! er... Well, it was a great song, let's try for a hit. In those days itdidn't matter, Syd was still; we could still put Syd's version onthe LP or whatever, it didn't matter. But it was a very good song&amp; Peter Jenner said 'Oh if we're gonna do that let's call itSinging A Song In The Morning! Trying to get Tony Blackburn toplay it on his morning programme...Here comes the dumb question.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: Have you got a favourite Syd Barrett song?Malcolm Jones: (sighs) Everybody asks me that, not really no.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: It seemed like a good question at the time.</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Oh sure yeh, its like people asking me my favourite BuddyHolly record. One day I can give you one answer &amp; the next day Ican give you another. Probably would be "Clowns &amp; Jugglers", theone that came out. It's funny actually cos it's so smart comparedto the original one &amp; I always quite liked that. I always think ofthem with the original titles.</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: Did Clowns &amp; Jugglers have different lyrics?</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: No, it's just he called it Clowns &amp; Jugglers &amp; decided to callit Octopus later. (Julian's note: Actually, it has an extra verse: 'Up, up, touching hips to a madcap gallopping chase') I'd have preferred it to be called Clowns &amp;Jugglers actually, I think it's a much nicer title.</p>
<p>Malcolm was digging through folders &amp; assorted bits of paper likean envelope with Jerry Shirley/Willie Wilson's addresses on that hewrote when they turned up during the Madcap sessions.</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Somewhere I've got a list of what EMI sent to America toCapitol, &amp; Capitol turned down. Everybody talks about the Beatlesbeing turned down but they turned down the Animals, Herman'sHermits, the Dave Clark Five, everybody, The Yardbirds; theywouldn't release them &amp; all those artists went to other labels. Originally Capitol wouldn't release Syd's album. It was only whenthe Floyd were so big &amp; had so much clout in England that they putit out.</p>
<p>Looking through some of the recording sheets for the 'Barrett' LPI was quite startled that in one session they'd attempted 15 takesof one song but Malcolm said that most of them would be like theengineer saying something then Dave &amp; so on. The recording sheetswere like the one at the beginning of the Making Of The MadcapLaughs, the ones I saw for 'Barrett' were dated 26/2/70, 27/2/70,1/4/70, 2/4/70, &amp; 3/4/70. None of them listed titles that didn'tappear on the album, so where Birdy Hop etc come from I don't know. (Actually the 26/2/70 listed Living Alone and Bob Dylan Blues.) Looking at another sheet referring to Madcap Malcolm again takes upthe story.</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: y'see this is what annoys me, y'see I didn't even mix my stuff&amp; by the time Dave &amp; Roger had taken over I was quite happy to letthem do it, &amp; er then they did every one of my mixes first off andthey didn't even go back &amp; see if they could improve it. They justdid em straight through. They did the same on their tapes as theydid on mine, so there was no politics involved...</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: I think as far as they were concerned they were running out oftime, I've often wondered about the kind of friction that must havedeveloped through the Floyd split-up, surely it couldn't havehelped Syd's solo sessions with Dave/Roger &amp; Rick.</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Dave, I remember, he always seemed to me to care for Syd &amp; tobe rather protective about him, I mean that's probably why theywanted to produce him once he'd decided once he knew that EMI wereinterested properly. The occasions we went round to Dave's flat toborrow his amp we didn't stay long but it was all matey &amp; the factthat Dave was lending him his amplifier, and that was before Davewas involved with the LP. Dave was the P.R. man in terms of cominginto EMI, more than Roger &amp; I can remember him at least twiceasking how Syd's sessions were going, when I was doing it.</p>
<p>Looking through at some bits of paper with Ramadan down Malcolmrecalled the 3 hours (10:30am to 1:00pm actually) that they triedto put overdubs of a motorcycle onto the Ramadan track.</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Oh it's a good idea, it's just that the thing he had was thisterrible little cassette player, I mean you know what cassetteplayers were like in those days...</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: Was he actually serious about that. (Syd had recorded somemotor bike sounds on the back of his friend's bike-with thisportable cassette &amp; wanted to overdub this onto the Ramadan track.)</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: Oh yes, we spent hours on it, the tape was no good, the firstthing we did was try &amp; link the cassette up through the desk, Ithink we made up a lead eventually, &amp; we spent hours &amp; then theengineer said it was not really very good so we said alright, cosEMI's got a good effects library. So we went along &amp; dug out allthe sound effects &amp; spent hours putting them onto tape because thesound effects records are all one bit, the engine revving etc... &amp;you add them all together. I don't think we stuck it on anything,I'm not sure where it was intended to go..</p>
<p>Ivor Trueman: I've heard rumours that the Floyd used it in Atom HeartMother.</p>
<p>Malcolm Jones: I haven't got that album, I doubt it, it won't be Syd's tape.</p>
<p>Again one of Malcolm's pieces of paper (he has quite a few of them)shows that Ramadan &amp; the motorbike effects were entered into thetape library mixed down to stereo but not joined together.That just about concludes the interview, we also talked aboutthe possible reprinting of The Making Of The Madcap Laughs, &amp; forpeople without a copy there should be some good news sometime.Finally I'd like really like to thank Malcolm for his time,his tea &amp; music.</p>

<p>The Jitsu Foundation (TJF) is a martial arts organization based around British Universities. The focus of training is, whilst acknowledging the traditional methods and techniques, to place Jitsu in a more modern context and as the world around us changes so does the need of the practitioners of any martial art.</p>
<p>The Jitsu Foundation are an open and friendly organization who actively encourage prospective practioners to 'have a go'. They acknowledge that Ju Jitsu is not for everyone and would prefer to have someone be comfortable and happy with another MA than miserable with Jitsu.</p>

<p>Early training focuses on some basic techniques, defenses from punches, arm-locks , wrist-locks, immobilization techniques and throws. These help to teach the beginner the fundamental principles of balance and posture. A certain amount of time is spent introducing pressure training technique. All in all it builds self confidence and awareness.</p>
<p>Intermediate training builds on from early work but increases in complexity of technique and intensity. Types of attacks one learns to defend from are more realistic and more likely to be encountered in the street in the modern world. Pressure training is used more to simulate more of a street-fight type of scenario. Further increasing the practioners confidence.</p>
<p>Advanced techniques have the greatest level of complexity but are really just variations on a theme. The focus at this level is to produce the 'maximum effect, (from the) minimum effort'. The level at which the techniques are tested are at a very high intensity.</p>
<p>Pressure training is a large part of the TJF training and assesment of knowledge and techniques.</p>

<p>The Jitsu Foundation has adopted the Western practice of coloured belts to signify level of competance acheived.</p>
<p><br />
7th Kyu -Yellow belt 6th Kyu -Orange belt 5th Kyu -Green belt 4th Kyu -Purple belt 3rd Kyu -Light Blue belt 2nd Kyu -Dark Blue belt 1st Kyu -Brown belt</p>
<p>1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Dan -Black belt</p>
<p>Due to the narrow nature of TJF grade structure 7th &amp; 6th Kyu have been sub-divided to differentiate early on the ability range of new practitioners. A simple pass, 1, 2 or 3 mons can be awarded.</p>
<p>The Dan structure is also sub divided to provide extra scope. Fewer techniques are taught but the proficiency at which they are assessed are at the highest of standards. The other function of the division is an administrative and political one.</p>

<p>These are designed to test a practioners knowledge of technique and there ability to perform them to the correct standard whilst under pressure. They are therefore quite long and tiring. Each grade can be tested on <b>ALL</b> the techniques they have learned so far. This results in increasingly longer gradings the higher up the grade structure one gets.</p>

<p>There are 2 major competition events in the TJF. The first is the <b>Atemi Natinals</b> in November each year (TJF uses the academic calendar). This is more of a demonstration competition were candidates from each grade compete against each other in high intensity V's, circles and gauntlets. The candidates are judged by a panel who assess their ability to defend themselves, style &amp; composure, breadth of technique and the correct execution of the technique.</p>
<p>The <b>Randori Nationals</b> are held in March each year. These are more of a sporting competition than the Atemi Nationals. The same grade levels compete against each other with limited techniques at lower grades allowing only pins increasing the number of techniques allowed for higher and higher grades until full Judo rules are applied to higher grades.</p>
<p>Both events are held in Birmingham, they mark the highlight of the TJF social calendar for the majority of members. Due to the largeproportion of University students both events are now accepted as BUSA events.</p>

<p>Rupinderpal Singh Dhillon ( 1969-) is a Uk born English Punjabi Writer, who has written many poems in English, and an English Novel about Sikhs called Annexation, and is the first person bron and bred in the UK, who has written a Punjabi novel in the langugae as it is used in the west. That is the language code has shifted to an Angloised nature, reflecting the way the Punajbis born in the west use the language. As such it is a mixture of Taxila, Doabi, Maji and Malvi dialects. Normally such languge is reflected in novels such as Londonstanni, in English. He has chosen to go the other way and as a result created a new style of written Punjabi. This novel is Nila Noor, and has been championed by Desi Radio in Southall. Currently it isonly available from Diggory Press. Again Dhillon has bucked trends by ignoring Indian based Publishers and going to a ffrim based in the UK.</p>
<p>It is considered a Pioneering work, and he was interviwed on Radio earlierin the year, and asked what inspired him to write. He definitely considers himself English, but belives Punjabi is now an international langugae which belongs to all Punjabis throughout the world. It is likely that it will be used as a text book in the UK, as the punjabi is easily understood by locals compared to Punjabi novels from India and Pakistan.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-13_3339.html" title="Edit section: Camera Diet">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Camera Diet</span></h2>
<p>The Camera Diet is a concept explored in Jeff Hawkins's book On Intelligence. In the book, Hawkins states that the operation of the brain resembles the execution of scripts. An example script is "driving home from work". While one executes the script and drives home, they may be thinking about other things. Similarly, there are scripts for eating out. One can go out to eat and talk to one's friend at the same time.</p>
<p>While eating out is scripted, one does not have good control over the scripted activity — it is always the same process. Therefore, one who eats with poor etiquette while eating out will always eat badly. On the other hand, Hawkins claims a script is not executed if there is no match between the script and the activity you are doing, allowing the possibility that one might have separate scripts for "eating out" and "eating at home". As another example, if one had never taken a bus home and then rode a bus for the first time, there would be no automatic script — one would need to think carefully about the ride and watch for one's street.</p>
<p>Hawkins argues that people who wish to diet need to have a way to keep their bad eating scripts from being executed — one could not continue to execute old eating scripts and successfully lose weight. To do so, one would need to change the way one eats so as to not match any automatic scripts. One would then be forced to think about the eating activity and try to make better food selections.</p>
<p>Hawkins suggests starting by making a single change to one's eating, which would cause the eating to become less automatic. Instead of eating in a way that would match old eating scripts, Hawkins suggests doing a "photo shoot" along with eating; i.e. taking a photograph of what one is about to eat. As none of the old eating scripts would contain photo shoots, they would not match the new situation.</p>
