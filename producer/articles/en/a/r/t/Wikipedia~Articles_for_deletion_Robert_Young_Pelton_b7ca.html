<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> The article is in bad shape, yes, but the subject is definitely notable with articles specifically about him in Time Magazine and Salon, among others. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 22:55, 20 August 2006 (UTC) Can we get a <b>Speedy Keep</b> here?

<li><b>Complete rewrite</b> The article is basically an advertisement, but he seems to be fairly established. The problem in the article lies in that the lower half is as follows:

<li><b>Keep</b> I've met Mr. Young Pelton, read his books and have spoken with people who know him and his 'adventures'. If anything the article leaves out some of the incredible things he's done and accomplished. It doesn't mention the numerous awards he's recieved or the fact that his writing and traveling are just one face of his multi-faceted life. I couldn't imagine anyone who knows of him or what he's done objecting to this Wiki piece. - <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.158.141.174 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.158.141.174_9885.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.158.141.174">contribs</a>).</small>}</li>

<li><b>Article Subject</b> Hi, Robert Young Pelton here... it seems that the fellow who wants to delete the entry is a guy named James who got into a pissing match with me on another site. Open to cleaning up the organization and getting rid of the stupid verbal graffitti that gets added. More importantly the links on the site are to outside articles and all information in the listing is verfiable. Might be the only Wiki entry that has my personal friggin email in it! In any case I have no idea who I am talking to on this forum. ...and no... my mother didn't write the entry or the comment above.&#160;:)))) I could post my full CV if needed....its handy to have a web entry that people can refer to. - <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by RYP (<a href="../../../r/y/p/User_talk%7ERYP_bc04.html" title="User talk:RYP">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RYP_29bd.html" title="Special:Contributions/RYP">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - From Spencer in New York - Robert Pelton's work is extremely valuable to the world of journalism. Ideas and observations made outside of the corporate news entities are slowly becoming a thing of the past and less and less available to those of us that look to independent journalism to inform us on what is really happening in the world. The "non-sexy, in vogue" stories, issues, and places in need of our attention are what Mr. Pelton has made a career of focusing on and illuminating through his books, articles, and reports. Deleting his entry from Wikipedia, is fully contrary to what Wikipedia is about; a site based around the idea of community, the ideal of which as described by its founder as, "Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing," - <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Spencerpost (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Spencerpost_5b36.html" title="Special:Contributions/Spencerpost">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>KEEP!!!</b> Y'all gotta be kiddin me, thats the best most clinical author's profile in 5 paragraphs I've ever read replete with links to the author's works with in-depth coverage. Where's the beef about self-seeking promotion? I sure aint seein any. Haint it Wikipedia SOP to include profiles of world famous, award winning authors complete with links that refer to their works? And if Wiki-wackos start editing and messing it up, dont worry because commonwealth opinion will prevail and clip whatever junk gets added on. Otherwise y'all are crazy to throw out the baby with the bathwater here, Robert Pelton is easily one of the most influential writers of our time...... says me, Yorickentucky</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The entry seems fine to me. A photograph would be good and the last paragraph needs re-arranging too. Young-Pelton is probably the most prominent and respected author in this field. Although it'd be fair to say that his Televised and journalistic pieces aren't to the same standard of the likes of the BBC's John Simpson, the books he has published are much more encyclopedic rather than subjective reportage... all of this is nicely captured in the entry, although - as i say - it's a bit messy at the moment.

<li><b>Keep</b> Robert is the real deal! He interviewed John Walker Lindh and his adventures and books are epic. The Wikipedia would be incomplete without a mention of Robert Young Pelton. The article needs to stay. SP24.245.14.48 02:16, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I have read several of Pelton's books and find them to be informative, entertaining, perceptive and humane. His web site "black flag cafe" has proven to be a very valuable source of information and contacts in re my travel to non-traditional destinations. The sincerety of RYP in providing relevant and valuable information and topical discussion is beyond question. He is a man who "walks the walk" and better yet encourages and motivates others to do the same. submitted by: Charlotte</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Richfife, notable author with many books under his belt. And we're not talking vanity press here, either. <a href="../../../r/f/e/User%7ERFerreira_c585.html" title="User:RFerreira">RFerreira</a> 22:57, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
