<li>As Ben noted, these were engraved stones created by the Kassites in Mesopotamia to record land grants and land boundaries. They are the only remaining artworks from their period in charge of Babylonia from the 16th Century BC to the 12th Century BC and examples are in the Louvre and the National Museum of Iraq.

<p>The basis for placing this on speedy deletion appeared to be that the city was unnamed: which is why "what links here" was invented, revealing that it is in fact Sheffield, UK. I think a decision needs to be made on whether this is notable enough for an encyclopedia i.e. whether it's made up or whether it needs clean up. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Francs2000</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Talk</a> [[]] 00:46, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a very real phenomena that requires a phrase to encapsulate it and facilitate discussion etc. Because it is disparaging of capitalism, there will obviously be supporters of this socio-economic system that do not wish to have such a critically descriptive phrase in existence, and will therefore want it deleted. For an example of Capitalist Money Madness being used and discussed, see the talk forums of the Guardian newspaper <a href="http://talk.guardian.co.uk/WebX?13@73.jmPzaPcVplW^0@.461" class="external free" title="http://talk.guardian.co.uk/WebX?13@73.jmPzaPcVplW^0@.461" rel="nofollow">http://talk.guardian.co.uk/WebX?13@73.jmPzaPcVplW^0@.461</a> -- <i>Anonymous post by 195.92.67.67</i></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Google only shows about 17 instances of this, all at <i>www.blackchat.co.uk</i>, and Wikipedia already has articles which contain criticisms of capitalism (or it should). Even if the world "requires a phrase to encapsulate it and facilitate discussion", it's not an encyclopedia's job to spread usage of a phrase just because it would help to facilitate discussion. Or at least, it's not Wikipedia's job to do such. -- <a href="../../../k/h/y/User%7EKhym_Chanur_d0a4.html" title="User:Khym Chanur">Khym Chanur</a> 07:18, Jan 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Doesn't 'pass the google test' as he has a fairly common name, and only two of the top 30 hits for that name are his (and that probably as he owns the domain name). Doesn't pass the academic test either, as there is no evidence of a permanent position or a notable publication record (Google Scholar and ISI Web of Knowledge do not give any indication that any paper he has published has been cited to date, which indicates non-notability in that sphere). What you can find is 235 hits for 'Jonathan Bishop Glamorgan', including a press release. Which, having read, I now feel that the PARLE system may just about deserve an article if it continues to be developed, but that doesn't mean the researcher who led the initial study does (and since they gave it to an MSc student, it suggests it was a very initial study).

<p>A dicdef neologism. Gets 492 hits on Google, and Google searches for "Seph D", and not Seph'd. So I'd assume that upwards of 80% of those hits are not "seph'd", but "Seph D" of some kind.

<li>I restored it the first time because I thought that some of it, perhaps, would be helpful to us in writing articles related to the history of China. But afterwards I found that the thing had been copied wholesale from a 180-year-old text on Project Gutenberg. The article talks about Imperial China in the present tense and is outdated to a ridiculous degree. Since it is already on Project Gutenberg there really is no reason why we should "save a copy" on Wikipedia for reference. This is why I speedied it the second time. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 04:23, Jan 12, 2005 (UTC)

<p><i>from VfD:</i></p>
<p>An essay about a single song by Bob Dylan, which says it's Dylan's version of the song "Norweigan [sic] Wood", or maybe "Norwiegan [sic] Wood". I realize that Dylanology is still a booming business, but this song is no "Blowing in the Wind" and I wonder if it's all that notable; meanwhile, this article as it now stands contains what I'll charitably term "original research". -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:39, 2005 Jan 12 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Definitely needs cleanup. Perhaps the song isn't that notable, but given Dylan's notability, by extension any song he wrote is certainly of some interest.

<li><b>comment, no vote</b>. If this was Dylanology, you'd get about four pages of detailed discussion on whether it came before, after, or simultaneously with Norwegian Wood. (There's an elaborate story involving hotel rooms and rubbish bins, I think, but I forget the details). The linkage between them is, um, canonically accepted... or however you might want to term that; not research original to the article author, anyway. Is a random Dylan song encyclopedic? Couldn't comment. What do we have for precedent?

<li><b>Serious Editing Needed</b>, this article is just not good and is more opinion than anything. If one thing needs to go, it's the "direct message to Lennon" bit. The song is notable not only because of its relation to "Norwegian Wood" but also because there's a Byrds song with the same melody. I don't know which song, but there was a George Harrison interview in <i>Guitar World</i> quite a while ago where he reflects on how that melody was being passed around between several bands. Dylan also played it during the acoustic half of the 65-66 tour. The acoustic set included "Desolation Row," "Mr. Tambourine Man," "Visions of Johanna," and "Just Like A Woman" which are all very strong songs, so he apparently thinks highly of "4th Time Around."--68.49.56.238 23:11, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can only conclude this is vandalism, clearly *not* a vanity page - all current MPs have a wikipedia entry, and Johnson is one of the best known outside of the Cabinet, and would almost certainly be notable enough for a wikipedia entry for his journalism and other media roles alone. <b>keep</b>.

I've done a Google search to make sure that I haven't missed anything about a replacement Shuttle being built, but NASA have always said that they will not be building a replacement for Columbia. The only reason they could build Endeavour to replace Challenger was that they already had some spare parts.

<li>I think the article page is wrong, but I come up with sources that say one way and sources that say the other. In any case, Challenger, Columbia and Enterprise were heavily used in testing. The only reason Challenger was refit instead was because it was cheaper to build it into a shuttle, than to open up a completed shuttle and refurbish it. It was the same reason why they built Endeavour. 132.205.45.110 20:36, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete. No mention of this on any of the NASA sites. There are a couple of Google hits that tell a similar story and seem to be some sort of role-playing game, and <i>Phoenix</i> was one of the <a href="http://spacelink.nasa.gov/NASA.Projects/Human.Exploration.and.Development.of.Space/Human.Space.Flight/Shuttle/Shuttle.History/Endeavour.Naming.Contest/State.Winners.Announcement" class="external text" title="http://spacelink.nasa.gov/NASA.Projects/Human.Exploration.and.Development.of.Space/Human.Space.Flight/Shuttle/Shuttle.History/Endeavour.Naming.Contest/State.Winners.Announcement" rel="nofollow">rejected names</a> for Endeavour.

<li>I'm sure <i>Phoenix</i> wouldn't even fall into the standard naming categories (ships of exploration, basically); but that aside... Building OV-106 was briefly proposed by Boeing in early 2003, and was probably studied for a few weeks. However, there are no plans to build one, no strategic plan requiring one (the Shuttles are being withdrawn over the next few years - "set to begin in summer 2007" would mean it would have first flight in about 2010 - and they only <i>need</i> a three-orbiter fleet, anyhow)... it's nonsense. It may well be a garbled misunderstanding of the OV-2xx idea (a "moldline-compatible" redesigned Shuttle II), but I don't think even that got much play other than being kicked around in space-policy circles for a bit. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> 13:19, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>(right down to some odd captialization). A list of facts can not be copyrighted though the presentation can be, but this is still <b>non-authoritative</b>. I replaced the ditto marks with spelled out text and expanded the abbreviation <i>abt</i> to <i>about</i>.

Initally, this user also insisted that catagories also be place on Wikipedia for OWU buildings (and those catagories need to be deleted as well). None of the buildings listed here merits its own listing on Wikipedia with the text that accompanies them; unless someone is willing to flush out <b>facts</b> about them (architect, important events tied to these specific buildings, etc. Finally, while a listing on the National Register of Historic Places is a designation that recognizes the building role in history, design merit and/or significant people tied to the listing; unless someone is willing to flush that information out, simply stating that a building is on the list isn't enough for that building to have it own listing.

<li><b>Merge</b>. What a surprise to be perusing VfD and discovering my Alma Mater in this way. Elliot Hall is marginally notable because it is the first building on campus and dates to 1833. University Hall dates to 1901 and has a very nice organ, but is not particularly notable. Phillips Hall is just an ugly 1950s building. The Scienece Center was just renovated and expanded and is as nonnotable now as it was before said renovation. Merrick sits abandoned and is mildly interesting architecturally, yet not notable in any meaningful way. Sturges is old, architecturally banal, and singularly hideous as a building. Slocum has gorgeous stained glass, but not much esle to comment on. As always, poor Sanborn Hall, home of the School of Music, seems to have been forgotten enitrely. These pages just need to all go away. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 05:52, Jan 16, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I suppose I'd be perfectly happy with a <b>merge</b> to Ohio Wesleyan University, though, as I understand it, that means keeping all of these as redirects, which seems kind of inappropriate to me. It's not likely that anyone is going to look these up, and it's not likely that any other article will link to them. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 21:42, Jan 16, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As far as I understand, a merge doesn't usually imply a redirect (hence the "<i>merge and redirect</i>" vote that is sometimes used). If redirects are used, though, they would obviously need a different title (as "X Hall, Wesleyan" is clearly a misnomer given the number of universities listed in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan.html" title="Wesleyan">Wesleyan</a>). <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos"></a> — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos">Talk</a> 22:04, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that the bigger question is, do these listing (on their own) mean anything to anyone other than Xiapingowu(et.al.) who launched them? Now if they were named for someone who did something significant, then maybe they should be mentioned under that person's article on Wikipedia. So it goes back to the question, <i>do these building articles add value to Wikipedia</i>? Are they listings that someone would visit the site just to look for, or are they something that only an OWU person/alumnus would look for? Are they significant enough on their own to stand alone?[[User:Stude62|<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStude62_1ae3.html" title="User:Stude62">user: stude62</a> talk:stude62]] 22:23, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think I can pretty safely say from experience that these buildings do not deserve individual listings. Elliot Hall at the least deserves to be mentioned on the Ohio Wesleyan University page as do little tidbits like the beautiful organ in Gray Chapel and the stained glass in Slocum, just this summer restored to its original beauty, but none of it is significant outside of the university. I think a redirect would not be appropriate. If I have to make a choice between a merge and redirect and a delete vote, I would rather these pages were deleted, at which point I could just add a few of these tidbits to the main university page myself. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 06:51, Jan 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Man, why did that scene get cut from syndication? Lenny's bizarrely appropriate line about Burns being 'no bowl of Special K' made me laugh out loud the ONE time it was run. Was it cut out because Kellogg's and/or Disney wanted them not to use their logos? I sorta doubt that..</p>

<p>That old guy in the airport asks a book seller if he has anything by Robert Ludlum, to which the seller replies: "Get out". Was there something about a hijacking in some of his books? I'm not sure I get this reference.</p>

<p>Under cultural references, the following should be considered...</p>
<p>In the film Jaws - Quince (the shark guy) turns up - scratching his hands down the blackboard to gain attention - after the mother of a child eaten by Jaws offers $3000, says he'll find it for $3000 but will only kill it for $10,000.</p>
<p>Similarly, Willy enters the church and draws attention by scratching his down the blackboard - in an identical fashion - then offers his services in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>If you see the two scenes, the parallels in behaviour are undeniable. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.154.45.145_68bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.154.45.145">81.154.45.145</a> (talk) 01:08, 24 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Aas, Henrik is widely know as the man in the leather outfit. A version of this legend is preserved in a late fifteenth-century manuscript, in a story called "Rumpa mi", written by the man from God knows where.

<li><b>Redirect into Eating Clubs (Princeton University)</b>. Ivy was the first eating club at Princeton in the mold of the modern clubs (sporadic eating associations existed in the late 19th century beforehand, but Ivy was the first permanent club).

Otherwise if that section is this long as this article, it will have to be moved to some other article than <b>Islam in Iran.</b> That was the reason it was short.

<li><b>Keep</b> it. We have articles here on the Spanish Inquisition, the Holocaust, etc.; I am sure Torquemada and Hitler would not be thrilled with the facts presented there. It would be no less than absurd to obscure a factual set of interesting and useful information- that of the well documented actual discrimination against especially Baha'i and Jews in Iran- because of one user's apparent distaste for criticism of anti-Semitic activity. One could do worse than the United States government in seeking out factual information; although if someone wishes to use information from FreedomHouse, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Britannica, or whatever to suplement this material, fine with me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I second user Humus Sapiens's comments- the focus on democratic Israel in an irrelevant discussion, which was meant to analyze a region full of totalitarian autocracies, goes beyong legitimate criticism and enters the realm of double standards, which according to former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky is one sure indicator of anti-Semitism. Along with OneGuy's disparaging comments about "Zionists", this leads one to question whether he supports the views of genocidal mass-murderers, such as Adolf Hitler and Yasser Arafat, and questions the right to Jewish sovereignty, alone of all the world's nations.__sirmikeguy 04:17, Jan 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article, and <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_%28spelling%29.html" title="Russian (spelling)">Russian (spelling)</a>, were created by <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">User:Mikkalai</a> because he felt some links to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_%28language%29.html" title="Russian (language)">Russian (language)</a> were "clutter". Apparently it was inconvenient for him to have so many articles linking to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_%28language%29.html" title="Russian (language)">Russian (language)</a> merely because a person happened to speak Russian, or a word was spelled in Russian. However, this change matches no policy I am aware of, was carried out unilaterally, and is certainly inconvenient for the <b>reader</b> of the article, who in my view is more important in this case. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 21:25, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

Also, I'd like to point at a hostile attitude ot Jayig, who started chasing me all over my edits without talking.

<li>Actually, I first put it on the Village Pump (policy) page for comment, and when others agreed that it was a bad idea, then I reverted the changes. And it was only after you actually violated the 3RR on a couple of articles defending your unilateral change that I brought it here for VfD. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 21:47, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>It doesn't matter that you talked to some buddies. The point is you reverted <b>my</b> changes without talking to <b>me</b>. I find this arrogant and disrespoectful. And I didn't violate 3-revert rule. Learn to count (or English language), buddy. There were 4 edits, 3 of which were reverts of yours.

<li>What pissed me off most that you lurked there silently, counting "One, Two, Three, BANG! GOTCHA!" This berhavior is simply disgusting. Anyone can check I never reverted twice in a row, not to say 3 times. I am a pretty reasonable guy.

<li>There is no policy that forbids me to do what I did. You are probably confusing tthe Soviet and Western notions of freedom. It is in totalitarian <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> only things listed in the Law were allowed, and the rest was forbidden.

<ul>
<li>The problem with a re-direct is that it will create double re-directs in all those articles Mikkalai has changed to point to his pages. Double re-directs don't work, causing even more problems for the user. At least if they're deleted, then we can finally change the articles he has re-directed to point back to where they are supposed to, since he apparently won't allow anyone to do that now. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 22:50, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Not entirely sure how it would if you set the redirect to go to the final destination page and not another redirect. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 23:33, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Because I simply cannot find pages that discuss <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a> <i>per se</i>. All what I see are pages that say how, e.g., <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsar_Bomba_8e1f.html" title="Tsar Bomba">Tsar Bomba</a> is written with Russian letters. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 23:41, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>My question is why to you need to know every page linking to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a>? <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Monkey_6b08.html" title="User:Evil Monkey">Evil Monkey</a> → <small><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvil_Monkey_65b0.html" title="User talk:Evil Monkey">Talk</a> 23:42, Jan 12, 2005 (UTC)</small>
<ul>
<li>I donn't need every pages that link to Ru Lang <b>now</b>. I want to see all pages that <b>discuss the language</b>, rather than say how <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minsk.html" title="Minsk">Minsk</a> is written with Russian letters. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 23:47, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Then add them as links in the main article, surely? <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 23:56, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How would I find them in the first place? Ever heard about e.g., <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centum.html" title="Centum">Centum</a>? Also, there is a pretty fat chance that some smartjay will decide that <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centum.html" title="Centum">Centum</a> has only cursory relation to the article and delete the link.

<li><b>Delete</b>, because the page itself is content-free and meaningless. It's intended to be editor-friendly, but at the expense of being reader-hostile (no reader clicking on a "Russian" link wants to go to this page). Mikkalai does raise a valid point about how some pages have so many backlinks that the feature becomes unusable, but this is a general problem (not just for language pages) that needs some other solution. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 02:09, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Suggestion:</b> When the links are changed back; maybe some of them shouldn't be links in the first place. I mean maybe instead of putting in "[[Russian]]" you should just put in "Russian" .

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think it's a copyvio. No Google hits on things like <i>"note surprise" "steam surprise"</i>. Built up by a single contributor, <a href="../../../k/b/g/User%7EKbg_a4ca.html" title="User:Kbg">User:Kbg</a>, incrementally in a long series of edits. Minor spelling and punctuation errors, probably typos rather than errors, such as "Balloon" spelled first correctly, then incorrectly as "baloon," are not typical of "one of those email forwards." But I think it does fall under the rubric of "personal essay" or "original research." I wonder whether the contributor has considered submitting this to a magazine... they seem to love articles that can be billed on the cover as "47 ways to..." or "22 great ideas for..." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:54, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> original research. It's not badly written, but it's not encyclopedic either.

<li>I speedied it before it came here, because (i) in the form in which I read it it said almost nothing (it's grown a lot since), and (ii) at best it promised to become a how-to, and, well, see Wyss's comment. (I realized that strictly speaking neither of these was grounds for a speedy, but was under the impression, perhaps mistaken, that it's common practice to speedy new articles that have multiple serious problems.) So anyway, WP is not a how-to manual.

<li>Look, OK, I'm just being difficult and argumentative, but for the record I do NOT think there is any <i>policy</i> to the effect that "Wikipedia is not a how-to manual." <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> says nothing about this, and <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow-to_dba1.html" title="Wikipedia:How-to">Wikipedia:How-to</a> points squarely in the opposite direction.

<li><b>Delete</b> as personal essay/original research. This is not well-established factual, verifiable, properly sourced material. At best this is entertaining with a germ or two of truth in it.

<li><b>Delete</b> because this seems very specialized rather than pandemic. Maybe what works on his significant other doesn't work on everyone.

<li><b>Delete</b>.
