<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>.

<p>Believe me I don't want to nominate this. I was going to edit it for accuracy, but then stopped because it seems so unsalvageable. To start with, it's purely speculation. There probably will be a 40th Canadian parliament one day, but when that day comes, will Harper still be prime minister going into the election, as the article suggests? What if Harper's Tories resign and the Liberals form a minority government without an election? It's happened before. Even if the Tories are still the government going into the next election, how do we know Harper will be consulting the Governor General as to when the election will be held, as the article says? What if Harper resigns or dies in office? That's happened before in Canadian history, too. Which brings me to my next point. This article isn't about the 40th Canadian parliament. It's about the <a href="../../../4/0/t/40th_Canadian_federal_election_62ce.html" title="40th Canadian federal election">40th Canadian federal election</a>, which already has an article. And that's because we don't know anything except that the next Parliament will result from the next election. Unless I'm remembering my politics wrong, and a switch in governments actually signals a new Parliament, but even then we don't know if that's what causes the next Parliament to be formed. <b>Delete</b> as either speculation or unexpandable, as a simple fact, namely that there probably will be a 40th Canadian parliament one day. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">The Republic Restored</a></small> 04:33, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think we all know here that the likelyhood of Canada not having a 40th Parliament in some form or another is around the same odds of someone in this afd being hit in the head by a meteor.

<li><b>Keep</b> So far no one has quoted any specific part of the Wikipedia policy to support their position that this should be deleted.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I also agree that this article should be deleted. After all, it is purely speculation right now, I mean, the 39th Parliament hasn't even begun its first sessions, and the MP's haven't even been sworn in either. For all we know, the Canadian government might completely fall in this Parliament and form the 1st Canadian Republic, not that I'm say it's likely to happen, but we shouldn't be speculating about events that we can't even place a date to.

<li><i><b>Weak keep</b></i> While it's not a bad idea to get the perfunctories out of the way, particularly given the short-lived nature of the <a href="../../../3/8/t/38th_Canadian_parliament_65e9.html" title="38th Canadian parliament">last government/assembly</a>, this article is a tad premature just yet ... hell, the <a href="../../../3/9/t/39th_Canadian_parliament_a78d.html" title="39th Canadian parliament">recently elected Parliament</a> hasn't even met yet! I don't think we should delete an article that will be resurrected later, however. If it remains, it should be edited to generalise any notions therein (e.g., nix mention of Harper, etc.) E Pluribus Anthony | <a href="../../../e/_/p/User_talk%7EE_Pluribus_Anthony_adc5.html" title="User talk:E Pluribus Anthony"><i>talk</i></a> | 06:30, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Though a 40th Parliment may exist someday. It's still assumptious to say that Harper will still be PM by then (Harper could suddenly resign or die in office). Therefore since this article is based partially on assumptions, it should be deleted. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodDay_3ee1.html" title="User:GoodDay">GoodDay</a> 17:36, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
