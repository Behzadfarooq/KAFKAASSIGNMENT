<p>"The Independent Student Newspaper of the University of Victoria". Marked as a speedy, but it doesn't seem like one. <s>Might be best merged somewhere but no vote from me yet</s>. My vote is <b>keep</b> now it's been cleaned up. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 10:39, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Redirect</b></s> to <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Victoria_4600.html" title="University of Victoria">University of Victoria</a>, merging a little of the intro. Most of this article is a <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyvio.html" title="Copyvio">copyvio</a> from <a href="http://www.martlet.ca/archives/031002/news6.html" class="external text" title="http://www.martlet.ca/archives/031002/news6.html" rel="nofollow">www.martlet.ca/archives/031002/news6.html</a>, but the material doesn't belong in this article anyway. Some of the information (but not the text) could go to various other articles. My first reaction to this listing was that it was unnecessary, as the proposer didn't propose deletion, but I see the problems now and yes, VfD is probably the way to go. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 12:18, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is an existing category for Category:Canadian student newspapers, which I've added this article to. I <b>strongly</b> object to any attempt to draw a distinction between Canadian student newspapers that are notable enough to have an article and those that aren't, and fail to see how <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Martlet_b8c0.html" title="The Martlet">The Martlet</a></i> is any less notable than American student papers such as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tartan_4704.html" title="The Tartan">The Tartan</a></i> or the <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Maroon_9723.html" title="Chicago Maroon">Chicago Maroon</a></i>, both of which also already have articles. The only acceptable options are <b>keep</b> this, or <b>delete all university newspapers, period</b>; nothing in between is appropriate. I have to say <b>cleanup</b> (I've done some myself just now), but keep. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:08, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> (change of vote). Good <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refactor.html" title="Refactor">refactor</a>. Agree that Canadian (and Australian... <i>hang in there <a href="../../../l/l/e/Lleyton_Hewitt_aed8.html" title="Lleyton Hewitt">Lleyton</a></i>) student newspapers should be treated equally to those of other countries, but I think the above argument misses the point on several issues. Academic (;-&gt; now. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 20:40, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, if I'm missing the point, then please show me where. Because the way I see it, there are only three possible approaches to the general topic of student newspapers: (a) all are notable enough for Wikipedia, (b) none are notable enough for Wikipedia, (c) some are notable enough for Wikipedia and others aren't. I'm <i>genuinely</i> curious to know where the distinction lays for people who believe (c), because I don't personally see where a defensible distinction <i>can</i> be drawn. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 03:52, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: Peace! But for a start, you still seem to think that someone wants to discriminate against Canadians. Nobody is proposing that, see my comments above and those of others below. Before, it seemed you were arguing that because we hadn't deleted a similar article, we shouldn't delete this one. Two problems there: Firstly, nobody had at that stage suggested deleting this one (not even the nominator). Secondly, we do make mistakes. Precedents are relevant, but not proof. No change of vote (ie still a keep as revised from redirect). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 08:46, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In my original comment, my strong objection was to dividing Canadian student newspapers <b>from each other</b> as notable vs. non-notable; the American examples were raised in a different context. Yes, my point <i>is</i> that American and British student newspapers need to be treated equivalently; I raise that not because I think that there's some conspiracy against Canadian topics, but because if I didn't, this would have either survived or failed the VfD process as an isolated example and the others would have stayed right where they were. Frankly, I think student newspapers are a topic (university athletics teams and student unions would be two more) where we need to have a clear policy on their notability (or lack thereof) which applies consistently, because as things stand, some isolated examples get deleted and other isolated examples survive almost solely on the basis of <i>who happens to show up to vote in that particular case</i>, which isn't acceptable. (For example, the list of member papers at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_University_Press_d15e.html" title="Canadian University Press">Canadian University Press</a> <b>must</b> consistently link either to member papers or to the university articles. It <b>absolutely cannot</b> be half one, half the other. It also happens to be woefully incomplete at the moment, for that matter, since I can't add anything to it until I know whether I can link to papers.) And just for the record, Canadian topics <b>really have</b> sometimes been held to a higher standard of notability on VfD than their American or British equivalents. I ain't making this up. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 20:33, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: Lots of issues here, but I don't think this is the place to discuss them. We agree on the course of action. I notice you haven't expressed your opinions about student newspapers at <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat%27s_in%2C_what%27s_out_7f38.html#Newspapers_and_magazines" title="Wikipedia:What's in, what's out">Wikipedia:what's in, what's out#Newspapers and magazines</a>; Please consider doing this, although it's (quite explicitly) not a policy document it does have some following.

<li>I've merged the stubs for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tartan_4704.html" title="The Tartan">The Tartan</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Maroon_9723.html" title="Chicago Maroon">Chicago Maroon</a></i> with their respective universities. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 21:10, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Very well and good. There are still <i>plenty</i> of student newspapers existing in <a href="../../../s/t/u/Category%7EStudent_newspapers_8045.html" title="Category:Student newspapers">Category:Student newspapers</a>, and gawd knows how many more lurking outside of any category. Those were just two examples, not the totality of the issue I was raising. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:31, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course, but those were the only two I knew about at the time. I've started working on redirecting and merging the stubs in that category. Care to give me a hand? <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 18:29, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Frankly, no, because I'm not going to pretend I believe that student newspapers are unencyclopedic or undeserving of individual articles. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 02:54, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The burden of evidence should be very high to show that a regularly published newspaper is not notable, and most English and major other-language newspapers not sufficiently notable for the English wikipedia. Some would obviously fail, such as advertising and listing "newspapers." This would not. Bearcat introduces the problems with such an isolated deletion. The article now notes how it was "responsible for bringing about the resignation of the university's president," which is highly important. Besides, I've never had anything to do with the University of Victoria, but I'm <i>interested</i> in it, and it's certainly expandible. (What's it independent of? Was it a response to an oldline establishment student newspaper? Have any subsequently notable people written for it? And so on.) <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 18:42, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Clean up and keep</b>. Needs to be copyvio-free (if that's still an issue), but it's certainly worthwhile to have. – <a href="../../../b/e/g/User%7EBeginning_2e6d.html" title="User:Beginning">Beginning</a> 19:43, Jan 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Not enough for an article. A newspaper is not notable <i>per se</i>. As for Bearcat's argument, I'm all for deleting every university newspaper from Wikipedia, unless they are actually notable for something else than simply being a newspaper. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> 23:59, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>; student newspapers are on the wrong side of the line. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 05:00, Jan 29, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then start putting the damned things up for deletion. Just saying student newspapers aren't notable when only one paper is actually up for deletion will only result in that one paper being singled out for deletion and the others being left alone. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:17, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I <i>go</i> to UVic, I read the thing every week, and I don't think this is encyclopaedic. And for the record, I'd vote to delete other student newspapers of this miserly stature as well. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 10:09, Jan 29, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is that a merge and redirect, or just redirect?</li>
<li>And what do you define as "miserly" vs. "non-miserly" student newspapers? Where's the dividing line? <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:26, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's a merge and redirect. My bad. And a student newspaper that's churned out a number of <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_e802.html" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer</a>-winning journalists or had an impact on major affairs off the campus would probably make the cut, for me. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 21:16, Jan 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. By default, student newspapers are not notable. Practically every university and college has one. There could be a student newspaper that is notable. The first one in a country or language. A student newspaper where an extraordinary number of a country's top journalists learned their profession. One that has won the Pulitzer Prize, or the equivalent in another country. But the burden of proof is on the person writing the article to establish notability. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:55, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b> to <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Victoria_4600.html" title="University of Victoria">University of Victoria</a>. The argument for outright deletion escapes me. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 18:55, Jan 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> and redirect to <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Victoria_4600.html" title="University of Victoria">University of Victoria</a>. Current content is not sufficient to stand alone as an encyclopedia article. If there is ever a lot more encyclopedia-worthy material, it can be broken out to a separate article then. In the meantime, it is better discussed in context. Comment: To answer <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a>'s question above, I strongly believe the answer is C - keep some and delete others. The decision is a judgment call and often a very difficult one but it should be based on 1) whether the topic is or ever can be encyclopedic and 2) whether readers will understand the current content best if it is discussed separately or in the immediate context of some other article. I disagree with his/her comment that the "member pages at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_University_Press_d15e.html" title="Canadian University Press">Canadian University Press</a> must consistently link" one way or the other. Piped section links work just fine. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 22:56, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's necessary because Wikipedia <b>has</b> to start taking consistency of organization more seriously than it does. It looks bad to have some things separated out as articles while other equivalent things are strictly subsections of other articles, it looks bad to have an inconsistently-organized list, etc. Consistency isn't taken nearly seriously enough on here; there are <i>far</i> too many <i>ad hoc</i> decisions made in one case and not in another, resulting in poor organization. And also, I've noticed that the unofficial rule for most publications seems to be that any magazine or newspaper with a per issue circulation of at least 5,000 passes the test; why should a student paper be held to a different standard? <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 02:52, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think this is the place to discuss it, but I disagree with Bearcat's notion of consistency here. I don't see this as any different than (for example) one might have a list of an author's works with only the major works linking to articles of their own. Is there somewhere more appropriate to discuss this? -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:03, Feb 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Merging things like this defeats the object of the category system as the merged article won't be placed in the newspaper category. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Philip</a> 02:55, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Categories exist to serve articles, not vice-versa. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 09:24, Feb 2, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nobody's suggested otherwise. The point is that the category <i>isn't</i> serving the articles if it can't include 95 per cent of the articles that belong in it; it's of no value to have <i>any</i> articles on student newspapers, even "more notable than most" ones, if they're divorced of their context by the lack of any other student newspaper articles to compare them to. It <i>detracts</i> from the existing articles (and from Wikipedia as a whole) to have any "student newspapers" category at all, if isn't <i>allowed</i> to ever contain more than a fractional subset of that group of topics. (And again, comparing this statement to personal biography articles is intellectually dishonest; "student newspapers" is a finite set of things that are mostly of equal notability to each other, not a potentially infinite can of worms like allowing an article on any person who ever lived would be.) <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:05, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
