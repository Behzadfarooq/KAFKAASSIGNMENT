<p>The result of the debate was that no administrator need delete anything and that further deletion discussion was unnecessary. The discussion came to a unanimous agreement, including the nominator, to keep and to go for redirection instead. The nominator and a second editor, <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> below, also agreed that the discussion need not continue, and no further comments appeared after three hours.

<li>Actually, to be honest, the site <i>is</i> significant beyond its Alexa rank; it was one of the first local news websites in Canada to emerge as a response to <a href="../../../c/t/v/CTV_television_network_e6b0.html" title="CTV television network">CTV</a>'s local news cutbacks (see <a href="../../../c/t/v/CTV_Northern_Ontario_12e3.html" title="CTV Northern Ontario">MCTV</a>).

<li><b>Delete</b> - As described by <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> on the discussion page, "I can see there being a good article on religion and mental illness, but as this page stands, it's POV, unencyclopedic in the style it's written, and it has no sources. My suggestion is that it be deleted, and the creator (or someone else) puts it on a user subpage and works on it there, until it's ready to face the public, as it were." Also, singling out schizotypy as a specific disorder to mention in the title is really quite odd as it's just one minor classification out of a whole range that would be important for a comparison between religion and psychology in general or mental disorders more specifically. If the article stayed around waiting for cleanup it would just get redirectede to a real article on the topic under a better name, and this title is so specific it's really unnecessary as a redirect as nobody would think to go looking for it instead of, say, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_and_psychology.html" title="Religion and psychology">Religion and psychology</a> or Religion and mental disorders or whatnot.

It would be pure speculation in all of these cases because they can never be clinically examined and diagnosed. We can in hindsight say "oh that person diplayed some or all of the symptoms" but with mental illness there are a wide variety of causation, such as chemical imbalance and physical anomalies. For historical figures as outlined in this article it would be impossible to say definitively what the causation of the visions or voices that may or may not have compelled them to action. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 22:12, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If that's your attitude, why bother to delete? You could easily just edit the article to improve it.

<li>I apologise if my comment reads like a personal attack--it isn't my intention. The point is that your vote rationale puzzles me. You clearly think the article contains valuable material, because you want it merged; however you instead vote for delete because you think "such sensible moves would be blocked". I find it hard to avoid the conclusion that you are willing to sacrifice good material simply because you can't get consensus for your preferred merge. You then say "deletion does not prevent future creation with a full article", so naturally I ask you: why bother to delete in the first place? The article can be expanded where it is--if you think it needs to be. For myself I am quite happy with the current contents, so it's silly to ask me to edit it. It's a lovely, bijou little stub sitting there inviting someone who knows about the school to write about it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 10:53, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for your apology. I didn't take personally anyway just as an attack on everyone voting other than keep. I am not keen on schools in wikipedia, at least merging reduces the number of articles about them, but 1 vote to merge amongst all keeps and deletes is a wild goose chase. (and I note some closing admins count them as keeps&#160;;) ) --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimPope_0d3a.html" title="User:TimPope">Tim Pope</a> 16:49, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I generally assume that people who vote to merge want the information to be retained, since they're voting to have it preserved elsewhere on Wikipedia. Is this not your intention? <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 07:49, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Merges <i>are</i> keeps. This is a fact, and not one that has ever been, or ever will be, seriously disputed. When an article is merged, the material is kept and its history is kept.

<li>Simply merge the history for the two articles when you do the delete. At least that is what the documentation seems to say you can do. I don't see this as incompatible, just more work. This could explain why so many votes wind up as keep, the admins don't want to do the extra work, and elect to call the vote keep rather than merge and delete. So, maybe this is a good reason to not vote merge and delete, but to simple vote Merge. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 01:47, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Oh I see. A history merge. That is compatible. However I don't see what is gained from this that couldn't be achieved by simply merging and redirecting without deletion, which unlike a history merge is a reversible operation. I'd suggestion that admins probably don't want to do this precisely because once it's done even a sysop cannot undo it.</li>
<li>Voting merge won't necessarily get you a merge done for you by the closer. Anybody can do a merge so sometimes a sysop will do it (particularly if there is a consensus to merge--ie, merge votes outnumber all non-merge votes by a considerable margin, which is very rare), and often he'll leave that decision up to other editors, who are perfectly capable of doing it themselves.</li>
<li>There isn't a sysop "merge" button that a sysop can press to do a merge, it's an editing operation and often requires good judgement and knowledge of the material that, being chosen maybe for his clerical abilities and general reliability, a sysop does not necessarily have. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:16, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ok, just so we're clear, you agree your comment "Probably not compatible with the GFDL" was incorrect? Can we further agree that you'll no longer use this as an oft- repeated argument against delete and merge? I'll interpret no response as "yes" and "yes". - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 00:50, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>For the record, no and no. And it's preposterous to make these little assumptions--what if the editor you're addressing should happen not to read your comment, as I nearly did not? Have you by any chance recently been a denizen of some kind of flame forum?</li>
<li>Clearly it would be impractical to perform such a complex and irreversible procedure just to comply with a license, when a simple paste-and-redirect merge achieves precisely the same result in a reversible manner without any license issues. Also as a closer I'd not expect to see a discussion ending in a consensus "merge and delete", if only because it's a patently perverse vote. Having refined the argument, I shall reuse it to much greater effect. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 15:37, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, I was going to use this article as a means of compiling information, themes, and such about it; the idea that my intention was to advertise it is quite false, since I am quite aware (yet unfazed by the fact that) my story will remain unpopular. For an idea of how the finished article would have looked like, refer to an article regarding an actual novel such as "1984" by George Orwell, which is far from being an advertisement for the book. Still, by all means I'm wanting this void article to be removed at the moment. If, however, you are saying that this article should be deleted <i>because</i> of non-popularity, I suppose I can't do much other than to refrain from posting this article, regardless of whatever content I may put in it. Since I am fairly new at this and probably missed a few things in the guidelines of what and what not to post as an article, thank you for pointing this out. ~ Jake 11:26, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>If you have a company thats notable you have to actually move beyond the developmental stage of your operations, remember <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. Thats not to say you shouldn't have an article here in the future. Generally speaking, it is better to have the notability as a company, or as an individual that <i>other</i> people who aren't your friends, family members (or particularly <i>yourself</i>) would want to write about or read a story about you and/or Milliteq. I happen to know a guy who owns a company called Millitex and he does a great business. Drives a sweet <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porche.html" title="Porche">Porche</a>. They do special <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paint.html" title="Paint">paint</a> jobs for military vehicles. And I doubt he'd get an article here in the Wikipedia as you can see by the red link (like this one) on his company name. You have to establish real notability or notariety to get an article in. Try editing about a subject you have a real interest in, maybe you can contribute something positive to the knowledge base here. Good luck with your company BTW, I hope you do make it big enough to get in here someday! If you establish a user page I could have discussed all this with you in that space. Just one of the benifits of creating a wikipedia account.

<p>which is almost a speedy deletion candidate as "little or no content". I do see that there was one keep vote, and my decision to delete is not only based on vote count but also on the article's skeletal appearance. Remember that the "recreation" speedy deletion clause is for "substantially similar content, so if someone makes another article about this record label, with more content than the one which is being deleted now, this VFD debate should NOT be used as justification to speedy delete it as a recreation. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:23, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> I would have hoped as a regular reader of Wikipedia, that the purpose was to provide information to the masses as much as possible. The deletion of this article will stifle the growth of Wikipedia. Perhaps there is the need for more information, in which case I'll write more when the article's status is confirmed. Having said that, who wants to win a grammy to be considered anyway?

If one of our experienced Filipino editors gets ahold of this (I am not Filipino and have never been to the Philippines; I just wrote what I could!), then it could presumably become a more complete article and thus more worthy of inclusion.

<li><b>Comment</b> the Google test doesn't prove much by itself; Googling "Original American music" or a similar variation also generates lots of hits.

<li>It seems that it does, if you look at the Google results themselves for both OPM and original American music. The latter is often used to describe one artist for self-promotion or in some historical context, and while used by many artists there doesn't seem to be much of a consensus on what it is.

<li><b>Keep</b> However, the article really needs revision because its meaning in the present form of the article doesn't jive with how many, if not most, Filipinos define the term OPM. According to the article, as of this date, "OPM is original music created by anyone of Philippine descent. It can be in any genre, and its lyrics can be in any language." This is misleading. As far as I know, many Filipino artists (especially the more commercialized Pop music performers) limit the term OPM to Filipino Pop songs, especially those in the ballad form, popularize by artists like Martin Nievera, Rey Valera, Sharon Cuneta, and APO Hiking Society. I think, it's time to define OPM clearly. Should it refer only to Filipino Pop ballads, or should it finally mean: "OPM is simply Filipino music, or any type of music produced in the Philippines or by Filipinos regardless of their location when they composed it"? If this now becomes the more sensible and simple meaning, then OPM would become the mother umbrella of specific genres like Filipino (Pinoy) Rock, Filipino Jazz, Filipino Rap / Hip hop, Filipino Folk, etc. And I am for this more plain and sensible definition. --eLf_ideas 14:53, August 13, 2005 (CT)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>Improve</b>. I agree with CSTAR that the title is POV, as is most of the article. However, I believe that with an overhaul, it could be a valuable article.

<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>Improve</b>. There is a long history of mathematicians speculating on the nature of god - speculation is their job - and the idea of god is entangled with the idea of infinity which mathematicians can be said to have a particular viewpoint on.

<li><b>Comment:</b> What I seem to be seeing generally here is delete votes because the article is just a collection of quotes and is POV, and keep votes because the history of mathematics in relation to religion is a valid history subject. What I propose is move this article to something like <i>Mathematics and Religion</i> or <i>Mathematics and Spirituality</i> and turn it into an article on the historical relation between the two. Or just start a new article at one of these places and remove this one.

<dd>Could someone explain exactly why they believe that the title "Mathematics and God" is POV? Would it be better if we put quotes around the word "God"? The title "Mathematics and deities" sounds wrong to me. It is not clear to me that the article is talking about several gods. I would guess that with the possible exception of Plato, all the quotes here are talking about a monotheistic notion of "God". "Mathematics and religion" also sounds wrong to me, it is not about religion (or spirituality) <i>per se</i>. It seems to me that this article is about an <i>idea</i>. An idea, as expressed by several famous mathematics, about the relationship between mathematics and the notion of a supreme being they called "God" — perhaps seriously, perhaps metaphorically, perhaps jokingly. And in so doing, I would guess, they were also trying to say something important, about mathematics and its relationship to the world we live in. I think, the fact that these mathematicians thought this idea was important, means it <i>is</i> important, if only for the reason that they thought so. Their idea is certainly POV, our writing about their idea is not. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 19:53, August 16, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's not the title by itself that causes the problem. The POV is caused more by title plus current first paragraph:
<dl>
<dd><i>A number of famous mathematicians have made connections between <b>mathematics and God</b>, often likening God to a mathematician.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Taken together, these could be read to imply a POV that a God exists. Now, I don't actually read it this way, rather I see this use of the word "God" as a literary device to denote a concept that the average reader will be familiar with, regardless of the beliefs about God that the reader holds. Nevertheless, I think the first reading is quite plausible for many of our readers, and the paragraph is therefore unacceptable as it stands. I would support keeping the current title if the first paragraph was changed so that the overall POV effect was eliminated. <a href="../../../d/m/h/User%7EDmharvey_69fb.html" title="User:Dmharvey">Dmharvey</a> <a href="../../../u/s/e/Image%7EUser_dmharvey_sig.png_96c3.html" class="image" title="Image:User_dmharvey_sig.png"><img src="../../../upload/1/13/User_dmharvey_sig.png" alt="Image:User_dmharvey_sig.png" width="18" height="21" longdesc="../../../u/s/e/Image%7EUser_dmharvey_sig.png_96c3.html" /></a> <a href="../../../d/m/h/User_talk%7EDmharvey_4b37.html" title="User talk:Dmharvey">Talk</a> 20:21, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it would certainly be POV for Wikipedia to be asserting the existence of "God". And I can see given what Dmharvey has said above that the article and title could be read as doing that. David, has now changed the first paragraph to read:
<dl>
<dd><i>A number of famous mathematicians have made connections between mathematics and various notions of God.</i></dd>

<dd>If this is about Mathematics, not mathematicians, where is the formal definition of God? What is the status of the "proofs" mentioned? Are the proofs <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructive_proof.html" title="Constructive proof">Constructive</a>?

When <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_39cd.html" title="Intelligent Design">Intelligent Design</a> advocates are trying to revise one's science curriculum, one can get twitchy about such sloppiness; it's no longer harmless fun. <i>We</i> (mathematicians) know the proofs are nonsense; <i>they</i> don't.

<li><b>Comment</b> There does seem to be a precedent for not keeping pages of proverbs on wikipedia, but moving them to wikiquote instead. The links to English, French, German and Portugese proverbs provided at the bottom of the Latin proverbs page are all simple redirects to Wikiquote. Japanese, Polish and Spanish proverbs send one to a brief description of their use, and then once again redirect to wikiquote. Chinese proverbs trys to send one to wiktionary, but that may have been an accidental mistake. Therefor, we either need to send this page to wikiquote, or pull dozens of pages off of there, and back here. (Or at least duplicate the most important proverbs.) However, I don't know which way it should go. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcelight_76ef.html" title="User:Icelight">Icelight</a> 18:03, August 8, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see what Wikiquote has to do with it. These are proverbs (the non-proverbs, such as mottos and epigrams, should be removed) and have no place on Wikiquote, not least because they can seldom be attributed. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 18:18, 8 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think you are misunderstanding the situation (and Wikiquote). Proverbs have always been part of Wikiquote's mandate, since it's founding. They are featured prominently on the main page (just take a look). In fact, Wikiquote's very first, pitful, main page consisted of three links: Albert Einstein, Zen proverbs, and Irish proverbs. This kind of thing is the reason we have Wikiquote. And we at Wikipedia are not the ones to make Wikiquote policy. Also, you're pointing to the other Wikipedias is a bit of a red herring, because all of the Wikipedias have developed their own criteria for inclusion, plenty of subjects have been deleted here but kept on another 'Pedia, or vice versa. We don't follow their precedent, and none of the reasons cited here, like "useful" or "has blue links," make this article encyclopedic. Wiktionary and Wikibooks are both, but we certainly don't want to duplicate them, they still aren't encyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 21:16, August 8, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, I'll take all that on board, while still being completely unable to see that there's a good argument for deletion. If we don't follow Wikiquote's precent, nor that of any of the non-English Wikipedias, then I suggest we completely ignore their existence and just judge the proverbs on their encyclopedic quality, which I think is well nigh unimpeachable. --14:46, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I have used this many times and often wouldn't have thought to look in wikiquote. If wikipedia's search engine gets better, to the point where it automatically searches wiktionary, wikiquote, <i>et cetera</i> then perhaps we can revisit the issue. Until then, keep it in both places and we'll periodically merge them. (It is a nuisance that I often must search both the Latin proverbs and the Latin phrases pages for whichever one I'm thinking of; I was just looking for <i>quidquid latine dictum sit, altum viditur</i> again tonight).

<li>There is simply no such thing as "Walton Summit motorway". The concept of this stretch of road being a wholly separate motorway by that name is a simple <a href="http://pathetic.org.uk/motorways/waltonsummit.htm" class="external text" title="http://pathetic.org.uk/motorways/waltonsummit.htm" rel="nofollow">invention of a "Pathetic Motorways" web site</a>. (The other occurrences of this name on the Web, such as <a href="http://www.lmars.co.uk/m65motorway.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lmars.co.uk/m65motorway.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, and on Usenet, such as <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/uk.transport/msg/a85fa1c6aa35f220" class="external text" title="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/uk.transport/msg/a85fa1c6aa35f220" rel="nofollow">here</a>, all turn out to have that web site as their source.) If you look at <a href="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=53.7185&amp;lon=-2.6369&amp;scale=25000&amp;icon=x" class="external text" title="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=53.7185&amp;lon=-2.6369&amp;scale=25000&amp;icon=x" rel="nofollow">a map of the road</a> you'll see that this is simply a common slip road, that was previously a stretch of "A" class road, but where now non-motorway traffic is barred for the very simple reason that there is no way of exiting that stretch other than by joining a motorway, and that is still labelled as the <a href="../../../a/6/_/A6_road.html" title="A6 road">A6</a> on <a href="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=53.7192&amp;lon=-2.6356&amp;scale=10000&amp;icon=x" class="external text" title="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=53.7192&amp;lon=-2.6356&amp;scale=10000&amp;icon=x" rel="nofollow">some maps</a>. As I have argued before:
<ol>
<li>The sign on the "Walton Summit motorway" in the photograph on the web site that says "Walton Summit" <i>isn't naming the slip road</i>. It's not a road name sign. It's a <a href="http://www.highwaycode.gov.uk./signs06.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.highwaycode.gov.uk./signs06.htm" rel="nofollow">direction sign</a>, pointing the way, off the interchange and along the slip road, to Walton Summit.</li>
<li>There are <i>plenty</i> of motorway slip roads and other nameless motorway-class stretches of road in the U.K.. <a href="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=52.4792&amp;lon=-1.7132&amp;scale=25000&amp;icon=x" class="external text" title="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=52.4792&amp;lon=-1.7132&amp;scale=25000&amp;icon=x" rel="nofollow">Here are some more</a>. <a href="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=51.4993&amp;lon=-2.6899&amp;scale=25000&amp;icon=x" class="external text" title="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=51.4993&amp;lon=-2.6899&amp;scale=25000&amp;icon=x" rel="nofollow">And here</a>. <a href="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=51.5591&amp;lon=-0.5332&amp;scale=25000&amp;icon=x" class="external text" title="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=51.5591&amp;lon=-0.5332&amp;scale=25000&amp;icon=x" rel="nofollow">And here</a>.</li>
<li>It's certainly going to be in the interests of a "pathetic motorways" web site (the only source for this information) to build up the importance of a road into a fully-fledged "motorway" simply so that it can have one more target to knock down as "pathetic".</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Whilst a country's major highways may warrant articles, we should draw the line at articles on their individual slip roads going by invented names. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:01:44, 2005-08-07 (UTC)

<li>OK, lets look at some of the things that you claim. As I have pointed out previously to you, this is an extremely unusual sliproad. Show me another one in the UK that meets two motorways at the same time. Oh, you can't. There isn't one. There is no claim that it is a "fully fledged motorway". In fact, the site states "Really, it's an overgrown sliproad.."</li>
<li>Secondly "Walton Summit Motorway" is only a 'working name', until the correct name can be found through more research. This name is in common use throughout the British Roads community. There is no claim anywhere that the signpost pointing down the hill does anything other than point to a destination. Presumably you also don't recognise "Mancunian Way" but only A57(M)...</li>
<li>Thirdly, it was never previously a stretch of "A" road. It was new build and opened under motorway restrictions. This claim of being a motorway simply because it accesses a roundabout that meets only motorways is false. See M1 junction 21, for example.</li>
<li>Fourthly, I suggest you look up the meaning of "pathetic" properly... Pathetic Motorways does not simply exist to "knock targets down" - there's a heck of a lot of solid research that needs to go on to actually examine small motorways accurately. That's real genuine research that involves trawling round archive material located all around the country. It's not designed to be staid and boring, but interesting for the reader to learn some things. And yes, I'm very annoyed at the suggestion that it is just pure fantasy. You try doing some of the work!</li>
<li>However, I vote for <b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../m/6/5/M65_motorway.html" title="M65 motorway">M65 motorway</a>, with possibly a link provided from <a href="../../../m/6/1/M61_motorway.html" title="M61 motorway">M61 motorway</a>.

<li>The thing that is actually false here is the claim that it has "become legendary under that name". That's uttter rubbish. It hasn't. As I said, the <i>only</i> source for that name, which isn't even in widespread use, let alone "legendary", is the "Pathetic Motorways" web site, which has simply made up that name for a common slip road.

<li>All you have established with the above reference is that there is no designated motorway by the name of the "Walton Summit Motorway". I also notice that the above map establishes that there is no such thing as the Newcastle Urban Motorway, nor even the Durham Motorway--two stretches of motorway that I'm intimately acquainted with. Well done: at this rate you'll have proven that there are no roads in Britain except those that are listed under official names on a map produced by the Department of Transport. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 15:51, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>And assuming this hyperbole were actually true, this exercise of verifiability in action would be a problem <i>how</i>, exactly?
<ul>
<li>There is no verifiability problem; there is simply a case of a guy showing a single map that doesn't list a particular entity. I don't know what you find to be hyperbolae here--is it my statement that the motorways in question aren't named on the map or my statement that they nevertheless do exist?

<p><i>please re read original article, it has been updated with a lot of new material as of august 11th</i></p>
<p>This is a renomination due to the unusual outcome of the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Arab_hacker_649a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Arab hacker">first VFD vote</a>. The basis for the original nomination was non-notability. There were 7 Delete votes, plus 3 Merge votes (all of which recommended different pages to which to merge). The presiding admin discarded some of these votes on the grounds of lack of seniority, which apparently upset someone enough to open <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Tony_Sidaway_4a42.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Tony Sidaway">an RFC</a>. So, let's try this again and see if we can reach a consensus this time. My own vote is <b>delete</b>. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> (<a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFirebug_6151.html" title="User talk:Firebug">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Firebug_2eb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Firebug">contribs</a>) 12:41, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
<ul>
<li><s>Keep</s>. <i>Changed vote; see below</i>; I closed the last VfD, which was inconclusive because most of those voting were too new at the time (this may not be the case if the same people voted again now). The reason for discarding votes was not "lack of seniority" but (mostly) extreme newness--we tend to ignore votes from extremely new voters because of the possibility of sock puppetry.

<li>Well, I still don't have seniority, so this may as well be the last time I do this. I have read the article again, it has been re-written, and the re-write is interesting. However, none of the links show that the group the re-written article puports to exist actually exists. The first three links<a href="http://mauna.org/tiki/faq.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://mauna.org/tiki/faq.php" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://forum.regierigby.co.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://forum.regierigby.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://www.rubbersideup.com/forum/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rubbersideup.com/forum/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> are links to defaced pages, on which we see that hackers who claim to be Arabic have had their way with someone's server. However, these three links do not prove the existence of the Arab Hacker group, but merely prove the existence of hackers who claim to be Arabic. There have already been several cases of hackers who claimed to be Chinese or Arabs or what-have-you turning out to be thirteen-year-old script-kiddies, so this literally means nothing. The fourth link<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/printthis/2000/0,4814,53940,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.computerworld.com/printthis/2000/0,4814,53940,00.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> is to an article which mentions the FBI is on the lookout for Arab hackers. It does not proport that this group, the Arab Hackers group, exists. Instead, it mentions other groups in specific in the text of the article, and gives an un-cited list-box that has, as one of it's entries, "Arab Hax0rs." It can be argued that this is one and the same with Arab Hackers, but without a citation on the list-box, it is unclear as to where the list originated from. As such, the article seems to me to be poorly cited, offers no real proof that the group named "Arab Hackers" the article covers actually exists, and gets a <b>Delete</b> vote from me. <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 15:02, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I *have* cleaned up VfD articles I think are worth the effort of saving from the axe. I've done it twice already. But, this isn't an article I think is worth saving. I can find no evidence that convinces me that there is a group of hackers called "Arab Hackers," and the evidence given in the articles does not convince me of their existence, either. However, if you think it's worth spending the time, feel free to clean it up yourself. =) <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 21:32, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Comment</i> The links the article points to alledge that the FBI is trying to catch them. Somehow, I think the FBI would not be trying to catch them if their members had a Yahoo group, given that the FBI has the right to simply subpoena IP's and e-mail addy's to track the members down. This seems EXTREMELY unlikely - and is more likely just a group of wannabes. If they really were who the FBI was looking for, it seems to me they'd already be caught and jailed. The existence of the Yahoo group called "Arab Hackers" only proves the existence of a yahoo group called "Arab Hackers" - it does not prove that the Yahoo group and the alledged international criminal conspiracy/hackers group are in any way related. <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 21:19, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Comment</i> I would like to know what kind of evidence would prove this? There is no way more definitive evidence could be produced unless you want some sort of a video. "a day in the life of Arab Hacker". Maybe some satellite footage. I say that adequate evidence has been provided. there are literally hundreds of pages with the "fuck U.S.A. and israel" message so obviously, unless its a mere coincedence, they are connected. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuraisam_da37.html" title="User:Samuraisam">Samuraisam</a> 04:19, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Comment</i> As I said above: <i>For example, a US Government site that lists the group as being one that's sought after for extradition/interrogation/arrest.</i> I can find evidence that George Bush is defaming websites on zone-H.org. They only keep track of the names, they have no way of verifying if that really IS an Arab Hacker group or just one kid, or if the president is really vandalizing web-pages. Yes, I acknowledge that it's not unreasonable to presume what you're suggesting. However, we're <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">not allowed to presume things when we write articles.</a> If we're going to assert that a secret hacker group exists, we have to offer solid proof it exists that can't be explained as just one kid with a computer. <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 04:53, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> as per TimPope but do not delete. I do not normally advocate merging expandable stubs such as this but I can certainly believe that Tim thinks this is not expandable.

<ul>
<li>Just to be clear, are you recommending that all the information in the article be merged into that list? The page history doesn't show that any of it was ever there, aside from the name of the school. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 22:00, August 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The short answer is yes. The history of this article is extremely mixed up because of moves back and forth. It was part of the list once <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Waldegrave_School_for_Girls&amp;oldid=20471342" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Waldegrave_School_for_Girls&amp;oldid=20471342" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> but the list article was moved back to <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldegrave_School_for_Girls_6104.html" title="Waldegrave School for Girls">Waldegrave School for Girls</a> since TimPope had originally moved that article to the list article as the beginning of a merger. I would like to recommend that when people "merge" an article to a non-existent article that they follow the merge instructions rather than move it. It makes it far less complicated to follow. When I first saw this VfD, I looked at the history as well and believed that Tim had only posted a redirect, effectively soft-deleting the article but more complicated look through the moves found what had really happened. You can see some of the moves and merges at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Waldegrave_School_for_Girls&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Waldegrave_School_for_Girls&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoubleBlue_f889.html" title="User:DoubleBlue"><font color="darkblue"><b>Double</b></font><font color="blue">Blue</font></a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoubleBlue_3ebb.html" title="User talk:DoubleBlue">Talk)</a> 00:16, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for the usual arguments. The most relevant here: 1) The editorial consensus apparently favors separate articles. Merging should be discussed with them, not on VfD. 2) There is a project to develop guidelines for school articles. The recommendations do not currently favor deletion. Go clean it up, expand it, tag it and sort it, etc. 3) Notability is not itself a criterion for deletion. Deletion is an extreme action only to be taken when there is no hope of a valid encyclopedic article arising through collaborative editing. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 23:29, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, if they were crazy enough to want to paraphrase text rather than copy edit it, they could do that. Why would a sysop want to do that when it results in lost copy and the creation of a duplicate? And then of course someone will come along and recreate the link from the school name, and pretty soon when someone has more information to add they'll break out the article and overwrite the redirect, and you're back to square one except for some deleted content. All because of this doomed obsession with deleting, stamping out, and expunging school articles from Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:45, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, I do not agree with that. The process you describe is a deletion followed by a kind of rewrite.

<li>There is no reason to delete the list or the article which precedes it. Statistics are often listed in encyclopedias.

<li>Problem: The article doesn't provide encyclopediatic information. The list of power levels is not information that is necessary. Statistics on, say, population in a city in an article ON the city is necessary. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 21:30, August 7, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How do you define "information that is necessary"? The article is more then just a list of numbers, it's an article on power levels, which is a very important aspect of the DBZ series. The article explains their uses, the history of them, and some other details. The article itself IS necessary for DBZ because power levels play such an important role almost a third of the entire series. And it can be argued that the numbers themselves that go along with that article are also necessary. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocar15_5666.html" title="User:Socar15">Socar15</a> 21:42, 7 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you take away this information, which is valuable only to DBZ fans, it would work out just fine. Problem is, a merge of the rest of the information is unnecessary; we wouldn't need several paragraphs of information in the main article. It can be wittled down to a single paragraph, or even less. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 21:47, August 7, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How did you determine that this article specifically is only valuable to DBZ fans? How would say, an article on a specific character, be any different? If an individual read something that referred to DBZ power levels (which is a pretty common thing) and went to look them up, I would think that the article would be very useful to someone who didn't know much about the topic itself. In this case, I don't believe deletion or a merge is necessary. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocar15_5666.html" title="User:Socar15">Socar15</a> 21:52, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
