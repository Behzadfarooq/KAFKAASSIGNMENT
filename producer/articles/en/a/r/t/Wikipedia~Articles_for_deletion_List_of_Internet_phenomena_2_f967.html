<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Article is at least as relevant as many other pop-culture articles on WP. Notability is definitely not a problem, nor is verifiability.

WP:IAR should be the case here with using Internet sources as this IS a topic regarding the Internet. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 06:02, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> per Guy above. As long as there are some rationale guidelines for inclusion (third party sourcing, evidence of notability, etc.) there are no content policies that this list <i>must</i> violate. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, etc. problems need to be delt with but that doesn't require deletion. I might reconsider if it were convicingly argued that this list were unmaintainable rather than just poorly maintained but noone above seems to be arguing that. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 06:40, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> An issue that is timely and here forever. (See current news on China's internet revolution) Revert for source work. Seek reliable sources and additional help. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Nysted_e100.html" title="User:Lee Nysted">Lee Nysted</a> 13:19, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
