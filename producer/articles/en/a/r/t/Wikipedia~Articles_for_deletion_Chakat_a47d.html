<p>A nearly unintelligible article on a fictional "creature" that seems be something the creator <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">made up in school one day</a>. The article puts forth no creditable claim of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> and, being a amateur construct, has no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> outside the creator's personal website.

<li><b>Commet:</b> Honeymade, have you read the notability guideline I linked? If you have I don't understand how this can be seen as anything but "something made up one day". You're right, Wikipedia is not a place for obscure porn stars, see <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_f7cd.html" title="WP:PORN">WP:PORN</a>. If you see pornstars that are featured here that do not meet that criteria then by all means prod or AfD those articles. Most minor comicbook characters are included in their parent comicbook articles or in a list. Those that don't fail <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. Again, if you see any violations of this feel free to prod or AfD them. Another important feature that distinguishes those aformentioned articles is that they have been <i>published</i>. This, on the other hand, is a pure amateur creation that is being advertised on wikipedia that has no interest to people outside a particular subculture (cruft). The people in that subculture can find this information at other more appropriate places such as the creator's webstie, fansites and dedicated wikis such as WikiFur. Violations of wikipedia policies and those policies' guidelines do not set a precedent for continued violation. I would recommend you review <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 03:42, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep but rewrite</b>: As the <b>original creator</b> of this text (but not the species) I cite the large amount of independent art and literature that has been created about this species, including this article. [<a href="http://www.furry.org.au/focault/Prose/Star-Dancer_Preface.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.furry.org.au/focault/Prose/Star-Dancer_Preface.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] [<a href="http://www.furry.org.au/mayfurr/Stories/lost-01.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.furry.org.au/mayfurr/Stories/lost-01.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] These are independently conceived and written works, and I assure you (as a writer) that the act of creating the two given examples was non-trivial. The fact that you may or may not like the species yourself does not change the fact that hundreds do. The fact that you don't understand why this species (among millions like it) has achieved that level of success is in fact a mark of potential interest to the wider community.

<li>The existence of fan fiction on this subject demonstrates a 'cult following' though, which is a criteria for notability. I would also challenge you to name another fictional species which has achieved this level of popularity (or greater) or caused the creation of this amount and quality of work (not of creator origin) without being backed by a major publishing house or broadcasting organization. If you cannot, and no one else can, then that makes the species notable all by itself. ANTIcarrot 14:21, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Fan fiction isn't a source, period; at least not in terms of any <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> guideline I've ever read. We're talking published, independent, reliable sources. Think newspapers, scientific journals, informative television programs, and some web content - but not blogs, and in this case, probably not anything from <a href="http://www.furry.org" class="external text" title="http://www.furry.org" rel="nofollow">www.furry.org</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntepenultimate_a059.html" title="User:Antepenultimate">Antepenultimate</a> 04:46, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The notability guidelines require the topic (chakats) to be the subject of multiple non trivial works (novels and very expensive art) whose sources (people who created the works) are independent of the subject itself (and its creator). The guidelines go on to say that 'published works' is a very broad category not limited to the examples given. If it was limited to those categories then wikipedia itself (being non published) would be a trivial source- which is blatant nonsense. If you wish to exclude all material that is only published online then you still have to deal with the large amount of paper artwork that has been created on this topic. To my knowledge wikipedia offers no guidence for notabilty of artwork, but the shear quantity and quality produced makes it non trivial. ANTIcarrot 14:00, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I believe that ANTI's point is; because it is so well known, in a pool of dozens of other fictional species in the Furry Fandom, it is notable. Take the Sergal for example.

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b> or <b>slight merge</b>. I've found myself involved with some of these furry AfDs lately (I'm going back to writing mycology taxa articles soon, I swear), not out of any remote personal interest in the concepts, but rather in the AfD process. At times, material that <i>could</i> meet our standards reaches AfD because the articles <i>don't</i>: they are poorly written, in a genre perceived as "crufty", and little effort is made to appropriately reference or verify the content (even by its supporters!). That said ... I cannot find multiple, independent, non-trivial sources here. There are no shortage of trivial mentions: art categories, furcode references, one-line references in FAQs. The term is well-attested in the print-medium fanzine South Fur Lands, but that is not independent of the creator; the self-published and ultra-minor press material likewise. It <i>is</i> discussed in the webzine Anthro (#6), but that's not enough to support an article. Nevertheless, the term seems to have some cultural currency. Perhaps it can be merged as a brief mention in another article, such as a mention in<a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">furry fandom</a> that roleplaying charcters—on which a stubby section already exists—might include "anthropormorphic animals (such as rabbits, foxes, or wolves), mythological creatures (centaurs, dragons, and the like), or fan-created species (including the quadrupedal feline aliens called chakats)". <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 08:56, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</s> -- change in suggestion, see below</li>

<dd>This is a false argument. Pretty much every modern fantasy book on the book shelves contains elements from Lord of the Rings, but that does not make them fanfiction. <i>All writing works that way for all genres.</i> Furry simply tends to be a little more honest about it. The two (story) sources are relevant as they mark the turning point where the chakat setting stopped belonging to its creator and became 'open source'. Information to this effect exists on the chakats den. At that point fanfiction as a term no longer has any relevant meaning. (And point of note, specifying 'furry fanfiction' like that is not needed. Fanfiction is fanfiction. Specifying specific types can sound prejudicial and non-neutral.) ANTIcarrot 23:35, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> OK, I think I'm understanding the deeper issues here, (which really don't involve the notability of Chakats for WP), apparently (correct me if I'm wrong) the mainstream furry fans (the folks who like ordinary furry things such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lion_King_5b05.html" title="The Lion King">The Lion King</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogs_Playing_Poker_dce3.html" title="Dogs Playing Poker">Dogs Playing Poker</a>) aren't too hip on hermaphroditic feline centaurs, whilst the more extreme furry-lifestylers and yiffy crowd don't see Chakats as overtly sexual <i>enough</i>, then apparently there's some personal issues between the "owners" of the articles as well. Thus all the protestations about the notability of Chakats in furry fandom, which really isn't pertinent to this AfD (the question here is solely whether the article meets WP guidelines). Anyway, the <a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Chakat" class="external text" title="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Chakat" rel="nofollow">Chakat article on Wikifur</a> is pretty much the same as the WP one, so the transwiki-ing is a done deal at this point. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 08:14, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If that was the case, you would have mentioned that line of reasoning long before I basically begged you to start citing policies (see below). I'm thoroughly unconvinced that you just happened to stumble upon this AfD and began commenting with the hopes of averting some great injustice. And for the last time, please stop mentioning completely un-related subject matter as though it has any bearing on the current discussion. What a video game, created and developed by a major software publisher and distributed internationally (and henceforth reveiwed by Gamespy) has to do with a race of hermaphrodites "living" in some future fancruft universe... Seriously. This is ridiculous. To say nothing of the fact that such a review isn't likely to be the only thing an author of such an article could come up with. If you find articles where this is not the case, then you are welcome to nominate them for deletion.

<li>My mentioning of verifiability was in direct relation to Shewolff's "proof" about Chakats being used in classrooms being a personal experience involving her son.

We've already gone over the notability concerns, please read <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and stop throwing that word around like there isn't a very specific definition of its use here at Wikipedia (as you just did when you claimed there to be a "notable amount of art.")

Webcomics that do not meet the project's notability guidelines are no more able to serve as references or reliable sources than fan faction, livejournal entries, or blog posts. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 06:13, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Google PageRank of www.longtail.us/apollo9/ = zero. Alexa rank .. (another drum roll) ... 2,240,125. I mean, we're rapidly being sucked into an <i>obscurity black hole</i> here. Chakats are apparently <i>reverse <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midas.html" title="Midas">Midases</a></i> of notability. The next example that comes up will probably prove that a gathering of the entire world readership of Chakat material would barely fill two booths at the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakey%27s.html" title="Shakey's">Shakey's</a> in <a href="../../../c/u/c/Cucamonga.html" title="Cucamonga">Cucamonga</a>. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 06:20, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Google PageRank is a 0 to 10 scale. BTW, the Alexa rating for the <i>site</i> dropped 1,297,089 in the last 3 months, and the page views by 83%. These stats are for the entire longtail.us site, the stats for the individual pages, of course, will be less.

<li>A few notes about problems cited. As I understand it, Wiki policy prefers that potential problems are discussed in talk pages before deletion becomes an issue. That did not happen here. "<a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">made up in school one day</a>" It would have been easily disproved by an examination of the primary source given at the time that this is not the case. "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>" This article is not one of the examples given. Wikipedia currently gives no guidelines for as to whether any given story is notable. The article might be a close match for requirement 6 in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">books</a> albeit chakats are a species that features in several stories written by several authors; rather than a single story in and of itself. "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAPBOX" title="WP:NOT">Advertising</a>" Chakats are not a commercial product, so it is hard to see what is being advertised here. The article was not written as an advert. "<a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">Wikipedia:Fancruft</a>" Not in and of itself a reason for deletion, and not a policy violation. This statement is also disputed, as with the school teacher example, and that the species might be of interest to transhumanists, and scifi writers in general. (See below.). "<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astroturfing.html" title="Astroturfing">Astroturfing</a>" I cannot see how this is possibly relevant to the topic. This and the accusation about hit-count manipulation read as a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_attack.html" title="Personal attack">personal attack</a>. "<a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">Does not meet style for fiction criteria</a>" This is an argument for rewriting, not deletion. "<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability</a>" The big question. Two third-party web-published articles (non-scholarly sources) have been found on the subject. A large amount of third party literature and art has been created. Since this is a <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shared_universe.html" title="Shared universe">shared universe</a> the term <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanfiction.html" title="Fanfiction">fanfiction</a> may or may not be appropiet.

<li>A final note for on the usefulness of the topic (since notability is so heavily defined): We may well have in this discussion a couple of <b>experienced deletionists</b> here. I once again ask them a question which they have so far either not noticed or refused to answer: <i>How many species are there like chakats that have created a comparable amount of interest and participation as evidenced on the Chakats Den and associated site?</i> The deletionists must come across topics like this a lot. So how many can be named? It has been implied that chakats are nothing special. So how many examples of fictional species can you name? Creating such a popular fictional species is neither easy nor simple. chakats weren't even created as such, yet they *became* popular because people showed an interst in them. It might have been word of mouth, or random clicking, and yes, people reading about them in 'cruft' publications. But the fact is that lots of people were interested enough to look it up, stay, and contribute. how often can you say that for a fictional species that hasn't been backed by a major publishing house? <b>For the administrator:</b> I realise that 'being very exceptional' is not a criteria for wikipedia notability, but it is a standard for common language notability. In the latter sense, chakats are very notable, not because of the species itself, but because the exceptional response and interest they have generated is very unusual and has sustained itself over fairly large period of time. I ask the administrator to consider whether this might constitute an <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">occasional exception</a> to the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability guidelines</a> on that basis alone.ANTIcarrot 05:21, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>So how many examples of fictional species can you name?</i> Offhand, dragons, mermaids, centaurs, satyrs and unicorns. All fictional species of long term, wide popular notability, not cult subjects of webcomics with sub-1,000,000 Alexa ratings and books that are so obscure they lack ISBN numbers, which demonstrates exceptional <i>lack</i> of response and <i>lack</i> of interest. Never heard or cared about Chakats until this AfD came up. That sort of goes to the point, WP is supposed to document notable things and persons, not be used to create notability, neither should this AfD used to create notability. The keep argument ran out of gas, like, about the first day, but every argument <b>except</b> actually coming up with verifiable, reliable sources that establish notability has been dragged out and rehashed ad nauseum, just to keep the debate going, it seems. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 06:36, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>PS: Alexa rank of the Chakats Den = 717,353. WP is, by 30,000, the highest ranked site linked to it, without that WP linkspam, the ranking would likely dive to oblivion. Chakats Den exists to promote and sell Mr Doove's work, so does the page, a pretty good argument could be made to speedy delete this article as spam. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 07:37, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think chakats being characters in Apollo 9 makes them notable. But that doesn't make them non-notable either, because non-notable means absence of notability, not presence of a case of non-notability. Not having heard of chakats isn't a valid argument for non-notability, nor are WP:IHATEIT found way above, just as WP:ILIKEIT aren't. I agree though, there are plenty fictional species more known than chakats. However, you don't list any modern creation.
