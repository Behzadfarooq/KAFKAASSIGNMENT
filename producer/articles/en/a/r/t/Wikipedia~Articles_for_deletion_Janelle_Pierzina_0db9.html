<p>Another Big Brother competitor who is nn enough not to need their own article. Every attempt I have made to redirect this has been reverted. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 05:33, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I think being on a well known show (more than token or minor appearance) of a major broadcast network is a straight forward keep. I base the keep only on that, since other than the one show, I'm not sure much of anything about her is verified, or will be till later. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 08:23, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>So an article on every Big Brother contestant in every season in every country in the world should be created? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 08:39, September 1, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Reply: This is no place to debate an issue not specific to this article. It was a mistake to call a vfd. A "mergeto" (or appropriate) tag should have been added to each unwanted contestant's article, which would then direct everybody to a single central talk page (for the show), to discuss and vote on the issue. A single approach should be established. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 11:29, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

I tried doing this once, but of course it was deleted. We could also create a different article for each season of Big Brother and we can describe each contestent there. This should be discussed in <a href="../../../b/i/g/Talk%7EBig_Brother_%28USA_TV_series%29_0621.html" title="Talk:Big Brother (USA TV series)">Talk:Big Brother (USA TV series)</a> and a consensus should be reached.

<li><b>Keep</b> Subject has several things of note to name outside of being a BB contestant. Subject is extremely popular. Merging wouldn't be the worst case, but would make the original BB page too unwieldy very quickly. Not sure why Zoe has such a campaign against individual BB pages in the first place.--66.149.92.242 13:58, 2 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because just being a contestant on a TV show does not make somebody notable, and once she's voted off, we will never hear of her again. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 18:52, September 2, 2005 (UTC)

<li>So you are a psychic, eh? Nice! Can you tell me who'd going to win the Superbowl this year by any chance?--66.149.92.242 20:00, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> certainly keep at least until and if she's evicted. She's got accomplishments other than being on Big Brother, and given the rating she has on CBS's site and that she won America's Choice I expect that CBS will be having her do other things one way or the other.--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFiredrake_f9df.html" title="User:Firedrake">Firedrake</a> 23:14, 2 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And how many of the other contestants from the US Big Brother have you ever heard of again? The only one I can even think of is Josh Sousa from BB1, who got into minor modeling and has now written a screenplay. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 19:25, September 3, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Lets see... there's Marcellas Reynolds, Will Wikle, and Alisun Irwin to name a few. But somehow I don't think YOUR or (or for that matter, MY) awareness of their activities after the show should be the standard for which they are judged. Kaysar's (the only one more popular than her this season) been on a soap so far after the show and is in talks about a possible spot on The Amazing Race. CBS isn't exactly stupid when it finds popular folks (See Rupert or Rob and Amber). I'll also note the season isn't even over yet and although the odds are against her, she may yet win.--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFiredrake_f9df.html" title="User:Firedrake">Firedrake</a> 19:59, 3 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I know that Marcellas hosts CBS's online BB discussions, but what have Will Wilke and Alisun Irwin done? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 21:15, September 3, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Alisun and her boyfirend were on Amazing Race. Will writes on the CBS BB site as well as a few other reality TV sites. I'll grant you that if you aren't a BB fanatic you probably won't hear a lot about many of the non-winners. My main point is that neither of us would probably claim to hold the final ord on celebrity. I would say that she's known to enough folks and has done enough to earn her a few kbytes in Wiki. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFiredrake_f9df.html" title="User:Firedrake">Firedrake</a> 22:41, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Janelle Pierzina is the people's favourite to win the show. Other members who have been evicted have their own section, why can't this very popular, athletic, smart girl have one? Besides she's got a story to tell.</li>

<p>Gian89 02:05, 5 September 2005(UTC)</p>

<li>Strong <b>Keep</b>- Janelle is by far the most popular person left in the house and will be remembered (at least by series fans) for being one of the strongest, smartest, and most entertaining people ever to appear on the show. She has at this point secured a spot in at least the Final Four, and even if she doesn't win she deserves her own page for what she's added to the series (like <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danielle_Reyes_2df8.html" title="Danielle Reyes">Danielle Reyes</a>). --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatadyBag_273f.html" title="User:PatadyBag">PatadyBag</a> 14:24, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
