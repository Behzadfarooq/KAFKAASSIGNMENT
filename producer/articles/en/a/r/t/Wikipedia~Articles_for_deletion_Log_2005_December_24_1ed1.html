<p>Foogol created this "disambiguation" page and a string of redirect pages. Nothing links to them but more importantly, I can find no evidence that anything ever will link to them. This is in my opinion a thinly veiled attempt to create dictionary definitions for a series of off-color euphemisms. Several of them have already been speedy-deleted. Foogol recreated them rather than <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">contesting</a> the deletions.

<li><b>Delete all.</b> While there are plenty of references available to show that "the N word" has historically referred to "nigger," and "the F word" has always unequivocally been in reference to "fuck," "the D word" is "damnation"? These are just arbitrary one-letter acronymizations of profane words. This is problematic because society does not actually use any of these phrases, and so to have them on Wikipedia is misleading and non-representational of, well, reality. Rather unhealthy for an aspiring reliable reference, eh?

<li>This reminds of me that old saying "If a tree fell in the forest with nobody there, would it make a sound?"

<li><b>Comment</b>. There seems to be a feeling here that neologisms are inherently not wikipedia material. I suspect people who are thinking that way are mis-interpreting <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a>. That policy rejects <i>Original research (including the coining of neologisms)</i>. Note the use of the word <b>coining</b>. If I were to create hyperdeletionism, that would be coining a neologism, because I would be creating a new word. <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yak_shaving.html" title="Yak shaving">Yak shaving</a> is not that; the phrase already existed, the article is simply documenting its history and use.

<li>For me, the problem is the <i>neo</i> part. A newly coined phrase (i.e. neologism) is of unknown and unproven significance. Once it is widely used, assuming it is not a dicdef, there is no real problem with inclusion in, say, the list of Internet slang. The number of neologisms which are independently encyclopaedic is, in my view, small; Wikipedia is not as far as I can tell a mirror of either the urban dictionary or FOLDOC. Also remember that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> in Wikipedia terms means verifiable from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reputable sources</a> (explicitly <i>not</i> blogs).- <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 20:11, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Provisional <b>Keep</b>. I'd rather not see this phrase completely disappear from Wikipedia. If it belongs on a list of slang somewhere, then let's figure out which one it belongs on and move it. I agree that the article will probably not expand significantly beyond its current form. I do not agree that it is a neologism <i>which was coined by the creation of this article</i>; this phrase has been around and in usage for a significant amount of time. <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBcordes_b612.html" title="User:Bcordes">Bcordes</a> 15:39, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would qualify that to say, all real legal jurisdications, current and former, (e.g. municipalities, states, provinces, etc...). Maybe every census unit (whatever the proper term is). But are all places notable? What about neighborhoods? Is every hamlet notable? Also, the list you gave is (I think) based on census data, so its all verifiable information.

<li>While the stated nominators reason is invalid (villages can't be deleted as "nn"), *anything* in Wikipedia can be deleted as non-verifiable. Discussing notability is an unfortunate (though common) distraction from the single issue we should discuss: verifiability. If I find an article on a village, that no amount of effort can verify, I'll certainly list it for AFD. At this point, I suspect the problems of the article can be addressed, and the article kept, but that's not been determined yet. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 13:05, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: What type of legal entity are we talking about here? Based on reading <a href="http://www.ihorizons.net/lacounty/stonemills/centreville.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ihorizons.net/lacounty/stonemills/centreville.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>, I gather its an unicorporated village in the Camden Township (which doesn't have it's own article). It sounds like it was once incorporated based on the sentence "<i>The Town Hall in Centreville, the current Municipal Offices for the Township of Camden East was erected in 1905.</i>". Anyway, I would likely support keeping this, but I would like to know what we're keeping first. Sorry in advance, if my question sounds dumb. <s>One option would be to move this article to Camden, Ontario and convert it into an article about the township, which mentions this, and any other village inside it.</s> Also, can anybody find any official mention of this place? --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 12:27, 24 December 2005 (UTC) Added: If Camden did exist, it doesn't seem to anymore. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 12:34, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's a very valid question - has anyone local knowledge?

<li>I think an unfortunate result of RAMBOT, is it's given the impression we can write articles about every little place on Earth, with no decent sources. We can't. Some places have no verifiable information. RAMBOT is based on verifiable census data, and will update articles as needed. Based on reading the <a href="http://centreville.limestone.on.ca/" class="external text" title="http://centreville.limestone.on.ca/" rel="nofollow">Centreville Public School</a> I now get the impression that Camden (and East Camden) are gone, and that Centreville is part of the Township of Stone Mills . No mention of Camden exists on the <a href="http://www.lennox-addington.on.ca/government/Council/coun.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lennox-addington.on.ca/government/Council/coun.html" rel="nofollow">county web site</a>. This is concerning, since our *only* source for this article is so out-of-date, it refers to a Township (Camden) that might not exist anymore. I think the article has to state what, if any township the village is part of, and it has to state if the village is incorporated (e.g. if it has its own government). I'm 100% for keeping this article *if* there's sufficient verifiable information. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 12:51, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Added: While I hope somebody does have local knowledge to contribute, that won't be sufficient. We have to answer the relevant questions from verifiable sources. I won't accept somebody just telling me they know the place exists, with a certain status, because they've been there. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 12:54, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well ... Centreville is mentioned on the County-Homepage, there is a map here: <a href="http://www.lennox-addington.on.ca/region/mapcounty.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lennox-addington.on.ca/region/mapcounty.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> .... --Enfiladissa 13:03, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks, the map is helpful. But, it's just a dot on a map. It doesn't tell us enough, like the incorporation status, or what (if any) township its part of. We have to verify more then existence, but also status. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 13:13, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>well: here: <a href="http://www.ihorizons.net/lacounty/communities.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ihorizons.net/lacounty/communities.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> - on the county side - it is said, that "Centreville, the centre of Camden Township, is a small village located at the intersection of County Road 4 and Centreville Road. We are a 10 minute drive from Hwy 401, a 25 minute drive to the City of Kingston and a 20 minute drive to the Town of Napanee.", if that helps ... --Enfiladissa 13:23, 24 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The county site you pointed to contradicts itself. Go to <a href="http://www.ihorizons.net/lacounty/communities.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ihorizons.net/lacounty/communities.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> then click on the list for "Stone Mills Township" and you'll see "Centreville". Select it, and you'll see <a href="http://www.ihorizons.net/lacounty/stonemills/centreville.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ihorizons.net/lacounty/stonemills/centreville.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> (the only source of our article). Her's the catch: Stone Mills isn't mentioned on this page at all. Instead Camden is (in fact Centreville is in the centre of Camden). It even refers to "<i>the <b>current</b> Municipal Offices for the Township of Camden East</i>". So we know the first sentence, and last sentence of that page are no longer accurate. What else is no longer accurate? What benefit does a Wikipedia article have, unless we tell people things we've verified to be accurate. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 13:40, 24 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>well, I agree, partly. I mean, these people seems to have contests in constructing cabbage-throwing-machines (<a href="http://home.cogeco.ca/%7eodessacabbagethrow/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.cogeco.ca/%7eodessacabbagethrow/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>), I do not expect them to be accurate in giving details a small 80-person village. I saw the contradictions, but I posted it because of the links being <b>some kind</b> of verification of the existence of the place itself ... --Enfiladissa 13:55, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. More info would be needed, and is unlikely to come and be relevant.

<li><b>Keep</b> This event is worthy of an entry for two reasons. Firstly, it was - arguably - the most pivotal play of the most exciting series in baseball history. In fact, it may go down as the most memorable stolen base in baseball history. Secondly, the phrase has started to acquire its own etymological significance. Just as the annual Harvard / Yale football game is understood to be <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Game_def0.html" title="The Game">The Game</a>, Dave Roberts' base will always be The Base. Regarding verifiability, one need only read the game's box score available here <a href="http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/ps/y2004/boxscore.jsp?gid=2004_10_18_nyamlb_bosmlb_1" class="external autonumber" title="http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/ps/y2004/boxscore.jsp?gid=2004_10_18_nyamlb_bosmlb_1" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></li>

<p>Just found this while searching for something on Wikipedia. It's an article with no inbound links, and has gone under the radar since June. It's a guy still in college who, while if you read the external links got extremely good grades in high school (a Presidential Scholar in 2001), hasn't actually done anything in his career. If he becomes a Senator or something, then he can rightfully have an article, and won't be ashamed to link to it from other pages. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harro</a><b><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarro5_1808.html" title="User talk:Harro5">5</a></b> 03:33, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Save</b> It is quite a notible term. It is a term much like 'bloging' and 'podcast'. It's roots come from what it does. Some are abstract like 'bloging' while others make sense such as 'podcast'. 'podcast' comes from ipod and broadcast. This article is a legitiment entree. It would hurt Wikipedia's extensive knowledge if it was deleted. Furthermore, despite you allugations that this is spaming 'webumentaries', it is actually showing examples, much like to show an example of a fast-food restaurant you might show an example of Waffle House. It would be considered spamming the Waffle Houses but implimenting them to serve a purpose as to enlighten people as to what an actually 'webumentary' is. Also these three 'webumentaries' are all of different organizations.-Kyle 1:39, 24/12/05(eastern/pacific)
<ul>
<li>Kyle, how is it 'notible' and why is it a 'legitiment entree' (<i>sic</i>)? I assume you mean 'blogging', which comes from 'web log' and 'logging', so it is certainly not 'abstract', and has a similar derivation as 'Podcast'. When you search Google, you find these words mentioned in abundance. You do not for <i>webumentary</i>. Could you give us a reason this article is 'notible'? If it's because the word is made up of two others, then anyone can concoct a variety of words, so that is not a compelling reason. Without reasons for the article's legitimacy, my objection remains.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStombs_27f9.html" title="User:Stombs">‚ÄîStombs</a> 08:08, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b> - Ravenswood Media- I won't debate whether the term "webumentary" is ready for Wikipedia. I'll leave that to the experts and defer to their decision. However, I do take exception to the characterization that www.midwestfrogs.com and www.cavebiota.com are spam or self promotion. Both sites are free, offer objective educational points of view and neither site has ads or banners. They are not personal websites, they are sponsored by not-for-profit organizations; Indiana Karst Conservancy, Hoosier National Forest and the Chicago Herpetological Society. The sites provide both information and entertainment and extend the value of Wikipedia beyond text and still images. I offered the sites in good faith and did it in a transparent manner.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment only:</b> this is a fair comment on the part of Ravenswood Media, though I still think the term hasn't become commonplace. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStombs_27f9.html" title="User:Stombs">‚ÄîStombs</a> 12:11, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Save: Among the documentary community the term "webumentary" is becoming commonplace - and the phenomenon if not the word has been around at least since the turn of the 21st century (see for eg. www.littledove.org/frameset.html for a pioneering version by Australian filmaker Marcus Gillezau). It is an apt and useful neologism which is rapidly gaining acceptance as the technology for streaming video is taken up by documentary filmmakers who want to reach a broad non-commercial audience and to have regular upgrades of their work. The fact that Ravenswood Media use their own links as one of several examples is irrelevant - as they point out, the sites are free and have no ads or banners and have important environmental concerns as their primary motive. The internet is rapidly transforming the whole documentary game and webumentaries are leading the way in terms of developing radical, socially useful outlets for actuality filmmakers' work and for a growing audience. It is already happening in terms of sourcing archival footage (see for example www.archive.org, www.absolutelywildvisuals.com). The number of numerical Google hits compared to "blogging" is irrelevant - you might as well compare it to the number of hits for "books". It would seem absurd to delete "webumentary' from Wikipedia just as the phenomenon is about to take off, and Ravenswood Media are to be congratulated for bringing the term to a wider (and one would hope more enlightened) public.Mozofilms 06:34, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Save</b> - Since the self-promotion charge has been reasonably nullified, the only remaining objection appears to focus on whether or not the term is "commonplace". In response, I respectfully suggest that readers consult the Wikipedia entry for "commonplace" - ironically, "webumentary" would be concisely defined by the etymological root of this term. How disappointing it would be if Wikipedia and its users impede the wonderful dynamic of human language by limiting the validity of new terms according to their google ratings! 70.224.66.146 19:50, 29 December 2005 (UTC)Laurie How many unique Google hits did "wikipedia" have on this date five years ago? 70.224.66.146 20:45, 29 December 2005 (UTC)Laurie</p>

<li>Regarding Zoe's questions, (1) it is indeed important to have articles on translation problems when the words to be translated are <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">culturally</a> shaped and refer to <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institutional_fact.html" title="Institutional fact">institutional facts</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_construction.html" title="Social construction">social constructions</a>: in these cases, language comparison is also a comparison between cultures (since social constructions exist only through language); (2) regarding "law", the first comparison to be made is between English and other European languages, precisely because this case ("law" vs "ius"/"lex") is a strange phenomenon within a common philosophical, religious and otherwise cultural background. <a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVelho_c63f.html" title="User:Velho">Velho</a> 22:12, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Regarding Flyboy Willy's opinion, this is <i>not</i> original research, because it is all about a translating problem and its consequences to philosophy of law; I'm not going to do anything more than to say what people has said about it. And the translation issue in itself is more or less a "matter of fact".</li>
<li>For instance, you could take a look at Michael Roumeliotis' article "On the <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Dworkin_d123.html#The_right_answer_thesis" title="Ronald Dworkin">one right answer</a>" (<i>Archives for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy</i>, vol. 87, 2001, pp. 72-96: see p. 74) and see that he uses precisely this argument on the translation of "law".</li>
<li>If you read <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Alexy_30d7.html" title="Robert Alexy">Robert Alexy</a>'s argument on the "claim to correctness", you will see that the concept of "ius" (as possibly opposed to "law") is essential to the question whether law has or has not a necessary relation to morality.</li>
<li>Are there still some doubts? Please let me know.</li>
<li>By the way, <b>could someone please tell me</b> when and how does this debate end? Thank you in advance. <a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVelho_c63f.html" title="User:Velho">Velho</a> 04:24, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>About Blackcats' vote: this article cannot be merged into <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_systems_of_the_world.html" title="Legal systems of the world">Legal systems of the world</a> because the issue around "law" vs "ius"/"lex" concerns mainly philosophy of law, not law itself.

<li><b>Comment</b>: it appears that the author has also made an autobiographical article at Yakov Kronrod. On the other hand, it seems that we <i>should</i> have an article on <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleksandr_Semenovich_Kronrod_51dc.html" title="Aleksandr Semenovich Kronrod">Aleksandr Semenovich Kronrod</a> (1921-1986), who as far as I can understand is Vladimir's father and Yakov's grandfather. On Google Books I also find mention of a Soviet economist, Iakov Abramovich Kronrod (1912-1984), who I suppose may be some kind of relative (see Oscar J Bandelin, <i>Return to the Nep: The False Promise of Leninism and the Failure of Perestroika</i>). Yakov (if you are reading this), it is usually frowned upon to write articles about yourself or people or things very close to you - which is not to say that it never happens - but I am sure an article on your grandfather would be fine, as long as you reference sources available to others for verification purposes (such as obituaries in math journals, for instance, preferrably in English, but Russian sources are also fine if they add additional information or a different perspective). Forget your personal knowledge and connection for a while, and look at the task as if you were writing a biographical entry about any stranger who may deserve an article. If you want to emphasize his importance, do so only by quoting the evaluation by others. Read up on <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citing sources on Wikipedia</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Wikipedia's policy on verifiability</a>.

To answer Vader's question, the Copyright at the bottom was just a way to make sure that no one would steal our idea. Since we're not that familar with Wikipedia, we put super hero at the bottom as a way to have it appear in a "Super Hero" search.

<li>AfD discussions are usually not resolved until at least five days have passed, to make sure people have time to think about the issue, or to see if new points come to light.

In Washington, D.C. there is a <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Law_Enforcement_Officers_Memorial_a43a.html" title="National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial">National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial</a> <a href="http://www.nleomf.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nleomf.com/" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, I presume Canada has (or its Provinces have) something similar.

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia and the insensitivity to the need to acknowledge those that give their lives to service is of great concern. Admittedly, these articles need to be expanded, which is a task that will be done over the coming days. Please respect the notion that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that anyone can edit but not everyone has the time to immediately update. These pages were created out of respect for both living and fallen warriors and the desire to delete them post-haste concerns me You have made this a political issue, which it is clearly not. As you can clearly see by this category here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Canadian_law_enforcement_officers" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Canadian_law_enforcement_officers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Canadian_law_enforcement_officers</a> , there are others who are working to provide information on both living and deceased police officers.

As for "the full political implications" of abiding by our well-established precedents on these matters, there aren't any. You might not <i>like</i> the fact that Wikipedia doesn't consider someone's death to automatically make them notable, but if dying in the 9/11 attacks doesn't make one encyclopedically notable, it is not sufficient to be a law enforcement officer killed in the line of duty either. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:51, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep.</b></s> Despite Wikipedia being the "free encyclopedia that anyone can edit", a group of rogue vandalizing admins is now going to be given the editing power of deciding who is "valid enough" to recieve their own biography? I hope those that feel these entries should be deleted also begin the process of deleting the biographies of all law enforcement officers on this website. Clearly, the open-source foundations of the Wikipedia project are starting to crumble based upon the very clear bias and inconsistent editing/deletion policies that are emerging here. If this page is deleted, the Wikipedia foundation will be making a very public statement that the contributions of law enforcement officers across the English-speaking world are not welcome here. If these pages and these pages alone are deleted, the credibility of this project will be seriously undermined. <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelebritySecurity_9407.html" title="User:CelebritySecurity">CelebritySecurity</a> 00:03, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> To those that suggest these articles and infobox be deleted, Should the process of deleting all entries of all law enforcement officers from this website also be undertaken in order to ensure fairness? Also, please note that the infobox has been written with proper code designating whether or not the officer is deceased or not. It is not intended as a memorial, merely something written to acknowledge the contributions of law enforcement officers, much in the same way celebrities and politicians are listed on this same website. <small>(this unsigned comment was made by <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelebritySecurity_9407.html" title="User:CelebritySecurity">CelebritySecurity</a>)</small>

<li>of <i>all</i> law-enforcement officers? no. of law-enforcement officers who, like Val√©rie Gignac, fail to be encyclopedically notable? Yes, actually. ... I hasten to add, because the kind of person who tries to vote three times in the same discussion seems like the kind of person who needs this warning, this is not encouragement to go on a vandalistic rampage slapping deletion tags on all articles you can find on English-speaking law enforcement officers, no matter how notable, to avenge what you misperceive as a bias against law-enforcement officers who speak other languages.

<li>Part of the reason for lack of relevant hits on this language is most likely the spelling of the name, which started out as ts≈ìxisca, and has gone through a range of orthographies (nor√∞ƒ±sca, northisc, nor√∞isc, etc.) depending on the context it was being used in and the stage of its development. I've never created an article on wikipedia before, and I'm sorry if it's insignificant. I'm still learning. I'll remove it if you'd like. BPJohnson 06:40, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've made other arrangements for the information on this page. Please feel free to delete at will. - BPJohnson 16:26, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Basically, Prodos is an objectivist with a blog and some other exposure. Prodos Marinakis turns up only 396 hits on Google. However, Prodos objectivism turns up more than 10K, but only 150 results are included (suggesting the rest of the hits are from a handful of sites?).

<li>How do you know that the Guardian author is even the same guy??? The Guardian article was <i>about</i> bloggers, but nowhere do I see the author identify himself as a blogger. Crabtree is a very common last name, and James is one of the most common first names. His supposed claim to fame is that he's written about Iraq, so the relevant Google hits should mention "Iraq" along with his name - but <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=zWt&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;q=%22James%20Crabtree%22%20iraq&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=iw" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=zWt&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;q=%22James%20Crabtree%22%20iraq&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=iw" rel="nofollow">only around 600</a> do. Hmmm...well maybe some list his writing about "anbar" provence but not "Iraq," (Only 2 do <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Z6v&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+anbar&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Z6v&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+anbar&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>) or perhaps the city of "Fallujah" (Only 7 do <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=A7v&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+Fallujah&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=A7v&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+Fallujah&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>) or even his home town of "Austin" Texas (Only a little over 300 do <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=nSb&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+Austin&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=nSb&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22James+Crabtree%22+-iraq+Austin&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, and I'm not even sure all of these are about the same guy). (Note - I excluded "Iraq" for all of those searches to avoid duplicates of hits from the original search.) But at any rate, even a non-noteworthy blogger would be likely to have a whole lot more relevant Google hits than this Crabtree guy does - given the nature of blogs and their ability to create a lot of redundant Google hits. So I have yet to see anyone give any evidence that this blogger's inclusion here is anything but vanity! <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 22:01, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sadovision_0e84.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sadovision">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sadovision</span></h3>
<p><b>Vanity</b>, although there's enough confabulation &amp; untruths around this article that one might be able to argue <b>Hoax</b>. Let's start with the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Article about an invention by one Mary deSade, submitted by Mary deSade. I'm already suspicious at this point.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the fact that Mary DeSade submitted an article about her own Trademarked invention, means that's that is doesn't exist?</p>
<ul>
<li>"Sadovision" is a modification of Apple QuickTime for use on a specific website, <a href="http://www.pillowfight-bloodbath.com" class="external text" title="http://www.pillowfight-bloodbath.com" rel="nofollow">Pillow Fight Bood-Bath</a>. I have selflessly devoted the time to investigate this webiste, &amp; yes, it exists. From what I can tell, "Sadovision" is just bog-standard Apple QuickTime.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon patented "One Click" and Apple (and others) accepted that based simply on the concept.</p>
<p>Now for the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Pillow Fight Bood-Bath" is a performance art project funded by the "International Performance Arts Forum" (Google search turns up nothing); no wait -- on the website, the funding came from the "International Society for the Advancement of Performance Art" (another unsuccessful Google search).</li>
<li>No wait, it's not a performance art project, it's a documentary about a performance art project by Tamara Cruz, director of the documentary "Gulf War Syndrome". Only both Goodle &amp; Internet Movie Database have never heard of either. And the profile about Cruz on the website doesn't provide much credibility that this person actually exists.</li>
<li>On the Pillow Fight Bood-Bath website, you can listen to Mary deSade discuss her work in leather, or in the nude. And yo can buy all sorts of stuff from Cafepress to support Pillow Fight Bood-Bath. I guess she's spent that entire grant by now, &amp; is looking for any way she can to keep her website afloat.</li>
<li>By this point, I'm surprised to discover that the three actresses in this project <b>do</b> exist: Regina Russell, Zoe Paul, &amp; Aysia Lee. One's clearly mired in supporting roles in B-movies, another is a British page 3 girl, &amp; the third is an unknown young starlet. However, their biographies on this website mix fact &amp; fantasy in different amounts -- &amp; I have serious doubts that the "Regina Russell" who played "Mint" in this project is the same "Regina Russell" with an entry at IMDB &amp; whose website at reginarussell.com is linked from Pillow Fight Bood-Bath. But I'm not surprised that only Aysia Lee mentions that she took part in this project.</li>
</ul>
<p>By this point, I'm convinced that this is a soft-porn website, distinguished by an odd sense of humor &amp; some web design skills. But otherwise unnotable, or am I just showing how out of touch I am with the latest internet experiences? -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 07:44, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, I'm Mary DeSade. Delete it if you want. I don't give a rat's **s. But a Google search of Sadovision comes up with 274 entries. And that was before my site started video podcasting.</p>
<p>Sadovisions is Trademarked. Yes it relies on Quicktime VR, though I could easily use flash or some other technology to dupllicate it. But no one (to my knowledge) has ever done what I have done with Quicktime VR. That is, tell a story.</p>
<p>Yes, naked breasts are shown! But it's hardly soft porn. There is no sex or even hints of sex. I guess showing nipples is a crime.</p>
<p>In Europe, the nudity would barely rate a glance. But I guess in America it's porn.</p>
<p>Someone show me where an artist has used VR photography to tell any kind of story before. It has never been done. I believe VR photography is at the beginning of it's art form. It's like movies when audiences were amazed simply by a train coming at them. Then characters were created, stories were told, dramas unfolded.</p>
<p>Sadovison is the first example of story telling through VR photography.</p>
<p>Yes, my website has a lot of comedy on it. But I didn't submit the comedy to Wikipedia. I stuck to the facts. Obviously I made up the actresses (Zoe, Asyia, Regina) bios. (Tamara is a real person, she just isn't very well known. She's a Latino commie and isn't interested in pushing herself onto iMBD.)</p>
<p>But Sadovision is real. I trademarked it, and others will copy it and are already copying it.</p>
<p>Delete this if you want. I don't care. But Sadovision isn't going away.</p>
<p>Mary DeSade</p>

<p>Though this is a three-year-old (!) article, the more I look at it, the more I smell a hoax. I can't find a reference to the kingdom of Biffeche anywhere on Google but our mirror sites, nor is it in JSTOR or Academic Search Premier. Its website strikes me as highly suspicious--why only an English language version for a Wolof/Arabic/Frenchspeaking kingdom? why the references to selling titles? Why does it provide American and European contact info but none within Senegal or Mauritania itself? I suspect that this article is either an elaborate hoax by an American who visited Senegal (the pictures look suspiciously like those a Peace Corps Volunteer or some such would have) or by someone interested in profiting from a micronation. Of course, I'd be very happy to be proved wrong, and maybe 24 hours from now I'm going to feel really stupid for posting this--but until we can verify some of this independent of the website, I'm recommending <s><b>delete</b></s> <b>delete the anthem and keep the island</b>. <a href="../../../d/v/y/User%7EDvyost_72a4.html" title="User:Dvyost">Dvyost</a> 08:21, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The link you posted mentions in passing (in French) an "island of Bifche." But the article isn't about an island at all (doesn't even mention the word). Also, effective hoaxes do tend to sound plausible - generally because the hoaxter has some background knowlege of the over-arching subject. And there's a good chance he's laughing his ass off that he was able to have his hoax remain on Wikipedia for three years with all the resulting mirrors and everything. But at any rate, <i>plausible</i> is not the same thing as <i>verifiable</i>, and if a kingdom does in fact exist, then its existance shouldn't be too hard to verify. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 09:27, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

At first I thought this was just a hoax for the purpose of humor, but now it seems like it's a more sinister fraud - designed to profit from the poverty in West Africa.

By the way, this is apparently the king of Beffeche <a href="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net/images/B-infant.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net/images/B-infant.jpg" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 18:44, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm changing my vote to <b>Abstain</b> for the main article (still <b>Strong Delete</b> for the anthem). I really have mixed feelings here. On the one hand, I appreciate all the work that Dlyons493 and others have put in to research and re-write the article. I also think the en.Wikipedia's coverage of African geography and culture really needs to be expanded. But I'm still not quite comfortable giving this article an official "Keep" vote for a number of reasons. 1. My comment above seems to have been largely ignored. I think it's quite likely that the hoaxsters are perpetrating this whole Biffeche scheme as a charity-scam to profit off the poverty in West Africa. Assuming this article is kept, it should note that the Biffeche website is a hoax/scam (but without actually hyper-linking to that site). 2. I clicked on several of the maps that the article now links to, but I couldn't see any of them actually including the word Biffeche. A couple of the old ones were really low resolution, so maybe I just couldn't see... 3. Even assuming that Biffeche has been verified, I'm not sure that its notablity has been established. If this is the historic name of an island, then couldn't that just be mentioned in an article with the island's current name? Or maybe the river's course changed over time and the island no longer exists - so then couldn't it just be mentioned in an article about one of the towns in the vicinity?... At any rate - I'm just not sure that this deserves its own article - so with this and the concerns above, I'm abstaining with regard to the main article.

<dd>For 1, nearly all of the bad info on the web is limited to the hoax web site and WP derivatives. I'm open to possibly mentioning the self-proclaimed king hoax in the article, but I don't think it's necessary since the WP mirrors should die-out now that we've gotten our act together. Without WP the hoax notable? I really don't know. For 2, check out JJay's antique maps from the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblioth%C3%A8que_nationale_de_France_0ab3.html" title="Biblioth√®que nationale de France">BNF</a>. For 3, I agree that given the poor coverage of West Africa, this article sticks-out like a sore thumb, and also that much of the information would ideally go into an article about a population-center, but the island is pretty big, and (I think) notable enough for an article. <i><b>√ó</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 06:26, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Re the valid notability question raised - the area in question is where Arab North Africa starts to merge into <i>black</i> Sub-Saharan Africa. It was also an early locus of competition with the Dutch, English and French trying to expand. It was one of the early slave areas a bit north of the famous island of Gor√©e and the Gambia (of Alex Haley and <i>Roots</i> fame). So there's a <b>lot</b> of interesting history. There's also a stong Wiki tradition that places/settlements are intrinsically notable. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 10:38, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Those are all good points. I just want to say that the three map links from the BNF that I added all show and name the island/and or region with good resolution.

<dd>Those are very helpful. Bifiche is one of five big islands in the river's delta. The first map is the easiest to find the island on, but the second map (on which East is up and Bifiche is written in light &amp; thin script) shows the most detail, including a number of locations on the island. I'm not as happy with the modern maps ‚Äì as Blackcats suggested, the island's size and shape may have changed a bit. <i><b>√ó</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 05:33, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's an interesting topic to look into. Based on some of the maps, the name seems to refer to the region as well. I added the reference in the first paragraph that describes the island, but we need better primary sources. The area has to have some interest because the French maintained a fort at St. Louis for centuries. The BNF has many first-hand accounts but they are not searchable.

<dd>Re the difference between maps - that's to be expected as all the area is very flat and low-lying. The river is slow-moving and silty and much of the delta is mangrove swamp.

<p>I dont understand how Floater can be notable enough and not Angels Wake. I understand that yes they may only be on the east coast, but Floater is only heard in Oregon? Being on a label, or having a contract shouldnt be a factor in whether or not they should be on an informative website. The links are there, theyll take you to sites where the music is up, where itll show you what theyre involved in, and whats coming up.

You are also greatly in error on a number of points:
<ul>
<li>I did not feel the "need to be anonymous" when I, as per well-established AfD tradition, posted notes concerning your contributions and the fact that they came nowhere near Wikipedia's traditionally-held "voting age". Such notations are traditionally unsigned because they discourage the useless but still frequently-seen practice of ignoring the facts presented and attacking the messenger -- as you have indeed done -- but anyone who knows what they're doing on Wikipedia knows that they can check who left what comment just by reading the history of the article.</li>
<li>"You also apparently didn't read ALL my contributions (see <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boomslang.html" title="Boomslang">boomslang</a>)." If you mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boomslang&amp;diff=32673181&amp;oldid=26939827" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boomslang&amp;diff=32673181&amp;oldid=26939827" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, that edit was made by IP address 151.197.30.149 (talk <small>‚Ä¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_151.197.30.149_94f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/151.197.30.149">contribs</a>). Someone sharp-eyed might indeed have spotted that 30.149's first contribution (one of two) was signed "TaeKwonTimmy" and thus assumed that you could be credited with all that anon address's two contributions. However, you cannot reasonably expect that when checking edit histories, we should look for all anon addresses that you <i>could</i> have been using prior and count their contributions as your own. (By the way, what is the difference between stating that the boomslang's fangs are located at the rear of the mouth and stating that the boomslang is rear-fanged?)</li>
<li>There was no attempt made to "mar your character", only to evaluate realistically your ability to fulfill your responsibilities in this discussion. Even if all the contributions you have <i>now</i> were added to all the contributions of that anon address, they'd still fall short of the above-mentioned "voting age". The purpose of an AfD discussion is to tap the judgement of experienced Wikipedians who understand both the letter and the spirit of Wikipedia's policy and understand how they are applied; new editors, no matter how well-intentioned, very rarely have the needed understanding, and I'm afraid that your apparent ignorance of simple matters such as how easy it is to check the edit history of an article -- not to mention your idea that calling people "Captain Jellyfish", telling them to "kindly get stuffed!", accusing them of "degenerate behavior", and promising "a verbal spanking" is acceptable behavior in an AfD discussion -- shows that you do not have that experience. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 16:45, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm sorry then, if I have misunderstood anything that was done here. As you have pointed out, I am new and I'm not familiar with how EVERYTHING works. I apologize for the hostility. Also the boomslang thing was an oversight, thanks for pointing it out, I went back and fixed it. I also deleted my comments that were in violation. It just seems like most of the people here have it in for me because I'm new.</p>
<pre>
Also see my above comments. They do meet WK: Music guidelines.--<a href="../../../t/a/e/User%7ETaeKwonTimmy_172e.html" title="User:TaeKwonTimmy">TaeKwonTimmy</a> 20:22, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Also, "but anyone who knows what they're doing on Wikipedia knows that they can check who left what comment just by reading the history of the article. " I wasn't aware it was a standard practice. If I HAD know (I.e. had you signed it and explained it) I would never have said what I said.). Also I did know you can check edits and history, but I still wasn't able to check the edits because my computer kept refreshing automatically for some reason. I have since fixed this problem. Anyway, sorry. Also, what is the "voting age" of which you speak? I have made a number of contributions including a rather large one to <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seahorse.html" title="Seahorse">seahorse</a> and the addition of an article on <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaded_Red_7570.html" title="Shaded Red">Shaded Red</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> The article with its rampant product linking is little more than a marketing blurb for Stardock - albeit with an unwanted negative spin with the addition of the 'Forum Criticisms' which has inspired the contestation over neutrality in the first place. If a 'clean-up' simply follows the focus of this argument and removes only the criticisms then the point is still being missed. As it stands not only does the article exemplify the commodification of information but, with its purported 'neutrality', it also seeks to represent its commercial imperative as natural and unbiased setting an unwelcome precedent in the process.

<li>If you think it's not neutral, fix the neutrality. As you appear to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Confuchsia" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Confuchsia" rel="nofollow">new to Wikipedia</a>, I would suggest checking out <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a> for help in doing so. Note also that edits to the article are not forbidden during the AfD process, as you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WinCustomize&amp;diff=33169588&amp;oldid=33073414" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WinCustomize&amp;diff=33169588&amp;oldid=33073414" rel="nofollow">seem to believe</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 05:27, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>but i have already addressed my concerns about the article's lack of neutrality Greenreaper. It is true i could edit the page however running through endless reversions seems to achieve very little. Discussion in order to reach a concensus would seem to be the way forward at this point. My edit comment does not deny the process of further editing. That assumption is entirely yours, but thank you for your advice. My reversion does help to contextualise this debate however, which not only includes the subjectivity of the forum criticisms but the excess of advertising as well. A third of the article page is taken up with product links. One can hardly complain about the subjective bias of the Forum Criticism when the page is so overtly an advertisement for Stardock products,no? Confuchsia 07:23, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Most mixtapes are used to promote material that is either available on actual studio releases or will be at some future date. For the purposes of this encyclopedia, I don't think mixtapes can or should be given their own articles, primarily because anyone can make a mixtape that features the music of any artist (even the artist themself).

<li>The first is available from an Amazon.com marketplace seller, not by Amazon. Amazon cannot legally carry the album. The listings at MTV.com and Yahoo online may be because of confusion: this is not an official and actual album, and neither are the rest. I examined each and every item, and I guarantee I know what I am doing, so do not ass. These are <i>mixtapes</i>, not actual albums. I wouldn't mind a (that is, <i>one</i>) scholarly article on the <i>Welcome to the Chuuch</i> mixtape series, but the articles as they stand are not only uninformative, they are poorly written and formatted as well. The other mixtape articles, however, should be deleted on site. Otherwise, I should have 50 mixtapes for various music artists printed up and distributed, and force their inclusion here as articles. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 15:59, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I wish! They slap the catalogues they receive on their website, and when you actually go and try to buy the thing after eight weeks they tell you that they can't get their hands on the thing. What this say is that someone said that that is by Snoop Dogg. No one denies that that bootleg tape has Snoop Dogg on it. What people say (if you have read the AfD page) is that tons of bootlegs - with and without Snoop Dogg - exist and that no one cares about this particular one.

<li>The mixtapes verifiably exist; I'm sure if you order one, they'll send it to you. However, the point is is that they are all unnofficial and are not produced by Snoop's record labels, but by any odd number of DJs looking to make money for themselves. Official, professional quality studio albums these are not. Any DJ can make a Snoop Doog mixtape and sell it. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 21:38, 24 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry for being unclear. What I meant is that sellers like HMV don't vet the catalogues they receive from their suppliers for accuracy or update their own listing for availability. If a record publisher runs out of a low-volume item the article will remain in the HMV listing until someone tries to order the item through HMV and they are informed that the recording is no longer available. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 02:15, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The question of whether the albums are "official" (whatever that means) is immaterial, completely and utterly immaterial. Wikipedia doesn't exist to act as an official copy of the catalogs of record companies. If the albums verifiably exist (and existence on a HMV catalog is ample evidence of this, then their existence should be recorded as part of the encyclopedic work concerning the artists involved. I regard this mass AfD listing as ill-conceived because of that misunderstanding. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:27, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I Don't know what's going on here. User <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> has just tagged all of Snoop Dogg album entries, that I have created, as articles for deletion. And when I say all I mean <b>ALL</b>. Including The <i>Welcome to tha chuuch</i> series, which are as official as <b>Doggystyle</b> so to say, They are released under <a href="../../../d/o/g/Doggystyle_Records_bd2c.html" title="Doggystyle Records">Doggystyle Records</a> and I think that the mesure of right to exist can't be nothing else that the artist released it under his own name, his own label, with fully new tracks, that he has worked with many other artists, and you say "Okay, off with them, they didn't reach platinum" (from that point of view 5 albums would remain in total...). We could delete every page containing albums about all the not-so-commonly-known rappers. Or does he have to reach a higher standard because he's popular? That's what you call free artistry? Is it some kind of vengeance against a newcomer, who dares to edit and collect every minor album an artist has recorded. I thought an encylopedia gathers every information possible about persons, facts, and related material. For example there are some entries already on <b>Snoop</b> page that reached the number one search spot on <i>Google</i> when looked up (it doesn't mean it doesn't exist on several search results on the later pages). <i>Wikipedia</i> is not just a travel guidebook or a pocket dictionary of some sort. And I would like to ask those persons who never listened to Snoop Dogg in their lifetime to decide carefully, because It is some kind of incompetency to just read about his tracks but not to listen to them. Please consider this. <a href="../../../l/a/j/User%7ELajbi_aa80.html" title="User:Lajbi">Lajbi</a> 16:10, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The <i>Welcome to tha Chuuch</i> releases (save for the last one) are all mixtapes. They are not official albums, and they are not released by Doggystyle records; they're released by other companies. It appears that Snoop may endorse them, in the sense that he allows them as long as he gets payment, but there are literally thousands of mixtapes out there that do the same. Any and every DJ in the industry can and probably does make mixtapes, all of which are illegal, and many of which bounce the same songs back and forth across dozens of releases. Encyclopedias don't gather <i>every bit of information</i> on everything. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. We only need articles on official <i>legal</i> studio releases, not underground mixtapes (because there are, as you see, <i>dozens</i> of them). And even if we did cover them (which we don't; Wikipedia is not hiphopmixtapez.com), we'd need more than a tracklisting and a spam commercial link for purchasing to warrant their inclusion. All of Snoop's studio albums, compilation albums, and official soundtracks can stay, the mixtapes must go.--<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 16:19, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>to <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a>&#160;: I do not deny that these are <i>Mixtapes</i>. I 've never done so. But for example their importance can be seen on examples like&#160;:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1. they contain several EXCLUSIVES, for instance the only cooperation between Usher and Snoop Dogg (not just their voices mixed together!!!) and Sean Paul and Snoop (not just their voices mixed together!!!) can be found on them.</dd>
<dd>2. They indicate that Snoop didn't disappear between Doggystyle and R&amp;G (according to your high level expectations only these two album are "listened" enough)</dd>
<dd>3. That Snoop doesn't exist only in the U.S.A. <i>Welcome to tha chuuch</i> is distributed mostly in Japan (as indicated from the Google search scoring), Street Dance releases are from Denmark and can be bought in Europe (I got mine in a FNAC shop, France) just to name a few</dd>
<dd>4. They ARE released by Doggystyle (the older Doggystyle page mentioned them, the new is not yet ready), and there's the Doggystyle trade mark on all of them (If it wasn't so, there will be some sort of charges against their release, that you would hear about, and they couldn't be sold on Virgin Megastore, Paris for example)</dd>
<dd>And the reason why you can't fund <i>much</i> reference and reviews about them is because they aren't popular enough. Is this music-section about pop-music or what? Please don't be so narrow-minded (that is for all of you)</dd>
<dd>Challenge: if you find those tracks that you said just bouncing around the music industry, then go on and find some other source for those songs, if not, they are only released HERE.

<li><b>Comment</b> to Lajbi: I haven't been voted down anywhere; you control yourself, please. I put off this cleanup task for a long time because I needed assistance in doing so (which I haven't gotten, but that's another story). So I am taking care of it myself. MTV gets soem of its album data from AMG, which is hardly a flawless source of info, and is <i>highly</i> confused at times. Mixtapes are illegal. I never said <i>Doggystyle</i> and <i>R&amp;G</i> are his only important albums, nor did I ever imply such. Ever album Snoop ever released on an official major label should indeed be included, and I have cleaned up his article and the discography to reflect such. I don't know what mixtape rules are like overseas, but in the USA, they are illegal, and would never be on sale in any major retail store (only mom-and-pop and underground stores...and, of course, on the street and on the internet). And when I said "bouncing around", I mean that (and several of your articles specifically state this) that many of the mixtapes include songs from other mixtapes. Mixtapes by default aren't popular because you have to go through special circumstances to try and find them, because they are, indeed, illegal. If you want to help make Wikipedia a better, professional, product, I would strongly suggest you take some time out to learn more about the scope of what is and is not included here, how to format pages, how to write stub articles that assert notablility (and not just existence), and how to not give four frantic replies to a user when one calm one will do.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, I enjoy Snoop's music, and have not selected anything by "my own taste in music". Simply put, if it was obviously unofficial and not released by a label Snoop has released material through (Death Row, Priority -- Snoop was technically signed to Priority when he was releasing through No Limit, Star Trek, and Koch) or a soundtrack to an official film release, I listed it here. Just becasue it exists doesn't mean it needs an article. I'm sorry.</dd>

<dd>As far as films go, it's probably best not to write entries on each and every direct-to-video release Snoop has ever put out (for example, the <i>Welcome to the Chuuch</i> DVD has already been listed in the above group). Now, if you're <i>asking</i> for me to sort through them for notability verification, I will most certainly do so. A million people aren't required to have seen or bought a movie to warrant its inclusion, but at the same time every $3 DVD that Snoop appears in doesn't need an article here.

<li><b>Comment</b> to FuriousFreddy:The major problem is, you did it your way. You want people to vote about a bunch of albums, not letting them to decide one-by-one, so if one agrees with OGTV2 for example, but not the DJ Jam stuff, he could indicate it but he won't (as <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> did). They will just see the list and vote. They see one wrong edit and they vote "no". So don't hurry the process. I'm sorry that you didn't find assisstance for months, but that's not my problem. Sorry about my style too, but how would you feel, if someone deleted all your entries done. And finally I don't know why are you trying to make an example of Snoop there are way too many sites that are stubby but could stay. And it's okay like that, they will improve with enough time. About the single&#160;: some of them are made in my earlier edit and I came round that they are badly-edited, but I have no assisstance neither to clean them up, so I decided to do them sometime (as I remember I asked you to assist me...). The newer one are not "that bad", are they? They are made copying non-stubby single articles' style. But this debate is not about them. Don't take it personal! I did take it, because of your manner of "deletion-madness". You could leave a message on my talk page before doing such a huge step (step back?). So please, change method in reaching your goal. Just because you have more rights, it doesn't mean you just take a bunch of edits, and throw it into the dustbin (without information gathered from them). <a href="../../../l/a/j/User%7ELajbi_aa80.html" title="User:Lajbi">Lajbi</a> 17:29, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><s>Maybe G-Unit mixtapes are actual endorsed albums that are made to sound like mixtapes</s>. Then again, maybe not, since I tried to look for DJ Whoo Kid mixtapes and found I had to go to specialized websited to do such. Even if they are legal overseas (which, as international copyright violations, they <i>shouldn't</i> be), we don't need articles on them. The articles had no content as it was; only tracklistings. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 18:08, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>You don't know the law as it is written to state the mixtapes are illegal and neither do I.

<ul>
<li>And is a mixtape illegal if it is released by the artist himself, and on the label owned by the artist? If you listen to ANY of the mixtapes, Snoop talks in the intros,interludes and outros that these are HIS mixtapes. He mentions the album name, his record label name, and the forthcoming projects. I have an example for the inverse to your "Bouncing theory". In <i>Welcome to tha chuuch vol. 2</i> it is the premiere of the 213 song "So fly", with a Snoop introduction, the only change that has been made to it in the later <i>Hard Way</i> album is that they cut out the intro so it starts with a sudden beat. <a href="../../../l/a/j/User%7ELajbi_aa80.html" title="User:Lajbi">Lajbi</a> 19:08, 24 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If a mixtape is released by the artist themself, it depends on the songs included (where they were recorded, when they were recorded, and who owns the master recordings) to determine whether or not the mixtape is legal or not. This means that you'd have to check each and every song on each and every mixtape, and make sure not a single track reappears on any other album or mixtape anywhere in existence. And mixtapes aren't too keen on not including previously or soon-to-be released material. Regardless of the legality, we don't need articles on every Snoop Dogg mixtape in existence. He's released plenty of real albums between 1993 and 2005 that have Wikipedia coverage, so no one thinks he dissapeared during that period. I've never listened to any of these mixtapes. You know why? They are illegal, and I'd have to go through special circumstances (such as ordering them from untrustworthy online retailers -- I've heard horror stories about mixtape websites) to try and get one --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 19:25, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I can't get this Virgin Megastore (which sells bootleg imports as it is anyway). This has nothing to do with my personal preference; this has to do with maintaining an <i>encyclopedia</i>.

<li>We have different ideas about encyclopedia. All that I'm saying is we should keep the <i>chucch</i> series at least, because they exist and you couldn't cite a source that doesn't say they are released by Doggystyle records.

<li>Meanwhile attempts to delete the article in question clearly haven't a hope in hell of succeeding while so many other (presumably verifiable) articles are also listed. The system is broken if it destroys such verifiable information rather than considering merging it to another, more comprehensive article about an obviously widespread an encyclopedic phenomenon surrounding such a prominent exponent of rap music as Snoop Dogg.

<li>Could someone explain why the question of legality has been raised? I notice, and now that I see it I'm quite, utterly, shocked by this, that the <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> article barely admits the existence of the many bootleg recordings that were made of Dylan's work in the early seventies--items which fed the Dylan cult and led to a peculiar and distinctive form of Dylan fandom. This is a very, very palpable omission from that article. But with these articles that we're discusing now, we're not even talking about illegal material, but material that has been released with the sanction of the artist, Snoop Dogg, who has gone out of his way to promote his own local brand of rap. Why on Wikipedia should we ever consider statements such as "this is not an official and actual album" when clearly there is material in the form of an album? Are we to say "there was no asesmbly on that day" because the legal authority in Peking on a certain day denies the existence of a popular protest?" --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 05:43, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>{{sofixit}}. You made an excellent point. Bob Dylan bootlegs are part of Dylan fandom and some are well known. Now the material under discussion here is a stack of mixes amongst hundreds of others. As I said above, if any of the mixes here was important stuff the article would say so and it would be kept. The question if the music here was issued with The Dogg's blessing or not is rather irrelevant. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 15:31, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly. No notability other than existence (and commerical links) are established. Bootlegs, mixtapes, and the like don't need articles (or even mentioning) unless they are notable factors in something like a hip-hop rivalry or such. Do you really understand just how many Snoop Dogg mixtapes exist, how many new ones are created and distributed within a year's time, and just how many aren't even listed here? Do you understand how many mixtapes exist for <i>any</i> given popular rapper? Do you understand just how interchangable and individually indistinct each mixtape's tracklistings, etc. are? This is where the line needs to be drawn between "encyclopedia" and "indiscriminate repository of data". I didn't join this project to write articles about CD-R's pressed up in some guy's basement. If bootlegged songs are ever released to the public in special packages (<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lost_Tapes_6925.html" title="The Lost Tapes">The Lost Tapes</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bootleg_Series_Volumes_1-3_%28Rare_%26_Unreleased%29_1961-1991_472c.html" title="The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961-1991">The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961-1991</a></i>), mention them <i>there</i>. It's also not that big a deal to have an article on Snoop Dogg mixtapes and bootlegs, minus the individual tracklistings and plus <i>notability</i>, <i>significance</i>, and <i>historical context</i> (<i>if</i> they exist). But that bundle of warez up there almost made me quit the project because of just the sheer size of the problem, and the lack of response when I asked for help with doing cleanup. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 16:58, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>FuriousFreddy, I haven't blocked you and wouldn't contemplate doing so. Indeed I made a comment on two talk pages recently requesting explanation of some of your recent edits. I agree that the new article is a mess; obviously I think the material belongs in individual articles. I find the statement "Crap like this are good reasons that people that <i>could</i> contribute to Wikipedia <i>don't</i>. Tony, you know better than this" uttery inexplicable, as inexplicable as indeed I find the original listing for deletion. It's utterly mind-boggling.

<li><i>Verify</i> it with a <i>real</i>, dependable source (like the kind Wikipedia is <i>supposed</i> to use), and not a commercial catalogue website. Mixtapes, random compilations ,etc. exist for any number of artists. Does that mean that we write encyclopedia articles on them? C'mon, I know you know better than this. I am almost certain that that eyesore of a merged article is unneccssary (and I really should add it to this list). Snoop's mixtapes are just about as verifiable as the numbero f pairs of shoes and cars he owns, etc. Wikipedia quality is already on a wane; we don't need ot be crowding it with underground CD-Rs. Also, in case you don't realize it by now, Snoop was actually only fully involved in maybe 30% of those mixtapes -- the rest are DJs using his name and image to make money for themselves on the side, so there goes your "verifiable material from an artist" excuse. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 18:04, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Tony, you couldn't know how mixtapes work if you're trying to push for keeping these articles in any form or fashion. It would be a good thing to have an article on Snoop Dogg underground releases that, using verifiable sources, <i>lists</i> (no tracklistings) the mixtapes he himself was actually fully and directly involved in making/approving (if any) and/or covering any important underground songs contained on any of them (in many cases, one song will pop up on dozens of mixtapes). <i>This</i> is a travesty. I've fought tooth and nail trying to improve Wikipedia's once woefully poor coverage of hip hop, R&amp;B, and soul music-the <i>least</i> you could have done, as an administrator and an apparent long time user, was done some research and reaize just what the heck you're doing, instead of going "oh it exists; here's a link to where I can <i>buy</i> it at" (first mistake) and trying to bend rules and make edits/articles you know better than doing (and to what end I have no idea). (And even then, if you wanted to <i>bend</i> rules, why not clean up the articles before merging? Why the text dump?) My WikiBreak just might turn into a break<i>out</i> if I am to look forward to coming back to globs of consolidated and poorly formatted Snoop-cruft (at least the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariah_Carey_467b.html" title="Mariah Carey">Mariah Carey</a> cruft was, if nothing else, decently formatted and informative (if overly so and coated with a thick sheen of POV).

<li>Hmmm, in some cases we have very little information about these unofficial releases other than the outlets through which they have been made available, and the track listings. I see absolutely no legitimate reason to remove a track listing from the information about an album. I also remain unconvinced by the arguments that the article about these unofficial items should be deleted. The "Welcome to Tha Chuuch" series, in particular, inspired an official release, and so it would arguably be best to merge the information to the article about that official album. These items are for the most part easily verifiable (and where they're not then a case can be made for deletion) and the information should not be deleted from Wikipedia without an extremely good reason. No reason, other than personal attacks and palpably false accusations against me, has been presented to support this mass listing for deletion. The only person who has attempted to make a constructive response--myself--has been vilified. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 19:50, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes I collect Snoop CD-s I bougth some of the mixtapes in France (and saw the others too) and (oh my God, it may happen that illegally) purchased the rest. It was a hard work and took several years, and I listened all of them, and I can make a difference between what is fake and what is not. (Right now I'm not giving reasons for keeping I want to make clear I'm not just a naive fan)</li>
</ul>
<p>Small summary of the debate:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.<i>It's been said that they don't exist</i> - now the links show different</li>
<li>2.<i>It's been said that they are illegal</i> - while there's no charges brought against the DJ-s by Snoop or by the F.B.I. or the RIAA, and can be bought in several stores, this isn't proved to be true. Not to mention that the 7th chapter is distributed by Sony BMG.</li>
<li>3.<i>It's been said that they are</i> unofficial - there are several cases when official mixtape DJ-s work for artists (DJ Whoo Kid for Shady/G-Unit, DJ Exclusive for Aftermath, and most of all DJ Clue, who produced several number one hits' beats), the CD-s are released by Doggystle Records (others like the Gutta Music release are from the New No Limit). Maybe they are just called mixtape to sound more underground. And for the <i>chuuch 1-9</i> series there are no DJ name indicated. Because they are Snoop Dogg releases not unknown DJ ones who try to make easy money.</li>
<li>4.<i>It's been said that they are</i> not notable. They contain mostly unique tracks by a large variety of artists, these albums are the original and first (!) appearance for those tracks and the <i>series</i> led to a "solo studio album" release. Not to mention that the 7th chapter is distributed by Sony BMG. They have a reason to do so.<br />

<dd><i>humm... then again, wikipedia isn't supposed to be a collection of lists is it? Nice work, but if we had an article about boot legs maybe... Preferably we would pick the best of this artist and try and comment on those songs (with research... don't just make a list of songs but add critical comments that can be found in the news about these songs... if there is none, then perhaps a delete might be warranted.

</dd>
<dd>My afformentioned comments seems to co-incide with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>:
<dl>
<dd><i>Lists of Frequently Asked Questions. Wikipedia articles should not list FAQs. Instead, format the information provided as neutral prose within the appropriate article(s). You may want to consider contributing FAQ lists to Wikibooks.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So, what I am saying, is that, though I have attempted to compare this with the precedence of Beethoven's 9th symphony. Beethoven's 9th appears to be full of information with adequate sourcing. These present articles, up for deletion, have may have a potential for expansion. (Probably not, but who know's maybe someone has written a novel, or some news articles on the album songs.) However, it will probably be hard to find non-original research that analyses the music in those tracks. Essentially what I am getting to, is, will these articles be expanded? I looked into precedence for this <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html#Music" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents#Music</a> and I agree with whomever wrote this page. (though it is not wikipolicy) This stipulates that:
<dl>
<dd><i>Albums are notable, but please provide the name of the band, and more info than a mere tracklist</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Furthermore:if you follow the link <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a> provided a little further down in the text from the above quote, you will notice in the 2nd paragraph that when it comes to notability:
<dl>
<dd><i>the article in question must actually document that the criterion is true.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Though this appears to be in the context for musicians, I believe it is as true and applicable for their respective albums or even bootleged albums. So my conclusion: Expand the articles to have news paper clipings information, etc... talk about the songs, etc... or unfortunatelly move to wikisource and delete. (Currently, I'm not convinced that they're posibility for improvement to the article in time before this delete is over so I think it will be deleted.) Again, I strongly encourage the admin. that will probably be deleting these articles and the information to move them to "wikisource" or "wikibooks". --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CylePat</a> 00:08, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>THe feeling is mutual. Why are so many people voting to delete neutral, verifiable information? Because the items aren't "official"? That means nothing to Wikipedia, it's just somebody's name on a piece of paper and doesn't stop artists producing useful work (for instance the mixes that 50 Cent did after losing his contract with a record company,that resulted in his being signed up by Shady Records...oh but those have been listed for deletion too.)

<li>Maybe people are voting to delete these entries that are undoubtedly verifiable because they feel that Wikipedia is not a good home for track listings of minor recordings. This is an encyclopedia that relates what secondary sources have said about a thing, not a repository for first-hand data. The fact that this is a large volume of data on a very specialized and ephemeral subject may also play a role in peoples' voting behaviour.

<p>"<i>Has had a charted hit on any national music chart, in at least one large or medium-sized country</i>". This criteria is for musicians but it is simply applicable for albums too as they can be considered as a "subcategory" of a musician's article. From this point of view the Dogg Pound Mix (for example) should be kept because as a <i>Street Dance Records</i> release (that means European distribution) it charted the Switzerland Top 100 Album at the place 81 in 2005 (that would mean a larger amount of record sales) <a href="http://www.mariah-charts.com/chartdata/PSnoopDogg.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mariah-charts.com/chartdata/PSnoopDogg.htm" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>.

<li><b>comment:</b>I think I have to agree with TUF-KAT on this. We should not jump out of context with my use of the quote from <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. The section I quoted talks about notability and appears to be more of an introduction to the main subject of "musicians." The rest of the article should not be brought out of context to accomodate "recording-artists." Now, if these recordings where all done by pure hasard by the same DJ, it may be convenient to have a small bio on this "recording engeneer," and include all these albums as a list of "see also." Again, they would have to have a significance to the "artist" that created them. As for the #81 on the Switzerland list... perhaps that information should be added in the appropriate album or song section and would hence add credible information to give that one article enough substance to avoid deletion. Finally, I think the problem here is that we are treating all these articles as one. I read through one and it appears to be fair, and stipulates more information than just a list of songs on an album. However some others, like this one, are simply a list of songs on the album. I think what we want to do, with the current information and knowlege we have, it to valurize the artist. To do that we need to add more information than just a list of songs on an album. There is no reason we can't do like my above example, of Beethoven's 9th, but we must have some information on the subject. Currently the articles appear to be anemic on this and I don't think there is any room for much improvement at least for a little while. (as I stipulated, merge the information under the artist, wikisource or wikibooks, (place them on your user page, or whatever) and when there is enough info about those album, more then a list, then perhaps incorperate into wiki. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CylePat</a> 00:33, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>KEEP! Imperfect it may be, but it does contain information I could not find anywhere else. Fix, but keep. R.L.V.</p>
<p>This article is hopelessly wrong. The only people who refer to English Units are Amercians. The system that they describe actually dates back to the Holy Roman Empire, not England or Britain. Whilst it might be salavagable I doubt it. It has become to massed up by addition made by someonewho knows little or nothing about the history of the measurement in the UK. Imperial is a late and very codefied system which, were as the systems it replaced were more remshacle than ever. The term 'English Units' should be decribe as an Americanism describing in accuratley European measuring systems.--<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanDavies_be2e.html" title="User:IanDavies">IanDavies</a> 01:02, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> but God alone knows what the title should be. These historical units have a much wider currency that is suggested by "English" or "British" units, not least due to their spread throughout the Empire, but also if you look into the history of science you will find people like Boyle, Hooke, Newton and others using drachms and other units, and their work was circulated worldwide. Use of the FFS (Furlong/Firkin/Fortnight) system still has some currency as an affectation among traditionalists. I guess that perhaps <b>archaic units</b> or <b>units (archaic)</b> might be the best target.

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with the first entry. This is a difficult subject, but this isn't a useful article. I don't think it contributes to material available elsewhere, in parts it is wrong, in others misleading, and the conversions are too precise. It fails to address the issue with rigour. It is insufficiently detailed to be useful to historians, and dangerous for non-historians. The list is useful but these are definitions for a dictionary, not an encyclopedia. At the very least the name must be changed - it is an invention. English wouldn't be better as units were regional within England, and often imposed in e.g., Wales <a href="../../../g/b/h/User%7EGBH_94b3.html" title="User:GBH">GBH</a> 22:28, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The accuracy issues can be fixed. The problem of the correct title is a thorny one, but I've recently been reading the original papers of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Hooke_6579.html" title="Robert Hooke">Robert Hooke</a> in reproduction by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Gunther_9e2d.html" title="Robert Gunther">Robert Gunther</a>, and the units in those papers (including early work on gravitaiton, magnetism, microscopy, the nature of light and so on) include some of these archaic units. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 23:18, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That should hardly come as any surprise. You wouldn't expect Hooke to be prescient enough to use the metric system a century or so before it was invented, would you?

<dd>It supporters and the article haven't show anywhere that the units are in anyway English. You haven't shown the originated in England or by English people. You haven't shown that the measures were peculiar to England. The only thing that has ben demostrated is that Americans use the term English Unit, but Americans also have English Muffins, which do not occur in England.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think it necessary for WP to explore stereotypes in society, even though it is hard to do so without causing offence to some people (usually not those to whom the stereotypes refer, incidentally). I think this article, with some cleaning up, will be perfectly acceptable.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Let's say for the sake of argument that this article is on a "perfectly valid topic" and just needs "cleaning up." If it were "cleaned up" by removing everything that wasn't sourced (<a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">WP:V</a>), that was original research (<a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">WP:NOR</a>) or that was POV (<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">WP:NPOV</a>), what would be left? "The three policies are complementary, non-negotiable, and cannot be superseded by any other guidelines or by editor's consensus," and this article violates all or them, repeatedly, and the arguments to keep utterly ignore that. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 00:58, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I absolutely believe that something could be made of this article. Here's how: (1) delete every word on the page; (2) do some actual research (thanks for the references) about high school subcultures; (3) write it up, with references. I'm not going to do that, though, and no one else is either as long as there is a long, random list of stereotypes filling that page. It could make a great basis for a website of its own, I must say, with a scope like urbandictionary or the late lamented TV Tropes wiki. But as it is, it's worthless--as opposed to "vital" or "crucial"--and I don't see it developing in a useful way. I (still) support what <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> says above, 100%. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 04:28, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

I don't know how you want to upkeep articles pending on the internet, because nothing is eternal there (in other words everything is temporary).

<li>P.S.&#160;: I had to do a lot of web browsing til finding that page. <i>Google</i> only came up with www.daddyv.com, that was already obsolete (only the main page remained), then I changed to <i>Hotbot</i>, and it found on the 50th hit the www.ogdaddyv.com flash page, which was up to date with background streaming audio and so on...But never mind that.

<li>His companies don't show up in a web search, there is no proof for the assertion that he plays in the same league as Dr Dre and King Tee - the most that can be said is that he issued a bunch of mixes of Snoop Dogg's work. How much Snoop Dogg was involved is unknown - the article doesn't say, and I was unable to find any sources. We don't know how influential he was, I guess not very much, if he was someone would have noticed his work and reviewed it somewhere. Maybe <i>you</i> can bring up the article to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> standard. If you want it kept you should.

<li>WP:MUSIC does <i>indeed</i> dictate what gets kept or deleted. That's what it's <i>there</i> for. We've already determined that being on the same CD as a notable performer doesn't qualify you for notability yourself, if no other such notability is established (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Quan_723b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Quan">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Quan</a>)--<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 16:40, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm pleased to confirm that FuriousFreddy is incorrect. WP:MUSIC absolutely does not determine what is kept and what is not kept on Wikipedia. It's merely an attempt to consolidate the consensus. Where there is disagreement (and there is clearly disagreement here) then it isn't much of a guide. Which is why we need AfD. Daddy V is on record on some CDs that are widely circulated; he isn't your local butcher, he's an artist whose work is circulated in every country of the world. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 05:06, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>So new pages aren't welcome at <i>Wikipedia</i> because it may be out of some people's field of interest. I really saw much simpler pages without any reference with just a <i>stub</i> sticked on them.

<li>I'm saying. If the research was already <i>done</i>, and proved fruitless, then how can we verify it.

<li>I'm not so concerned about that (you are the one fighting on the behalf of stubby articles). You attack EVERYONE who says keep it. But that doesn't change nothing.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm a bit confused now that I've seen the list below. Wouldn't it have been easier to just redo the present list, instead of creating a new one? Or did you only create that list based on the voting here? Because the problem is once the present list gets deleted, your new list qualifies as a re-creation and thus a speedy delete. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:18, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hmm, I didn't notice that the <i>Lists</i> one was that new, but I don't think it would qualify as re-creation because it is a <i>list of lists</i> (and the lists it includes have been around for sometime) so it's not technically the same content. However, it would have been a lot easier if <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> had simply edited the current one and renamed vs. creating a new one and putting the old one up for AfD. -- <a href="../../../j/l/a/User%7EJLaTondre_be65.html" title="User:JLaTondre">JLaTondre</a> 02:26, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have to confess I introduced a confusion here, because of my misunderstanding. I created <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Jews_by_country_c2eb.html" title="Lists of Jews by country">Lists of Jews by country</a> by myself after <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">User:JJay</a> pointed to my misunderstanding, that the discussed article was in fact "List of Countries with Jews". What I did I wrote a clear intro describing the purpose of the list and made it transparent. And then I noticed that the discussed article does the same, only in a peculiar manner. I didn't notice that that the links to lists are piped: ([[Lsit fo ....]|list]]), and they simply slipped from my eye because of the random list of names, and I was overfixated on its POV. 03:32, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Probable hoax. Purportedly it was a children's show that aired exactly <i>one</i> episode, in Wisconsin, in 1984; however, as is usual for hoaxes, mysterious circumstances seem to have conspired to put obstacles in the path of anyone trying to verify that the show actually existed: the lead actor "died under mysterious circumstances in 1989", the director/producer "remains anonymous to this day", and rumoredly "tried to destroy all of the props and footage after his show was cancelled." The external links claim to list the "Gunk Land Official Site" and "Gunk Land at the Internet Movie Database", but in fact "Gunk Land" has no listing at the IMDB. Neither does its supposed lead actor, Glen Thompson. The "official site" is actually a fan site, but out of its multiple subpages, only "About", "Characters" and "Video Clips" are anything but mere "Coming Soon" stubs. The video clips don't function, so they provide no evidence for the show's existence and the "Characters" pages list all character images as "coming soon". Then there's the show itself: this was supposedly a <i>children's</i> show, complete with educational content -- but the lead character, the little girl "Jane", is played by an adult male actor? There's "a giant phallic looking pink furry puppet named One Eye", who "has been known to spit a viscous fluid when pet under the chin"? "Poh Pie cuts off his arms to stop his urges from touching the TV set"? Who believes that <i>anyone</i> would have put this on the air as a kid's program in 1984, at the height of the <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Reagan</a> era?

<li><b>Keep</b> Hello, I am the person who submitted the article Gunk Land, and while I am excited to think that people think I concocted this absurd story, I have to admit my own imagination is far too lackluster. I would like to petition to keep the info up as it is real. I distinctly recall seeing it sometime back in the mid 80s. Although I am not clear of the channel, and it could very well have been one of the local cable access shows. You have to keep in mind that while the story is potentially subversive - look at the much more successful Pee Wee's Playhouse. I distinctly recall much sexual innuendo between the puppets and the live characters such as Miss Yvonne. Also look at the subversive aspects of "You Can't Do That on Television" which aired during the Bush era. To say a show is a hoax because of its potent content is silly and short sighted. I can see your point about the "anonymous" director. I chalked that up to either shame or embarassment and the need for the artist to seperate him/herself from the failed project (aka Alan Smithee). Anyhow, I do hope you consider my petition to keep the article intact, and hope all of you have some Happy Holidays! Thank you for your consideration!&#160;:) -- Aidan_NY 23:40, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's true MisterHand, I am not able to make as much a case for the article. It seems to be much harder to prove something exists especially when I am merely going by my memory here. The fan site is the only offering of confirmation that the show exists coupled with my memory I have of the media experience. I clearly remember this show, as well as the more popular Sid &amp; Marty Kroft live action lineup of the late 70s. I also can't help but see humor and irony in the concept of an anonymous jury debating the validity of my memories and experiences.&#160;:P Anyhow, I have contacted the fansite creator but haven't heard back. I was hoping to contribute my memories of the show. I guess I'll keep looking. I'll see what I can find on IMDB. That seems to be another reputable source that exudates fact - thanks for the lead Francis Tyers!-- Aidan_NY 23:48, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

What do we see in the first four lines of <a href="../../../d/r/o/Dropa.html" title="Dropa">Dropa</a>? "Skeptics note, however, a number of problems with the case (and a lack of corroborative evidence), which offers significant doubt as to the reality of the more sensationalistic Dropa claims. Mainstream critics argue that the entire affair is a hoax." Your "Gunk Land" article, on the article, tries to pass itself off as the real thing.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Reviewing most of Wikipedia's general guidelines, I realize I am still inept in proper coding - but it seems to me that Quarl seems to be quite over-excited in his psuedo witch hunt (Reviewing all of his heated and persistant and inane edits to mistakes that are common with a newbie really causes me to take a step back. I am not versed in how to add "comments" to these pages and will cut and paste the previous entry and fill in my reply.) - I understand most of everyone's comments in how Gunkland is not appropriate for Wikipedia. I felt it was because of the fairly recent criticism concerning this site, and my growing interest in the nature of hoaxes. Gunkland wasn't created specifically for Wikipedia - but I was planning on using Wikipedia to help make it a fact - as it is known that the internet audience is increasingly relying on the internet for fact. Gunkland is my thesis project on the blending of media experiences (blurring horror, sexploitation and children's programming) and posing an argument about whether or not asexual characters can exude either homosexuality (like spongebob or teletubbies. The Elk Hotel is a film that exists and is currently being finished - I did this all in good humor, and was not trying to cause people anxiety attacks as I seem to have caused Quarl as represented in his crude criticism - (referring to his comment about getting rid of the "crap" on the gunge page - although the word crap is totally appropriate for Gunkland in the sense that taboo bodily fluids are figuratively exploited in the world I am creating. I realize that creating a hoax needs much more work before it is generally released into the world. This was a great test for me though! lostheadfactory 08:39, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I should note that this was talked about in the CS talk page before the page was created, and while I may have physically started the page, it wasn't my idea so my opinion shouldn't be considered more relevant solely because my name's next to the creation entry. I was expecting at least two others to contribute. That didn't happen, and since nobody else seems to have the ability to flesh the article out, I don't think it's worth keeping. Also, another person questioned the article's worth in its talk pages two months ago as well, and although at the time I disagreed, now I think there's merit to his argument. I do think it would be worth keeping if it had the content, but it just isn't happening. --<a href="../../../c/y/l/User%7ECylik_c16e.html" title="User:Cylik">Cylik</a> 02:40, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
