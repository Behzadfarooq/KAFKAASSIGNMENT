<p>The information presented here about lengths of reigns of Popes is redundant; it is <b>already completely contained</b> in the main article <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a>. While it is true that this page contains unique content, that content is specific to Peter and much of it is also irrelevant to the subject of length of reign. It should therefore be transferred to the main article <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a>, or possibly <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Peter_ace2.html#Catholic_Church" title="Saint Peter">Saint Peter</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_S_616d.html" title="User:Robin S">Robin S</a> 00:52, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> It is not redundant, it is a unique presentation of the data which is the subject of the article. The discussion of Saint Peter's longevity is of interest in itself apart from the Saint Peter biography. Also, why such a short time for a <i>2nd nomination</i> for <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> after a vote to keep? It's only been <b>73 days</b> since the last nomination. What's <i>different</i> about that list on March 18 compared to <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">January 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatsw_2d50.html" title="User:Patsw">patsw</a> 02:15, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The information is presented identically in the article <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html#Longest-reigning_Popes" title="Pope">Pope</a>. The discussion of Saint Peter's longevity alone does not merit an entire article. The first AfD discussion may not have noticed the duplication of the information in <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html#.23Longest-reigning_Popes" title="Pope">Pope</a>, or the information may have been transferred there as a consequence of the discussion. Either way, the article is in my opinion no longer viable. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_S_616d.html" title="User:Robin S">Robin S</a> 04:46, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> as <b>sortable table</b>. There should be only one list of popes. Having several lists with basically the same information is redundant.

<p>In response to those who have suggested merging, I would like to remind you that the information is already contained <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html#Longest-reigning_Popes" title="Pope">here</a> in exactly the same form, so a "merge" would in fact amount to out-and-out deletion. Personally, I am in favour of a sortable table in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_popes.html" title="List of popes">List of popes</a>, as Dr bab suggested (I was not previously aware that this was possible). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_S_616d.html" title="User:Robin S">Robin S</a> 03:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> how many ways can we slice the list of popes and have it be encyclopedic? By date of reign seems (pardon the pun) canonical. By how many cardinals he made? By how tall he was? or By how many illegitimate children he fathered, seems clearly popecruft. By length of reign? Close calls as there may be nothing particularly notable about the length of a pope's reign, there are other lists where the listees are sliced by notable things: see, e.g.,</li>

<li>The article is 55k, but the recommended limit before splitting is considered is 32k.

In such a case, because the split is only because of excessive size of the main article, we have to be more generous in judging the notability of the split article. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 00:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
