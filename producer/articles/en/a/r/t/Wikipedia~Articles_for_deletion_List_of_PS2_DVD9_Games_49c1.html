<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). <i>Four</i> options are on the table, keep as is, merge with a more general list, convert into a category, or just delete. Merging into a more general list probably means annotating the entries which use the DVD-9 format (and I cannot be bothered to do that now, but if anyone thinks that is a good idea, go ahead). Conversion to category would mean losing the redlinked entries until we get articles on them. With no consensus for any of the four options, I will default this to the outright "keep" result without prejudice against a relisting later. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:37, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> I know of many people whom this list would help! Read the updated/expanded list introduction to see why it is relevant. This info is made more useful because PS2 games disk formats are NEVER provided by Sony or the game makers (though CD-based games can USUALLY be identified in stores since they often display the special CD logo on back). PS2 lasers are by far the most common failure on the system. Since the dense DVD-9 format requires dual-layer focusing and has only been in use since 2003, these disks have common read errors when switching layers. This list is a great complement to the extensive PS2 CD-ROM game list created 6 months ago <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_PlayStation_2_CD-ROM_games_fe07.html" title="List of PlayStation 2 CD-ROM games">List_of_PlayStation_2_CD-ROM_games</a> -- <a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERory77_2c49.html" title="User:Rory77">Rory77</a> 08:21, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Bloated Response</b> This is not useless information, but I can see I won't convince any of you serial-information-destroyers of this. The fact that we have a 20 year old admin commenting on this list means I'm 99% sure you will delete this list and probably the other (CD-ROM) list I mentioned above. I knew full well your deletion fetish may lead to the CD-ROM list being axed as well, but risked it to provide you with more info. The PS2 is one of the only systems in history where games have confusingly been released in more than one medium. Additionally, there are VERY FEW conceivable high-level/obvious lists or classifications for PS2 games, but among them would be such things as genre (there are many pages for game genres that list game examples for each system), developer, release year, networkability, and disk media. There are currently 2 lists for PS2 networked games. You guys better delete both of them while you are at it too. Since none of <b>YOU</b> have ever looked at these lists before, I'm sure that means they are useless information. <i>Seriously, a list only takes a few kilobytes on the Wiki-drive and each of these lists I mentioned are NEARLY COMPLETE (I personally flagged both lists as "incomplete" to encourage users to update them and not take them as 100% definititive). The lists don't even show up on the Wikipedia search listing yet, so please allow users some time to find and utilize them before they are deleted as <b>cruft</b>. Please re-consider your actions.</i> -- <a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERory77_2c49.html" title="User:Rory77">Rory77</a> 12:46, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - This list belongs on a PS2 fansite, not on Wikipedia. Especially the <b>DVD9</b> and <b>CD-ROM</b> part of it.

<dd>Importance is in the eye of the beholder. Would you support my idea of merging, so that the merged article has a "critical mass" of importance.

<li><b>Obvious KEEP</b>. There is nothing in this article (or list) that doesn't belong in Wikipedia. "Listcruft" is a lame attempt to circumvent the need of presenting any real argument for deletion. "Not important" is a dubious claim, as the material on this list probably has vastly greater influence on today's society than, say, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrada_of_Laon_72c3.html" title="Bertrada of Laon">Bertrada of Laon</a> (just a random example). – <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimwi_eb8f.html" title="User:Timwi">Timwi</a> 16:54, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Convert to category</b>. This sort of thing is exactly what categories are intended for; lists aren't supposed to have minimal entries like this. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">contribs</a> 18:33, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup. Firstly read <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EListcruft_170b.html" title="Wikipedia:Listcruft">Wikipedia:Listcruft</a> again: <i><b>the perception that an article is listcruft can be a contributing factor to someone voting for deletion, but it may not be the sole factor</b></i>, which means that almost all of the "delete" votes above fail this test; I would remind you furthermore that <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EListcruft_170b.html" title="Wikipedia:Listcruft">Wikipedia:Listcruft</a> is not <b>policy</b> or even a <b>guideline</b>, it is a personal essay. Second, the calls to convert the list into a Category miss the major differences between categories and lists: the former are not capable of referencing yet-to-be-written articles, which the latter can accommodate in addition to further annotation which increases value. I call upon the closing admin to take these points into serious consideration when evaluating the votes above.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Keeping this list would open the door for things like List of G-rated PC Games on 3" disks, List of R-rated PC Games release on both 3" and 5" disks etc. (And yes I'm obviously exaggerating of course). Since enough people seem to want a list of games (though I still don't understand why), I've changed my vote to merge the DVD9 and CDROM lists. Can I convince you to do the same&#160;? -- <a href="../../../h/i/r/User%7EHirudo_8b5b.html" title="User:Hirudo">Hirudo</a> 08:16, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply to Comment</b>: that might be a possible compromise, although I would be more inclined to support this proposal if it went further. From a quick perusal of the various lists on offer, it would appear that unifying the various "by format" lists into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_4ac8.html" title="List of PlayStation 2 games">List of PlayStation 2 games</a>, adding <b>much</b> annotation as to format/networking/etc, accompanied by splitting that list into sub-lists by initial letter (List of PlayStation 2 games: A, etc) would be the best long-run solution which subsumes all other possibilities. In the even-longer-term, this is a possible application for <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/wikidata" class="extiw" title="m:wikidata">wikidata</a> or something similar.
