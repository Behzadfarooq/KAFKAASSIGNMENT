<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous. I count 5 clear "delete" votes and 7 clear "keep" votes (but 2 of them were from anon or very new users and are discounted). Even after discounting the anon votes, this discussion fails to reach a clear concensus to delete.

<li>I'm reiterating my nomination to delete this article. All the new references are genealogy sites, which can have a tendency to accept and repeat unverified information.

<p>Keep. The author clearly states that the subject of the article is mythological and openly acknowledges that many sources have it to be pure legend. While wikipedia may have no room for a man who was never born, we certainly do record myths and folklore that achieve particular popularity. This one has obviously circulated for hundreds of years (see, Eyre Empire). Also, keep in mind, while there is no clear historical precedent to prove his existence, there is also nothing with which to disprove it. No premise for deletion. Maybe relist as, "Legend of Truelove Eyre." History 21</p>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> - A google search for "Truelove Eyre" produces utterly nothing. I suspect it is in fact a vanity (if you can call it that) page written by an "Eyre", or whoever owns the page it links to - a "fictional genealogy" if you will. Complete rubbish, and a hoax. And to comment on the points the user "History 21" raises - "while there is no clear historical precedent to prove his existence, there is also nothing with which to disprove it". Well, I'm not a historian, but perhaps you'd care to tell me how William the Conqueror granted Truelove "significant lands in Ireland", when we wasn't in control of Ireland at the time? <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick04_a2be.html" title="User:Nick04">Nick04</a> 22:28, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</s></li>

<p>Nick04, google has no hits for Truelove Eyre, but yahoo does (quite a few actually). You should always try BOTH engines when doing a search, especially if you can't find anything on google at first. Secondly, Truelove Eyre's existence or nonexistence is COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT. Only the legend ITSELF is relevant, as it is widely well known tale in Britain. If there was a widely known "Legend of the Bat Boy," I expect that wikipedia would have an article on it. "In 19th Century Romania, a false but highly believable story circulated...blah blah blah...this folklore has become a part of Romanian history and lives on to this day." You get the picture. The story itself is famous, that's what matters. But just as an aside, the Gaelic name for Ireland is, "Eire." That's no coincidence. Go to yahoo. History21</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> thank you, Nick04, but I'm serious about what I said.</p>

<p>I know that I don't get to vote twice, I was just emphasizing what I had said before. You all don't seem to understand what I'm saying here: nothing about Truelove Eyre is verifiable. But the fact that a legend surrounds him IS verifiable. It is the LEGEND that we are reporting. For all I know, William the Conqueror could have falled from his horse because he saw a shiny coin on the ground--I DON'T CARE. The story, however, is a significant part of folklore and should be shown on wikipedia. It is made perfectly clear in the article that the story is largely thought to be myth. <b>History21</b></p>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Delete</b>. Even legends are verifiable: you can verify that people believed them at the time. This has not been done for Truelove Eyre.

<li>Okay, I'm a registered Wiki user with hundreds of edits to my name. I have no vote on this issue yet; I'd just like to provide some actual Google hits here, so as to clarify that this is <i><b>NOT NONSENSE</b></i>. It may not be <i>notable</i>, but it's not nonsense, okay? Sheesh. Note that many of these are for "Truelove who was henceforth called Ayre/Eyre", or similar phrasings. <a href="http://www.standard.net.au/~daneyre/Histeyre.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.standard.net.au/~daneyre/Histeyre.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.last-names.net/surname.asp?surname=Ayres" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.last-names.net/surname.asp?surname=Ayres" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://www.vmb-collection.com/A&amp;DPages/AandDP20.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vmb-collection.com/A&amp;DPages/AandDP20.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://www.meddows-taylor.com/Eyre.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.meddows-taylor.com/Eyre.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://www.cholet.us/Family%20Tree%20Index%20Pages/ayres_tree.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cholet.us/Family%20Tree%20Index%20Pages/ayres_tree.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/pa/bucks/history/local/davis/davis15.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/pa/bucks/history/local/davis/davis15.txt" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> (a 100-year-old transcript which refers to "True Love" instead of "Truelove"), <a href="http://www.trueloves.info/history.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.trueloves.info/history.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> (a history of the family name 'Truelove', and how it's associated with Eyre), and <a href="http://superjordans-home.com/MariahsAncestors/a23.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://superjordans-home.com/MariahsAncestors/a23.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.

This would explain why "Truelove Eyre" gets no Google hits. Does this sound reasonable to anyone else? <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoobaz_6eee.html" title="User:Foobaz"><font color="green">Foobaz</font></a>·<a href="../../../f/o/o/User_talk%7EFoobaz_50d5.html" title="User talk:Foobaz"><font color="brown">✐</font></a> 06:05, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In medieval Europe people didn't really have surnames. They were indentified by their occupation (e.g. "John the Smith"), their location (e.g. "John of York") or their nickname (e.g. "Edmund Ironsides"). "Eyre" was just a nickname. "Truelove" may have been another nickname: it certainly sounds like one. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">GeorgeStepanek</a>\<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeStepanek_0414.html" title="User talk:GeorgeStepanek"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 21:36, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One cannot verify the Truelove Eyre legend without thus verifying the Eyre Empire itself, as it is said to have stemmed from him. Therefore, I counsel patience and caution before recklessly acquiescing to the validity of either article. 168.184.90.11 (<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168.184.90.11.html" title="User talk:168.184.90.11">talk</a> · <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_168.184.90.11_1928.html" title="Special:Contributions/168.184.90.11">contributions</a>)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Obviously, this is at best a legend, and it doesn't seem to be a notable legend at that, as a google search reveals. Furthermore, a legend which people insist 'may be true' is what is generally called a hoax or, when pressed, a conspiracy theory. There is no verifiable fact at all in the article as it stands, even after the edits. This Truelove is <i>not</i> mentioned by anyone (that I was able to find) as the founder of the Ayre or Eyre families, and the <a href="http://www.allfamilycrests.com/e/eyre-family-crest-coat-of-arms.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.allfamilycrests.com/e/eyre-family-crest-coat-of-arms.shtml" rel="nofollow">Eyre family crest</a> does <i>not</i> feature a leg in armor. Finally, to say that 'historians cannot definitively confirm whether or not Truelove actually existed' gives his legend far too much credit; historians actually appear not to care at all. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquibix_398c.html" title="User:Squibix">Squibix</a> 19:08, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I have rephrased these statement to better reflect the references. I have also listed the eight references that <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> found, which appear to be independent of each other at least back to 1900, if not earlier. If it is a hoax or a conspiracy, then it's a very old one, and certainly nothing to do with the Eyre Empire nonsense (although it has been a bit of a job removing that author's ludicrous inventions). I urge you to take a look at the references, and reconsider your position. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">GeorgeStepanek</a>\<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeStepanek_0414.html" title="User talk:GeorgeStepanek"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 03:18, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - At worst this is a hoax that has managed to confuse some of the editors voting above. At best it's horribly nonnotable and unverifiable. Either way it doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 01:00, Mar 5, 2005 (UTC)

<li>How can you say that it is "unverifiable" if you haven't taken a look at the references? I am getting rather frustrated with opinions like this, that clearly been made only on the most cursory examination of the evidence at hand. Please read the article closely, compare it to the source texts, and then (if you are still unconvinced) provide a <i>reasoned</i> explanation of why you think this subject is invalid. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">GeorgeStepanek</a>\<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeStepanek_0414.html" title="User talk:GeorgeStepanek"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 00:34, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>George, have you compared Eyre Empire and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Eyre_Empire_5f98.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Eyre Empire">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Eyre Empire</a>? THAT is why people want this nonsense deleted. The whole thing is of a piece. It's all a hoax. This person, even if he were a real person, does not qualify for an encyclopedia article, And are you REALLY trying to claim that Ireland got its name because of a person whose last name was Eyre? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 00:55, Mar 6, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/r/u/Truelove_Eyre_0858.html" title="Truelove Eyre">Truelove Eyre</a>, as I have rewritten it, does not state that Ireland got its name from a man named Eyre. It is not "of a piece" with Eyre Empire. Forget Eyre Empire. I have <b>totally rewritten</b> the article based on a significant number of independent, verifiable references. Please address your comments to those references, and to the article as it stands. Can you not see how much of a logical fallacy it is to say "article A is rubbish, therefore article B should be deleted" if articles A and B have different authors? I am now the author of <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truelove_Eyre_0858.html" title="Truelove Eyre">Truelove Eyre</a>, not the <s>idiot</s> person who wrote Eyre Empire. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">GeorgeStepanek</a>\<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeStepanek_0414.html" title="User talk:GeorgeStepanek"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 01:28, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Those links you gave above are personal pages and sites that allow the gneral public to add info about their families. There's nothing authoritative about them that would make them reliable sources, and they seem like a relatively easy way to slip bogus family history out onto the web. But even if this were true, it's not encyclopedic material. It's completely and utterly nonnotable, and even if you give it the benefit of the doubt there, it's fringe nature added to the very real likelihood that someone is out there pulling your leg and we have an article that needs to be removed. Sorry you took time rewriting something so insignificant, but that was your choice and I don't think editors here should vote to keep it just because you trust those Internet sites you went to and rewrote something that undeniably started as a hoax article. The submitter wants you to believe that Ireland was named after his ancestor for crying out loud... can you say "untrustworthy source"? And is it really so hard for you to believe that if that person took the time to post the hoax articles here that he didn;t do the same on those personal pages and geneology sites that let people claim whatever they want about their families? Come on. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 19:39, Mar 6, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry, but your assertion that these "sites that allow the general public to add info about their families" <i>is simply not true.</i> <a href="http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/pa/bucks/history/local/davis/davis15.txt" class="external text" title="http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/pa/bucks/history/local/davis/davis15.txt" rel="nofollow">This</a>, for example, is the Chapter 15 of <i>"The History of Bucks County, Pennsylvania from the discovery of the Delaware to the present time by W.W.H. Davis, 1876 and 1905 editions"</i> which runs to over 15,000 words (not to mention the other 54 chapters). The idea that someone has simply invented this mass of material is, frankly, ludicrous. Have you even bothered to take a look at these sources? <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> is correct in pointing out that the story is apocryphal, but it is a centuries-old legend, not something that a contemporary individual has put together. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">GeorgeStepanek</a>\<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeStepanek_0414.html" title="User talk:GeorgeStepanek"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 21:40, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
