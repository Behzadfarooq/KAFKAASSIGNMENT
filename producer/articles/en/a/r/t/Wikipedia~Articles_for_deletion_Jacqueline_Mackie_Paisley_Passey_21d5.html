<li><b>Comment</b> Be careful yourself of what constitutes a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. A blog post may not be a reliable source for information about Passey, but citing that blog post <i>is</i> a reliable source for the fact that there have been blog posts about her. As <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states, the definition of "published work" is left deliberately broad, and the literally dozens of bloggers who have published material pertaining to Passey ought to establish notability. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 19:13, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As the author I take some offense at the claim that the article is "essentially a defamation"; as written there was no defamatory intent and I was careful to adhere to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

As for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, it's easy to find multiple non-trivial published works of which she is the subject; if nothing else there have been dozens of commentaries written about the blog post detailed in the "controversy" section. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 19:13, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It seems to me that a blog post shouldn't qualify as a non-trivial published work. It's not exactly a very stringent 'publishing' process. Should I be able to open up a bunch of Blogger accounts and make myself notable? <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubSeven_abca.html" title="User:SubSeven">SubSeven</a> 21:16, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> When the blog posts in question are on blogs like Marginal Revolution and written by folks like Harvard Economist Greg Mankiw, does the fact that publishing is done online necessarily make it trivial?</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Even if you open a bunch of Blogger accounts, you can't make yourself notable, because you're neither multiple sources nor independent of the subject. If, however, thirty bloggers write articles about <i>you</i>, that is a strong indicator of notability. Of course, bad faith would have to be taken into consideration... but there's certainly more than enough evidence to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> on the part of the bloggers who wrote about Passey and believe that they wrote about her because they thought she was notable. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 01:54, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I mean that I'd be posing as thirty different people. There is not really anything to prevent this. And even ignoring those kinds of possiblities, I can't accept a blog post as an indicator of notability. Blogs have absolutely no publishing standards (nor should they). Plenty of bloggers are part of circles of friends that regularly talk about each other's exploits. Certainly a few buddies writing about each other can't make them notable to the world. <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubSeven_abca.html" title="User:SubSeven">SubSeven</a> 13:54, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> I realize that you'd be posing as thirty people. This again goes to the notability criteria being <i>guidelines</i>... not policies, not laws. If your article is up for deletion and you want to claim that you meet the notability criteria because of your mention on thirty different blogs, people could choose to discount that evidence based on suspicion that those thirty different blogs aren't really "multiple" sources, nor really "independent" of the subject. Are you suggesting that that is the case with the multiple blog mentions of Passey? It seems highly unlikely, considering that 1) most of the published works on blogs regarding Passey are hardly complimentary and 2) many of the published works are on well-known, large blogs, which aren't likely to allow themselves to be used as sockpuppets.</li>

<dd>As far as blogs having "no publishing standards"... technically, neither do newspapers nor magazines nor any other media outlets. Anybody is free to publish whatever he wants. I can start my own newspaper and put whatever the heck I want in it; it's a free country. But <i>respected</i> blogs, just like respected mainstream media outlets, make an effort <i>not</i> to publish works on non-notable subjects.</dd>
<dd>Certainly a few buddies writing about each other doesn't establish notability. But just as certainly, a person who is the subject of articles on Kos, Huffington, Malkin, and Powerline <i>is</i> most likely notable, regardless of whether the New York Times deigns to take notice. Discarding blogs entirely as an indicator of notability makes no more sense than automatically accepting any mention on any blog as an indicator of notability. But even so, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> as it is written today certainly includes blogs; it explicitly excludes other things but not blogs, and it specifically emphasizes that the definition of "published work" is left extremely broad. If you want, you can argue that Passey is not notable, and you can argue that the cited works do not prove notability. But you can't legitimately argue that she doesn't meet the guideline <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, because she plainly does. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 19:18, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I realize that I'm not disinterested, having invested the time to actually <i>write</i> this article, but I think too many people are kneejerking on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. In the first place, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuidelines_ac33.html#Guidelines" title="Wikipedia:Guidelines">guideline</a>, not a policy. That an article fails a notability guideline would be a reason to consider the article's merit, not an ironclad mandate to delete. Quoting from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> itself:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted.</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>(boldface in original)</dd>
<dd>In the second place, Passey meets WP:BIO besides. The very <i>first</i> criterion for notability:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Okay, so what's a published work? The guideline continues:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>This criterion includes published works in <b>all forms</b>, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries (2) except for the following: (two criteria which do not apply to Passey).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>(2): What constitutes a "published work" is deliberately broad.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>A blog post is surely a published work in <i>some</i> form. And several of the blogs which published articles on Passey are big, well-known blogs with massive readership. Heck, some probably attract more eyeballs than most major newspapers.</dd>
<dd>Maybe blog posts should be specifically excluded from the category of "published works" in WP:BIO. But as of now, they're not. Passey meets the notability guidelines spelled out in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and this article should not be deleted.</dd>
<dd>I'll add that this article has been the target of repeated vandalism, mostly by anonymous IPs. I'll keep an eye on it and prevent it from happening again. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 01:54, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Excellent additions, which make clear the subject meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> even if you <i>don't</i> count blogs as published works. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 06:34, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> can you tell us how substantial those newspaper articles are? Do they just mention her name in passing, or are they entirely about JMMP? The headlines don't mention her anyway. I found the <i>Seattle Times</i> article <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002042747_blogosphere22.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002042747_blogosphere22.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, in my opinion it doesn't really count as a substantial reference, because it's primarily not about her â€” she only gets a few paragraphs. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 09:25, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Neither article is entirely about her, no. But she gets a couple of paragraphs, and the quotes I added. Basically she's given as one of a couple of examples of people with notable blogs. The Seattle Times article is about how blogs can affect politics, and the Toronto Star article is about using blogs to start relationships. She's cited in both as an example of the point about blgos that the article is trying to make. --<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxamegalon2000_b578.html" title="User:Maxamegalon2000">Maxamegalon2000</a> 15:34, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Umm, the bit that says, "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person."

<li><b>Comment</b> From <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>: "Non-triviality is a measure of the depth of content of a published work, and how far removed that content is from a simple directory entry or a mention in passing that does not discuss the subject in detail." It specifically draws the examples of a birth certificate or a single ballot line as trivia. Other examples of trivia: "newspaper articles that just mention the person in passing, telephone directory listings, or simple records of births and deaths." Published works focused primarily on the subject are not trivial, even if they take the form of blog posts. Even if you disagree, do you think the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Star_41f5.html" title="Toronto Star">Toronto Star</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle_Times_a494.html" title="Seattle Times">Seattle Times</a> are also trivial publications? <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 00:19, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
