<p><br />
The <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_1812.html" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a> was a well-known war between the country of Great Britain, and the colonies of Britain (also called the thirteen colonies), situated in what is now the <b>United States of America</b>. They broke off of subjection to Britain in order to become an independant country. Britain was not worried with them, seeing their forces as insignificant. Britain was more interested in protecting the land that they had obtained in the north, in the region of what is now called Canada. The Thirteen Colonies, in the mean time, were furious at their lack of attention by Britain. The English simply did not see them as a people deserving respect. In addition, the British were blocking trading ports belonging to the Thirteen Colonis, and refusing to allow goods to pass through! The Thirteen Colonies decided to revolt. Soldiers from the colonies, called <b>Patriots</b>, attacked the British soldiers. Both sides underestimated the power of their opponents. Britain, hoping to march in and overtake the Patriots, were taken by surprise because of their sturdy defense, and forced to retreat. The Thirteen Colonies soon realized they had their own problem to contend with. Many of the people living there were not willing to fight against Britain, their home country. These were called Loyalists, meaning that they were loyal to Britain. Many of the <b>Loyalists</b> were expelled from the Thirteen Colonies, and some went to British territory up north (Canada), while others returned to Britain. This was the cause of this war, which ended in the year 1814. The last battle, however, took place in January of the year 1815. For further information on the war, such as the Battle of Queenston Heights, please refer to another article.</p>

<p>Fal-Tor-Pan is a Vulcan ceremony in the science fiction tv series Star Trek. It is a very dangerous procedure and consists of reuniting a vulcans mind, or katra, with his/hers body. This may be necesary if the Vulcan has performed a mind meld with someone and placed their Katra in that persons body. Spock did this to Dr McCoy before he entered the radiation chamber in order to give himself a chance to live in Star Trek II The Wrath Of Khan. This ceremony was then seen at the end of Star Trek III The Search For Spock. On this occasion it was succesful but it is a very risky procedure.</p>

<p>GU Comics is a single panel webcomic written and drawn by Woody Hearn. Published five times a week on its own web site, it features comics based on various online video games such as World of Warcraft, City of Heroes, EverQuest, EverQuest II, Dark Age of Camelot, PlanetSide, Star Wars: Galaxies, and so on. It also comments on gaming community news. The comic also features the adventures of Hearn and his fictional roommate, Ted, and often parodies contemporary social, political, and personal issues related to the online and general video game world. Driven as it is by happenings in the video game world, continuity of the story line is not important, but it does have a few recurring themes. Strips are usually presented in a large format and in full color. The first strip was published on July 10, 2000</p>

<p>GU is not a long-term storyline-based comic, instead featuring single, stand-alone comics or short, three-to-four-comic storylines. However, there are several characters, based off of real-life persons or characters in various online video games (called Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games, or MMORPGs), that do make regular appearances in the comic. These characters include:</p>
<p>Woody- a fictionalized version of Woody Hearn himself, almost always drawn with his characteristic orange ballcap. (introduced: September 1, 2000) Ted Prescott- The fictional roommate of Woody who has often been described as Wood’s id given form. He is notorious for his obsession with all things game-related, as well as his conflicts with a sleep-deprivation-created hallucinatory monkey that he swears is real. (introduced: September 1, 2000) Vhah- Woody’s Everquest character, a barbarian warrior who is used to portray the many aspects of the game from the character’s perspective (introduced: July 10, 2000, strip 1, but not named till much later) Toast- Probably one of the most famous of GU’s characters, Toast is a troll from Dark Age of Camelot who is most known for uttering his catch-phrase “Toast Smish” as he breaks something, whether intentional or not (introduced: July 3, 2003) Monkey- The product of Ted’s sleep-deprived imagination, Monkey is often the scapegoat which Ted blames for the many gaming-caused sleep-deprivation oddities of behavior he engages in (introduced: December 30, 2003) The Zapper- While not a character in the traditional sense, the Zapper is the central figure in a series of comics which feature failed games and even entire development companies, flying into a giant bug zapper in the form of insects (introduced: August 31, 2004) The Gamer Girls- A pair of female gamers used when Woody wants to provide a slightly different perspective on current events in gaming. (introduced: March 9, 2000) Iggy McStickson- The stick figure character which replaces a standard comic in times of technical difficulty, sickness, or other such problems (introduced: October 1, 2000) Frank- When the perspective is a mob's point of view from any of the games Woody depicts, the characters name almost always is Frank. ED-209- Woody's cat, who pops up every once in a while to wreak havoc and pursue cat like activities, such as the destruction of the human race. (introduced: October 13, 2004) Caesar- Woody's dog, forming a sketchy alliance with the cat, only to bring about the sure doom of all bipedal animals and eats socks. (introduced: January 18, 2006)</p>

<p>GU Comics has featured costume contests for its readers for Halloween, unofficial gatherings at various conventions, gaming trade shows, and the Texas Renaissance Festival. Woody Hearn was one of a group of EverQuest community leaders who were instrumental in the Sony Online Entertainment Community Summit in which a great deal of the changes initiated in Everquest and, later, EverQuest II were hammered out. In addition, Hearn has been invited to review the development of and write NDA-friendly reviews of various games, including Vanguard: Saga of Heroes. This has often been the first glimpse at upcoming games for many players, who respect Hearn’s opinion as it is considered to be fair and relatively unbiased. In addition, GU Comics was among the many game-based webcomics who took on anti-videogame campaigner and lawyer Jack Thompson through a combination of parodies in several comics, and raising awareness within the gaming community of the activities of Mr. Thompson.</p>

<p>"Congress creates agencies through statutes called enabling legislation. In general, an enabling statute delegates to the agency congressional legislative power for the purpose of serving the “public interest, convenience, and necessity.” Armed with this mandate, the administrative agency can issue rules that control individual and business behavior. In many instances, such rules carry criminal as well as civil penalties."</p>

Sponsored Reserves are a category of reserve forces in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Armed_Forces_f475.html" title="British Armed Forces">British Armed Forces</a>, created by the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Reserve_Forces_Act_%281996%29_0400.html" title="Reserve Forces Act (1996)">Reserve Forces Act (1996)</a> in order to allow certain support tasks to be carried out by trained professionals. These are tasks that must be carried out by service personnel in war time and other higher risk operations but can be carried out by civilians in peace time operations. For example flight attendants on personnel transport flights generally do not need to be military unless the area being flown into is dangerous, or weather information at home stations can be provided by civilians but in theatre information will still be required so the people that provide such information must be in the armed forces. These roles would be uneconomic to staff with military personnel and so having reserves prevents front line troops being pulled off operations to perform second or third line jobs.</p>
<p>Members of the reserve units undergo training to allow them to function as members of the force while in theatre and while deployed they are subject to the rules and regulations, and all other conditions, of regular service life. This allows for the specialist knowledge to be provided by uniformed personnel.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

Harry Sylvester was an American short-story writer and novelist in the first-half of the 20th century. His stories were published in popular magazines such as <i>Colliers, Esquire</i> and <i>Commonweal</i>, publishing over 150 short stories. Some of his stories were published in a collection entitled All Your Idols in 1948 and in several other short story anthologies. Among his novels were <i>Dearly Beloved</i> (1942), <i>Dayspring</i> (1945) and <i>Moon Gaffney</i> (1947). Sylvester was born in Brooklyn, NY in 1908 and went to Notre Dame, playing football for Knute Rockne (many of his short stories were about sports), graduating in 1930 with a degree in journalism. He soon found work as a correspondent for the <i>New York Evening Post</i> and a reporter for the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i>. By mid-century, he was considered to be a very promising writer in Catholic circles but by the time of his death in 1993 he was virtually forgotten. It should be noted that he heavily criticized the Catholic hierarchy in several of his novels and dedicated Moon Gaffney to a group of "good Catholic radicals." He eventually renounced his faith and, with his second wife, became a Quaker. He didn't write a novel after 1950 and worked for the US Information service for twenty years, spending the last 40 years of his life in the Washington DC area. His novel <i>Dayspring</i> was inspired by his trips to New Mexico. The University of New Mexico, University Libraries, Center for Southwest Research has a collection of bibliographic material and book reviews by and about Sylvester (and Willa Cather). However, his complete papers are housed in Georgetown University Library's Special Collections, and include correspondence, manuscripts and an unpublished work, "Watch in the Night."</p>
<p>Trivia: In the March 2007 edition of the journal <i>First Things</i>,in an article by Philip Jenkins entitled "Who is Harry Sylvester" it is mentioned that "he lacks even the minimal fame of a Wikipedia entry."</p>

<p>Caban Coch Dam is part of the Elan Valley Resevoirs and is one of four dams built along the Elan Valley river. Caban Coch is the lowest dam, situated at the bottom end of the valley, and is also the smallest standing at 123ft (37.49m) in height. The dam helps to supply the water treatment works with water but it's main purpose is to control the flow of the Elan River which later joins the River Wye in nearby Rhayadar.</p>
<p>The design of the dam is simple but funtional and when the Caban Coch Resevoir is full, the water cascades over the top of the dam to create what is described as a magnificent waterfall.</p>

<p>Born into a family whose name is synonymous with musical genius, Luca Mancini's chosen career path stems more from the love and passion he personally has for music, than that out of paternal obligation. Born March 1988 in Santa Monica of Musician Chris Mancini and a Swedish supermodel formerly known as "LA Legs". There were no expectations of musical success for the new born Mancini, growing up in and around the industry's Los Angeles finest, but what was to come of the young man was anything but anticipated.</p>
<p>The Mancini legacy started first with Lucas' grandfather, the legendary <a href="../../../c/o/m/Composer.html" title="Composer">composer</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Conductor.html" title="Conductor">conductor</a> <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Mancini_2746.html" title="Henry Mancini">Henry Mancini</a>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Mancini" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Mancini" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>].<br />
He held the record for:</p>
<p>-Winning the most Grammy's and Oscar's combined.<br />
[20 Grammy's &amp; 4 Academy Awards]<br />
-Unprecedented 72 Grammy Nominations<br /></p>
<p>However, the musical background surely does not rest there. Renowned jazz vocalist/patron of the arts Grandmother Ginny, and followed by his acclaimed Grammy Nominated concert performing vocalist Aunt Monica. His accomplished writer-producer Father Chris wrote and co-produced his own album for Atlantic Records, "No Strings" in 1983, where the quality in his voice had then been compared to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Perry_d1bb.html" title="Steve Perry">Steve Perry</a>. Luca's decision to follow down a course rich in musical history and philanthropy appears on its face to be logical, yet if you consider the pressure of filling not just one set of shoes, but two previous generations of such musical accomplishments, one might rethink his position.</p>
<p>Luca Mancini discovered his own talent after singing in a Los Angeles Recording Studio. He was singing along to another vocalist, when unexpectedly, the studio producer suddenly turned his head towards the new sound he heard and the voice he showed express interest in. Luca Mancini began working with this very man; Multi-Platinum hit Songwriter-Producer, Richard Podolor (<a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Dog_Night_8a3e.html" title="Three Dog Night">Three Dog Night</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steppenwolf.html" title="Steppenwolf">Steppenwolf</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Eagles_1c5c.html" title="The Eagles">The Eagles</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ella_Fitzgerald_7216.html" title="Ella Fitzgerald">Ella Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen.html" title="Queen">Queen</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santana.html" title="Santana">Santana</a>). Innovative in his day, 52 million records sold, and the first record producer to achieve Platinum-Selling status. He nearly let Luca finish and interrupted; <i>"Now that’s a chart-topping voice!"</i> Luca Mancini welcomes this challenge and is committed to carry on and preserve the Mancini family legacy for generations to come, while at the same time make his own mark on the entertainment industry utilizing the inborn talents, passion, and work ethic he has been blessed with.</p>
<p>Luca Mancini, singer-songwriter, musician, budding producer, and visionary has is eyes set on a prize that is ripe and within his reach. With a cunning and creative ear for both music and the business of music, Luca has developed and carved out a hybrid niche that is self-described as <i>"Pop music that defies the genre"</i>. Left with Podolor's mentoring, Luca sets out to collaborate with other producers to create and develop his new sound as his unique styling evolves.</p>
<p>Luca's approach to his cutting-edge, new breed of Pop emanated from his desire to create, foster and disseminate music that reflects his own eclectic taste and the forethought that today's listening audience has had it's fill of the norm and mundane, same 'ol recycled format/marketing driven music that continues to be distributed to the masses. In today's marketplace where America shouts that it wants substance, Luca has honed in on the desires of the young "downloading generation", as well the discerning ears of the savvy listening public at large. Luca stands poised and ready to fulfill and satisfy the needs of the modern consumer and pounce upon the gap left wide open in the industry.</p>
<p>Luca states, <i>"I have never felt any pressure growing up in my family to be a musician, I'm doing this because it’s me; It is what I want for my life"</i>. With microphone in hand, dancing shoes laced up, guitar at the ready, and advocating the charity he believes in, Luca unselfishly prepares for this opportunity to share his gift of performing on the worlds stages before an international audience.</p>
<p><i>"I'm so happy to finally be able to step into my own skin. Sure, music is in my blood, but for me it's rather feeling a deeper connection with the music. It's not a matter of obligation or just because I happen to be a Mancini. The bonds that tie us to the love of music wasn't blood... it was our own independent heart and soul"</i></p>

<p>Swyer James Mcleod's Syndrome is a rare lung disorder found by Physicians Paul Robert Swyer, William Mathiseon Macleod and Radiologist George James in the 1950's in the United States. At the same time J. Bret was exploring this illness in France, hence sometimes it is referred to as Brett's syndrome.</p>
<p>In appearance Swyer James normally leaves shadowing in a CT scan in the upper lobar regions of one or (rarely) both lungs. Patients with the illness operate in much the same way as patients with mild bronchiectasis. As a result the illness can go undiagnosed for some time. With current developments in the pharmaceutical industry prognosis for suffers of the illness is good, sufferers can lead normally and healthy lives- particular attention must be paid to the new development of Erdosteine from Italy, which is becoming increasingly available across the world.</p>

<p>The Leedstown Resolves, a document declaring the early dissatisfaction of Virginia colonists with the Stamp Act was drafted by Richard Henry Lee and signed by citizens of Westmoreland County at Leedstown on February 27, 1766; and in 1608, when Captain John Smith and a small party explored the Rappahannock River, Leedstown was the small village home of King Passassack and the Rappahannock Indian tribe; settlers were attacked by the Indians and one of the men, Richard Featherstone, was killed and buried on the south side of the Rappahannock River, a few miles below Leedstown.</p>
<p>Leedstown was located in Westmoreland County, the boyhood home of George Washington, and by 1678, Edward Bray had built a brick church, a tavern ordinary, a ferry, and a wharf at what was then known as the village of Rappahannock named after the river; the town went through several names, including Bray’s Wharf, Bray’s Church, and Leeds.</p>
<p>Leedstown became a thriving colonial port and was officially established by an Act of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1742, but the town is best known for the resolutions that were drafted there in 1766 when a very early spark of revolution was ignited by Westmoreland's prominent and influential planters.</p>
<p>In 1765, the Stamp Act, which laid a stamp duty on all papers used for legal documents, liquor licenses, academic degrees, newspapers, pamphlets and almanacs, was imposed on the colonists by British Parliament to raise revenue for King George II of England; the Act greatly angered the colonists, who considered it "taxation without representation". Arthur Ritchie, a Tappahannock merchant, announced that he possessed stamped paper he planned to use to clear his own cargo ship bound for the West Indies. Thomas Ludwell Lee invited his neighbors to meet at Leedstown to make plans to stop Mr. Ritchie from acting on his own, and 115 patriots signed the resolutions drafted in Leedstown petitioning King George II to do away with the hated Stamp Act. The Leedstown Resolves were discussed and signed by the impassioned patriots, who met in the town church or the tavern built by Robert Bray, it is not entirely clear which one, on February 27, 1766</p>
<p>The historic signing of the Leedstown Resolves is immortalized with a tablet on the walls of the Westmoreland County courthouse at Montross, and a Northern Neck historian recorded that “here in the clerks office are recorded writings of ancestors of more statesmen that we can find in all county clerk’s offices of any state outside of Virginia. On the walls of the courtroom hang portraits of more men of national fame—native sons of the county—than we can find at any other county seat in America” The original Leedstown Resolves manuscript is believed to be in Richard Henry Lee’s handwriting and is preserved by the Virginia Historical Society; remnants of the historic buildings where the patriots met remained until around 1932;</p>
<p>The Leedstown Resolves preceded the similar documents of the Mecklenburg and Tyron Resolves, allegedly signed in 1775 in North Carolina, by more than nine years; and it preceded the drafting of America's Declaration of Independence, signed on July 4, 1776, by more than 10 years</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-02-14_81e6.html" title="Edit section: Judge Matthew Jasen, NY Court of Appeals">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Judge Matthew Jasen, NY Court of Appeals</span></h2>
<p>Judge Matthew Jasen was a judge on the New York Court of Appeals from 1967-1985. The NY Court of Appeals is the highest court in the state of New York. Judge Jasen wrote many opinions during his tenure, and although many have considered his views to be too liberal, Judge Jasen's jurisprudence and commitment to uphold the constitutions of NY and the United States was rarely questioned. Argueably, Judge Jasen's most important opinion came from his dissent to a criminal case, in People v. Register. In Register, a drunk defendent acted recklessly in killing another. The defendent was convicted of second-degree murder, under a subsection of NY Penal Law 125.25 which states that one who acts recklessly with a depraved indifference to human life is guilty of murder. In a 4-to-3 vote, the NY Court of Appeals convicted the defendant of murder, based largely on a reading of the statute which held acting recklessly to be a sufficient culpable mental state for a murder conviction. It rejected the interpretation that the depraved indifference element suggested that a defendant must act with a higher culpable mental state than mere recklessness. Instead, it viewed the depraved indifference element to refer to the circumstances of the crime only. In his dissent, Judge Jasen took the opposite stance. He wrote that the depraved indifference element of the statute does evince the need for a higher culpable mental state than recklessness for a murder conviction. The NY Court of Appeals would come to embrace Judge Jasen's dissent in a 2006 case, People v. Feingold. Largely using Judge Jasen's reasoning, NY now requires a higher culpable mental state than recklessness for a murder conviction, using the depraved indifference subsection of NY Penal Law 125.25. Although the issue was not specifically addressed in Feingold, that the NY Court of Appeals almost wholly adopted Judge Jasen's Register dissent suggests that being intoxicated may be an acceptable defense to negative a culpable mental state under the depraved indifference murder subsection. Unfortunately, Judge Jasen never got to see his dissent embraced during his tenure on the court. The reason this reversal is so pivotal is because now NY State could not gain a murder conviction for defendents who did not act intentionally.</p>

<p>Lenin Jimmy Avigliano Hernandez Junior was born in Jersey City, New Jersey. He was born to a Ecuadorian father and an Italian mother. At a very young age Lenin moved with his parents to Charlotte, North Carolina where his brother and sister were born. Lenins first job was as a waiter at Embassy Suits where he was fired for hitting another employ in the head with a metal serving tray. Later that night a potato gun loaded with dog fiecies was shot at his car. The poop shot like a missle denting the back of his van. For more information and an accurate description of Lenin Hernandez please vist <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=choad" class="external free" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=choad" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=choad</a>.</p>
