<dl>
<dd>I did not make the decision in this case, but I affirm that the admin that redirected made the right decision. VfD decisions are not made on the basis of strict numerical voting. Furthermore, you cannot determine consensus by simple percentages for a single choice when you have multiple possibilities. It is almost impossible to get a 2/3 vote when you have at three or more choices.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Admins are given leeway to determine consensus and it can be a thankless job. Yet consensus has been demonstrated. There were 31 votes to remove this as a stand-alone article; there were 13 votes to keep it; that is 70%+ support for content removal. I'm well aware that there is an intentional bias toward non-deletion on Wikipedia; however, for the article's supporters there is the point that accurate content can be merged into the target article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For the admin to have taken the middle course of leaving the article name as a redirect is consistent with maintaining the spirit of consensus, since there is significant support for this, as there were 26 votes to either keep or direct the article. One thing I might have done differently would have been to redirect withour protection, since protection is frowned upon. However, if non-protection led to vandalism I would then have protected it. However, that last is just my 2c; I'm not second-guessing. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 15:37, 23 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Decision_Policy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Decision_Policy" rel="nofollow">guidelines</a> state that if after 5 days of voting there is no consensus for Deletion, the page should remain. There was no consensus to delete after 5 days (September 19), and there isn't one now either. Lobbying around and keeping this vote open does not seem to be productive (and is not endorsed by rules). So, let's close this VfD and move onto providing a balanced article on the subject. HistoryBuffEr 19:30, 2004 Sep 22 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Consensus" generally means that 2/3 of the people involved think Deletion (or some similar remedy) is required. We have been at that 2/3 stage at several points in the discussion; perhaps we should just delete and re-direct, and work on balancing the original <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel-Palestinian_conflict_7006.html" title="Israel-Palestinian conflict">Israel-Palestinian conflict</a> article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 19:45, 22 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Wrong, "Delete" means <b>delete</b>, not "Redirect". A Deleted article no longer appears in the index, a Redirected one does. The rules do not state that "Redirect" is similar to "Delete"; in fact "Redirect" is not even mentioned as a remedy under VfD. If you insist we can submit this point to Arbitration. HistoryBuffEr 20:01, 2004 Sep 22 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, that's part of what the discussion is about. 2/3 of the voters don't want to keep it, that's pretty clear; i.e. the contents go away, perhaps to be POVd and incorporated in some way into the original article that <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation_of_Palestine_cc9f.html" title="Occupation of Palestine">Occupation of Palestine</a> was originally intended to be a POV fork of. And the net effect is pretty much the same; few people refer to the index. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 20:18, 22 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Wrong again; "Go away" is not a remedy under VfD rules either. The only remedy under VfD is <b>delete</b>, therefore only "delete" votes count. HistoryBuffEr 20:21, 2004 Sep 22 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm pretty sure all those people who voted "re-direct" feel differently. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 20:32, 22 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As one of those who voted delete, I'd just like to record my complete disagreement with this. I think Ed has the right idea. By far the best solution to POV is to create an NPOV article on the same subject. Ed has seen, as I did not, that there <b>is</b> a valid topic that belongs under the title <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation_of_Palestine_cc9f.html" title="Occupation of Palestine">Occupation of Palestine</a>. Not surprisingly, such an article will please neither extreme, as it puts things into their true historical context, and thus serves neither side of the propaganda war. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 01:37, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The NPOV article which belongs under the title <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation_of_Palestine_cc9f.html" title="Occupation of Palestine">Occupation of Palestine</a> is the re-direct to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel-Palestinian_conflict_7006.html" title="Israel-Palestinian conflict">Israel-Palestinian conflict</a>. Ed's view creates the absurd scenario in which every single country which has ever controlled Palestine is an "occupier". Will we now have sub-articles on Canaanite Occupation of Palestine, Philistine Occupation of Palestine, Israelite Occupation of Palestine, Ancient Egyptian Occupation of Palestine, Assyrian Occupation of Palestine, Babylonian Occupation of Palestine, Greek Occupation of Palestine, Roman Occupation of Palestine, Byzantine Occupation of Palestine, Arab Occupation of Palestine, Turkish Occupation of Palestine, Mameluke Occupation of Palestine, British Occupation of Palestine, Syrian Occupation of Palestine, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_Occupation_of_Palestine_f0bd.html" title="Israeli Occupation of Palestine">Israeli Occupation of Palestine</a>, Modern Egyptian Occupation of Palestine, Jordanian Occupation of Palestine, and Palestinian Authority Occupation of Palestine? Who decides when Palestine is "occupied" and when it is not? Or is Palestine a region which can only be "occupied", and never actually just be part of a country? The whole notion of this "improvement" is idiotic. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 02:16, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Anonymous editor 66.93.166.174 originally replaced the contents of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> with his own highly POV view of this conflict. This replacement was reverted by a number of different admins; rather than discuss the edits in Talk:, 66.93.166.174 simply reverted to his own text. After the page was briefly protected (by me), the editor created a userid User:HistoryBuffEr and created a new article <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation_of_Palestine_cc9f.html" title="Occupation of Palestine">Occupation of Palestine</a> with the content he originally wished to place in <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>. Within 5 hours of its creation it had already been through a number of edit wars, culminating in page protection. Since the content itself is merely intended as a POV alternative to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel-Palestinian_conflict_7006.html" title="Israel-Palestinian conflict">Israel-Palestinian conflict</a>, and since it will have to eventually be incorporated back into that article, the new article should just be deleted now and the user should bring his concerns and proposed edits to the Talk: page of the original article <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 20:33, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

Aren't we supposed to judge articles by their content (ie, their current content) rather than on how much of a dick their creators are? I agree, HistoryBuffEr is a troll who even admitted he created the page because he was fed up with what he percieved as pro-Israel POV on other pages, but so what?

<li>Why would you remove it? Other users (myself, ambi) had kept it in after numerous NPOV edits because we saw it as a fabulous addition to an article that really needed some work. And obviously the rest of the article needs to be better linked with the first paragraph and perhaps shortened to arguments for and against the usage of the term "occupation". But so what?

<p>Why are so many afraid of the title "Occupation of Palestine" when it is a universally acknowledged fact, acknowledged even by Ariel Sharon! Many people from all over the world surely enter this term into a search engine. Does it make sense for Wiki not have such an article (or to have it redirected to an obviously pro-Israel titled page)? I didn't think so. Not to mention how lame it is to suppress any article which is not vetted by pro-Israeli extremists. HistoryBuffEr 08:58, 2004 Sep 15 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is not "a universally acknowledged fact" that there is an "Occupation of Palestine", and Ariel Sharon certainly does not accept that "Palestine" is occupied in the sense you intend (and have explicity stated in your article). This is symptomatic of one of the problems with this article; what you insist are "facts" are, in fact, points of view. Regardless, if there are legitimate perspectives missing from the existing article, they can be incorporated into it. <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">Poisoning the well</a> ignored. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 14:27, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<li>Did you read this article? It is not intended (except by HistoryBuffEr of course) to be an article on "the occupation", but rather an article on the term "occupation" in the case of Israeli presence in the Palestinian areas, how people who are for the usage of the term justify its usage and how people against its usage justify its non-usage. Currently, I think the article is pretty NPOV, and the first paragraph already meets the objective of an article on the term.

<li>Occupation of Palestine may not be a universally acknowledged fact to obsessed pro-Israel partisans like you (eg: check Jayjg's contrib log, please; I gave up after 1500 edits in just 2 months -- almost all solely on topics related to Israel). However, outside of your extremist pigeon-hole there is an entire world -- billions of people with an NPOV on the subject, and most call it "Occupation of Palestine". As evidenced by the votes of 99% countries of the world in the U.N.</li>
<li>Also, what would you say if the shoe was on the other foot? Would you agree to have, for example, the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> article renamed to German-Jewish conflict because some people disagree and think the latter title is more NPOV? Somehow I'm convinced you wouldn't. So, reconsider your approach as it perfectly matches the logic of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denier.html" title="Holocaust denier">Holocaust deniers</a>. Which is not very helpful to your cause. HistoryBuffEr 20:19, 2004 Sep 15 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Also, you are mischaracterising the Holocaust as simply a conflict between non-Jewish Germans and Jewish Germans/Europeans. This could not be farther from the truth. Germany also slaughtered millions of Roma, gays, disabled people, communists, and plenty of other groups (yes, including Esperantists. the last thing we need here is somebody yelling about how we forgot to include them in an incomplete list of groups targeted by the Holocaust). I'm not sure I like the usage "the Holocaust" and I'd rather something like "the Nazi Holocaust" or something like that, but a change to something like German-Jewish conflict would be not just as you propose whitewashing the emotional trauma but most importantly it would be a complete mischaracterisation. If you wanted something analogous, how about Tensions in Nazi Europe, or Nazi conflicts? Even those aren't completely analogous. For one, those events were very different in size, scale, and circumstance. For two, those events are over and now *everybody* sees nazis as looneys (well, not *everybody*...), whereas these events are still ongoing and there are plenty of people on both sides.</dd>

That's a really poor starting point for a NPOV page, to have a name that stems from the POV of the extremist part of one side.

<li>Matter of Law? As I understand it, International Law is a very controversial topic in itself. I'm not certain if you can take it for granted that that has any sway here. In any case, all the content <b>belongs in one place</b>, regardless of what the content <b>is</b>. It all should go into the conflict page, categorized and organized as appropriate and NPOV. Mind you, I'm no big supporter of any large side, so I don't invite any position to imagine that I'm frothing at the mouth for their opposition(s). What I care about is keeping the content NPOV, in one place, and encyclopedic.

<li>The word "occupation" is inappropriate to Israel's presence in the Palestinian territories.</li>
<li>The meaning of the phrase <i>Occupation of Palestine</i> is itself an important issue in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> war surrounding the current <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_conflict_0812.html" title="Middle East conflict">Middle East conflict</a>. Various POVs attribute various meanings to the phrase, and an NPOV writer would avoid it except when describing the views of significant players who use the phrase. But if this article is to focus on these views, then its title should reflect this. <i>Occupation of Palestine</i> is not good title for either topic.

<dd>Jmabel, after doing your tally, I think it is wrong. I voted on three points, but they are one and the same really. The reason the title is biased, the reason the history of the text is so, and the reason it was separated from Israeli-Palestinian conflict are one and the same. This is just POV pushing.

<dd>This one and the above one (with some caveats) for me. I agree with those pointing out that "Palestine" is used to refer to different entities and therefore I agree, that the term must be settled at the start of the article. The term "occupation" is much less problematic, and I'm really baffled, that the entire <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> article is working around it. Even <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belligerent_occupation.html" title="Belligerent occupation">Belligerent occupation</a> does mention it, giving the right (but strangely formulated) qualification that some parties deny the term. Calling it "occupation" is just plain the world's majority POV, it is not a case of obviously bending the definition of <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belligerent_occupation.html" title="Belligerent occupation">Belligerent occupation</a> and so it should have its coverage in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 08:28, 17 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the latter. This *should* have been a redirect beforehand, but just because a POV warrior came along doesn't suddenly make it a legitimate seperate article.

<dd>I think the latter, too. As I said above, it's best to avoid the phrase <i>Occupation of Palestine</i>, not just in the title but also in the text <b>except</b> where it forms an important part of the opinion of a significant player whose views you are quoting. Then of course you use their terms, and it's obvious from the context that you are also using their definitions of the terms, and reporting their POV rather than supporting it. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 11:43, 17 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't know where the best place is to vote on this very messy page, but I vote <b>Keep</b>. The term "Occupation of Palestine" is obviously commonly used (a google search gives 43'000 hits for "Occupation of Palestine", compared to for example 190'000 hits for "Israeli-Palestinian conflict", a much broader subject). However this article should deal mainly with the controversy surrounding this concept (which is very important and not dealt with in other articles) and only give a very brief summary of the history of the occupation and instead link to the relevant articles dealing more in depth with the history. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 15:36, 17 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here is a citation of George W. Bush using the phrase "occupied territories" in this sense: <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/06/20020624-3.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/06/20020624-3.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>

<dd>Not being Node, but offering an answer, what would make sense as a separate <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation_of_Palestine_cc9f.html" title="Occupation of Palestine">Occupation of Palestine</a> article (even if renamed): I'd consider it informative to many readers, to detail out the different legal theories regarding the status of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> etc. The major POV would be that of <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belligerent_occupation.html" title="Belligerent occupation">Belligerent occupation</a>, but that is questioned among others because there may be no subject of internal law, previously owning these territories, etc. Please forgive the clumsiness of my formulations, I'm not an expert on this.

<p>As a Palestinian I know what is right and what is wrong. I also know that as much as the pro-Zionist Wiki posters would like to obscure and confuse the issues, the facts remain. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Zionist state was created by uprooting the inhabitants of the land at the time. The use of terror by the Zionists was only one method that was used, but in the end the Zionist state was in illegal occupation of more land that was allocated to it by the flawed, biased, and failed partition plan of 1948. From that day (May 8, 1948) until now the Zionist state has never been in compliance with International law nor the Geneva Conventions, of which it is a signatory. I won't even try to list the relevant sites, but just look up any UN documents, even US ones. Try as they might to obscure the fact, the UN is the final arbiter of international law, so there is no way to circumvent this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>While I will admit the article requires work, and I agree with Jayjg, alleged is not a smooth phrase the way it is laid out now, this page should be corrected and kept, both views can be laid out.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I know, and have received many notes over the 3+ years I have posted, about the poor way the Wikipedia has presented information relating to the Palestinian/Zionist issue. It is hard for me to be objective and unbiased, but I do try, and even allow for the Zionist POV. That said, why can others not, at least, try and do the same? Time and again posts are removed or edited to silliness, with pro-Zionist nonsense.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>My points and questions are these: Do you the members of this community want to keep the Wikipedia an object of ridicule in this area, and have it seen as an instrument of Zionist propoganda whenever a post is made that explains the Palestinians point of view? Will this issue ever be resolved? If this project is to gain some credibility vis a vis the Palestinian/Zionist issue, some general guidelines need to be implemented, is that not a fair compromise?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As much as the present Zionist and US government would like people to believe, they cannot change what people see with their own eyes. People around the world are not fools, and posters who cannot allow the mainstream to post in an <b>intellectually free</b> environment have no place here.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Finally, I have shown many of these articles, my own edit wars, and numerous other diatribes to scholars, library professionals, educators in general, Arab peoples, and others. All agree that this manner of depicting the Palestinians shows that the Wikipedia, in this respect at least, is not credible. I challenege pro-Zionist posters to read and look up Middle-Eastern history texts, or Encyclopedias of the conflict, or any of the many texts that deal with these issues. One will find that in fact these territories are illegally occupied, and were gained through the illegal use of force and war. We should be brave enbough to at least say that. Keep the page, fix it, and please do not merge it. I notice that a common tactic in this continued frenzy to deny facts is to try and merge articles to hide the truth of the content.</li>

<li>The article isn't a good one - but it's fair (ie NPOV) to refer to the Palestinian territories of West Bank and Gaza as occupied. This is internationally accepted. To argue that an articles has to also reflect the views of a very very small minority of people that these territories are not occupied is to try to force a POV into it. Let's call a spade a spade. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJongarrettuk_f336.html" title="User:Jongarrettuk">Jongarrettuk</a> 17:49, 18 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding here. The author of the article is not insisting that the West Bank and Gaza are occupied; rather, the author is insisting that all of the historical mandate of Palestine is "occupied", including Israel behind the 1949 armistice lines. That is why the title and the article will always be inherently POV. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 03:53, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For exactly this reason it's very important to keep the article: it should explain what different people understand by "Occupation of Palestine", so that everybody knows what they are talking about. <i>Describing</i> PsOV is the very essence of NPOV. A google search for "Occupation of Palestine" gives 43'000 hits. If an Internet user reads any of those 43'000, is unsure about what exactly is meant and comes to Wikipedia for enlightnment, would you really want that person to be kept in the dark about it?? A future "Occupation of Palestine" article should not deal with the history of the alleged occupation, for which readers should be referred to the relevant existing articles, but it should deal with the term, it's usage, it's implications and what kind of people use it. It seems to me that the Zionists in residence try to erase the concepts of their opponents from Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 10:17, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I completely disagree. Please explain why "Occupation of Palestine" is less NPOV than "Supreme Soviet" or "Lebensraum". The whole POV controversy comes from the fact that it is based on and expresses a particular anti-Zionist view&#160;; but "Soviet" is based on and expresses a Communist view, and "Lebensraum" is based on and expresses a Nazi view. Also "Occupation of Palestine" is a recognised term, to the same extent as the other two, and in all cases there are obvious other pages where the content can be added ( <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html#Ideological_theory" title="Nazi">Nazi#Ideological_theory</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Barbarossa_47da.html" title="Operation Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a>&#160;; <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union_453d.html" title="Communist Party of the Soviet Union">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinism.html" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_capitalism.html" title="State capitalism">State capitalism</a>). If you look at the Lebesnraum article, it deals mainly with the concept as used by the Nazis, rather than putting the content in the way the Nazis would have written the article - that is precisely what makes it NPOV, and the same can be done for "Occupation of Palestine". - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 11:59, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Finally, your personal worries about what the "Occupation of Palestine" article may or may not become in the future does not pertain to the question of whether it is a legitimate entry to Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 13:01, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

BTW: "Occupation of the Palestinian territories" should be added to "Occupation of Palestinian territories" which gets another 5000 hits. Either way it still shows that "Occupation of Palestine" is not a term but rather a phrase, one of many.</li>
<li>Where are all these other pages? This can be discussed on their VfD pages&#160;;-)</li>
<li>My so-called personal worries about the future of this page are evidently shared by most people here and are highly pertinent to the decision.</li>
<li>Finally to your first question that I did indeed forget to answer. Possibly, the term "Occupation of Palestine" in 2004 is just as POV as was "Lebensraum" in 1939. But we are in 2004, and Lebensraum is a historical term whose context and political significance are well understood and accepted. The very fact that there is no VfD page for Lebensraum demonstrates this well enough. <a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadykozma_c7d7.html" title="User:Gadykozma">Gadykozma</a> 13:15, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, no, no, no. It is the task of an encyclopedia to deal with concepts from all political movements and to describe them in a NPOV manner, and to provide information that helps to debunk them if they have no value. If they are currently controversial concepts, it is even more important to write a NPOV article about them. Worries about what the page may or may not become are completely speculative. The <i>only</i> question we should debate on this page is whether "Occupation of Palestine" is a <i>legitimate</i> entry, guided by the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a>. I can assure you that I will make sure that that any pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist views of this term will be clearly attributed and not stated as facts, and they they would be contrasted to opposing views.

<dd>Would you care to explain why "Occupation of Palestine" would be an "inherently POV article" when I gave half a dozen of examples above that prove the opposite, instead of accusing me of acting in bad faith (I think that might qualify as a personal attack)? I certainly have my own POV, but I do my best to make NPOV edits to these articles. If I make edits on such topics, I am careful to make them NPOV by attributing them and sourcing them. I don't know if I always succeed in this, but I take your accusation that "I'm not interested in working towards even better NPOV" to be an insult, and I'd be happy if you could point me towards any evidence to support your accusation.

<dd>I'm sorry, I should have been clearer; I was referring to the original author of the article, who created the article for the reason listed above, not to you. You (and others) have made valiant attempts to turn it into something worthwhile and NPOV, which I appreciate, but my point above remains, you can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear. <b>Occupation of Palestine</b> will never be NPOV based on the title alone; there is no way to get people to agree on what "Palestine" is, nor on what "Occupation" is. Palestine has had least three hotly contested definitions; the 1917 British Palestine which included Trans-Jordan (now Jordan), the 1923 San Remo/League of Nations mandate, which roughly included everything currently controlled by Israel, and the post 1967 version, which basically comprised the West Bank and Gaza. Supporters of both sides of the debate each have their preferred view, which leads to endless conflict. Add to that the issue of "Occupation" which some insist there currently is, and others insist there is not. Then mix in the deliberate confusion created by the original author, who pretended that the widely held view that Israel is occupying the West Bank and Gaza was actually a widely held view (and "fact") that Israel was occupying the entire San Remo mandate of Palestine. In the end you have a hopeless mess that can never be sorted out, especially when everything of value on the topic belongs in <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel-Palestinian_conflict_7006.html" title="Israel-Palestinian conflict">Israel-Palestinian conflict</a> anyway. As for why <i>that</i> article's POV is disputed, that is because of the intense emotions that the Israeli-Arab conflict generates; there is no middle ground which satisfies all parties as NPOV. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 16:34, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, no harm done. The point is&#160;: <i>We do not have to agree on anything in order to write an article about it</i>.

<dd>So, thank you very much for your explanation of the difficulties in defining "Palestine" - I think it could be copy-pasted into that particular article right away, because it would make the article more NPOV.</dd>
<dd>Also, I was trying to think of what Zionist concept would be the equivalent of "Occupation of Palestine", and I think it would probably be <a href="../../../e/r/e/Eretz_Israel_ef82.html" title="Eretz Israel">Eretz Israel</a>, or translated into English <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_of_Israel_af97.html" title="Land of Israel">Land of Israel</a>. Strangely enough that article exists, and it's <i>not</i> a redirect to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel-Palestinian_conflict_7006.html" title="Israel-Palestinian conflict">Israel-Palestinian conflict</a>. And strangely enough, it only describes the Zionist POV. And strangely enough, it is not a problem for that article that the term is difficult to define precisely. I suggest that if we delete "<a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation_of_Palestine_cc9f.html" title="Occupation of Palestine">Occupation of Palestine</a>", we need to delete that particular article too, or make it into a redirect to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel-Palestinian_conflict_7006.html" title="Israel-Palestinian conflict">Israel-Palestinian conflict</a>. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 16:59, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We don't have to agree on everything, but if an article just contains information which is already found in other articles (or which should be in other articles), then it just creates needless clutter and confusion. The fundamental problem with the article is this: If you leave it as the original author intends, it is merely POV propaganda. And if you somehow manage to make it NPOV, then it will inevitable overlap and duplicate (or contradict) other articles. That is the horns of the dilemma upon which this article places us.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the <a href="../../../e/r/e/Eretz_Israel_ef82.html" title="Eretz Israel">Eretz Israel</a> article, I hadn't seen it before. I think there is a fundamental difference between that article and this one. That article explains the meaning of an ancient term still used today; the term is not a "Zionist concept" in that it long pre-dates political Zionism. As well, it does not describe a conflict, nor does it express any particularly POV position; rather, it describes a geographical area. A parallel article might be one on the term "Palestine", explaining (among other things) its historical origins and usage. And lo and behold, there is a <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a> article which, while itself fairly POV, is better than what is here, and contains just about everything of value which has been entered into this article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 17:20, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In exactly the same way, it is impossible to understand what Palestinian nationalism is about, unless we have equivalent articles on <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation_of_Palestine_cc9f.html" title="Occupation of Palestine">Occupation of Palestine</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/k/Nakba.html" title="Nakba">Nakba</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_to_return.html" title="Right to return">right to return</a> etc. These are concepts that are central to Palestinian nationalism. To just hide them away in a small paragraph somewhere in the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> article will not do - if we take the NPOV serious, then they deserve their own article that explains in a NPOV manner what is meant, without reporting in detail the whole history dealt with elsewhere. If there is some overlap with other articles, that won't be a problem - there is enough space on Wikipedia left. And you are of course right that <a href="../../../e/r/e/Eretz_Israel_ef82.html" title="Eretz Israel">Eretz Israel</a> is not an exact equivalent of <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation_of_Palestine_cc9f.html" title="Occupation of Palestine">Occupation of Palestine</a>, but both are central concepts in their respective nationalisms, and they both express a claim for land (more or less the same land, by misfortune). - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 18:01, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The heliocentric view of the solar system is also disputed by many individuals, but that doesn't that doesn't change the facts.

<dd>When one is talking about states as opposed to people, recognition does not mean knowing or acknowledging that something exists. It means diplomatic recognition. There is a territory there and an organisation that claims to be a State. In some people and country's eye's it is nothing more than an illegitimate breakaway regime, they no more recognise it than the Union recognised the confederates. There is no one article title or one article which can be neutral on this subject or many others. There is no 1 truth to be written down on this subject and if you try you'll just end up writing propoganda.

As far as I know Egypt is the only one of Israels neighbours to recognize it. Only 3 countries recognize the captital as Jeruselem. No one recognizes the annex of the Golan. It's totally reliant on an external power for it's existance. The major problem is that you don't understand the power and effect of language.

The issue of borders is one thing, the issue of whether Israel is somehow uniquely less legitimate than the world's other states is another.

<p>I think many people here are totally missing the point. We have a very clear case of someone trying to create their own private Wikipedia within the actual Wikipedia. Someone here is angry at some of our articles, but instead of working with others to improve them, thet are creating their own parallel Wikipedia article to push their own POV. This is a clear violation of Wikipedia NPOV policy. We <b>do not</b> have two articles on abortion, one from a pro-choice POV and one from a pro-life POV; we <b>do not</b> have two articles on racism, one from a pro-racism POV and one from an anti-racism POV. The same is true for all topics, including the Arab-Israeli topic. Shamefully, several people are willingly trying to violate NPOV in this one case, because they feel that the current articles on the subject are not correct. We cannot allow this and still stay true to Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></p>
<p>Jayjg's analysis of this situation is both correct and friendly: Jayjg is very open to other people adding information (in an NPOV fashion) to the current Arab-Israeli conflict articles; Jayjg is not rejecting any new topics or subjects. I cannot understand the opposition to his simple proposal. As he writes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Since the content itself is merely intended as a POV alternative to <i>Israel-Palestinian conflict</i>, and since it will have to eventually be incorporated back into that article, the new article should just be deleted now and the user should bring his concerns and proposed edits to the Talk: page of the original article <i>Israeli-Palestinian conflict</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Jayjg is correct. This is the way that we all handle all article, <i>especially</i> controversial issues. Keeping a separatrem, parallel article in this case violates Wikipedia policy and creates a divisive precedent. What we end up with is <i>not</i> Wikipedia NPOV, but rather the <b>M</b>POV policy of the Wikipedia fork, Internet-Encyclopedia (a totally separate project that forked off of Wikipedia a while ago.) <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 20:59, Sep 19, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you that trying to create a POV alternative of a controversial article should not be tolerated. However, I think this article has potential if it strives to answer the question "What do people mean when they utter the word "occupation" in reference to territories that were part of (pre 1948) <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a>?". <a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERorro_8c97.html" title="User:Rorro">_R_</a> 21:37, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b>. The title is inherently POV, since it specifies a political judgment. It is not sufficient to simply say "well, that's what some people call it." The title then makes the content POV, because Palestine has been "occupied" for centuries--it hasn't been a sovereign nation, so you would need to talk about the Turkish Occupation, and the Jordanian Occupation, and so on. If we were to let this stand, we would need to submerge ourselves in irridentism, and have an article on western Poland titled <b>Occupation of Germany</b>, or of New York State, <b>Occupation of the Iroquois Nation</b>, or even of Syria, Iran and Iraq <b>Occupation of the Ottoman Empire.</b> Of course there are probably some people who would enthusiastically agree with these, but this is not Wikipedia's job. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 16:46, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>For many here the pull of tribal ties apparently outweighs both common sense and human decency.

<p>I had previously said "keep or merge", but I am changing my vote to neutral.</p>
<ol>
<li>I am distressed by the downright mean and petty tone of some of the arguments on the keep side, and I am simply uncomfortable to be in such company.</li>
<li>Besides the issue of tone, I can see that there are several people who wish to use this article not as a place to discuss the occupation of the Territories -- which I think we should have an article on -- but to question the entire legitimacy of the Israeli state, and to argue that all Jews in the region are "occupiers". This makes me very uncomfortable with keeping an article at this title.</li>
</ol>
<p>I still believe that we need to have far more coverage in Wikipedia of what I will continue without reservation to call the Occupied Territories, so I cannot bring myself to vote against this, either, but apparently this article is, indeed, intended to set Israel apart as less legitimate than other states in the region, and I can't support that. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> 00:05, Sep 21, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>As I have said before, I do not hate people, any people of any race, religion, colour, whatever... I do not even hate the Zionist state for all the damage it has done to my people; the Palestinians. I do hate, though, the way the pro-Zionist supporters overule every post on the other side, not even admitting that there is anything wrong. It is a shame and a crime akin to Holocaust deniers, in all due respect. I am Palestinian by birth and feel now that this project will never be credible in this respect - The Arab/Israeli conflict and especially anything to do with the Palestinians inalienable human rights and their tragic recent history (are all diputed, and our view is now where to be seen on most of these pages). I will continue to monitor and interject (vainly trying to set the record straight) when I can, but feel there is no chance at the present time. Lie and try to cover up the truth as much as you want, it will come out one day in the end, you cannot lie and obscure the truth about it forever. There is a reason so many young Jewish youths cannot stand the Zionist state and what it has become now. The flee from it and the militaristic settlers in droves...

<dd>Dear <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoseph_E._Saad_79c9.html" title="User:Joseph E. Saad">Joseph</a>: I realize this is not the right place for reconciliation. Speaking for myself only, if I change the word "Palestinian" to "Jew", I can sign practically entire your paragraph. Zionism, the idea of of Jews returning to their homeland (even though they have never completely left), is despised as racism, despite our willingness to share it with others. At the same time most of the world cheers up the "right of return" of Palestinian Arabs to the same land, automatically annihilating the Jewish state and making the land Judenrein. I am sorry that your people were used (and abused) in dirty political games, or chose bad leaders such as Amin al-Husseini or Arafat, or rejected the dozen or so offers to share the land and create two states, or to build and negotiate, instead of blowing people and things up. There are 22 huge and resource-rich Arab states carved out of the Ottoman Empire and only one tiny Jewish. Perhaps it's time to try peace without attempts to destroy "the Zionist state"? <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens"></a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">Talk</a> 01:55, 21 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, one last time, look there is not another article called <i>Occupation of Palestine</i> is there? No ok, so there could be one, it should be balanced and fair, NPOV, clean this one up, create a new one I do not care which, but let one stand. When I first joined back when, the Wiki wanted all the articles it could get, what is wrong with that? Jayjg says this particular article was created out of a sense of malice, perhaps so, who knows? I don't, but that should not be if that is so. <b>I for one</b> do not want issues relating to the very serious subject of the Palestinian/Zionist conflict being used as some sort of tool to slander another person or group of people or anything. It means too much to me, I still have family that live there, everywhere there and beyond... I would kindly ask (as others have in the past) you people to consider the effects this conflict has on <i>REAL</i> people. Real peoples families are being killed, on both sides, the trauma is very real and sickenning. The least we could do here, in this role, is try to present in an infomative way the facts as best we can find them in an unbiased and objective manner. It is hard, but we should try to be fair and reasonable. Thanks for the space, <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoseph_E._Saad_79c9.html" title="User:Joseph E.

<p>One last point then I will keep silent, I am a Library Technician by training, I work in the library profession. The very esssence of providing information in this field is to do so in an objective unbiased manner. When one fulfills a reference request in this profession, provide information, one presents all the information available. Not selected portions. Censorship, banning the right to free expression is a big taboo, libraries have a long history of fighting censorship. Freedom to read is an essential right of all human beings. That said, I am opposed to deletions as a rule excpept for the serious rights violations of others. Deletions should occur only when there is no real constructive method of dealing with a problematic or malicious article. I can see if the topic was a double, but in this case it is not.

<p>Joseph, I think you and I are pretty much on the same page on all but our conclusion about what should be done with this article. I think the Occupation is a perfectly valid topic. I think it needs to be taken up seriously somewhere in the Wikipedia. At first I thought it should be in an article of its own under this title, but now I suspect that it had best at least be "incubated" at <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> and possibly factored out later if there is consensus to do so. The main reason I have changed my mind is that while I use "Occupation of Palestine" as a shorthand for "Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories", it has become very clear that there are people who intend to use the very <i>title</i> as a tool to argue that all Jewish presence (or at least all Zionist presence) in former mandate Palestine constitutes "occupation". I find that view exactly as abhorrent as I find the attitude that continues to deny Palestinians the status of a people.</p>
<p>In any event, there seems to be a near-consensus that this is an under-covered topic. I don't think it is as crucial that it immediately be placed in a separate article as that we start to write about it. And thank you for preserving a constructive attitude on what must obviously and appropriately be an emotional topic for you. Would that a few others would do the same. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> 06:36, Sep 21, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let there be no doubt about it: many Palestinians and opponents of Zionism <i>do</i> think that <i>all of "Palestine"</i> (i.e. not just the West Bank and Gaza but also Israeli territory) is "occupied". They think that the creation of the "Zionist state" led to the expulsion of Palestinians from "<i>their</i>" land, that this new state, which denies the "right to return" to the Palestinian former inhabitants while granting such a "right to return" to all ethnic Jews even those who have had no connection with this land for 2 millenia, is therefore an "apartheid state", the State of <i>all Jews and Jews only</i>. They regard this "apartheid state" as "occupying" "their" land and they think that this "occupation" must end. That is what they <i>do</i> think, no doubt about it. Zionists find this view "abhorrent" (and wouldn't tolerate it being described at Wikipedia), no doubt about that either.<br /></dd>
<dd>Some of these strong anti-Zionists also <i>do</i> think that all Israelis/Jews should be "driven into the sea"&#160;; but many of them argue for something entirely different: they argue for a <i>bi-national state</i>, in which Palestinians and Jews have equal national and individual rights. They do not argue for the destruction of Israel together with all Israelis, they argue for the <i>transformation</i> of the Zionist "apartheid state" into a state that accomodates the aspiartions of both Jewish and Palestinian nationalism on an equal footing. Radical Zionists reject and most of the time ignore this possibility&#160;; when they do respond, they typically argue that this is "anti-Semitic" because it would make Jews the only nation in the world to whom their "own" state is denied (nevermind the obvious contradiction that they would be equally racist, because they simultaneously deny that right to Palestinians, also nevermind that dozens of other ethnic and cultural groups come to mind at once that don't have their "own" state, Kurds, Afrikaners, Native Americans, Scots, Asanti, Bavarians, Basques, Maori, Sikhs, etc. etc.)<br /></dd>
<dd>I am not arguing in favour or against any of these political positions here (personally I detest all forms of nationalism because nationalism is an abomination of the humanity in all of us and of all our cultures, and nationalism always seems to be the root of enormous bloodshed and conflict)&#160;; what I am arguing for is that there are many different political positions in this conflict, and that all of them have a <i><b>legitimate right to exist in Wikipedia</b></i>, to be described equally in a NPOV manner from their own POV (as opposed to in a POV manner from their opponents POV), no matter how abhorrent they may appear to anybody - because: if we do not present these views it is simply <i>impossible to understand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</i>. Worries about how a particular article may or may not affect the case made by one or the other side in this bloody conflict (which is 80% of what's written on this page) are totally illegitimate and beside the point - <i><b>enabling readers to understand</b></i> this conflict must be our sole aim at Wikipedia. Sadly this is not happening at all. Sadly, the most intolerant, intransigeant, rejectionist and extreme Wikipedians from both sides of the debate effectively collaborate in marginalising, frustrating and eventually eliminating the moderate and open-minded ones - just like in the real world. Sadly, the partisans have little integrity. Palestinian and anti-Zionist views are consistently removed, distorted beyond recognition and hidden away by their opponents. This does Wikipedia a great disservice. The articles about the Israeli-Palestinian issue are absolutely appalling and they diminish and ridicule the whole project we are working on. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 12:55, 21 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation_of_Palestine_cc9f.html" title="Occupation of Palestine">occupation of Palestine</a> has occurred several times throughout history. Various justifications and criticisms of these occupations have been made.</p>
<p>Articles about this region of the earth's surface should merely recount the facts, as best we can find them (with any significant variations when the facts are in dispute).</p>
<p>We should not try to "get to the bottom of it" and label one nation's "occupation" as justified or not.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> occupied Palestine rather famously during <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> times, a fact which is significant for Christians because Jewish leaders appealed to <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilate.html" title="Pilate">Pilate</a> to crucify <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>.</p>
<p>Didn't the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> control or "occupy" Palestine for centuries leading up to modern times?</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan.html" title="Jordan">Jordan</a> occupied the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>, a portion of Palestine; this should at least be mentioned in the article.</p>
<p>The current legal status of Palestine's various residents is obviously hotly disputed. Actually, "violently disputed" would be more precise. Various militia and quasi-govermental organizations control neighborhoods and larger areas in <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gaza.html" title="Gaza">Gaza</a> and the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>. Then, there's <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> which controls a patchwork of areas: some militarily and administrativel, others only militarily.</p>
<p>Not to mention that there is unrest in the area, variously described as a "war", an "uprising", a "terrorist campaign", or even "anarchy" (depending on the source).</p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget that many countries don't even recognize Israel as a nation, so the non-Gaza, non-West Bank, non-Jordanian parts of Palestine are seen by some as "occupied territory".</p>
<p>There are so many versions of what happened and whether or not it was justified and what various advocates propose to do about it, that some writers simply want to withdraw or call for a vote (I mean here at Wikipedia).</p>
<p>But my suggestion is for each contributor to take a step back, re-examine the facts and positions, and write from the lofty position of someone trying to explain a family squabble to an outsider:</p>

<li>I wanted the remote, so I grabbed it from Johnny; he grabbed it back because he "had it first" but it was time for "my show" to come on, etc.</li>

<p>Hello again, I am not sure on where the votes are now, or the status of the article, but I thought it may help to have an example of the Occupation as it was meant in the original article today. This is not meant to criticize anyone person or anything, but just an example see: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3674202.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3674202.stm" rel="nofollow">Early troubles for Palestinian voter registration</a> a quote:</p>
<p><i>An Israeli military closure order is posted to the door of an empty office in a community centre that sits astride the dusty streets of the Shufat Palestinian refugee camp in Israeli occupied East Jerusalem.</i></p>
<p><i>...'Israeli territory'</i></p>
<p><i>...About 1,000 voter registration centres have been set up in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip...</i></p>
<p>...<i>Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has begun campaigning But still the offices are functioning. So why did Israel shut down only those centres in Palestinian East Jerusalem?</i></p>
<p><i>Because Jerusalem is sovereign Israeli territory, says Spokesman Raanan Gissin.</i></p>
<p><i>"Jerusalem has a totally different status, the municipal boundaries have been determined by the 1981 law, approved by the Knesset.</i></p>
<p><i>"It's not occupied territory and as any other country would not permit political activity of a foreign country, particularly voting, so Israel has the same right to prevent that kind of political activity within Jerusalem itself."</i></p>
<p><i>International law is clear about East Jerusalem. It's occupied Palestinian territory, with the same status as the West Bank and Gaza.</i></p>
<p><i>"We don't accept that", says Mr Gissin,</i></p>
<p>I appreciate Ed Poor's approach, and commend the effort. Unfortunately for me, the article does not address, what I see, as the main point of the original article. That point is the Israeli Occupation of Palestinian territory conquered in the original 1948 war, the subsequent 1967 (Six Day War) conflict, and the occupation of territory under the administration of the Palestinian Authority (God how I hate that name) today, perhaps even reference to the Zionist state making a unilateral withdrawal to borders of its own choosing rather than what International Law prescribes. I think that is what the issue really is...</p>
<p>With all due respect, if someone wants an explanation of Ancient Palestine or the Roman Occupation of Palestine/Israel/Holy Land, etc. then there is ample coverage of that in the original <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a> article.</p>
<p>I think this article needs to be written in the time-frame of today, with see alsos and such to other areas of relevance.</p>
<p>I looked over many things about Wikipedia policy, and there is no edict asking to restrict or limit articles. In fact quite the opposite, the idea is to make the Wikipedia grow, albeit with a NPOV view and in the strictures of scholarly debate, I suggest we go that route, with collaboration from everyone.</p>
<p>This post was meant to help explain, assist others and further clarify where this article should lead to. Thanks, and I hope that helps... <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoseph_E._Saad_79c9.html" title="User:Joseph E. Saad">Joseph</a> 15:07, Sep 23, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Jayjg is right: Occupation of Palestine will never be NPOV based on the title alone; there is no way to get people to agree on what "Palestine" is, nor on what "Occupation" is.</p>
<p>That is why so many people want there to be a neutral article on the "<a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation_of_Palestine_cc9f.html" title="Occupation of Palestine">occupation of Palestine</a>" -- and possibly a distinct, related article on the "<a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_occupation_of_Palestine_9cf6.html" title="Israeli occupation of Palestine">Israeli occupation of Palestine</a>" <b>which can address these issues.</b></p>
<p>And the notion that 2/3 have agreed to the deletion or redirect simply isn't true:</p>
<ol>
<li>The articles were radically changed, but no new vote was taken</li>
<li>Several people have voiced opinions but didn't 'vote'</li>

<dd>Why not create these first? Why not such <i>proccupation</i>? I understand your implicit implications, but the answer is very simple: because this is one of the most controversial and most explosive conflicts of our time. This region is where the three major monotheistic religions originated and the associated cultures/countries are involved in this conflict. The world's sole remaining superpower is deeply involved in it. The world's most feared terrorist organisation gets so worked about up this (among a couple of other things) that they crashed planes into the WTC on 9/11. Many Muslims think it's the worst example of how they are oppressed by the West. Millions of Christian fundamentalist (esp. in the US) think that this is where the final showdown of Armageddon will soon occur and Jesus return. This is one of the most important conflicts of our time, and an encyclopaedia which doesn't deal with it in a NPOV, non-partisan way, representing the views of the opposing parties fairly and equally, is, quite frankly, not worth the harddisk space it's written on. That's why, not the reason you are implying. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 11:08, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whether or not bin Laden cares about anybody is something none of us can now, but it is certainly true that the treatment and dispossesion of the PAlestinians at the hand of Israel figures in all their propaganda, for the simple reason that a very large proportion of Muslims are outraged about it. There's only one way to counter-act propaganda: confronting it with factual information and addressing people's views/grievances.

<p>Well, now, it appears we've started down the road of POV forks for everyone, and everyone who ever controlled Palestine becoming an occupier: see <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation_of_the_Gaza_Strip_by_Egypt_fd19.html" title="Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt">Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt</a> and <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupation_of_the_West_Bank_and_East_Jerusalem_by_Jordan_ff41.html" title="Occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan">Occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan</a> .
