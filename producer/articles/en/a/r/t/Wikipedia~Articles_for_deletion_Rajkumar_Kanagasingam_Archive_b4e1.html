<li><b>Week keep</b>: the subject of the article barely seems to meet the requirements regarding notability as a columnist and author. There also seems to be a problem finding <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, however one must bear in mind that many developing countries (like Sri Lanka) are technologically under-developed and that a web-search cannot be considered a exhaustive method for establishing notability in such cases. Furthermore English is not the primary language in this country (compare with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Dominic_Jeeva_26b6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dominic Jeeva">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dominic Jeeva</a>).

<li><b>My comment</b> This editor<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">User:Iwazaki</a> is trying hard to defame me; it is because of my controversial argument with the editor over the funeral of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anton_Balasingham_4061.html" title="Anton Balasingham">Anton Balasingham</a> in the discussion page <a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnton_Balasingham_f9b5.html" title="Talk:Anton Balasingham">Talk:Anton Balasingham</a> and the massacres of my community and their persecution in the same page. My article was created by <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWackymacs_1999.html" title="User:Wackymacs">User:Wackymacs</a>, I didn't know anything about Wikipedia at that time, though I referred for my book a lot from wikipedia.

But when you compare my other contributions, you will come to know the amount, I have spent for my Bio is not so much. There were many things, I might have added from the off-line media archives about my activities, but I didn't attempt. The editor is criticizing me, she/he hasn't heard of me in the academic world, but two of my public lectures were presided by Dr. Gamani Corea, a former Secretary-General of <a href="../../../u/n/c/UNCTAD_1952.html" title="UNCTAD">UNCTAD</a>, so what the editor is going to tell for that. I have placed those events in the newspaper archives in Talk:Rajkumar Kanagasingam. Why the editor is hell-bent to defame me could be well judged by the language the editor used to criticize a highly respected Bishop as boot-licker on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnton_Balasingham_f9b5.html" title="Talk:Anton Balasingham">Talk:Anton Balasingham</a>. <a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERajsingam_c57d.html" title="User:Rajsingam">Rajsingam</a> 01:13, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>REPLY</b> The above reply itself,qualify,perfectly for the deletion of the article.The user Rajasingham has shown that he is not afraid to accuse anyone given the opportunity.He is here, engage in baseless accusation for me without even trying to address the issues I've raised here.I've no desire to defame him,, but that doesn't mean I'm going to endorse what ever he says here. For what I have read from other users, It became evident that this user had violated <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> miserably.And when he realised this, he had asked his friends "to do edits for him",and I found this "comical"(read user Bakamans comments).BUT, I want this article to be deleted not only for this,for me violation of rules is not the main issue here.I care more about the "importance of this person " and "Does he deserve to have an article of him in wikipedia"&#160;?? Sadly, I don't see a single notability in this person which justify having his article here.He claims to have done public lectures&#160;??!! IS this notable&#160;?? Millions of people doing public lectures all over the world ,and do wikipedia need articles for every public lecturer&#160;?? He has hilariously put some pictures of him giving a lecture (??) to some German students at a beer table, is this notable&#160;?? I went though the articles he wrote in the Daily News, other than cow-towing the ex PM Ranil Wikramasinghe, he has done nothing special at all&#160;!! And please remember this person , is not even a journalist, he just had a couple random articles,which is possible for anyone&#160;!!</li>

<dd>Iwazaki, his book doesn't seem to be on sale or even published yet. From a PR... "<i>The book will be released by the US publisher AuthorHouse in the coming months and will be available worldwide and could be ordered at over 30,000 retail outlets and will be listed with AuthorHouse.com, Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com, Borders.com, Abesbooks.com, Booksamillion.com, Target.com and more!</i>".

<li>She/He blamed the Bishop as a LTTE's boot-licker and now she/he is finding various accusations against me. I don't feel even answer to the reply, but I am compelled to do so. My activities are multi-faceted not within one area. I never claimed I am a sole columnist or lecturer or an NGO worker. My attempts started from the beginning something extra ordinarily whether it is my peace initiative from my school days or my other activities in a more innovative ways. If the editor is accusing me that I have given a lecture at the dinner table then what about my lecture on <b>Global Role of the US Economy in the Year 2000 and Beyond</b> at the US Fulbright Commission, Colombo which was presided by Dr. Gamani Corea with the presence of Dr. <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_W._Spain_4b9c.html" title="James W. Spain">James W. Spain</a>, a former US Ambassador for Sri Lanka and the UN which was organized by the UN Association of Sri Lanka with other distinguished participants. Are they all fools to preside and come for my lecture? Then what about my lecture program on <b>Globalization and Future of the Sri Lanka Trade and Industry</b> which too was presided by Dr. Gamani Corea and it was organised by the National Chambers of Exporters of Sri Lanka. Not only I was a NGO worker, thereafter I founded a think-tank PDIP and I did my best for a lasting solution in the war-torn country while Mr. Ranil Wickremesighe was prime minister openly and silently. That doesn't mean that I belong to his party or his supporter, but for a lasting solution to the ethnic crisis. Clearly I am not a politician or in my life time never joined in a single political party and never want to be a politician as well.</li>

<li><b>REPLY</b> Please stop telling stories..I have accused you for nothing.If you have anything say of my contributions,please do so at the relevant pages. What I question here is the validity of the article and whether it should have a space in wikipedia..But so far ,I have failed to see anything other than your personal boastings..I really don't think wikipedia should be a place for you to boast of your self..While other users have warned you to not to edit your own article, you didn't listen to them,did you? Well, even if we forget all these "abuses"of wiki rules regarding editing, you still fail to justify your inclusion here.People do a lot of things in their school days, and it seems only you are boasting of them..You may have given a lecture in front of some famous people, but does that alone qualify you as a notable person&#160;?? NOPE. You may have given a lot of dinner table lectures,does that qualify you as a notable person???NOPE. Do you know that there are tons of international seminars and conferences going on every day around the world&#160;?? Do wikipedia need articles for every lecturer&#160;?? You may have met US ambassador , but frankly who cares&#160;?? You may have more German friends, that's good for you,but sorry, you can't use wikipedia to boast about it.And You can cow tow as much as you want ,but that doesn't make you a journalist..I went through almost all the article and photos ,and sorry, I don't see any notability there.Those are pretty ordinary stuff, nothing else. --<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 15:42, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>REPLY</b> I understand everything, but still what I don't understand is, so far other editors were trying to help in "Expanding the article", suddenly after my discussion on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnton_Balasingham_f9b5.html" title="Talk:Anton Balasingham">Talk:Anton Balasingham</a>, an AFD tag on my article is. <a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERajsingam_c57d.html" title="User:Rajsingam">Rajsingam</a> 16:05, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>REPLY</b> So you understand my points.Good. But You still haven't understand one thing..Your discussion at Anton Balasinghams page has nothing to do with this AFD. I really don't understand why keep playing this music from the beginning..Why don't you scroll up and see who had asked for a vote in the first place&#160;?? Did you debate with him at that talk page&#160;?? If not don't you think its the time to stop telling stories&#160;?? further, You are kind of contradicting your self here.While stating "<i>Really I am not worried my Bio is there in the wikipedia or not</i>" , you are vigorously campaigning here to keep your article.In fact its only you who are fighting for your course here..Also stop using the articles you've created in wikipedia to defend your course.There are tons of NGO's in Sri Lanka..And you wont become notable just because you found one..Sadly, to my knowledge,You have used wikipedia for excessive advertising for your upcoming(?) book and your NGO work. You have used wikipedia to promote your self and your NGO and hopefully administrators will take necessary action regarding this.--<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 13:03, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>My comment</b> If those explanations are coming from some other editors, I might have given thought for, but this editor<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowolfd4_dd28.html" title="User:Snowolfd4">User:Snowolfd4</a>, initially showed some resistance when I was trying to edit my native and birth place <a href="../../../j/a/f/Jaffna.html" title="Jaffna">Jaffna</a> which was just dumped with false historical information from medieval times, showing Jaffna rulers were Sinhalese and the details of the early tribes <a href="../../../n/a/g/Naga_%28clan%29.html" title="Naga (clan)">Nagas</a> were completely left out, until I did a complete historical updates with reference. Why I also feel my Bio work is entitled for Indian deletion category is I have done my best for the Gujarat earth quake victims at a time they needed attention for their relief, by giving a lecture program <b>Rebuilding the Indian Economy beyond natural disaster</b>, mostly a fund raising campaign than merely a lecture, with the help of Exnora International, India and The Hindu newspaper(I have submitted reference on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rajkumar_Kanagasingam_3bdc.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Rajkumar Kanagasingam">Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Rajkumar Kanagasingam</a>).

<p>As per the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:N">Guidelines</a>, <i>Subjective evaluations are not relevant for determining whether a topic warrants inclusion in Wikipedia. Notability criteria do not equate to personal or biased considerations, such as: "never heard of this", "an interesting article", "topic deserves attention", "not famous enough", "very important issue", "popular", "I like it", "only of interest to [some group]", etc. Notability is not judged by Wikipedia editors directly. The inclusion of topics on Wikipedia is a reflection of whether those topics have been included in reliable published works. Other authors, scholars, or journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it. Thus, the primary notability criterion is a way to determine whether "the world" has judged a topic to be notable. This is unrelated to whether a Wikipedia editor personally finds the subject remarkable or worthy.</i> <span style="border:1px solid #000;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariano_Anto_Bruno_Mascarenhas_f6b6.html" title="User:Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas"><font style="color:#ffd700;background:#000;"><b>&#160;Doctor Bruno&#160;</b></font></a></span> 13:42, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

You mean NGO's&#160;?? Wikipedia has been used as a propaganda tool for his book..The article starts with <i>Rajkumar Kanagasingam is the author of the book German Memories in Asia</i>, but the book doesn't even exist yet..The book might take months to be published, but wikipdia already says he is the author ..Amazing ,isn't it&#160;??</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> It seems fairly obvious that he's been noted by the media enough to be considered notable. For the record, I don't know anything about the person or his work, so this is merely an observation based on the evidence. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 18:12, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
