<p>The result was <b>Speedy Delete</b>. I have no doubt that I'm asking for an ass-kicking here, but this entire article reeks of self-promotional material if it actually exists, or a <a href="../../../h/o/a/WP%7EHOAX_ea37.html" title="WP:HOAX">hoax</a> if it doesn't (which... makes a lot of sense). There's absolutely no reason to let this farce of an AfD continue; a handful of people (possibly even one) are the ones campaigning for its continued existence, and the strongest piece of evidence (the scanned newspaper article) is one of the most heavily photoshopped images I've ever seen. Between suspect sockpuppets, a dubious level of notability, and an unreliable primary source, I don't feel that this article should be on Wikipedia. If this <i>is</i> a real religion (seems to be a bit of a debate about that, but that's neither here nor there), an article can be written at a later date at such a time as the movement is actually <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">notable</a>.

<p>Janicism is a factual article. All things start off small, and Janicism wont expand suddenly overnight. The fact is, Janicism is a real religion. There are people who follow it, and therefore I maintain they have a right to have it documented on Wikipedia, which is why I wrote the article (which has since been expanded by a fellow practicing Janicist, showing it is not false.) I strongly believe that this article should be upheld in the public view.<a href="../../../m/l/c/User%7EMlc409_7c7e.html" title="User:Mlc409">Mlc409</a> 10:19, 2 December 2006 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../m/l/c/User%7EMlc409_7c7e.html" title="User:Mlc409">Mlc409</a> (<a href="../../../m/l/c/User_talk%7EMlc409_0a12.html" title="User talk:Mlc409">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mlc409_0b97.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mlc409">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<p>Janicism is a real religion, but these things cannot simply turn up overnight. We have slowly been expanding our religion over many months, and have decided to write an article to try to reach out to more people. Janicism is definitely not made up, as some of its views are documented in books - see "Mort" by Terry Pratchett, as seen in the article. Do not delete. <a href="../../../i/c/h/User%7EIchbinbored_7e0f.html" title="User:Ichbinbored">Ichbinbored</a> 10:23, 2 December 2006 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../i/c/h/User%7EIchbinbored_7e0f.html" title="User:Ichbinbored">Ichbinbored</a> (<a href="../../../i/c/h/User_talk%7EIchbinbored_29d7.html" title="User talk:Ichbinbored">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ichbinbored_b255.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ichbinbored">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<dd>Actually, the article doesn't state that "Mort" documents this religion. When refering to books being written about people after their deaths: <i>This is documented in the book "Mort", by Terry Pratchett, however the fundamental beliefs surrounding this are different to those of Janicists (who follow the Parable of Reed).</i> All that means is that "Mort" mentioned the idea of people having books written about their life activities, it doesn't mean that "Mort" in any way referenced "Janicism". <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 10:36, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> as any of the following: A non-notable religion, which may or may not attract coverage at some indeterminate point in the future, thus becoming notable; a hoax, although possibly one based on the works of a notable author; a group of Terry Pratchett fans trying to do for his works what the religion of the Jedi Knights has done for George Lucas (as distinct from a straight-out hoax). In the first and third cases, we've got the cart (a Wikipedia entry) before the horse (the inconvenient acquisition of notability).

<dd>Read the page, it says "An article about Our fundamental beliefs is being compiled, and should be completed towards the end of 2006." Being compiled means it is being made. It was posted today when we completed it.

<dd>In what way must it help? In order to show notability, you'll need reliable independent sources. Currently, the two sources cited are a blog with some funny entry timestamps and a website which says (as WJBscribe so aptly puts it), "I'm going to write an article about X and put it on Wikipedia". Leaving aside the blog, in what way is the website independent of the religion? That's the crux of the matter for me at the moment - when independent and reliable sources start talking about this religion, it becomes notable. It doesn't turn up here in order for independent and reliable sources to start talking about it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:58, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>With respect, that's a false argument. Islam and Christianity (and a myriad of other religions, denominations, sects and cults) have attracted newspaper and/or scholarly coverage. Therefore, not only do we know that they exist, they're eminently notable. Janicism, on the other hand, has a dicey-looking blog, a website which says nothing more than "we exist", an apparently photoshopped newspaper article and an alleged YouTube video. The best that collection proves is that there is a relatively coherent group of people who call what they do by that name (and even then I have my doubts). There's no notability there, and there's precious little verifiability. If that were all we could find on an established world religion, I'd have no hesitation in deleting the article. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:07, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And also I thought there were no votes. It says at the top that the editors decide <i>not</i> through counting heads. So why are you saying that they have been changed if they don't mean anything? A religion doesn't have to be internationally recognised to exist. <a href="../../../i/c/h/User%7EIchbinbored_7e0f.html" title="User:Ichbinbored"><font color="red"><b>Ichbinbored</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/c/h/User_talk%7EIchbinbored_29d7.html" title="User talk:Ichbinbored"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 10:08, 3 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As far as the international recognition point goes, that's true enough. However, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia rather than a website about everything which exists. To use the hoary old chestnut, <i>I</i> exist (and in a nicely verifiable manner), but I don't get an article just because of winning the genetic lottery. If I want an article, I need to do something significant first. Likewise, were I to found a Satanic cult (an example plucked at random, although there are a lot of AfDs on these), said cult would also exist but remain obstinately non-notable until it had burned a church or two down or done something equally newsworthy. I'm willing to assume good faith and say that the religion exists, but it hasn't achieved noteworthiness yet. In terms of the "changing votes" thing, what was being referred to then was that certain accounts had actually altered what other people had said - changing a phrase such as "Delete this page, it is as noteworthy as the religion I've founded" to read "Keep this page, it is related to the religion I've founded" and so on. Pretending that people have said things that they hadn't is very bad form. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:23, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree that those such accounts/IPs should be banned, but there <i>is</i> a newspaper article about one of the festivals.

<dd>I, for one, would like there to be at least two newspaper articles to start with - regardless of the size of the festivals they're talking about. Further, there is a considerable belief that the article was created with Photoshop.

<dd>You haven't actually said it before, but regardless of that, we only have your word that neither of you could afford it. I'm not saying that it has been photoshopped, although other users are saying that. I've sent a message to IrishGuy to see if he's heard back from the Chronicle's editor, which would clinch the matter of the veracity of the newspaper article once and for all. It still remains to be seen, however, whether that's enough to move this into notable territory. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:10, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also I'm from the UK and I've certainly never heard of this religion, oh and it's not recognised by the British government.

<p>When will you people learn to READ??? PHOTOSHOP WAS NOT USED TO CREATE A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE. I can't think of a more simple way to put it. <a href="../../../m/l/c/User%7EMlc409_7c7e.html" title="User:Mlc409">mlc409</a></p>

<dd>mlc409 - I actually agree with you, looking at the quality of the image, the text and what not, I'd say your newspaper article was created using MS Paint. You still have not explained why your scan from the Oldham Evening Chronicle has a totally different typeface (Verdana if I'm not mistaken) to any other extract or scan on the internet. <font color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Kind Regards -</b> <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><b>Heligoland</b></a> | <a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><b>Talk</b></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heligoland_a022.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heligoland"><b>Contribs</b></a></font> 01:36, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't be ridiculous Patstuart. All this means is that I wasn't signed in at the time. My computer signs me out sometimes automatically. It happens, and it doesn't mean I am attempting to deceive people. What I WILL say though, is that I don't have a second username. So lets leave of the detective work and just discuss the actual article shall we?

<p>Thank you for pointing that out - I already knew that, which is one of the reasons I haven't being engaging in such actions.

<dd>I was informing you of Wikipedia policy, which is something you ignore when your article has one source, which is a poor quality scan of a newspaper article. It's not about whether the religion exists, it's if it's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">notable</a>, and it obviously isn't. I think an article on myself has more notability than Janicism. Google turns no results that Janicism is a legit religion.
