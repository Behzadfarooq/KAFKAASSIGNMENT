<p>One of my favourite pages I've AFDed for a long time. I doubt that Wikipedia is the place to have cows. I would write a satirical page Wikipedia:I'm sorry, but we don't allow articles on models of cows, no matter how interesting they may be or WP:NOCOWS... Note to the closing admin. If it's deleted, please can you move the page to User:Dangherous/Gladys the swiss Dairy Cow - seriously, I'm looking to collect quasi-funny deleted articles. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDangherous_d22f.html" title="User:Dangherous">Dangherous</a> 17:52, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>I strongly object to this AFD. Having read wikipedia's deletion criteria, I fail to see the grounds for deletion. Ths subject is a factual discussion of a serious work of art. the images are public domain, and the content is of wide interest to the communit</b>y. The problem here is that I havent had time yet to continue create the content - but I plan to demonstrate the intellectual property, techniques, evolution and and artistic history that is behind Gladys
<p>You see, gladys the swiss dairy cow is in fact a serious and very well known piece of ongoing performance art- having been created in over 50 forms and has appeared on television, been front page news widely circulated publications inclusing the Connecticut Post, on more than a dozen occations, and has been featured in two parades.</p>
<p>An article documenting her development, the artists creative methods and the overall artistic merit is at least as worthy of entry as any other artists work.</p>

<li>Now - maybe somene you can help me on the fine points of wikipedia. I really don't know how to make sure that I have followed the formal criteria to object to the deletion - so if I've midded something I would like to know and I'm not sure what to do to get out of deletion jeopardy - but I'd be glad for your assistance. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.191.43.133 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.191.43.133_a28c.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.191.43.133">contribs</a>) 2006-11-15 01:56:13 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I can appreciate that this is a longstanding family art tradition, but it is a family tradition nonetheless, and I don't see how this particular yard decoration is more notable than, say, my mom's neighbors who decorate their property with half a zillion watts of Christmas lights come December. The newspaper mentions are a good start but these appear to be fluff pieces, not an examination of Gladys as art (<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> requires "multiple non-trivial published works"). Note also <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. A web page would be a much more appropriate place for this.

<li>Uncle G - great comment - I'm really new to WIKI so trying to write the article while addresing wiki-guardians concerns is difficult in real time - especially since I have limited technical abilit in wiki.
<p>I'll investigate the proper refernce help - the current images posted to the AFD debate are designed to serve as proof points that the subject is notable, and have not yet been added to the actual content.</p>
<p>Bikeable and Aaron - the art is more than a family tradition, although you are correct in identifying it as being created by a family of artists. The piece has been featured in charity auctions, present at charity events ( most recently a haunted house/barnyard in Monroe, which was visited by more than 2,000 persons over three days - resulting in more than a ton of non-perishable food donations to a local soup kitchen. The artwork was the subject of an entry into West Haven CT's Cow Parade, and has also been widely photographed</p>
<p>Moreover, the ability to review, understand and perceive art is in itself relatively undefinable, as is the communication of a point of view on art - to you it may be fluff to have dozens of fromt page articles in connecticut papers - I'd disagree.</p>
<p>To my original point, Gladys is a work of art, just like every other piece listed in wikipedia. The details of the development and evolution of this art, the techniques, the outcomes, and the notability of this could very well serve as a living history of a one-day world-famous piece.</p>
<p>From a notability perspective as well, I can document more than two hundred written communications from art critics ( albeit amateur) and recognition by local officals as proof of wide interest and merit. In fact, a float with Gladys as a centerpiece was awarded "Best Appearing Float, Services Club" by the Town of Fairfield's memorial day commitee in 2004 and a similar entry with gladys won "honorable mention in 2005.</p>
<p>So, all in all, an ongoing piece of performance art is definetly more than a once a year christmas display, (although gladys has been a christmas tree complete with an outline of lights)</p>
<p>Just because the topic is light hearted, doesn't mean it is not of encyclopaedic quality.</p>
<p>Give me some time to prove this please.--<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames.lebinski_2692.html" title="User:James.lebinski">James.lebinski</a> 16:59, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You have at least until the AFD discussion period ends, as pointed out above. Please note that private communications to you from art critics do not satisfy our <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> policy. Sources must be <i>published</i>. We need multiple non-trivial published works (e.g. in-depth reviews by established art critics, news articles by journalists, accounts by historians) that discuss this work of art specifically. Again, see the likes of <a href="../../../g/%C3%A4/v/G%C3%A4vle_goat.html#References" title="Gävle goat">Gävle goat#References</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/g/Biggest_ball_of_twine.html#References" title="Biggest ball of twine">Biggest ball of twine#References</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:43, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unfortunately, all these references etc. seem to be local. There are many millions of works of art that are notable purely on a local scale. Merely having been featured on the front page of one's local newspaper cannot qualify something for inclusion in an international encyclopedia. If this is a work of art that has the potential to become famous but is not, in fact, famous <i>now</i>, then unfortunately we simply cannot include it now. When it has <i>become</i> at least nationally recognised, yes, but at present I must regretfully say that I'm not convinced this meets the criteria. (Note to closing admin: if this is eventually deleted, be sure to userfy it so James doesn't completely lose all his hard work.) — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 18:21, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I believe that this passes the multiple non-trivial sources test, and further believe that haleth;'s e notion that a "notability" threshold must be national is flawed. The combined circulation/audience of the publications cited approached one hundred thousand - which is substantial notability. Moreover, while I haven;t actiallu counted the words used to describe this art in the publications, my estimate is that each published article has been between 1000 and 3000 words. There was a professional photographer at my home last evening taking pictures for yet another newspaper arcticle to be rune before christmas so I said potential to be "world famous" . The art is already famous in Connecticut.</p>
<p>In the middle of all this discussion, I'd like to note that I respect and appreciate the feedback- so my efforts will be in complying with the policies of wiki - which I fully expect to achieve--<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames.lebinski_2692.html" title="User:James.lebinski">James.lebinski</a> 18:38, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<b>Check the article first -</b> I found on line-references to suport the notability aspect of this argument - and added them to the article. Multiple sources, multiple journalists, wide publication, I'm on my way to addressing the concerns. How's that Uncle G??????</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I'm not quite sure what to make of this one. On one hand, it looks like it might be mainly of local interest, though a claim to statewide noteworthiness has been made. On the other... it's a quirky article, but it's treated in some depth, and with references. It certainly appears to pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. It is <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIVIA_c4e2.html" title="WP:TRIVIA">interesting</a>. Is it important? We have no guidelines specifically for physical works of art, but taking <a href="../../../f/i/l/WP%7EFILMS_131b.html" title="WP:FILMS">WP:FILMS</a> as an example, it could arguably pass the "subject of multiple non-trivial published works" criterion, and it's also had multiple exhibitions in different parts of the state. Finally, effort is clearly being made to continue to improve the article. In the face of all that, and lacking any strong reason for deletion, I say keep it for now and see how it develops. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 00:23, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Apparently it also won "Best Appearing Float" at CT's largest parade. I'd missed it before, but that's another potential argument to noteworthiness.

</ul>
<p><b>Keep it civil Calton</b> The fact that you do not regard this as a performance art is clear, but there is a saying " de gustibus non-disputandum est" or in English - there is no accounting for taste. A significant number of others disagree with your position.</p>
<p>To the facts/policies here - I have offered proof of wide interest, significant notabiilty and and circulation, and this is in fact an ongoing piece of performance art - so if you would like to debate the facts about that according to Wiki policy, or back up your assertion that the largest circulating newspaper in Southern Ct is "hometown" , or that coverage on the largest cable network in Connecticut is insignificant then lets have that converrsation.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> if verified. This looks and reads far different from the usual vanity trivia; it doesn't sell a PoV; it may be of local/regional interest as opposed to world-wide, but I can understand how it could gravitate towwards wider notability. And as is it's well-enough written, that I doubt as good a job could be done swiftly, if it becomes world-famous. If the final decision is <i>"delete"</i>, may I suggest that it be ported to the author's User page, so that he can archive it, before salting the earth. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 08:13, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
