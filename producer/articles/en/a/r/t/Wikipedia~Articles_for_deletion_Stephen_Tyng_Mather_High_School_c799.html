<li>Well that's funny, because my Concise Oxford Dictionary defines <b>knowledge</b> as <i>1. awareness or familiarity gained by experience, 2. a person's range of information, 2a. a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject, 2b the sum of what is known, and 3. certain understanding as opposed to opinion</i> - while <b>information</b> is defuined as <i>1a. something told; knowledge, 1b. items of knowledge</i> - so it seems that the personal distinction you make between "knowledge" and information" doesn't really accord with extablished definitions.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 23:30, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>If we are debating Jimbo's founding principles we should take note of what he has specifically said about this issue. He once wrote: <i>Let's say I start writing an article about my high school, Randolph School, of Huntsville, Alabama. I could write a decent 2 page article about it, citing information that can easily be verified by anyone who visits their website. Then I think people should relax and accomodate me.

<li>Please don't quote Jimbo out of context. He can speak for himself, and if he doesn't you shouldn't presume to speak for him on this (or any) issue. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 11:35, Apr 4, 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Interjecting</i> Whoa, wait one minute there. Quotation is a source of information for Wikipedia itself. Don't shoot someone for a quote when we use them (paraphrased even) as support for facts. You basically just tossed out the "assume good faith" policy lock, stock, and both barrels. <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 06:56, 2005 Apr 6 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hmm maybe it would be better to leave a little message on his talk page every time a school comes up for Vfd, then we could get his opinion first-hand... <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 12:03, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thank you for pointing this out. Now that we are all aware that our fearless leader's opinion on the subject is in alignment with the "verifiabilty" rather than "notability" position, there should be no further need to endlessly revisit the issue on VFD.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 05:45, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>The quote also seems to imply a position on <i>quality.</i> I don't vote to delete "decent 2 page articles." This currently isn't a "decent 2 page article." If I were convinced that school stubs were consistently being expanded into decent 2 page articles within a reasonable time period, I wouldn't have any quarrel with them.

<li>He couldn't have been clearer. He said that we should relax about the whole thing. Wikipedia sure could do with 500 Jimbos.</li>
<li><i>whut?</i> never delete an article on grounds of poor quality. Why, half of WP would be listed here.

<li>They do not "self repair." People repair them.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not all schools are automatically notable. "More than half the school's students speak English as a second language" is a bit unusual but certainly not unique for an urban school in a big city. No evidence presented that this is more than an average school. Based on their test scores (page 4 of the pdf link), they're below average. And I'll go back to the argument about numbers for why we can't defend articles on every little school article from vandalism. We must make choices. I do not believe this makes the cut. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 04:37, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm beginning to think a) many people have too high of expectations for fast enhancement of articles and b) many people believe a place is not important unless someone important is associated with it, and that because almost noone (%-wise) is important enough to be encyclopedic almost no places (%-wise) are important enough for inclusion. I've seen enough vicious elitist sniping to turn my stomach in the past few hours on here and this just happens to be the crust that broke my tooth and made me say 'enough already!'. It's sooo much easier to tear down than to construct, and many of you (yes, getting personal here) are so darned self-satisfied about how much "junk" you've cut out that you fail to think critically any more; it's just delete this - it's cruft, toss that - it's silly, can that - it's pointless.

<dd>Please re-read <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_perfect_stub_article_271a.html" title="Wikipedia:The perfect stub article">the perfect stub</a>. Stubs are supposed to be <i>short-term.</i> People who just <i>want</i> an article and don't plan to do much serious work on it should make it a <i>requested article,</i> not drop in a stub. <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_perfect_stub_article_271a.html" title="Wikipedia:The perfect stub article">the perfect stub</a> makes the following points:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>the value of a stub is primarily in what it will become.</li>
<li>"Don't assume that additions and improvements will immediately pour in of themselves" (some school inclusionists <b>do</b> seem to assume this);</li>
<li>The time frame cited is "a few weeks," as in "If nobody contributes to your stub for a few weeks, roll up your sleeves and expand it yourself."</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>It's ironic that you should endeavor to educate me on the role of stubs and their "life cycle"; I've been part of the stub-sorting Project and the ref and fact checking Project for a while now.

<dd>The improvements might not just roll in like a tidal wave, but some of us school-inclusionists do more than just vote; I can see that, on this page, <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/c/User%7EYuckfoo_5ab6.html" title="User:Yuckfoo">Yuckfoo</a>, GRider and <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">myself</a> have progressively been improving it. The page was created less than a week ago; I have confidence that it will be de-stubified rather soon. There are plenty of stubs out there which have languished for years. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">BaronLarf</a> 17:00, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)

<li>The VfD and Deletion Consensus decisions on <a href="../../../r/a/r/Rare_Candy_81e7.html" title="Rare Candy">Rare Candy</a> were to merge it with other Pokemon items.
