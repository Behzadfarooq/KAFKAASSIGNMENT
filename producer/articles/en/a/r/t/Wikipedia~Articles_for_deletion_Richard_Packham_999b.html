<li>Uneasy keep: What's there isn't exactly POV, but what's <i>not</i> there is certainly noticeable. How prominent has he been? Has he been the target of litigation? Has he been active in legislation? What are the <i>effects</i> and what is the <i>context</i> of the facts given in the article? I can't say "cleanup," because that will do no good, but I have to say that it's a very unhappy keep vote. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:27, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>In doubt, thus weak keep by default. The main problem I have is that everything I find is essentially autobiographical. It would really help if some secondary source had something—anything—to say about him. As it is, it's hard to establish <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> when the only source of information is the subject himself. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 04:25, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep or merge</b> He does seem to be well-known in this particular area...maybe merge it with Mormonism? (just as anti-Scientology sites are mentioned in the Scientology article. <a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie">Jasmol</a> 04:45, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b>.</s> I can't presume notability when the article doesn't prove it and very little turns up on a search. If this foundation were a significant presence then they should have been able to get at least local Oregon press coverage. Anti-Scientology has a significant presence that the Scientologists have to contend with. Unless this ex-Mormon movement proves itself as an actual <i>movement</i> it seems disrespectful to move it onto the article about a known religion. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 06:27, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I guess I can't vote since I am the one submitting the article. But about the previous user's message -- are we discussing whether or not a significant ex-Mormon movement exists or are we discussing whether or not Richard Packham is noteworthy enough to merit a wikipedia entry? I thought it was the latter, not the former -- especially since a wikipedia entry already exists for <a href="../../../e/x/-/Ex-Mormon_d60e.html" title="Ex-Mormon">Ex-Mormon</a>. If we can agree that the Ex-Mormon movement is legitimate, then Richard Packham would have to be one of the more prominent members of that movement. I'm not sure what search terms the previous user was looking for or seearching on but finding information about the ex-Mormon movement is as easy as Googling "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ex+mormon" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=ex+mormon" rel="nofollow">ex mormon</a>" (the 1st link is to www.exmormon.org, the "Recovery From Mormonism" list which currently has a link to the Exmormon Foundation prominently posted on their front page. The 7th link is a link to a Richard Packham webpage). Of course, googling "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ex+mormon+foundation" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=ex+mormon+foundation" rel="nofollow">ex mormon foundation</a>", being more specific, will produce even better results. It is not surprising to me that not a lot shows up associated with Oregon and the Ex-Mormon foundation because the majority of the Foundation's activities, including annual conferences, typically happen in Salt Lake City. <a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJaromsmith_9acb.html" title="User:Jaromsmith">Jarom Smith</a> 07:26, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well in that case I'm probably still too much of a newbie to be able to talk intelligently about this. It seems that the consensus is to <b>Merge</b> into Ex-Mormonism and perhaps with an edit to make it more NPOV, which is fine by me. I did the best I could but I appreciate the help from the community. Just for grins, though, would the community like to take a look at <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Lindsay_b049.html" title="Jeff Lindsay">Jeff Lindsay</a>'s page and perhaps do the same thing? Jeff and Richard are more or less peers on opposite sides of the ideological fence. Within their respective communities, I would say they have roughly the same stature/standing (and therefore, would merit more or less the same level of mention in Wikipedia). That's my opinion, of course... and when it comes to this stuff I am definitely not neutral. <a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJaromsmith_9acb.html" title="User:Jaromsmith">Jarom Smith</a> 02:53, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or merge with <a href="../../../e/x/-/Ex-Mormon_d60e.html" title="Ex-Mormon">Ex-Mormon</a>. I personally know Richard and agree with Jerom, Richard is one of the original gray beards of the ex-mormon movement. He is not only a true skeptic, but relies on the scientic inquiry method that focuses on fact and reason to peel back the layers of an argument to try and arrive at the truth. Richard has spent the last decade using the Internet to share researched data and information that has been largely unavailable or repressed by The Mormon Church in order to highlight thousands of inaccurate details and errors regarding the Mormon Church, its origins and doctrine. Many have thanked Richard for helping them to have access to this data. By the way, Ex-mormonism is a bonafide movement. Also, the Mormon church was considered a cult, not an established church, until just 50 years ago. Until recently, its claim to be the fastest growing church in the world had been patently accepted. Today, we know that claim is plain just false and wishful PR. <i>This is Rshiveley (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rshiveley_e51a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rshiveley">contribs</a>)'s second edit.</i></li>

<li><b>Reply</b>: I'm not sure but I think you misread my note. I did not say it was his second <i>vote</i> but rather his second <i>edit</i>. Arguments from editors with low edit counts are still considered, but they have to be weighed carefully because often editors without enough experience misunderstand the AfD process and argue the wrong criteria for why an article should be kept/deleted. For instance, it may be true that Richard Packham "is not only a true skeptic, but relies on the scientic inquiry method that focuses on fact and reason to peel back the layers of an argument to try and arrive at the truth" -- but what does that have to do with whether an article separate from <a href="../../../e/x/-/Ex-Mormon_d60e.html" title="Ex-Mormon">Ex-Mormon</a> is merited? Mistaking "X is good" for "X should have an article" is a classic mistake made by those who don't yet understand just what the goals of Wikipedia's deletion policies are. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 03:52, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

To say that both of their <b>views</b> should be represented, that if one view is represented then so should the other be, is <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>.
