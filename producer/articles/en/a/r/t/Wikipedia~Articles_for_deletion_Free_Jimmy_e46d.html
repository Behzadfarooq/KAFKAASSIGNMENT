<li><b>Strong keep</b> Seems to have some fairly big names attached like Woody Harrelson and Kyle MacLachlan.

<li><b>Keep</b> Based on the description, and the voice cast of the English version, I think I might like to go see this one when it comes out here. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:07, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. I believe KernelPanic has nominated this article, which I am the starter of and main contributor to, in bad faith to retaliate against my <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_IRCDig_0b4d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/IRCDig">successful nomination of IRCDig</a> (see also his following <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html#IRCDig" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKing_of_Hearts_d108.html#IRCDig" title="User talk:King of Hearts">here</a> where he designates "deletion nazis"). In the alternative, he should explain which Wikipedia policy his nomination is referring to. <a href="../../../h/a/a/User%7EHaakon_f760.html" title="User:Haakon">Haakon</a> 19:31, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> Article content seems objective and not advertising-related. Celebrity cast is significant.

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<ul>
<li><b>Note</b> No bad faith nomination at all. It is somewhat of a coincidence that this user was the author but this was not a target for retaliation. I do not feel it is notable enough for a wikipedia article. It is at best a weak stub for an unheard of film. May also want to look into some of these usernames, I suspect most of them belong to the same person. Your use of slanderous terms like "bad faith nomination" does not make a stronger argument for your case <a href="../../../h/a/a/User%7EHaakon_f760.html" title="User:Haakon">Haakon</a>. Oh and by the way, I was not even the author of the IRCDig article so how can you say this was a bad faith, retaliation nomination? Your just using games to try and keep your non-notable article.

<dd>You still haven't cited what part of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> that it fails. It has a full imdb listing and has voice work from major Hollywood actors. As for your allegations that some of these usernames belong to the same person, the contribution histories should clear up any doubts (every other user aside from you has at least 500 edits on a wide variety of articles). <b><a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie">OhNo</a><a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie"><font color="#D47C14">itsJamie</font></a><a href="../../../o/h/n/User_talk%7EOhnoitsjamie_2359.html" title="User talk:Ohnoitsjamie"><sup>Talk</sup></a></b> 23:46, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> is NOT an official policy on wikipedia and therefore proof of failure is not required to be elected as nn. You say that the movie has "voice work from major Hollywood actors" but the fact that these so-called major Hollywood actors had to get voice over work in a Norwegian animated film should tell you just how "major" they are NOT. Furthermore I find it pretty funny that in my nomination for deletion of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_BitTorrent_search_engine_eb86.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/BitTorrent search engine">BitTorrent search engine</a> that <a href="../../../h/a/a/User%7EHaakon_f760.html" title="User:Haakon">Haakon</a> agrees fully but when it comes down to an article that he authored that is even less notable than the bittorent one he is up in arms and casting slanderous comments out to redirect attention away from deletion of HIS article. Bottom line, the movie is weak and the article about is even worse. NN accusation is valid and should not be dismissed. KernelPanic 03:35, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If providing the English voice acting for a foreign animated film makes you not a major Hollywood actor, that's certainly going to be news to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Mononoke_50fa.html" title="Princess Mononoke">Billy Bob Thornton, Claire Danes and Minnie Driver</a>, as well as to <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howl%27s_Moving_Castle_%28film%29_12ba.html" title="Howl's Moving Castle (film)">Billy Crystal, Lauren Bacall and Christian Bale</a>. - <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 21:23, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongest possible keep</b>. Is this a joke? Is a film not notable if YOU haven't heard of it? Perhaps you haven't heard of this film because <i>you don't live in Norway</i>. It is notable not just for getting a lot of press in that country, but for being Norway's first computer-animated film. Please, don't nominate any more articles for deletion until you are QUITE SURE that they are not notable. Remember that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a> - it is far better for them to have an article about a film like this than to not have it. This is one of Wikipedia's strengths (that it has articles on even the obscure things) and it is what separates it from other encyclopedias. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 07:05, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Further comment</b>: I've just read all of the replies here, and I must say that KernelPanic does not come off well. Being bitter is one thing, but lying about your motivations and accusing us all of sockpuppetry is no way to get respect from others (unless you know how to do it well, which doesn't seem to be the case here). It seems pretty clear to me that this was a bad faith nomination, and your attempts to explain this amazing coincidence away were less than convincing. I suspect that the only thing you have accomplished is to draw attention to yourself as a potential troublemaker - expect your edit history to be closely watched over the next while, if not by me then surely by someone else. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 07:17, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
