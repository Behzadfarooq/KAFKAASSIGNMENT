<li><b>Keep</b> The reason for keeping the article is actually in the nomination itself. It's on Keenspot, an independent for-profit syndicate for webcomics, which means it meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> clause 3. (I won't budge on this issue, so express your concerns with a separate recommendation, not a comment to this one.) It should be renamed to God Mode (webcomic) though, since the term is far older than the comic itself. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 15:10, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it does get kept, I agree it definitely needs moving. Having two articles differing in capitalisation is bad enough, but since it appears the "God Mode" capitalisation is sometimes used in relation to the gaming term, and that's both older and more widely used, it's definitely a bad idea. (I spotted and corrected a link to the wrong "God Mode" article in a Doom-related article earlier when looking through "what links here".) - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakomk_1f87.html" title="User:Makomk">makomk</a> 18:40, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It should be pointed out that the above keep is based on incomplete information. As described below, the creator of God Mode, Chris Cosby, is a co-founder of Keenspace; as such, its position in Keenspace specifically does <i>not</i> meet the third clause of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which requires that it be distributed through a site that is both "well known and <i>independent of the creators</i>." --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 20:08, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No Vote</b>. Curiously, back when <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> was being (re)written (back before webcomics dropped off the page), its "independent distributor" clause was there more or less for the express purpose of keeping Keenspot strips.

<li><b>Keep</b> It is notable. God Mode has been published in print as a 32-page cover feature of a Free Comic Book Day issue (Comic Genesis 2006), with a circulation of tens of thousands of copies. Additionally, God Mode was created by Keenspot co-founder and Superosity and Sore Thumbs creator Chris Crosby, who many consider to be a notable figure in webcomics. Crosby pays Ryan Kerns a page rate to produce the comic as work-for hire, which is highly unusual and notable for a webcomic. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.35.99.246 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.35.99.246_cfdd.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.35.99.246">contribs</a>) 22:03, July 5, 2006.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Abe and 66.35.99.246. The comic meets the non-trivial publishing for webcomics, furthermore there has been a printed version, again meeting the requirements. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberSkull_302c.html" title="User:CyberSkull">Dread Lord CyberSkull</a> <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberSkull_40df.html" title="User talk:CyberSkull">✎☠</a> 06:19, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_mode.html" title="God mode">God mode</a>.

Article has no reliable sources and my attempts to find any in my library have turned up nothing (although I've learned a lot about a vastly more notable yet still incredibly non-notable Ryan Kern who is president of the Monaco Air Duluth Airshow).

<li><strike>I (still) reckon it's probably essentially impossible to do what you're asking in terms of sources for any webcomic (even, say, <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a>) and any attempt to try will result in an outdated and incomplete article. In fact, the only webcomic article I've seen so far that achieved this is <a href="../../../w/h/e/When_I_Am_King_8ff1.html" title="When I Am King">When I Am King</a>, and it had severe problems (mainly the fact that it consisted mainly of quotes and provided next-to-no information about the webcomic), though those weren't entirely a result of this - and that was a comic that's no longer updated, apparently got a reasonable amount of media attention, and clearly meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> for that reason. Most of the webcomic articles (even ones that clearly meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>) don't stand a chance. You may well have a point about notability though; however it's somewhat debatable as to whether it meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criterion 3 (depends if Keenspot counts as "an online publisher" or whether it's more of an invitation-only webcomic community with its own private hosting service attached - it seems to be something of a hybrid AFAICT, which makes life a bit difficult - and there's the slight complication that it was apparently created by a Keenspot co-founder). This could be a bit tricky; maybe I should've started with something clearer-cut.</strike> - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakomk_1f87.html" title="User:Makomk">makomk</a> 19:59, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Regarding <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a>, it (like many other webcomics) easily meets our standards for verifiability and reliable sources -- the article already uses The New York Times as a source, and a quick look in my library shows other articles from The San Diego Union-Tribune, Publishers Weekly, South Bend Tribune, The Tennessean, etc. Regarding <a href="../../../w/h/e/When_I_Am_King_8ff1.html" title="When I Am King">When I Am King</a>, yes, it needs expansion; that's why I tagged it as a stub. Its importance, however, has been clearly established by reliable sources. This article, on the other hand, has no real claim of importance and no third-party reliable sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy, and therefore ought to be deleted. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 03:02, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a> uses the New York Times as a source for one small, minor part of the article (the bit about it requiring a certain amount of "obscure knowledge"); the rest of the article cannot be supported by information in the NYT article (or the Iowa State Daily one) and mainly seems to use megatokyo.com itself as a source (which is pretty much par for the course, unfortunately). <strike>Unless it's something like This Is Home, deleting webcomic articles on verifiability grounds is probably a bad idea - this is best decided on the basis of notability alone, if possible (and the article does have some issues there).</strike> - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakomk_1f87.html" title="User:Makomk">makomk</a> 10:37, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sorry - had a slight confusion of the difference between policy (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), guidelines (<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>) and random essays that are neither (<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>). It doesn't help that the guidelines seem to reflect actual practice in this area better than the policy does, and that the two apparently contradict each other in some situations. Thanks to <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> clearing the matter up. - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakomk_1f87.html" title="User:Makomk">makomk</a> 16:00, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, assuming that Chris Cosby was the person who created this comic, because Chris Cosby is a notable figure (co-founder of Keenspot is a notable achievement) meaning this comic would satisfy the WP:WEB requirement in that respect.

<li>None of the three criteria of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> (1. multiple non-trvial sources, 2. Well-known awards, or 3. Well-known non-trivial distribution) support the idea that everything a "notable figure" does is somehow notable. Even the most notable people do non-notable things all the time. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 17:14, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Since we agree the creator of the comic is notable, then I would also support a <b>merge</b> with the comic info going onto Chris Cosby's author page as an entry about other things he's done, besides helping to create Keenspot.
