<p>Article about some strange meditation technique. It would appear to have been mentioned in two newspaper articles, but I don't think that constitutes notability. It is also written in some garbled language which bears only the most superficial resemblance to English: 'The principles of the Path that are pillaring, lead to and from the Spiritual Unfoldment meditation are the Unfoldment of the Heart, the finding of Greater happiness, a life of Philosophy that is a living philosophy under a non-denominational / non-sectarian spectrum'. Wikipedia would be a much better place without this article, as well as the article on the <a href="../../../f/i/s/FISU_%28Foundation_for_International_Spiritual_Unfoldment%29_06b6.html" title="FISU (Foundation for International Spiritual Unfoldment)">non-notable group who promote this activity</a> and the <a href="../../../g/u/r/Gururaj_Ananda_Yogi_b7f3.html" title="Gururaj Ananda Yogi">chap who came up with the idea</a>. In essence, this is spam and we don't need it.

<li>Hello, i don't think it should be removed since it's been practiced by thousands of people who have seen these benefits. Also, as for the benefits of meditation concern shortly links will be added from medical articles proving these theories. How can Gururaj Ananda Yogi be removed from here when his profile is accepted by Wikipedia terms in the spanish version? <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gururaj_Ananda_Yogi" class="external free" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gururaj_Ananda_Yogi" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gururaj_Ananda_Yogi</a> .

<li>I would also like to add that FISU's method of teaching meditation for Spiritual Unfoldment are unique in the world. They have taught over 100,000 people in the UK and a similar amount in America plus many thousands more in European countries and Autralia. I totally disagree that Wikipedia would be a better place without this article. I think those comments are even predujuice or make by someone who has not discovered the spiritual path. Our methods of Spiritual Unfolmdent are unique and indivually prescribed for each person that comes to learn. There is no such organsiation in the world with our track record or achievements. W&gt;e plan to post many more article and newspapers write us from over the years to prove our case.<small>— Fisuuk (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fisuuk_de7f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fisuuk">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<p><b>On the other hand...</b></p>
<p>Greetings. This is regarding the initial comments of the debate, by user <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenkreuz_8bdd.html" title="User:Rosenkreuz">Rosenkreuz</a>. I hope this helps to clear up some things.</p>
<p>If you find this meditation technique "strange", then probably you may find all meditations techniques "strange" if you have never practiced meditation.</p>
<p>This is already an existing opinion that consider "all these things from the east" as "strange", especially in the western world. You may share that opinion as well and this is respected. Nevertheless, it's a personal opinion.</p>
<p>If you consider as "garbled language" which bears "only the most superficial resemblance to English" as anything you do not comprehend and share, it is, again, your own right and opinion. Maybe you will consider "garbled language" what it says <a href="../../../m/e/d/Meditation.html" title="Meditation">here</a>? Please note that the translation of eastern texts and notions in English is indeed a "tricky" business. You would be amazed what obscure words and sentences are used by scholars in order to accurately transfer the meaning e.g. from ancient <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> texts to English. As a prominent example of "garbled language", please see the translations of Thomas Cleary on ancient Zen documents - and Thomas Cleary is a recognized leading authority on ancient Zen transcripts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I will have to disagree with the crude labeling. This "language" that is used in the specific article text was reviewed by native English speakers that share common interest into Meditation for Spiritual Unfoldment and was approved.</p>
<p>About the lacking of media references, there are references regarding this article (and the other related articles), but those I personally have are not properly dated. There was a request for the community to help, as myself and other mates are sorting out the references.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Gururaj Ananda Yogi wasn't the "chap" that "came up with the idea". At least please check <a href="../../../u/n/f/Unfoldment.html" title="Unfoldment">Unfoldment</a>. People and movements like <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Kant_5dcb.html" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein.html" title="Einstein">Einstein</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> are not just some "chaps that came up with this idea" of Unfoldment.</p>
<p>I am terribly sorry for the misconceptions and the prejudiced language that was used.</p>
<p>Please also note, that in the past there were some ongoing discussions regarding notability etc of these articles and the result yielded for these articles to remain as such. The truth is that the community did not contributed as much as it should, maybe because of the notion that "since the articles were "approved" once, updating is not so urgent". But is seems that we need to update them ASAP, in order to avoid future misunderstandings.</p>
<p>So, expect more updates.</p>
<p>Thank you. Apologizing for any discomfort caused.</p>
<p>MarekTT 15:22, 26 January 2007 (UTC)<small>— MarekTT (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarekTT_3c10.html" title="User talk:MarekTT">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MarekTT_4380.html" title="Special:Contributions/MarekTT">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<dd>The English in the article is indeed mangled, but that is no indicator of the conceptual depth of the topic; it is the product of someone who cannot speak the language properly. If the language was, as you say, 'reviewed' by native English speakers, then they are either lying about their home language or not very good at it, because the language truly is very bad indeed. But that's incidental, really, since if the subject matter merited an encyclopaedia article, the language could be fixed. Incidentally, Einstein most certainly did not come up with the idea of 'unfoldment', and nor did Kant. Please don't misrepresent the status of your beliefs. If they are valid, they ought to stand on their own, without spurious references to well-known thinkers. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenkreuz_8bdd.html" title="User:Rosenkreuz">Rosenkreuz</a> 15:31, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Nope. no lying here. I really have no reason for that, I wouldn't waste my time in lying, I prefer doing things that I believe I enjoy much more than that. In the meantime, a team including myself are trying to be constructive and update the pages in question, in order to clear things up.</dd>
</dl>
<p>About the rest, please read <a href="../../../u/n/f/Unfoldment.html" title="Unfoldment">Unfoldment</a> more carefully, because that article as well displays some "spurious references to well-known thinkers". If you do not agree with <a href="../../../u/n/f/Unfoldment.html" title="Unfoldment">Unfoldment</a>'s "spurious references to well-known thinkers" then you are most welcomed to express it and if you still wish to call me a liar, then please do because it's really not something I consider harmful for me.</p>
<p>I will come back to the discussion in the light of the new content that will be added in the next 24 hours, or if someone wishes to help us out.</p>
<p>So, whoever wants to delete any articles is most welcomed to do it. For two long years we have been fighting with the <a href="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk" rel="nofollow">Charity Commission for England and Wales</a>, having to deal with similar mentalities, but in the end it was a <a href="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?regno=1061185&amp;submit=Run+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?regno=1061185&amp;submit=Run+Search" rel="nofollow">success</a>. And whoever dealt with the Commission knows very well what it takes to be approved as a <i>UK Registered Charity</i>: after exhaustive check, you have to be be proven 100% clear and with rightful purposes in order to be registered. So if you really think that our "chaps" and "garbled language" have actually managed to deceive the Commission (that in effect represents the British Public), then please report us using the Commission's <a href="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/tcc/complaints.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/tcc/complaints.asp" rel="nofollow">complaints form ("Dissatisfied with our decision?")</a> and tell them that some "chaps" managed to deceive them with their "indeed garbled language".</p>
<p>We will just have to deal with this as well, no matter how long it will take; it's just a matter of time because the determination to set things straight will not deteriorate. In the meantime, why not be amused in <a href="http://www.fisu.org" class="external text" title="http://www.fisu.org" rel="nofollow">here</a>?</p>

<dd>I don't appreciate your passive-aggressive stance, MarekTT. The article on 'unfoldment' is an appalling mess, and full of original research. It does indeed mention Einstein, stating that he had an affinity for Buddhism, a dubious fact which needs a citation. The fact is, many people are not really very aware of the intricacies of the philosophical debate between Niels Bohr and Einstein regarding quantum mechanics, but more than a few second-rate popularisations of science, many of which focus on Bohmian mechanics, take comments of Einstein out of all context. I was not accusing you of lying. I merely believe that you are misinformed if you think that Einstein came up with the idea of unfoldment a la David Bohm (in fact, Einstein dismissed Bohm's work as being 'cheap', and for that I <i>can</i> provide a citation).</dd>
<dd>I have no intention of reporting anyone to any boards or anything. The Commission does not judge any institution on the objective validity of its spiritual practices; it merely makes sure that institutions are not set up to make people money. Being a non-profit entity does not make an organisation, or practice, <i>de facto</i> notable. And what is being discussed here is the notability, not the validity, of spiritual unfoldment. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenkreuz_8bdd.html" title="User:Rosenkreuz">Rosenkreuz</a> 17:40, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>No Rozenkreuz what you discussed is the validity of the spiritual unfoldment(read your very first comments at the top)where you say: "Wikipedia would be a much better place without this article..." and about a chap who came with this idea. I think your comments shows a prejudice on our organisation. If you don't understand what a meditation organization is all about and how it works how can you judge of what we are trying to do here. All your comments shows your confusion about the subject.

<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete pending citation of further sources</b>, no claim of notability in the article, questionable whether existing sources are enough to provide verifiability. The first "reference" is from UKPRwire, and is just the group's promotional release, not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. The second "reference" is the group's own website, also not the kind of source that can establish notability. That leaves the article with just two mentions in a single Cyprus newspaper. Perhaps there are multiple featured coverage in reliable sources, but this article should be kept only if some are found and cited. Before I get accused of hating and being at war, I'm not making any value judgment about the group or its practices; I meditate, especially to avoid getting upset with people who think that their most important function is getting their special interest covered in Wikipedia. Such a priority leads people to suspect that the true goal is promotion, not spiritual improvement. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 21:24, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>OK, it's true that we could spare both epithets and passive-aggressive stands. It seems that all speak but none actually listens to each other, so I only have a definite comment to make, at least for now. If we look at the history of the articles in question; when they were first created they were merely stubs, but nevertheless there was some discussion going on on whether they should exist or not. Some were deleted and then revived, tagged, marked for deletion, deleted again, and then revived and so on... At a final phase, the discussions yielded that these articles would remain (no consensus and stuff). Eventually all tags and markings for deletions and notability were all (maybe but one) removed, and the articles were "clean". It seemed then that they would be allowed to exist and gradually be developed in time. Then we come now, after less than a month, with no much initial debate, within less than 24 hours, two articles are marked and deleted (Jasmini Ananda, Rajesh Ananda), and suddenly, when all articles were "clean" and seemed that would just "let be", are marked for deletion, to be merged and so on. At this point, I really do not want to repeat the discussions that took place less than a month ago, because what is said was said, and the turnout was that these articles would remain. So, the twofold ladies and gentlemen, is whether these articles will remain, let some voices heard and be given a chance to grow?- Or delete the articles and silence those opinions expressed in them? I realize that the articles are not (were not) perfect, much more info was yet to be added and the community participation was not as massive as expected, but I think they have potential, they do constitute notability (that yes, has to be proven) and therefore my opinion is to stay, let them be and let them grow. In the case they are deleted, then as community of people interested into this domain we must prepare a proper more "reinforced" articles before we actually upload them and definitely draw the community's attention to it so there is a steady and healthy participation. I am calling off for tonight, have a good one.

<li><b>No deletion</b>.I think the articles constitute a satisfactory degree of notability, because they have sufficient references . I have personally read all the books published by Gururaj Ananda Yogi and I have found them really interesting.I also disagree that the articles should be deleted because Meditation for spiritual unfoldment is practiced by a large number or people. I personally know more than a 100 people practising the techniques of Gururaj Ananda Yogi and noticing tremendus changes in their way of thinking changing their lives for the better.I should say that before you condemn something you should first try it.Spiritualbutterfly 22:17, 27 January 2007 (UTC)<small>— Spiritualbutterfly (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Spiritualbutterfly_f318.html" title="Special:Contributions/Spiritualbutterfly">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> No that's not the case Kesh. In the 'Books and References' section the books 'In Tune with the Infinity', 'Wholeness and the Implicate Order' and 'The Undivided Universe' are secondary sources because their authors don't perform the practice. Especially the last two books approach this philosophy from the scientific point of view. Yet don't forget that the primary sources used here represent thousand of people around the globe. Only <a href="../../../f/i/s/FISU_%28Foundation_for_International_Spiritual_Unfoldment%29_06b6.html" title="FISU (Foundation for International Spiritual Unfoldment)">FISU (Foundation for International Spiritual Unfoldment)</a> has 60 centres in 9 countries and it continues growing very fast. As for the merging of the individual societies DGG, <a href="../../../m/e/d/Meditation_for_Spiritual_Unfoldment_492d.html" title="Meditation for Spiritual Unfoldment">Meditation for Spiritual Unfoldment</a> is a distinct method of meditation. FISU, as an organization, only utilizes this method. So these notions constitute two distinct issues, therefore it is suggested not to be merged but to be kept as two distinct articles. FISU's article will expand.

<li><b>strong keep</b> In this debat I wish to contribut with a citation from Gururaj Ananda Yogi:</li>
</ul>
<p>" Is a meditator foolish or is he a fool? Why meditate? Most people are forever seeking a joy in life, and to seek joy of life one has to be an innocent fool. For in that foolishness brings the very joy that you want. So rather be a foolfilled meditator than a concentrated one. Concentration is a mental quality but a true meditator has heart quality. Would you like your mind to be filled with foolishness or would you like your Heart to be filed with innocence? If the mind is filled with various thoughts, that mind be sure to know, rambles on from thought to thought and ends up in contemplation and not meditation. Contemplation leads to analysis, where one thought battles with the other and this creates conflict. But in meditation one is freed from the conflicts created from the mind. So be a fool! In systematic meditation the very foolishness brings fullness, where you, being a fool, as I am, would learn to enjoy yourself. Get away from the mind. For in getting away you rid yourself of all attachments and cravings, and what you are left with then is the true fool, and only that fool can ever know the meaning of fullness. The fool in his foolishness becomes fulfilled in his innocence." ...Gururaj Ananda Yogi...March 1986. This man started the Foundation and FISU is going on with the work he started.This is NOT a "wallet garden", this is the "proof of the pudding, which lies in the eating"--- eat it and know.(User Jacha 28.01.2007)<small>— Jacha (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jacha_5a51.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jacha">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

I also stress that these 3 articles (<a href="../../../g/u/r/Gururaj_Ananda_Yogi_b7f3.html" title="Gururaj Ananda Yogi">here</a>,<a href="../../../m/e/d/Meditation_for_Spiritual_Unfoldment_492d.html" title="Meditation for Spiritual Unfoldment">here</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/s/FISU_%28Foundation_for_International_Spiritual_Unfoldment%29_06b6.html" title="FISU (Foundation for International Spiritual Unfoldment)">here</a>) they may have a relation, but by no means they are corporate belongings or trademarks of a sole organization (in this case, <a href="../../../f/i/s/FISU_%28Foundation_for_International_Spiritual_Unfoldment%29_06b6.html" title="FISU (Foundation for International Spiritual Unfoldment)">FISU</a>'s). Each entity (person or organization) can use the teachings of <a href="../../../g/u/r/Gururaj_Ananda_Yogi_b7f3.html" title="Gururaj Ananda Yogi">Gururaj Ananda Yogi</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/d/Meditation_for_Spiritual_Unfoldment_492d.html" title="Meditation for Spiritual Unfoldment">Meditation for Spiritual Unfoldment</a> (that btw, it wasn't something created by him), as they please. And they do. In fact, some use it very differently from each other (but that's another story - if members of other organizations found out about this discussion it would go on forever). Anyway, a simple search at Amazon yields these books (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_w_h_/026-2414735-7721244?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=spiritual+unfoldment&amp;Go.x=16&amp;Go.y=12&amp;Go=Go" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_w_h_/026-2414735-7721244?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=spiritual+unfoldment&amp;Go.x=16&amp;Go.y=12&amp;Go=Go" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) and they are from different authors, different point of views (some their commonality may not go any further from the title) and so on. Also, a more thorough examination of the current references (books, external links, websites etc) can show that they are referred from different sources (organizations, societies, individual authors etc) and also some of them are not related / directly related (solely) to meditation, nor meditation to spiritual unfoldment. Anyway, those books that were found will be used (for content, as references and so on). Please keep comments coming.

<p><b>No Deletion</b> <i>The mind is a Universe. Meditation can be used as a vehicle to explore and understand it. To go through all the layers and reach the "Source", the "Oneness", the "Wholeness".

<li><b>strong keep</b> Substance is of the essence. Beeing aquainted with the methods and teachings of Gururaj Ananda Yogi and the wast library of spiritual teachings as can be found at <a href="http://www.fisu.org/acatalog/Gururaj_Ananda_s_Tapes.html" class="external free" title="http://www.fisu.org/acatalog/Gururaj_Ananda_s_Tapes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fisu.org/acatalog/Gururaj_Ananda_s_Tapes.html</a> it would seem very clear that Gururaj has his given place in any encyclopedia. I can find no qualitative difference between Gururajs writings and talks and those of Vivekananda, Ramakrishna, Rumi and Milarepa whom all are represented and rightly so in the wikipedia. Possible flaws in the language are no argument for deletion (and doesn't bother me personnally being natively Finnish/Swedish). These and and other superficial issues can easily be corrected and should be. The beauty of the wikipedia is it's evolution. Hopfully towards something we would refer to as Truth.

<li>I disagree. I find the desultoriness of jumping into such conclusions rather disappointing. If the search is performed without the quotes then the results are tens of thousands. Just because there is not an exact matching, (as this diversity was already mentioned), it does not mean that the same / mostly the same thing is not expressed in many other close terms. And in this case, it does. I really find most unnecessary to repeat (but it seems it is needed) about the importance of a thorough examination of ALL books, links, references, websites and whatever else is mentioned in these articles, before jumping and expressing with such a crude way into these kind of incendiary conclusions. So I plea for one more time to those that want to post an opinion: before doing as such <i>please carefully review <b>all</b> the books, references, websites (AND their content), other related wikipedia articles etc that are mentioned in the articles</i>. It is most unfair to spend half a minute for a mere hasty and non deictic Google search where others have spent so much more time and effort into this. People can also understand an argument without the use of the word "crap"; not exactly the most helpful thing. Thank you. MarekTT 01:01, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
