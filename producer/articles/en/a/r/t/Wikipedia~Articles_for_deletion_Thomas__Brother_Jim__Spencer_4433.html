<li><b>Delete</b>. as per no sources beyond an obit and, most importantly, nothing to indicate a need for inclusion.

<li><b>Comment</b> There are many lawyers, professors, and teachers who have biographies on Wikipedia, but very few ministers. There are only about 15 Southern Baptist ministers with bios. Pastor Spencer was a substantial minister in the central Louisiana area for three decades. I will try to get more information this week. Here's hoping you won't delete him just yet. I looked over the list for deletion, and I must say that nearly everything there on first appearance looked as if it did not belong. -- Billy Hathorn 14:02, 4 July 2006
<ul>
<li>What you have to remember is that, to be included, verifiable notability must be established. I am certain that some of the lawyers, professors, and teachers you mention do not belong in Wikipedia. Likewise, I am sure there are ministers who <i>do</i> belong, but have yet to be added. The key to adding a successful article to this encyclopedia is the notability of the individual to a broad population. If the person is only notable to a specific, limited number of people, then the person's article is likely to come up for this kind of review. --<a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENMChico24_74ee.html" title="User:NMChico24">NMChico24</a> 02:10, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Here is a link under "Teachers" that I pulled from random:<br />
Paul Geisert was a biology teacher in Chicago in the 1960s, a professor in the 1970s, an entrepreneur and writer in the 1980s, and the co-developer of learning materials and a web sites for teaching religion in the public schools in the 1990s. He also attended the Godless March which subsequently led to his coining of the noun bright and co-directorship of The Brights Net.<br />

<br />
How is this person more worthy of inclusion that a pastor known throughout central Louisiana? -- Billy Hathorn
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Here is another person under "American academics" who would seem to have notability only within his academic area. In fact, he is an ADJUNCT professor at Rice. Pastor Spencer was in the field for some four decades. It seems to me that we are setting a higher bar for ministers than for other professions.<br />

<li>Here's another entry under "Christian pastors" that in my view is not stronger than the one for Pastor Spencer here:<br />
<br />
Apostle Arturo Skinner, known as the "Father of Deliverance" in black Pentecostal circles, founded the Deliverance Evangelistic Center of Brooklyn, New York, in the 1950s and founded other churches, or centers, in cities such as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Newark, New Jersey; and other large and small cities up and down the East Coast. Skinner's ministry, which Pentecostal in nature, focused on salvation and divine healing. There was also a strong element of the prophetic in Skinner's ministry and in the ministries of the evangelists and other clergy who received ecclesiastical training at his centers.<br />
<br />
Hundreds of pastors credit Skinner, also known as "Apostle Skinner," as their spiritual guide as well as for being the man under whom their ministries started. Skinner is believed to be the first Pentecostal to employ the title apostle as an indicator of the spiritual gifts at work in his churches. This use has been emulated by many of his spiritual sons and daughters as well as by people unaffiliated with his movement, and even by some who are unfamiliar with his name and history altogether.<br />
