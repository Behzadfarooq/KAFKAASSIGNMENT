<p>1. After <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Shefman_7f72.html" title="Alan Shefman">Alan Shefman</a>'s son <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">User:Pm_shef</a> writes that he will abstain from editing articles related to Vaughan politics, and confirmed that abstention at 05:55, 11 April 2006 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:VaughanWatch&amp;diff=47914650&amp;oldid=47914585" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:VaughanWatch&amp;diff=47914650&amp;oldid=47914585" rel="nofollow">here</a>, "Theonlyedge" goes after Pm_shef's longtime Vaughan target (who he nominated for the AfD a month prior) a few hours later, at 22:02, 11 April 2006 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Simon_Strelchik&amp;diff=40627315&amp;oldid=40621416" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Simon_Strelchik&amp;diff=40627315&amp;oldid=40621416" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Coincidence?</p>
<p>2. The name of Pm_shef's father's company is simply <b>The Edge</b>. It is involved in anti-racism, which we know Pm_shef/ Corey Shefman has been involved in too, both personally and through his edits. The Edge sounds a lot like The Only Edge... a coincidence? See main link to his father's bread-and-butter for 25 years: [www3.sympatico.ca/theedgeq/]</p>
<p>3. Roughly 50% of all Theonlyedge's edits are also articles that Pm_shef has edited. Compare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060319203123&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Pm_shef" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060319203123&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Pm_shef" rel="nofollow">Pm_shef's contributions</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060319203123&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Theonlyedge" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060319203123&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Theonlyedge" rel="nofollow">Theonlyedge's contributions</a>.</p>
<p>4. Both accounts in question were created within 5 weeks of one another; Pm_shef on Oct 31 2005, TheOnlyEdge on Dec 11 2005.</p>
<p>5. 4 hours after Pm_shef nominates this article for deletion (which he ultimately lost), Theonlyedege comes around and does NOT vote Keep or Delete but rather, after two consecutive Keep votes, adds a comment that the article should be shortened to 2 or 3 paragraghs. This was Shef's way of cutting his losses. See original AfD Keep debate: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Simon_Strelchik" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Simon_Strelchik" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>].</p>
<p>6. Both users are from Thornhill, as they have both have edited the article on <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thornhill.html" title="Thornhill">Thornhill</a> and are obsessed with their politicians.</p>
<p>7. Both are obsessed with adding positive POV edits to their favorites <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Kadis_f939.html" title="Susan Kadis">Susan Kadis</a> (as well as <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Di_Biase_329d.html" title="Michael Di Biase">Michael Di Biase</a>) and negative edits/blanking to their political competitor Mario Racco and political opponents <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Reale_6e13.html" title="Anthony Reale">Anthony Reale</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tina_Molinari_3ae9.html" title="Tina Molinari">Tina Molinari</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Cooper_8e89.html" title="Josh Cooper">Josh Cooper</a>.</p>
<p>8. Why did Pm_shef / Theonlyedge create this article on a previous opponent? So that he can control it. He can keep it down to 2 or 3 sentences and maintain control over content.</p>
<p>9. Pm_shef added the deletion notice of this article to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECanadian_wikipedians%27_notice_board_0e65.html" title="Wikipedia:Canadian wikipedians' notice board">Wikipedia:Canadian wikipedians' notice board</a> at 22:04, exactly 2 minutes after his sockpuppet created this nomination at 22:02. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Canadian_wikipedians%27_notice_board&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Canadian_wikipedians%27_notice_board&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">edit history</a> Coincidence?</p>
<p>I hope this is enough evidence, but if you want more, I can find more. Theonlyedge, as I see it, is the sockpuppet that does the dirty work for Pm_shef. He comes out of hibernation when needed, like a trusty administrative assistant. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeotardo_6227.html" title="User:Leotardo">Leotardo</a> 12:39, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the benefit of all, I decided to investigate this despite my doubts. These two are <i>definitely</i> not sockpuppets. Admittedly, their contributions are similar. However, from 21:41 to 22:05 on April 11, Theonlyedge's made about 14 edits to <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Strelchik_72ef.html" title="Simon Strelchik">Simon Strelchik</a> and related pages, trying to create an AfD on this article. He was fairly inept about it; earlier on he had tried to mark the article with {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDelete_bfa0.html" title="Template:Delete">delete</a>}}, but reverted himself; he created <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Simon_Strelchik_2_ba83.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Simon Strelchik 2">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Simon Strelchik 2</a> in addition to this page, and he never listed this AfD in the Log of AfDs. Pm_shef, on the other hand, from 21:43 to 22:06 on the same date, was very busy, making 22 edits, and nominating several other articles for AfD correctly and cleanly, and then informing other users about them at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECanadian_wikipedians%27_notice_board_0e65.html" title="Wikipedia:Canadian wikipedians' notice board">Wikipedia:Canadian wikipedians' notice board</a>. Pm_shef used edit summaries for virtually every one of those edits, while Theonlyedge only used one edit summary. Furthermore, how could they have both been so active over a period of 30 minutes if they were the same person? <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 15:48, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow. I was on holiday for three days, and come back to find out that I'm being accused of being pm_shef, or, apparently, his father. It's very funny that pm_shef's father's company, according to the above, is named 'The Edge', which quite evidently is a phrase that inspired my username. Allegedly, because my edits are very similar to pm_shef's, I <i>am</i> pm_shef. This logic is quite clearly faulty. I am not a so-called sockpuppet of this user. Yes, I presume we both lived in the same area, or even went to the same school, or perhaps even support the same political parties--which, of course, I also find a neat coincidence. Howver, it is just that, a coincidence, and I most definately am not pm_shef. As an aside, I also find the above "detective work" by Mangojuice very, very cool. Its an amazing concept how you can control and see so much on Wikipedia, like me trying repeatedly to put the deletion template on the Strelchik article--which, by the way, should be deleted, because he's only a local representative for Free the Children. Leave a message if you have any questions, <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheonlyedge_8121.html" title="User:Theonlyedge">Theonlyedge</a> 12:28, 18 April 2006 (UTC) P.S. I've taken the liberty of deleting the sockpuppet template. Please do not put it back. Oh, and I'll start using edit-summaries now. Thanks for the heads-up.</p>

<dd>I'd like to give you the benefit of the doubt, but I just don't buy the paragraph above. Again there are too many coincidences; your username Theonlyedge, like the username Pm_shef, being named for something important to C. Shefman (his dad's company, see homepage [<a href="http://www3.sympatico.ca/theedgeq/" class="external free" title="http://www3.sympatico.ca/theedgeq/" rel="nofollow">http://www3.sympatico.ca/theedgeq/</a> here); your springing into action as soon as the login Pm_shef agrees not to get involved anymore; the fact that the activities of the logins are so alike; that the accounts were created at roughly the same time; that you've tried to pursue the ends of Pm_shef on the previous AfD; that you both your usernames have an interest in the same politicians, and an active interest in helping those you approve and slamming those you don't; that Pm_shef, like magic, read your mind 2 minutes after you posted this AfD and added it to the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECanadian_wikipedians%27_notice_board_0e65.html" title="Wikipedia:Canadian wikipedians' notice board">Wikipedia:Canadian wikipedians' notice board</a>. It's almost as if he knows what you're going to do before you do it... similiar to the relationship between hand and mouth. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeotardo_6227.html" title="User:Leotardo">Leotardo</a> 20:56, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>CLARIFICATION: I've decided to move on from these allegations that I am a sockpuppet. Anyways, <b>Simon Strelchik is not on the board of directors for Free the Children. This is a lie. He is a failed local candidate, and is a part-time representative for the charity.

At the very least, any determination as to notability per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> should rest solely on the other relevant details of the subject's biography. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:28, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the other hand, the references in the article clearly back up the claim that he was a founding member of Free the Children. This is something different than being on the board of directors, and apparently he played no particularly important role as it's not covered in the History page on the Free the Children web page. That history mentions that Craig Kielburger gathered 11 friends to begin fighting Child Labor, and those friends are never named, so presumably Strelchik is one of them. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 23:31, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

From <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>: ""Verifiability" does not mean that editors are expected to verify whether, for example, the contents of a New York Times article are true. In fact, editors are strongly discouraged from conducting this kind of research, because original research may not be published in Wikipedia. Articles should contain only material that has been published by reliable sources, regardless of whether individual editors view that material as true or false. As counter-intuitive as it may seem, the threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeotardo_6227.html" title="User:Leotardo">Leotardo</a> 07:20, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree entirely, except that CJN and CBC ostensibly publish the information only in view of Strelchik's having included it in his biography; that is, they don't make an assertion as to its accuracy, they simply pass along Strelchik's bio. If this is indeed the case, in the absence of other independent, verifiable information, the article should be edited so that it is clear that the Free the Children association is claimed by Strelchik (cf., reported [as fact, rather than as background from the candidate]). I should say, though, that I agree with Mangojuice when he says, as also I wrote in my initial post, that if, as the relevant timelines would seem to suggest, Strehlchik's involvement was at the age of 13 and was only with the genesis of the group (or even of the idea of the group), it is altogether likely that we'd not find any Ghits to verify the involvement. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:15, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
