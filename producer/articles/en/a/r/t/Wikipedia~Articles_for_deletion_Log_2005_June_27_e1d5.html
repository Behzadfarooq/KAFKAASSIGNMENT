<p>Comment by author:</p>
<p>This is utter nonsense. The article briefly gives the social history of a well-known location in a major US city, which has become a well known part of American folklore ever since the release of a very well known American film. While the subject matter - a less than completely respectable part of Chicago, the article is, itself, devoid of material of prurient interest, merely referring to improper behavior without giving any specifics which would raise it above a PG rating.</p>
<p>I would point out that the city that I'm speaking of is clearly specified, as is the cultural context of the reference, and that those who wish to speak of Division Streets in other cities would, in no way, be hindered from entering mentions of those other streets in the article. I trust that our would-be censor is aware of the fact that this is a wiki, and that there are means in place by which the casual user may create sections within an article? So what, exactly, is the issue?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - if it's a notable subject, which I can't judge from the piece, it needs a rewrite; otherwise delete <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesgibbon_a971.html" title="User:Jamesgibbon"><font style="color:green">james</font><font style="color: blue">gibbon</font></a> 00:50, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

Response to Splash:</p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised at all, if this article could benefit from some cleanup. At the time Bumm13 decided to try to get it deleted, it was all of three minutes old, and was a first draft. I haven't had a chance to refine the writing, because I've had to deal with this.</p>
<p>Whether there will be any point to bothering to do cleanup, in this case, has yet to be seen. -- "the noneditor"</p>
<p><br />
Response to Dcfleck:</p>
<p>Nicely tightened. There was one small typo I fixed (you left the phrase "many of bars"; I think that you meant to stick a "the" in there). Oh, and David Mamet is a major playwrite, so I think that one should leave the mention of authorship. The movie was based on the play "Sexual Perversity in Chicago", with a major rewrite of the ending, the film being given a much more upbeat closure than was seen in the stage production.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The street is notable. For years it was synonymous with the young singles scene in Chicago. The article needs work, but that's what the concept of a wiki is. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 28 June 2005 05:09 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b>, if it's true that the only notable part mentioned is the bar, the page should be focused to just be the bar. If there are lots of other notable things on division street, then how about making pages for all of them and the creating a category of notable things on division street in Chicago? <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirmob_3a04.html" title="User:Sirmob">Sirmob</a> 28 June 2005 05:26 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Categories are useless for this sort of thing. For a start, they only list things in alphabetical order. An article could, for example, cover the most important features first, and list the rest equally in geographical order going along the street from one end to the other. Also categories are only useful for things that already have whole articles of their own. They're no good for semi-notable items that are only important enough to be mentioned in a list or general article like this one, but not notable enough for their own articles. You'd have to create a List of semi-notable places on Division Street and add it to the category, which is getting just plain silly. Categories should only ever be used as a very last resort since they're never the best way of doing things. And it seems silly to create one now, when we've already got an article that could do a much better job. <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> — <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson">(talk)</a> 28 June 2005 11:44 (UTC)</li>

<p>Appears to be a hoax. Google images, for instance, for this "appearance of only sleeping" - only has one relevant photo, discounting the drawing. Could have been edited, as there is only one photo, without vindication. Google hits reveal 288, seems rather suspicious. "Died before the secret was passed on" seems rather a hoax too - most scientists would be eager to pass on a great discovery. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 01:14, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>22 pages only containing a template, 4 with some content. Hypothetically these lists would attempt to chronicle the hundreds of thousands of genera, they are unmaintainable for numerous reasons including taxonomic changes and a lack of skilled taxonomists on Wikipeida (working out the correct name for an organism can be very difficult especially without access to the relevant literature, the information on the internet is patchy at best). The lists also don't specify a particular type of organism which means that they potentially would only be useful to someone that knew what they were looking for, which then raises the question as to why they didn't just search for the genra in the first place.

<li><b>BIG KEEP</b>. Wow first big keep ever&#160;:). I looked at the article and I must say that it is quite good for an article, any article, on Wikipedia. I esp. like the template to the right.
