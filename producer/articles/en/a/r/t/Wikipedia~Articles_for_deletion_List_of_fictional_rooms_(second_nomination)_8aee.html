<p>This was recently AfD'd and withdrawn before I could add my input, so I prodded it and it was removed citing the reason being that it is "no different from any other fictional item list". This is an unmaintainable, unsourced, unencyclopedic, potentially endless list. What makes this subject notable enough for inclusion in an encyclopedia? Who set the criteria to only include fictional rooms in real buildings? I don't see the usefulness of this list. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 22:49, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s>If you're (at least partially) talking to me, why the attitude? The reason I put "change title" in my vote is because, though I read the article and am capable of understanding the scope laid out there, I think the article could still do with a title change, I often think its a good idea for an article's purpose <i>to be clearly understandable from the title.</i> That way you know what's going on right away. The way it is, the title makes you think you are going to be reading about any fictional room in any fictional locale ever imagined, and then the first paragraph narrows it down. Why not have the scope defined from the get-go?

<li><s>As made clear in the article and in this AfD, the list is of fictional rooms in otherwise nonfictional places, so nothing like those would be included, no. If the title of the article needs to be changed slightly to make that clearer that's fine. <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBCoates_04d2.html" title="User:BCoates">BCoates</a> 00:42, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</s></li>
