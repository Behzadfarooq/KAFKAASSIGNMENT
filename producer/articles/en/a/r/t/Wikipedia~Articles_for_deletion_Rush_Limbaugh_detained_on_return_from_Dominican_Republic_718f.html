This is a non-story and not notable for inclusion in an encyclopedia.

<li>Ok, when another editor added this basic info to the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Limbaugh_cc52.html" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a> article two other editors said they thought this didn't belong because three sources didn't meet the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> guideline of multiple non-trivial sources, so I added more sources independent of each other, and now having seven sources is supposedly a problem. After I added more sources the two editors said it met the notability guideline for its own article but not to be in the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Limbaugh_cc52.html" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a> article, so I moved it to its own article. Now those editors think that the article ought to be deleted. Or maybe it should move to Wikinews. Or I need to find more recent sources showing that the story didn't just die after the incident. It seems as if the rules keep changig faster than I can keep up. KimmyChanga 05:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This article is in the canonical form for a news article. It has a news article style title, covers the story as a news article would, and cites more than enough sources to qualify for publication as a news summary piece. It thus does not belong in Wikipedia, whose articles are encyclopaedia articles, not news articles. An encyclopaedia article would have a different title, per our <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28verbs%29_00a9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (verbs)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (verbs)</a>, for starters, and a far broader scope. The proper place to write news articles is Wikinews. However, Wikinews won't cover this story because it is more than 6 months old at this point. Forking out a news article that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">does not belong in the encyclopaedia</a> is not the way to solve a content dispute over a biographical article. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:31, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> So there's still a bunch of humor pieces. Big whoop. Those aren't news. Face it, the only reason this is an issue is because a lot of people vehemently disagree with Limbaugh, so they make it their mission to disparage him in any and all possible ways. Give it up. The political shit ain't worth it.</li>
