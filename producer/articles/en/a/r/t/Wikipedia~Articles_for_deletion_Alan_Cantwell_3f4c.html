<p>Alan Cantwell is a self-published author of conspiracy theory books, is occasionally published in New Dawn (which publishes fringe theories), and back in the 1980s he published a few articles in the medical press, but under 30 publications is certainly not indicative of a significant research career. So he fails the professor test, is a self-published author (so fails the author test) but might be a valid subject as a conspiracy theorist. The no. 1 Google hit is whale.to (now vaccination.org.uk), <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">User:Whaleto</a>'s vehement;ly anti-vaccination website, and some at least of the supposed publications are reproduced (with or without permission) on that site. Article was created by Whaleto, who also added (<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Whaleto_2940.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Whaleto">per his usual practice</a>) links to his site. I would say that this is "just another crank" and not an especially notable one, but I could be wrong. Just to clarify per RayaruB below, the books on Amazon are published by <a href="http://www.ariesrisingpress.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.ariesrisingpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Aries Rising Press</a>; from their website: <b>Aries Rising Press, Los Angeles. was founded in 1984 by Alan Cantwell, M.D., for the purpose of disseminating vital medical research and knowledge concerning the origin and cause of two major diseases; Cancer and AIDS</b>. The site lists <b>no</b> books by <b>any</b> other author. These are self-published books. There are notable self-published authors, like <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Gunther_9e2d.html" title="Robert Gunther">Robert Gunther</a>, but he is notable as the founder of the museum of science at Oxford and the driving force behind the rehabilitation of [Robert Hooke]]'s reputation, not as a self-published author. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:50, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>That's a good point. However, even though they are self-published, I think the fact that several major bookstores stock them indicates that they may have an audience of 5,000 or more, which would satisfy the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notability standard</a> for people.

<dd>You say "stock". I'd say "list in their catalogue - unless I saw a definite indication they were on a shelf, or in a warehouse.

<li>Yes, you did say that. And had Mr. Cantwell's books just been sold by some unknown website I might vote delete here. But they are sold by major booksellers. And I see Cantwell quoted in the press on AIDs or being <b>referenced in other books</b> <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22Alan+Cantwell%22&amp;lr=&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;start=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22Alan+Cantwell%22&amp;lr=&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Your argument regarding self-publishing is also fairly unconvincing given the vast number of articles here that use self-published papers, blog articles and chat board posts as valid references. You should know this, because you are involved in editing some of these articles. Finally, I again note that Mr. Cantwell gets 18 hits in google scholar <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Alan+Cantwell%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Alan+Cantwell%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, while Dominionism gets 32 <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Dominionism&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Dominionism&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Dominionism currently benefits from an article here, a number of categories, a template and some lists. You yourself have argued that dominionism is backed up by scholarly references. Therefore, I'm sure you'll agree, that Cantwell clearly deserves an article here. Call it the dominionism test. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 17:11, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per JJay. The self-published author thing is a guideline, not a set of handcuffs.

<li><b><s>Comment</s></b>. Is it indicated how many of the books have sold? Amazon indicate they have to order half of them (2-3w), are they being printed to order? If another article is using self-published stuff and own website as a reference then there is a problem with <i>that</i> article, it doesn't mean it is OK for other ones. He doesn't look notable to me, but I've learned not to trust the articles out of that author to include what people are notable for, so it may be worth doing some actual research. It isn't an article that would take any length of time to replace though, is it, with a <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or whatever. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 18:44, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> as JJay mentioned above which may have been overlooked, Cantwell is mentioned in other books. Amazon lists 15+; after selecting the drop-down "Books" for the search, and searching on "alan cantwell jr" you then click on "Click here to see additional results."

<li><b>Comment on notability + Weak Keep</b>. This guy seems notable ("Alan Cantwell" "AIDS" = 32,000 hits). Clearly as mad as a bicycle, but notable. Just to clarify- having one's books listed on Amazon DOES NOT make one notable in itself. ANYONE with a chequebook can get a book into the Amazon catalogue- they have deals with numerous vanity press outfits. They may be a major bookseller, but they are not a discerning one. PS- Barring exceptional cases (like, for example, this one), almost any article that's using blogs, chat boards, and self-published papers (ie not peer-reviewed) as references is suspect.

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't see sufficient evidence of him being notable in the article. I would want to see notable sources writing about him (not just his writings). Personally, I think a self-published book, is little better then a personal web site. It doesn't mean you're not notable, but it doesn't mean you are. The evidence of notability, needs to go in the actual article (as opposed to this AFD page). Without citing reliable sources that have been written about him in-depth, we can't really say anything neutral and reliable about him, as a person is not a neutral reliable source about themself. Currently, the article mentions no criticisms of his views. Now, that's not because there isn't criticism of these types of views. It's because nobody (worthy of citing) seems to know or care enough about him to bother directly addressing his views. So the article will never present all major perspectives fairly. But if the article is improved, I'll be happy to be proved wrong, and change my vote. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:06, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
