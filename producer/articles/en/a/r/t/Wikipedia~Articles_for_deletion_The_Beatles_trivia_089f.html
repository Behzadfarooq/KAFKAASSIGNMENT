<li>Without digressing into a "what is trivia" debate, I need only view a few cards from a vintage <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trivial_Pursuit_9a33.html" title="Trivial Pursuit">Trivial Pursuit</a> game to see if WP provides the answers, and voilá, EVERY SINGLE bit of trivia I tested can be found here. Empirically, this ought to stay or we need a severe trimming of our content to be less trivial. So, where does that put us? Not only do we have the "trivia" pages as blatant as can be, we have "Minor characters in" lists that are basically trivia masquerading as lists, we have editors who insist that no matter how little distinguishes one school from another, they are all notable, we have articles on virtually every episode of fan-loved tv series, every pokemon monster, every voice on the Simpsons, etc. This encyclopedia not only embraces "trivia", I would venture to guess that without the trivia our article count would drop below a million. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 00:26, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete.</b> I love the Beatles' music, but trivia about the band simply doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. It's available everywhere.

<li><b>Comment</b> The word <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trivia.html" title="Trivia">trivia</a> seems to upset a lot of people. There is a Wikipedia article called <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trivia.html" title="Trivia">trivia</a> which deals with the subject, and has links to plenty of other pages that have <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trivia.html" title="Trivia">trivia</a> pages.

<li>I interpret Andreasegde's suggestion about deleting <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trivia.html" title="Trivia">trivia</a> as rhetorical rather than substantive, but he makes a good point about all our other trivia lists.

<li>The problem is that trivia is the very antithesis of what an encyclopaedia is supposed to contain. It's trifling details, when an encyclopaedia is supposed to give the most relevant and significant information. If you read the second paragraph of the article, you can see that whoever wrote it clearly agrees that it's <i>an indiscriminate collection of information</i> - <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> specifically proscribes this very thing. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 09:09, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Whoever wrote it said, "can be", which is not a statement of fact – it’s only a possibility. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 09:21, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What would you rename it? List of facts about the Beatles? One should never need a random List of facts about... relevent info should already be in the article's topic, in this case, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>. I'm all for adding the facts to appropriate articles in which they can cleanly integrate, but a page specifically for uncorrelated facts about a topic should not exist in an encyclopaedia. It deters people from finding the appropriate way to integrate the information, so that it can be used to improve an existing article on the same topic, or determining that, in the end, the information does not add value to the topic. I know that the article about The Beatles is already long, but spinoffs like these just don't sit well with me. GassyGuy 09:15, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Word History: The word encyclopedia, which to us usually means a large set of books, descends from a phrase that involved coming to grips with the contents of such books. The Greek phrase is enkuklios paideia, made up of enkuklios, “<i>cyclical</i>, <i>periodic</i>, <i>ordinary</i>,” and paideia, “education,” and meaning “<i>general education</i>.” <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 09:52, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, it is true that snippets were taken from other (lengthy) articles. This was meant to be just a start, so as to get it rolling. This article is approx. one month old (not forgetting the one piece that was there before.) A question: If you wanted to look up The Beatles influence, where would you look? This article was only intended to be a summary and a link to lots of other Wikipedia articles, that people would probably not delve into. Jeffrey Archer being a case in point. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 18:21, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Both the main article, and others related to it, are indicated as being larger than is normally expected for a Wikipedia entry. Many of the mentions now in "Trivia" were culled from the main article for reasons of reducing the article size, but were considered relevant/important enough to warrent keeping elsewhere. Some items have no other obvious place in The Beatles canon, but are never the less a potential search result.

<li><b>Merge</b> all contents to approate articles. The issue is not of importance, uniqueness, or verifiability. The issue is if it all really belongs in one rather large list about the Beatles.

The trivia is interesting, but wrapping it up all in one big pile of information under one generalized subject is ludacris.

I don't think we need an article called "Beatles trivia", but there is some good stuff here which should be moved or merged elswhere.

<dd><b>Comment</b> May I point out the part of the wording on the Afd tag is <i>"Feel free to edit the article, but the article must not be blanked, and this notice must not be removed, until the discussion is closed. For more information, particularly on merging or moving the article during the discussion,.."</i> My edits were in line with these and instructions and designed to save this article, and I point out again, quite clearly for those who haven't bothered to see read or understand my changes, I did not delete one piece of information from WP. Those sub-heading I deleted were the same as in the principal article, or augmented in a "see also" sub-heading. The article is too long, too unconnected, and no context between the bits of "trivia." Maybe it should be deleted. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichhoncho_144b.html" title="User:Richhoncho">Richhoncho</a> 13:43, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Make my with half a spoonful of sugar! As you know you have copied some other WP articles and pasted them into this article, which really isn't necessary! Does say, Portmeiron require all the information repeated here just because the Beatles were interviewed there once? Ditto Mary Hopkin, the Tom Hanks film, The Rutles and other sub-sections I moved to "see also" On the other hand you have added more info about Norman Pilcher which really belongs in the Pilcher article with a link from here. Some of the parts deserve to stay in here. The one real deletion I did make was removing "and allowed its release" (re-With a Little Help), and as anybody who knows anything about the music business knows once a song has been released the author only retains moral rights and <b>not</b> the right to stop the playing of, or release of cover versions. So those words are a complete fabrication. As I keep pointing out the article is too long, so a little bit of judicious editing will go a long way to saving an article which <b>could</b> be important. I also note you have missed some relatively important items like the Dora Bryan song, or perhaps the Ballad of Hollis Brown/Working Class Hero "coincidence." ditto Norwegian Wood. Some of these items rightfully belong in the Beatles Influence articles too, which you have also worked on. Your decision, I'd rather see this article be deleted than get into an edit war. This is why I am replying rather heavily here - I am actually trying to save this article (although it will probably need to be renamed), although you wouldn't think so from the comments I am getting!!!--<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichhoncho_144b.html" title="User:Richhoncho">Richhoncho</a> 14:43, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, I know that I am an incorrogible thief, but I only started it a month ago. (My... what a short life it had - laugh...)</p>
<p>My original idea was to have it as an index, so people would not have to trawl through whole pages of stuff to find one small reference about The Beatles. As that idea has (it seems so) well and truly had its genitalia skewered, I will sit back and think of something else to do.
