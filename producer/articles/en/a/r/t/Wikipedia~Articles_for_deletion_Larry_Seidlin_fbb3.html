<li><b>Keep for now</b> In paper encyclopedias, the practice is to go through and get rid of topical articles that are no longer of interest after a while.

<li><b>Delete</b> His exposure is far from "massive," and is generally limited to a few internet articles and as a chuckle-worthy piece on the Jay Leno show, in my opinion not notable. If he does get a TV show, he might merit a place in wikipedia, but a Lower Court Judge in Florida who has presided over one notable case, and made no landmark decisions is not worthy of inclusion. I seem to be in a two-person minority in this opinion but, whatever. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThethinredline_5528.html" title="User:Thethinredline">Thethinredline</a> 13:15, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is not at all limited to that... he has been given massive coverage on TV, and you would probably be hard pressed to find an article on the trial that didnt mention him, whether it be <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2007/LAW/02/22/smith.ruling/index.html" class="external text" title="http://edition.cnn.com/2007/LAW/02/22/smith.ruling/index.html" rel="nofollow">CNN</a> or the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6388229.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6388229.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC</a>.

<dd>Well the BBC article you mention proves my point, it doesn't cover Judge Seidlin at all, it mentions him. Does that make him somehow more 'notable' than just being a jurist presising over a case? I suppose some people might consider that to be so, but i am not one of them.</dd>
<dd>Also to say the coverage is massive is first of all subjective: I believe the coverage of the death of Saddam Huissein was "massive," not this story. Also to make any kind of statement about comprehensive coverage being given to this is also I would say, very US-centric. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThethinredline_5528.html" title="User:Thethinredline">Thethinredline</a> 17:12, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> as much as I'd like this whole fucking mess to go back to the supermarket tabloids where it belongs, you can't deny that Judge Seidlin has become a lightening rod for debate and discussion.
