<dd>A look at <a href="http://www.fordhallfarm.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.fordhallfarm.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fordhallfarm.com/</a> will confirm that there are 2900 people in the UK who have put money into this scheme and that over £575,000 has been raised. The farm is not particularly under threat from developers but simply coming to the end of it's lease. If successful the land will be owned by all of the people who have subscribed under a community land initiative, a scheme which probably merits an entry in it's own right. National newspapers are following the progress of this in The Daily Telegraph (Weekend section) on 17th June and The Guardian (Society section) on 21st June. I have no connection with the farm (apart from I intend to buy a £50 share before 1st July) - but I do think it's an important initative and warrantentry in Wikipedia on the basis of organic farming and community land ownership issues. As this is the first entry I have ever written, I would be grateful for any help in fitting in with Wikipedia protocol rather than simply rejecting my submission</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Content disputes such as "POV and unsourced, unsubstantiated claims" are not a reason to delete. Is clearly notable as an example of a farm trying to go organic; it is effectively a "case study". <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 08:59, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> nn. I agree, it's a good cause and it's caught some local attention by its fundraising pleas, but it's still nn. No sources given, POV questions, and unsubstantiated claims on their face - no sources or references for verification.

<li><b>Comment</b> - there are thousands of fully organic farms around the world. None of the statements in the article are sourced so may or may not be true.

<li><b>Comment</b> Based on what I have been able to find out, I believe it would be possible to produce a properly verifiable article about this farm, although there may be a slight issue with it being the subject of an ongoing news story in the UK. I do not intend to research this material myself though. I am just noting that the required material, IMO, seems to exist. Obviously, as the article stands, it fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Hence it needs cleanup. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 23:46, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I agree it may be verifiable but, despite this AfD nothing has come forward. It is up to the author and subsequent editors to produce a stand-up case and they haven't.

<li><b>Comment</b> If it's notable, even if the article itself contains nothing that verifies its notability, then it should not be deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b> (still Delete) Articles which cannot be verified and have serious doubts about their notability are exactly the type of content which *should* be deleted. If a legitimate encyclopedic article can be written on this topic, then someone should write it. This article is not encyclopedic and fails <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Wikipedia is not a place to list every organic farm. If it was, I could easily add 10000+ American farms of larger size and greater contribution to the economy than this one. Everything has a story and telling those stories has a place in society, but not in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 13:23, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Not notable and does not assert it either. The most notable assertion is "Fordhall is considered by many to have been a forrunner in the organic movement", which is third person "I heard about it on the bus" and unsourced. Its Google hits are mostly blog entries in a grass-roots campaign. It does, however, have this one article in <i>The Telegraph</i><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/wine/main.jhtml?xml=/wine/2006/04/15/edforhall15.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/wine/main.jhtml?xml=/wine/2006/04/15/edforhall15.xml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, but it is a "human interest" story, like one of many non-notable such stories in many newspapers. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 21:35, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
