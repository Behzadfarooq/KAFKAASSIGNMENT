<p>Redundant with the plot sections. Expanding upon that is horror fancruft. It is violating the growing consensus for a word limit for film plot synopses. I have also seen a more basic list of deaths being added to the films' articles: these are redundant to the plot section and looks like something an amateur fan site would do.

<li><s>'<i>Delete and Salt'</i><b>Merge</b></s> <b>Delete</b> (see revision of revised comment below) â€” far worse than fancruft, it's a kind of violent pornography that has no possible encyclopedic value. Each death is lovingly detailed to heighten the sadistic effect. Here's a quote from the Deaths in Final Destination article:</li>

<blockquote>
<p>He then walks over to the tub and slips on the puddle, causing him to fall on a clothesline cord, which snaps off the wall and, pulled by the velocity of Tod's fall, wraps tightly around his neck several times and strangles him in the tub, while he struggles to stand up, but only manages to kick over bottles of shampoo and soap, spilling them inside the tub and making it slippery and preventing him from getting to his feet. The blood vessels in his eyes burst as he tries to break free from the wire and reach a pair of scissors on the counter across the room. He slowly weakens and finally dies</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Seriously Keep</b> Unlike other horror based series the friday the 13th is by far more notable for its over-the-top death lists. Also the FD series is basically a slide-show of accidental deaths and they constitute to the plot (It should be noted that they were created to prevent the main article from being too long) <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesbuc_acfe.html" title="User:Jamesbuc">Jamesbuc</a>

<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Unfortunately with the FD series unless the deaths/misses ARE explained the plot would suffer. Just saying 'Carter is saved and Billy dies' (ive seen that put down once) places little point on the plot and the happenings. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesbuc_acfe.html" title="User:Jamesbuc">Jamesbuc</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> If it can't be merged into the main article it probably shouldn't exist at all. This should be on a fansite rather than wikipedia. Speedything 16:28, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Okay, think about this. For example, Tod Waggner- Killed by strangulation by clothes line. Inside or out? How on earth did he get strangled by a CLOTHES LINE? Lotsa questions get asked if the death is summerised in one brief sentence. Think about it your self. If it was your first time looking at the movie, what would you think about their deaths? The F13 movies is unnecessary, as it's either pop, rip or stab. NOthing creative. 211.30.223.128 09:01, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> even though id usually agree with that this time id have to disagree as both series in question are known for thier deaths and not much else. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesbuc_acfe.html" title="User:Jamesbuc">User:Jamesbuc</a></dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Eh? What a stupid proposal? The deaths are essential to the plot in illustrating that death would catch up with people. They can't make a popular movie by saying: "We got out of a crashed plane, and no we are each being picked off one by one. We won't tell you how, but use your imagination..." The deaths are imperative to the plot and, hence the movie's success. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Oliverlock (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Oliverlock_f3d5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Oliverlock">contribs</a>) 20:45, 20 February 2007 (UTC).</small>

Unless we decide that the series as such is unencyclopedic, we should keep the list. -- User:Docu <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocu_0014.html" title="User:Docu">Docu</a> (<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDocu_992b.html" title="User talk:Docu">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Docu_e843.html" title="Special:Contributions/Docu">contribs</a>) 07:12, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_deaths_in_the_Friday_the_13th_series_8eaa.html" title="List of deaths in the Friday the 13th series">List of deaths in the Friday the 13th series</a> per Docu. It seems to provide a concise summary of an important plot element without going over the top, isn't simply a plot summary, and I can imagine contexts where it would be useful to readers. I suggest merging the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Destination_bfac.html" title="Final Destination">Final Destination</a> death lists into one article, something like Lists of deaths in the Final Destination series and mirroring the tone/brevity of the Friday the 13th list. As they stand currently they're simply mega-gory recapitulations of the plot. Cut the pictures and the fancruft. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 07:19, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Listcruft/fancruft. Yes, horror movies feature lots of deaths, but that doesn't mean we need mass lists of them here. Take it to a fan wiki. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 15:22, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
