<li><b>keep</b> - this is the most important <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodyboard.html" title="Bodyboard">Bodyboard</a> competition in the world tour currently. You can't argue the notability of a competition by it's prize solely (but you seem to have misread the top prize: you only listed the prize when it wasn't an international event yet). You should have tried the article's talk page before AfD this article. Too harsh behaviour! <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 16:53, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Per the article, which is the only evidence a casual reader has about the event, the last competition was in 2003. If it's the most important competition, why hasn't there been one in the past four years. BTW, the top prize in 2003 was $6000 USD, hardly a large sum compared with the top prizes in other athletic events. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparklingWiggle_144a.html" title="User:SparklingWiggle">SparklingWiggle</a> 13:38, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The competition is still going on. I did not have the time to include the information about 2004, 2005, 2006 and upcoming 2007 event. I thought the community would take care of this. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 13:44, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Prize</b> alone does not justifies. <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodyboard.html" title="Bodyboard">Bodyboard</a> is a sport with lack of sponsoring, so competitions do not amount to so high a prize as surfing yet. It's getting better. But this is the most notable event in the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Tour_7a82.html" title="World Tour">World Tour</a> currently. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 13:47, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Prize certianly does contribute quite a bit to an event's level of prestige. If the event had a prize on the order of $100k to $1 mil I don't think there would be as much question about its notability. We list collectible card tournaments with scant sources because their prizes can be up to a million dollars. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparklingWiggle_144a.html" title="User:SparklingWiggle">SparklingWiggle</a> 14:25, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Have you ever read about <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodyboard.html" title="Bodyboard">Bodyboard</a> in Sports Illustrated? Perhaps you should have asked for some Bodyboarding magazines, instead of Surfing... Please, see the article again, I have provided a few sources for the stats and updated with 2004, 2005 and 2006 data. I don't think I need to provide anything from the sources above, which are mainly USA sources which tend to ignore the rest of the world, mainly a sport that is more common in Australia, Brazil, Portugal, etc. As I said to you, this is a sport which is currently suffering from lack of sponsoring. That's the same that is happening to <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodysurfing.html" title="Bodysurfing">Bodysurfing</a>. It doesn't make it non-notable, but it can make it hard to prove its notability for readers which do not know the sport and aren't willing to research. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 15:22, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Note</b>: I'm currently with a lack of time to work here. I'm so sure this is a notable competition but I will have to find more sources to back it up, so I would ask for you guys not to settle this AfD without giving me time to convince you&#160;:-) I have spent too much effort on this article, and I think it deserves more consideration. I myself own 4 commercial DVDs from the 2001 to 2004 competitions. I really don't know how could this not be notable. Keep the discussion, but give me more time.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. While it's clearly important in the bodyboarding community, there is nothing notable here for an encyclopedia. Citations are all self-referential except one article in a specialized publication. A scholarly search via LexisNexis reveals nothing notable. --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMus_Musculus_8efa.html" title="User:Mus Musculus">Mus Musculus</a> 16:30, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The self-referential citations are for the stats which came from the primary source to avoid errors. I think I'm now confused as what is a notable sports event. It is the most important bodyboard event in the tour today along with the Pipe Master. I don't know if wikipedia is running out of disk space, but I think this article is encyclopedic due to its relevancy to an international sport. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 17:09, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem is - you can't ask readers to take your word for it. You have to provide reliable, independent, verifiable citations that show how important the event is. News stories covering the event and explaining its importance will be your starting place. --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMus_Musculus_8efa.html" title="User:Mus Musculus">Mus Musculus</a> 17:22, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I have asked for time to make this research. That's exactly what I will do but I just don't want to came back here and see the article deleted. Regards <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 17:28, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Do you think references about wave conditions, prize, rankings, etc. should come not from the primary source? But I understand that these references alone does not prove the notability of the event. But <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">User:Golden Wattle</a> gave some external links (one from Billabong, a surfing giant company), and they were all dismissed.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> People do not want to take the notability of this event in bodyboarding from the IBA site <a href="http://www.ibatour.com" class="external text" title="http://www.ibatour.com" rel="nofollow">International Bodyboarding Association</a>. It is the same as denying that an statement of an authoritative association like <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_a2be.html" title="FIFA">FIFA</a> is not reliable. IBA is the authoritative association of bodyboarding in the world, it has the final word on rules and which competitions count to the tour. For example, the Shark Island Challenge here in question is the one with the biggest point award, which means that it's most important event in the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Tour_7a82.html" title="World Tour">World Tour</a> which is the only tour for international bodyboarding akin to the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Surfing_Professionals_4e47.html" title="Association of Surfing Professionals">Association of Surfing Professionals</a> tour for surfing. By the way the articles about the World Tour and IBA are still lacking information, they are all stubs right now.
