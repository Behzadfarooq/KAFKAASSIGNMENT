<dd>I am concerned that an editor would be inclined to have such a subjective opinion without presenting any counter points to the contrary of what has been presented. Stating that you disagree is not notable nor verifiable. We need you to present evidence to support your claims or this situation may be used as an example to nominate many other notable articles for deletion. We must work together in the best interest of the Wikipedia community. To do otherwise is irresponsible and may draw vast consequences. As a contributing reader, I do not wish to waste time undoing such activity. We must avoid setting a negative precedence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You state "Obvious fans" yet site no reference or proof, this does not set a good example for new contributors as you are not practicing what you preach. You should also not express how contributions make you "feel" as it has little or nothing to do with the facts, rather is shows bias due to your acknowledgement in regards to how something makes you "feel". Again, we must be careful to act in the interest of the community and set a proper example, particularly when we are held to a higher level of accountability. As we can see below, a young and very impressionable student from AZ (as per his talk) has taken to your example and represents how he "feels" here in post. We must avoid such matters. His opinion is highly subjective and rather than discussing or making reference to his opinion, he surrenders himself to simply stating how he "feels" ("I'm just sick") without presenting any supporting evidence. Nor is he open to the possibility that his issue may be entirely due to the fact that his position is incorrect or his actions are not justified. Please note how he referenced your example directly "per above". This is a real world example of how acting irresponsible can have a negative effect and open the door for biased and subjective opinions. (Please also note that rather than expressing an opinion about how I "feel" I have taken the time to cite examples of what it is I am concerned about. We must act responsibly.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 76.16.70.153 (<a href="../../../7/6/2E/User_talk%7E76.16.70.153.html" title="User talk:76.16.70.153">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_76.16.70.153_d20e.html" title="Special:Contributions/76.16.70.153">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>As per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_is_a_troll" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_is_a_troll" rel="nofollow">What is a Troll?</a> Explain errors politely and reasonably; point them towards policies, the manual of style and relevant past discussions. Don't conclude they are a troll until they have shown complete inability or unwillingness to listen to reason or to moderate their position based upon the input of others. Even in that case, it is likely better to remain silent and let others conclude the obvious instead of calling someone a troll and creating even more mayhem.

<dd>I care <i>this</i> much right now. You weren't commenting on his addition to the article in question, and even if you were it is irrelevant. I can't spot any of his comments that add to the OR, merely those that remove fair chunks of it. No, you were saying that he was reasoning unfairly with emotion rather than neutrality. Not only is this unfounded (he did give reasons beyond being sickened by it), but it <i>doesn't matter</i>. Before all of that nonsense, you basically blamed myself for <i>emotionally corrupting</i> this poor student. That's uncivil, and is the very definition of trolling.

<dd>Regarding the influencing of a young student. I never stated that you corrupted him in any way (we continue to see assumptions dominating reason and request for clarification), rather your example of casting how you felt over what your findings were based on facts, may have contributed to his post where he posted how he felt, rather than reference facts. You are clearly not giving me the benefit of the doubt as a first response. I am quite suprised to see an Administrator being presumptious to such a degree, that he/she would resort to name calling as a first response. You did not ask for me to elaborate or to clarify the intent of my post. What is uncivil sir, is not giving the beneift of the doubt, putting words into other peoples mouths, and resorting to name calling and threating bans because you don't agree with someone. I on the other hand offered to apologize if the intent of my post was misunderstood, apologized to you personal, and continue to behave in a very civil manner.</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your apology. Opinions about the page are reasonable and should be supported by references. The Clan links were indeed sourced as they are all listed on the front page of Zdaemon.org, Zdaemon.org is listed on GameSpy and Wikipedia, thus all notable sources. Perhaps your edits were subjective in nature and required more research before deletion? Many people tend to delete links without first discussing them. It is always prudent to discuss a deletion before assuming it is irrelevant.</dd>

<dd>So your logic states that only articles that discuss a given topic are notable? Could you elaborate please. Reasoning with your logic, if Google had a link to Zdaemon on it's front page stating that Zdaemon was a source port that you may wish examine, it would not lend any weight to the notability of Zdaemon? Many references have been provided.</dd>

<li><b>Do not Delete</b>Due to recent facts presented on pages discussion. Notable sources and presented and need to be properly addressed. If this gets deleted, then I fear that it will be used as an example and excuse for others to delete other similar articles which fall under the pardigm for which this article has been nominated for deletion for. Other Source Ports being deleted does not justify deleting other source ports. As per <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> we must be careful about letting prior precedence serve as grounds for parallel actions. This could lead to anarchy as contributors make aggressively nominate articles for deletion citing like-kind articles which have already been deleted. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 76.16.70.153 (<a href="../../../7/6/2E/User_talk%7E76.16.70.153.html" title="User talk:76.16.70.153">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_76.16.70.153_d20e.html" title="Special:Contributions/76.16.70.153">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>Nice work Bloodshedder. It looks like that was a lot of work. Thank you for helping out here and bringing some sanity to the situation. You should request nomination as an administrator. Rather than wasting your time with name calling and casting your opinion, you used your efforts and intelligence to provide a solution. You are a great example of how an Administrator should conduct themselves. Bravo!</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Well if non of the source ports are notable, I don't understand why it would work if they were all just put in one page. Also they are already all listed in the page before the merging began. --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonkoldyk_16c0.html" title="User:Simonkoldyk">Simonkoldyk</a> 20:03, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not that they aren't notable <i>at all</i>, they just aren't notable enough for their own articles. They still deserve to be described, plus have their articles on the Doom Wiki linked to. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBloodshedder_b5da.html" title="User:Bloodshedder">Bloodshedder</a> 21:11, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You are correct I do believe they should be mentioned; but, there is already a list of all the ports listed there with a link to a website if they have them and stuff about them; I don't see why they need another paragraph above as well. --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonkoldyk_16c0.html" title="User:Simonkoldyk">Simonkoldyk</a> 21:24, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>They need to be mentioned specifically because they are a) historically or technologically notable (ex. Boom, nxDoom) or b) fairly popular and in widespread use (ex. ZDoom). <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBloodshedder_b5da.html" title="User:Bloodshedder">Bloodshedder</a> 00:14, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
