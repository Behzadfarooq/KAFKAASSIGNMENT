<li><b>Keep</b> Appears to be a well sourced article that does establish notability. Not sure what is meant by, "Notability not asserted" when the article claims the subject is heard on 900 radio stations. Maybe needs more evidence or some editing done to the article but does seem notable and well sourced. <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> 03:27, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Further Comment</b> Havn't finished the sourcing yet but i'm curious about the charge of "tracts/books of unkown dubious publishing". So far the book publishers i'm come across are <b>W Publishing Group</b>, <b>Integrity Publishers</b>, <b>B C M Publications</b> and <b>DJ Publications</b>. The dual claims of dubious publishing combined with sourcing not offered confuses me. Without the sourcing how was it evident the publishers were of dubious origin? Hope my sourcing effort clears some of this up. <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> 03:56, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Imagine if every single book on wikipedia followed this suit; all books would be linked to one business. However, adding in the ISBN number, publisher, city, year, and page numbers would be good. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 07:11, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Adding a whole collection of links to the article without writing an article would provide the reader information that could be in a article, but it would not be encyclopedic. It would just be a collection of links.</dd>
<dd>Sourcing an article means providing substantive claims with references. Not linking things for sale to a merchant. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 07:45, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm really having trouble understanding your position here. Would you prefer I alternate links between Barnes and Noble and Amazon and whatever other online book source there is? The links added to the article are not for the purpose of selling books, they are for the purpose of satisfying your criticism. Adding links to Amazon, Barnes and Noble and other book sellers will satisfy your criticism of the article. <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> 07:53, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Do not link books bibliography to a place where books are sold. To verify the books in the Blibiography provide the reader with the ISBN number, publisher, city and year.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I removed the strike since you have no reason to invalidate my vote. The admin who decides on the close can give whatever weight to my thoughts as he/she shall choose. At the risk of being uncivil, I will say that the logic you are using is quite infantile. If your mouse has the capability of moving to click on the user contribution tab you will see that I've commented on many AfD in the past. (And tend to vote delete more often then not) Just because <i>yours</i> happens to be the ones that tickle my fancy today does not mean that I'm targetting these AfD. My brother and parents were huge Fundies and while I don't share that persuasion, I'm mindful of those for and against the fundamentalist bent. So, these Afds peaked my interest--namely because they're so laughably notable and the theme of the AfDs so apparent. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 10:18, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The above user, 205.157.110.11, has voted on many RfDs that Arbustoo did not nominate and he has participated in other articles, so Arbustoo's claim in his edit summary is wrong. I don't have any opinion yet on this AfD, but I am concerned about Arbustoo's general editing history with regards to articles about preachers and his attitude that he takes with people that disagree with him. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 08:02, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>comment</b> <s>I believe it's bad faith to accuse someone of wiki-stalking with no evidence.</s> If you take the time to look at my contribution history (the AfD's with the ingredient listing for edit summaries are all mine) you will see that I comment on which ever AfD's tickle my fancy. The rash of anti-fundamentalist AfD on extremely well known preachers obviously caught my interest because of the very evident theme to the AfDs. That is not a crime and it's certainly not wiki-stalking. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 08:23, 5 September 2006 (UTC) <b>Note</b> After some research I believe now that Arbusto wasn't accusing me of Wiki-stalking (his edit summaries when he was reverting my comments led me astray).
