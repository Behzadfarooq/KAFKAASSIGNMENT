<p>Although this person exists, everything it says about him is not true. Check the university website. --Fredthemonsterman 05:11, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The university humanities website is currently out of date as it failed to meet the deadline for recent updates. Theerfore not all enteries include accurate information. Moreover, Peter Goodall is certainly an academic worth an encylopedia article about because of the relevance of his research and his achievments. Perhaps you should look further into his history- I think a biography about him is available on auslit- and the article was based on an interview with and other academics in the english department at the university, including Rosemary Colmer. He teaches accross a broad range of subject matter including the english literature masters and honours programmes. So please before deleting this page, research the topic further as i think it is important to give recognition to the significant contribution Australin academics are making, particularly as there is a tendency to overlook their achievmnets- particularly when areas such as literature, and egyptological studies have important historical foundations. <i>unsigned comment by anon <a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.111.13.34.html" title="User:137.111.13.34">user:137.111.13.34</a></i></li>

<ul>
<li>I disagree that the article does not establish "notability". Clearly Professor Goodall has contributed significantly to a number of fields, most noteworthy, is literature and holds a high profile position coupled with a number of degrees (including an honoury doctorate from Macquarie University) from highly regarded universities, including Oxford and Harvard. If further information needs to be added, Peter is contactable via email, for verification, chapters from "la chess sherry" or other recent research papers (which he has agreed to)peter.goodall@hmn.mq.edu.au and is strong supporter of highlighting the works of Australian academics. Perhaps you definition of notability needs to be reconsidered- <i>second unsigned comment by anon <a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.111.13.34.html" title="User:137.111.13.34">user:137.111.13.34</a></i>
<ul>
<li>Tell you what, I'll go one better. I live not very far from Maq. I'll ask Mr. Goodall himself this Monday about the claims made in that article and for any publications he has produced. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 11:10, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>He is not a Professor, nor does he have the degrees you say. I think this is a prank. See his bio here <a href="http://www.engl.mq.edu.au/about01.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.engl.mq.edu.au/about01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.engl.mq.edu.au/about01.htm</a> --Fredthemonsterman 06:34, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I have to say i am offended by that comment as it completely undermines my credibility as a person- i don't think it is appropritate or helpful to make statements without doing all the particulars. Ihave provided his email address and if you do not wish to ascertain the legitimacy of this article through him, you may also contact the computing department regarding the incomplete biographical information of a number of the humanities/SCMP staff. I categorically deny falsifying any information and it is just not appropriate to advocate for the deletion of an article about someone who has contributed much to thinking and theory throughout his long academic life. I hope this is helpful but i strongly maintain that Australian academics really do need to be given more recognition for their contribution. <i>third unsigned comment by anon <a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.111.13.34.html" title="User:137.111.13.34">user:137.111.13.34</a></i></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am a GP at Round Corner Medical Centre in Dural, with an interest in English literature. I have read his nove "La chess sherry", which was a very interesting historical account of the profound meaning chess took on in Venice during the period of the Grand Serene Republic. He approaches the topic of dominance and democracy drawing upon the works of Immanuel Kant, Sigmund Freud, Jean-Jacques Rosseau, Jacques Derrida, Andy Warhol, Marcelle Freiman, Jane Messer, Rosemary Colmer, Andy Kissane and David Hume. Clearly, it is a very electic and original approach, because not only has Professor Goodall shown new insights into the theories of the abovementioned people, he has been able to draw them together and develop an innovative new theoretical perspective, which is something rare in academia these days. I am not sure who the writer of this bio was as they remained anonymous, however I do think they failed to provide sufficient information or background on his works and their significance to Australian literature. Hopefully someone from a literary background will be able to expand upon them.--Josette.docherty@gmail.com 07:22, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>== <i><b>Keep this one!</b></i> == I do know of peter Goodall but tend to agree with Josette that his bio needs significant work. It seems to have been written by an amateur, which is a pity, as its great to see Australian academics been given mention in encyclopedias. While I have not read his new book, I have seen, but after reading Josette's comment I will be obtaining myself a copy, though I have read several of his research papers in the field of Egyptology, which is an interest of myself and my late friend Professor Pierre Beaumont, who I believe also appreciated his works. --Stephent@psych.usyd.edu.au 07:31, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Expand</b> or <b>Clean Up</b>. The Macquarie website shows him as Deputy Dean of Humanities having published a work on the division between high culture and popular culture.

<li><b>Comment</b>: A number of the contributions above are made by people with remarkably similar (verbose) style and tendency to make spelling mistakes.

<li>That is unfair and a very pretentious thing to say - as many people use internet language and do not spell check or edit online pieces. There is nothing even "joke like" about the article and I would suggest that you really do check you facts before making unsubstantiated and quite frankly judgemental moralistic claims- please be real and look at your own issues rather than putting them on the internet. I stand by what I said and think Prof. Goodall is a very commendable person worthy of an encylopedia article. Read his stuff it is really good:) <i>fourth unsigned comment by anon <a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.111.13.34.html" title="User:137.111.13.34">user:137.111.13.34</a></i></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - V.C.&#160;? The only Australian term that uses V.C. that I know of is the Victoria Cross, and he doesn't have one. Unless the creator can explain what I've missed, I'd suggest that anything this article says that there is no cite for should be deleted. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 14:11, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The title V.C. given to Prof. Goodall is not a reference to either the victoria cross or vice chancellor, but rather is an honorary dignity ( called Most high Viccali Canonist, therefore the V.C. initials). This is one of the highest academic awards given out in Turkmenistan and is something i am sure he is extremely proud of. Don't discredit such a great honour <i>fifth unsigned comment by anon <a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.111.13.34.html" title="User:137.111.13.34">user:137.111.13.34</a></i>

<li>While <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> has again done an outstanding job of cleaning up the article, I can find no evidence that this person meets the recommended <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Sorry Rossami. I can't get the links to work despite the fact that they seem to work from Google. I cleaned it up so that people can consider his case for inclusion from the merits rather than the nonsense that he was born in 1921 in Turkmenistan presumably of the Turkmen Goodalls.

<li>Acting Dean, so not a low level professor. I've not got the impression that Macquarie is a bog-standard Uni, I thought they were better than that (a good standard Australian Uni - top twelve in the country, appeared in the top 100 of Asiaweek's survey of Asian universities, that sort of thing) and the humanities are one of their stronger areas. So a reasonably high position at a reasonably good university - and since I see no good reason why we should be significantly harsher on academics than we are on actors, sportspeople or pokemon cards, that would warrant Capitalistroadster's article as a <b>keep</b>, unverifiable claims by sockpuppets or not. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 10:33, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
