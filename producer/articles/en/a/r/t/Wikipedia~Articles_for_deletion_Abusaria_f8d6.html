This may be a long list, we'll see... I'm leaving out those who have more info than just the one line. If I list some you feel should be kept because they have some special importance, please say so and give a reason, so that perhaps those can be excluded from the deletion. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 07:39, 12 July 2006 (UTC) This list is not complete, and many others could perhaps be added, but it will have to do for now.

<li><b>No vote for now</b> - Does anyone know how many people approximately are in these clans?

Each one of the clan must be having its own mythology and history. I feel that each clan is like an <i>exotic tribe</i>. If these micro-stubs are allowed to grow, I am sure that over a period of time each shall have a reasonable content and information. We have many pages about villages having 10 or 12 households, and here we are dealing with clans, each with 1000s of households! --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 14:35, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Those figures listed are from the 1960s - so you're probably looking at somewhere in the region of 50 million people.

<li><b>Merge</b> as Eluchil404 suggested, or <b>Delete all</b> (except the three as noted above and below) for being original research and lacking enough content to believe them notable. Some clans/lineages are notable, some are not. My comment in the Jewlia AFD referenced the recent <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Paliam_195e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Paliam">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Paliam</a> where we decided to keep because one member of the lineage was notable, and have since moved the article to be a start for that notable individual. These don't offer us enough material to test for notability.
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/d/Andhak.html" title="Andhak">Andhak</a> Claims rulership over a specific territory. This is enough basis for a research, and if shown true it is keepable on the AFD:Paliam precedent.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/i/Maitla.html" title="Maitla">Maitla</a> has grown to 4 sentences in 4 sections, including a claim to a notable individual member. Probably would die as original research on its own, but at least it is stub quality.</li>

<ul>
<li>To expand, because they don't offer enough material to test for notability, and also don't offer enough content to be a decent stub, merging into a list is a good solution. When our (currently somewhat distracted) contributors to content on India have the time, they can work through the list to build out at least decent stubs for those where there is content to include. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 14:24, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand as appropriate. These are real life non-arbitrary concepts which affect rather a lot of people. Think of it as family names or, to be more concrete, Scottish clans. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 16:54, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Smerdis. Plus, some work's gone into putting these up. As and when information about these is available to India-related editors, they'll put more information in. There was no doubt a time when <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_MacKinnon_8213.html" title="Clan MacKinnon">Clan MacKinnon</a> had a line or two in its article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> (<a href="../../../h/o/r/User_talk%7EHornplease_7520.html" title="User talk:Hornplease">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hornplease_3946.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hornplease">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Delete all</b> per Dbpsmith; as for Zocky's Scottish clans analogy, does that mean that these are unverifiable, original research and copyvios, like most clan articles are&#160;? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 16:28, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b>: These stubs regarding Jat clans are one liner at present but likely to expand in future. Each clan contains in itself history. Some clans have been recorded and some have not been properly recorded. If a stub is kept on wikipedia with request to expand people tend to expand them. It has so happened with some clans but they became good article over a period. Deletion will not serve any purpose. Hence these may not be deleted. <b>Keep them all</b><a href="../../../l/r/b/User%7ELRBurdak_7c15.html" title="User:LRBurdak">burdak</a> 13:29, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b>: I would strongly recommend that all the pages should be kept. To begin with a stub of few words is not a bad idea. We should respect the spirit of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a>, and allow other editors to contribute so that the stub may grow: <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_Stubs_dcc7.html" title="User:Angela/Stubs">Please see</a>.

<dd>Any article about (Indian) surnames / family names have nothing to do with promoting one’s image or family name, or to do anything with <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy.html" title="Genealogy">genealogy</a>. In the Indian subcontinent, people of different faiths, and diverse regions, may have the same family name / surname, for example, “Choudhary” is a surname / family name, which a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">muslim</a> family may have in <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhaka.html" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangla_Desh_e060.html" title="Bangla Desh">Bangla Desh</a> and a <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> family may have in <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucknow.html" title="Lucknow">Lucknow</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>.</dd>

<dd>All said and done, I reiterate that the fact remains that Indian surnames/family names have historical and sociological significance and they function like socio-historical DNA fingerprints. Wikipedia and we, the Wikipedians should continue to contribute to enrich “the sum total of human knowledge”, of course, conforming to the Wikian philosophy and standard. And, so all bit of information is necessary, so that a seeker of knowledge should not return empty handed from wikipedia. Yes, sure, <i>Imagine a world in which every person has free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing.</i>" I repeat the same again.

<li><b>Keep all:</b> Please don't do this. Agreed, these are one-liner articles at the moment. But, all of us Indian Wikipedians can assure you that these will be expanded over time. What's more these clans are not exclusive just to India. Many of them are shared by neighbouring countries such as Pakistan. Deleting the whole lot would be an irreparable loss. Again, I request everybody to keep these pages as they are. They will evolve in due course of time.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep All</b> The idea of an encyclopedia is to have information it. Quite often, the information which appears useless to one individual, but may very well valuable to others. For someone to play god, sit in judgment, as to what is ‘valuable, important, useful’, may be fun; it could also be, one could suggest be bordering on arrogance.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Many of these names are Jat clan names. For researchers like me, they are useful, for as one gets deeper and deeper into the history of the people, it is of interest where they lived, how the names evolved, what their contributions to society were.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For the descendants of these clans, these give a family history. Many people turn now to Wikipedia as their first source of information. To delete these lists, is telling someone of this clan, ‘heh, you are not important enough, and let us erase you from our public records. That is a fate, slightly worse than death.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is correct these are stubs today. The idea of a stub is that it serves as a catalyst, to encourage people to expand it. This approach is working. Expanding the stubs will take time. They will be expanded, as more and more people get involved.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will strongly suggest that no names be deleted. People wishing to look for items to delete, may please take their focus efforts elsewhere. We should resist the temptation to play God. <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavi_Chaudhary_270b.html" title="User:Ravi Chaudhary">Ravi Chaudhary</a> 12:53, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not play God and resent that implication (as I do the one of arrogance). The articles <i>as they are</i> could hardly be valuable to others, as they presented no information beyond what was already in e.g. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jat_clans_e278.html" title="List of Jat clans">List of Jat clans</a>. They had no assertion of importance and were strictly speaking eligible for speedy deletion as an article about a group of people: <a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-bio_ac6d.html" title="Template:Db-bio">Template:Db-bio</a>. That would have been harsh though, and so I decided to start the discussion about these uninformative oneliners. The articles as presented do not "give a family hstory" (which is a category which falls clearly under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> anyway), and deleting them does not say "you are not important enough". The article has to make the case why its subject is important, not the other way around. If not being included is "a fate, slightly worse than death", then most of us are in the same position. As for the articles being stubs, intended to act as a catalyst: the <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abusaria.html" title="Abusaria">Abusaria</a> article was created in December 2005 and no more modified since February 2006. For me, it is impossible to know that anything more of encyclopedic value can and will be said about this family and others, and thus it is perfectly normal to nominate it for deletion, without playing God or having fun doing so. People wishing that these articles be kept should make a case about why they are important as per Wikipedia guidelines, not discuss the motivations of the nominator in a needlessly negative manner. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:42, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep All</b>. Many Indian-related articles have limited exposure online so it can be difficult for non-Indians (and Indians too!) to discern whether something is legitimate or not. Many of these gotras are used by vastly more people than other surnames listed on Wikipedia. I trust that the wiki process will eventually introduce more content into these articles. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;" lang="pa" xml:lang="pa">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 16:47, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: but other names aren't notable either, and every article that basically only says that "X is a surname found mostly there or there" should go. If the people who know more about these things claim that there is more to say (of encyclopedic value) about each and every of these family names / subclans / whatever you want to call them, I have no reason to doubt that, although the articles as they were gave no indication of that and hence were logical targets for deletion: so keeping them because encyclopedic contents (history, asserting importance, ...) will be added is fine by me, but keeping them because other family names are supposedly notable is a wrong reason, as that isn't true per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:42, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm confident that they will be expanded. All wiki articles grow quickly in size. I do not have enough familiarity with these clans to expand on many of them, but I have enough to realise much more <i>can</i> be written on them. <b><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Gizza</font></a></b><i><sup><a href="../../../d/a/g/User_talk%7EDaGizza_180b.html" title="User talk:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Chat</font></a></sup></i> <sup><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DaGizza_583c.html" title="Special:Contributions/DaGizza"><font color="teal">©</font></a></b></sup> 09:00, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment to all discussion above</b> I remain unconvinced that there is any reason to keeping these as separate articles at the present time. Merging to one list keeps all the content, and redirects to a list can be overwritten any time someone has the content for a decent stub. These lack the content to be a decent stub, with the possible exception of the three I called out above. If they don't properly belong in the list highlighted above, they may need to be in multiple lists. But the fact that I can't tell what would belong where is evidence that the current content is lacking adequate context - and the one thing a stub must have is adequate context for expansion. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 22:10, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
