<li><b>Keep</b>, Its hard to keep my fingers from typing out D*E*L*E*T*E, but that’s says more about me than about Rense. In the interest of fairness, I think he reached a level of notability a few years ago that justify his inclusion in WP. He has fallen out of not just the Talkers 100, but even the Talkers 250 in recent years, but that’s now,…a has-been for sure, but he was semi-significant in the world of talk radio once upon a time. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrimba_6849.html" title="User:Brimba">Brimba</a> 05:13, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I write this to bring attention to an important Web site that can be found through Google. The Web site I am referring to is that of the Jeff Rense radio talk show program. It is special because it has been singled out by the U.S. State Department as a site that contains "a great deal of unreliable information." If you go to the site, scroll down a little ways and on the left-hand side you'll see the word "Datapages." Under that is a</dd>

<dd>Getting the complete article costs $3, which I'm not willing to spend on a minor part of my Wikipedia hobby, but this header and length does not sound like an article as such. Note that 272 words is short - you've just read half the "article" right here. It is written in the first person, which is not a standard journalistic practice. It refers to the reader as "you", again, not very journalistic. It starts with "I write this to bring attention" - how many articles start like that? It reads like a "letter to the editor", or at best a poorly written editorial. The US SD mention seems to be that it was part of a long list of conspiracy sites, again, not something granting special notability to it. Please show me I'm wrong. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 15:48, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually, rense.com is one of only a handful of conspiracy sites that the state department explicitly mentions: <a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jul/27-595713.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jul/27-595713.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I do agree that the article I listed might not be the best source - the more I look at it, it <i>does</i> seem to be some sort of letter to the editor - but I'm sure there are some substantial sources out there. This guy was the host of a nationally radio show, after all, so give me some time to do some searching. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 16:32, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I did find an article that is actually <i>about</i> Rense and his website in <i>BusinessWorld</i> (Philippines). Here's an excerpt:
<dl>
<dd>The aliens are not just out there in outerspace. They are in cyberspace, too.</dd>
<dd>If you still can't believe it, try Sightings site (at <a href="http://www.sightings.com" class="external free" title="http://www.sightings.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sightings.com</a>) and get a load of the stories and photos from many sources from around the globe.</dd>
<dd>The site is based on the Sightings on Radio (formerly The End of the Line) program by Jeff Rense, a television news director and anchor for 12 years, the site explained. "The show presents advanced information and alternative views that rarely, if ever, appear in the mainstream media," it continued. [...]</dd>
<dd>Under the heading HOAX!, Mr. Rense explained how the site Webmaster was able to analyze that the UFO photo turned out to be a photo of a stage prop, particularly, stage lights.</dd>
<dd>"My Webmaster, James Neff, a brilliant analyst in his own right... determined that the new photo is indeed a stage prop as you can see from his enhanced computer work," explained Mr. Rense. (Silva, Veronica C. "Cyberspace: Host to Host". <i>BusinessWorld</i>. 4 September 1997. p. 18.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In addition, there are plenty of brief mentions in other sources, eg <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_4_28/ai_n6145277" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_4_28/ai_n6145277" rel="nofollow">this one from the <i>Skeptical Inquirer</i></a> and <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0GER/is_2002_Winter/ai_97116326" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0GER/is_2002_Winter/ai_97116326" rel="nofollow">this one from <i>Whole Earth</i></a>. Does any of this confer notability...? <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 17:15, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ehh.... There clearly are a lot of unrelated mentions, treating him as if he is well known. Will change my opinion, below. The BusinessWorld ref needs to be added to the article, that's at least more than just his site name, it's a couple of paragraphs. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 21:12, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Without commenting on Jeff Rense, the bottom line is that this article previously received a Keep result in an afd discussion and nothing significant has changed in the article.

<dd>Perhaps, but the last discussion was tainted because I had nominated the article and some of the people arguing to keep were doing so because I had been in an edit disput with them at the time over a completely different article.

<dd>He's not a part of an area or field, he's a fringe conspiracy theorist.

<dd>Those are compendiums of theories. You're essentially arguing that conspiracy theorizing is a field. If he was notable in a particular conspiracy theory (as long as the theory was notable), either establishing it or making some breaking discovery in it then I would be more inclined to agree with his notability under that particular theory. Just because there is an industry around it doesn't make it an institutionalized entity which would make it a field of research. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 19:27, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> per the previous AfD nom. However: <i>The Jeff Rense program show is broadcast over radio networks, satellite and the internet five times a week,</i> Please update the article for the sake of proving notability: WHICH radio networks? A syndicated radio show host is notable, someone who puts their podcast on shortwave repeaters is not. WHICH satellite? If your show is on Sirius/XM, that's more notable that someone putting their podcast on Free-to-Air. And the internet, people pay to listen - could be notable, question is - HOW MANY? <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 23:21, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Whole Earth (magazine) said in its Winter 2002 edition on p. 40 "Jeff Rense broadcasts interviews and conspiracy reports via his Internet radio show for three hours every night of the week and claims over 7 million hits a month. His site archives these shows and also provides innumerable daily news articles on how the world is going to hell in a handbasket. A much linked-to site." <a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 00:28, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Bit soon to nominate this one again since the last one was keep, and while <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">consensus can change</a> I'd hate to see AfD become a pitch-till-you-win scenario. There have been no new complaints about the article, and the article has not changed that substantially since the last keep. Thus, I'd say let the kook be for another few months unless new complaints can be lodge. He appears to be a notable kook, at present.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 01:02, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment: He once had (still in the archives) a article about a British National who hacked the U.S. Defense system computers to get UFO info. He found something that the US govt. does'nt want released. He also has another article depicting how North Korean troops could defeat the US in war. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 23:09, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Secondary Comment: If you see red or colored links on his articles, <b>Bold</b> BLACK links, either click on them, or access these seperately. Those are the sources of the articles submitted to him, such as the one example placed here referring to Concentration/Internment Camps in America intended to deal with "troublesome" Americans when the <a href="../../../n/w/o/NWO_a6ae.html" title="NWO">NWO</a> is in place, according to its author. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 23:53, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Third Comment: The reason I said to give the Paranormal boys a chance at this, is that 1/4 to 1/2 of the articles reference UFO and/or paranormal matters. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 23:57, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Too soon for another AfD, agree with Rosicrucian this is not pitch til you win, per Sparkhead and AnonEMouse having found several mainstream references, although his theories are not my cup of tea. Seems a notable kook. We do not have to agree his theories are valid or even rational for him to have an article, but a significant proportion of the population do share some theories he publicizes. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 01:05, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
