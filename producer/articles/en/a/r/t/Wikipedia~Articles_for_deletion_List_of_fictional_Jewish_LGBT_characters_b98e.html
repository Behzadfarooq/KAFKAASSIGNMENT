<dd><font color="green">On the face of the AFD contributions, consensus is split fairly evenly between merge and delete, with a few keeps. There is a significant majority for <b>delete the article</b> (ie, either of delete or merge), on the basis of listcruft or <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT an indiscriminate list</a>. Both delete and merge imply removal of this independent article. This implies a consensus is achieved that there isn't justification for an independent article. However, there is <i>also</i> a significant number (around 50%) of <b>keep the information</b> (ie, keep or merge), implying a significant view that the information is considered useful and appropriate, and a view that it should be preserved somehow either by keeping or merging. (Note - Argument by analogy is not appropriate for AFD, each article is judged on its own merits as per <a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a>.)</font></dd>

<dd><font color="green">Taking these two together, it seems there is a communal consensus overall: - that the list is considered overall sufficiently encyclopedic or notable to keep the information, but not sufficiently important for its own independent article. It thefore looks like consensus is that the list should probably be merged into some other more relevant article, and this one deleted or redirected. Looking at the proposed target articles suggested, I'm inclined to agree that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_Jews_2a00.html" title="List of fictional Jews">List of fictional Jews</a> is a more useful location to try, than <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_LGBT_Jews_4bf5.html" title="List of LGBT Jews">List of LGBT Jews</a>, on the basis that fiction/nonfiction seems a more fundamental distinction than straight/gay. Or, as per one comment somewhere, it 'muddies the water' if fictional Jews are added to an article mainly listing real Jews.</font></dd>

<p>Although I am the article "creator" (albeit after splitting it off) and also the nominator, please do not use this as a reason to consider speedy deletion. I feel the article should have a full chance to have a consensus formed. The list is a valid list, but I feel it does not pass any of the criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia. I split it from the original article, a genuinely notable list, because it diluted that article with ephemera, and did so after flagging a possible split on that talk page (no responses after 8 days). Although I am nominating the list my nomination is <b>Neutral</b> and a request for a consensus to be formed <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 14:21, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> all lists of x who are y and z.

<li>Well maybe. However I'm uncertain what this provides that existing lists don't. Is there something unique about fictional Jewish LGBT people that can't be dealt with on existing lists of fictional Jews or LGBT?--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>The question arises: is this a set of Jews for the list of fictional LGBT characters, or an LGBT list within the list of fictional Jews? Even if the article lacks sufficient legs as an independent work, it is still a collection of content that would otherwise be duplicated in other lists. --<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 00:31, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

As no deletion vote has cited a basis in policy, and I am unaware of any method for selecting the intersection of multiple categories, I must endorse keeping it. --<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 06:10, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment/Question</b> You make a valid point about the intersection. Is the list itself of sufficient "everything" that it warrants a place here?

<li>Based on some of the contributions to the discussion, it seems that merging the content would be an acceptable alternative, as long as the content gets incorporated into all relevant lists (fictional characters, LGBT Jews, fictional LGBT characters, fictional Jews, etc). However, I still see the maintenance of a separate page that can be included by links within all the aforementioned groups as a more common-sense solution, especially considering that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia isn't a paper encyclopedia</a>. --<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 00:31, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> it does not belong in a list of real people. It devalues that list by virtue of the characters being fictional. If the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_LGBT_Jews_4bf5.html" title="List of LGBT Jews">List of LGBT Jews</a> is an important list then it should not be devalued with fictional folk.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I am not a fan of lists, anyway, and this list serves little purpose that I can see.
