<p>An <b>art intervention</b> is an interaction with a previously existing artwork, audience or venue/space. It has the auspice of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conceptual_art.html" title="Conceptual art">conceptual art</a> and is commonly a form of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Performance_art.html" title="Performance art">performance art</a>. It is associated with the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viennese_Actionism_ce67.html" title="Viennese Actionism">Viennese Actionists</a>, the <a href="../../../d/a/d/Dada.html" title="Dada">Dada</a> movement and <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Dadaists_7be9.html" title="Neo-Dadaists">Neo-Dadaists</a>. It has also been made much use of by the <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuckism.html" title="Stuckism">Stuckists</a> to affect perceptions of other artwork which they oppose, and as a protest against an existing intervention.</p>
<p>Although intervention by its very nature carries an implication of subversion, it is now accepted as a legitimate form of art and is often carried out with the endorsement of those in positions of authority over the artwork, audience or venue/space to be intervened in. However, unendorsed (i.e. illicit) interventions are common and lead to debate as to the distinction between art and <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a> <sup id="_ref-tools_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tools" title="">[1]</a></sup>. By definition it is a challenge, or at the very least a comment, related to the earlier work or the theme of that work, or to the expectations of a particular audience, and more likely to fulfil that function to its full potential when it is unilateral, although in these instances, it is almost certain that it will be viewed by authorities as unwelcome, if not vandalism, and not art.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_intervention.html" title="Edit section: Authorised">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Authorised</span></h2>
<p>There are many art interventions which are carried out in contexts where relevant invitation and approval has been given.</p>
<p><a name="Detroit_MONA_goes_kaBOOM.21.2C_2002" id="Detroit_MONA_goes_kaBOOM.21.2C_2002"></a></p>

<p>The extreme to which an authorised intervention can go and yet still meet with institutional approval was shown in 2002, when the Detroit Museum of New Art staged a show <i>kaBoom!</i>, with the announcement, "Over the course of the exhibition, museum visitors will be invited to smash, drop, throw and slash artworks..."<sup id="_ref-kaboom_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kaboom" title="">[2]</a></sup> The show was scheduled for two months, but by the end of the first night had been totally destroyed by visitors:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"They even destroyed the pedestals and wall shelves," one museum staffer shrugged in disbelief. Fires were set in isolated galleries and a wrecking ball for one display had been removed from its chain and used instead as a bowling ball, taking out an installation as well as the corner of one wall. "In a twisted way, it was a wild success," MONA’s director Jef Bourgeau says the morning after, on a surprisingly bright note as he wades through the carnage and debris.<sup id="_ref-kaboomreview_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kaboomreview" title="">[3]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>This follows the precedent of the Dadaists. At one of their shows, visitors were invited to smash the exhibits with an axe.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_intervention.html" title="Edit section: Hanging Old Masters backwards, 2004">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hanging Old Masters backwards, 2004</span></h3>
<p>A more usual authorised art intervention in an institution is done with great care to make sure that no harm comes to the existing collection. In 2004, the Old Town House in <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Town_7c7b.html" title="Cape Town">Cape Town</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, hung its Michaelis Collection of 17th century Dutch Old Master paintings facing the wall. The curator Andrew Lamprecht said this exhibition, titled <i>Flip</i>, "would force gallery goers to reconsider their preconceptions about the art and its legacy." Knowledge of intent is integral to such a process, as it would be perceived differently if it were announced in a conservation context, rather than as an art piece. However, in this instance there was some ambiguity about the purpose of the exercise as Lamprecht, although stating, "I'm asking questions about the history", also added a more standard "educative" comment, "the reverse of the paintings revealed a wealth of detail not normally on view to the public, ranging from old attempts to preserve the canvas to notes from different collectors over the years",<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[4]</a></sup> thus lessening the confrontational impact of his actions.</p>

<p>An authorised art intervention which required considerable effort to gain the requisite permission was the wrapping in red duct tape of the equestrian statue of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Napier%2C_1st_Baron_Napier_of_Magdala_a7a4.html" title="Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala">Lord Napier of Magdala</a>, situated on Queens Gate in West London. This was done by <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleonora_Aguiari_ec42.html" title="Eleonora Aguiari">Eleonora Aguiari</a>, a <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_College_of_Art_9626.html" title="Royal College of Art">Royal College of Art</a> (RCA) student for her final show. When questioned as to whether she had considered a clandestine act, she replied, "No, not my style, I like to challenge the institutions." In order to do this she needed clearance letters from the RCA Rector, a professor, the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_and_Albert_2a64.html" title="Victoria and Albert">Victoria and Albert</a> museum conservation department and the RCA conservation department, bronze tests, a scaffolding license, indemnity insurance, and permission from <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Heritage_58b3.html" title="English Heritage">English Heritage</a> (who own the statue), the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Westminster_d04f.html" title="City of Westminster">City of Westminster</a>, two Boroughs (<a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Borough_of_Chelsea_4f50.html" title="Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea">Chelsea</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kensington.html" title="Kensington">Kensington</a>, as their boundary bisects the length of the horse) and the present Lord Napier.</p>
<p>Then a layer of cling wrap and almost 80 rolls of red duct tape were applied by 4 people working for 4 days. Aguiari described it as "a Zen action up there in the middle of traffic, but alone with a beautiful statue. Every detail on the statue is perfect and slightly larger than normal," and said that "statuary that symbolizes military past, or imperialism should be covered to make the topics of the past visible." <sup id="_ref-red_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-red" title="">[5]</a></sup>Aguiari then received a phone call: "Saatchi wants to talk to you", but, on keeping the appointment, she found herself talking not to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Saatchi_9f71.html" title="Charles Saatchi">Charles Saatchi</a> but to Michael Moszynski of the advertising firm, <a href="../../../s/a/a/Saatchi_and_Saatchi_f812.html" title="Saatchi and Saatchi">Saatchi and Saatchi</a>, who thought her idea would be suitable for "a Tory advertising campaign", and wanted her to wrap an ambulance in red tape. She declined the offer.<sup id="_ref-tory_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tory" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite her official clearance, the action caused controversy<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[7]</a></sup> through press coverage, including a <a href="../../../r/e/u/Reuters.html" title="Reuters">Reuters</a> press agency photo (right, reproduced in the <i>Daily Times</i> of <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>).<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>"Bansky" is the operating name of one of the best-known interventionists in the UK. He has carried out many graffiti stencillings, usually with a specific message or comment. He has also infiltrated his own artwork into museums, where they have remained for varying amounts of time before being removed. In May 2005, for example, he hung his own version of a primitive <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cave_painting.html" title="Cave painting">cave painting</a>, showing a human pushing a shopping trolley, in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Museum_7dce.html" title="British Museum">British Museum</a>.

If they left it on the wall they would be accused of anti-semitism by their opponents. On the other hand, if they took the work down, they would be censoring the work of a Jewish artist dealing with anti-semitic stereotypes. Catch 22.</p>
<p>The authorities were forced to take the piece down. The piece attracted considerable attention from the media. Lee offered to remove his "Judensau" on condition that a 14th century sculpture of a "Judensau" was removed from the side of Martin Luther's church in Wittenberg. Martin Luther, in addition to founding the Lutheran church, was a well-known anti-semite. His book "The Jews and their lies" had an influence on Nazi ideas.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[10]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>Although the legal technicalities are straightforward, when an unauthorised intervention intervenes in an officially-sanctioned one, the moral issues may be far less straightforward, especially when the legal act meets with widespread public disapproval (even to the point of considering it vandalism), while the illicit reaction to it satisfies a public sense of justice.</p>

Aside from complaints on the grounds of <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_taste.html" title="Bad taste">bad taste</a>, this act was described by some as "<a href="../../../d/e/f/Defacement_%28vandalism%29.html" title="Defacement (vandalism)">defacement</a>", although the set was a late 1930s printing.

<p>A seminal example of this approach took place in 1917 when <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Duchamp_9a05.html" title="Marcel Duchamp">Marcel Duchamp</a> submitted a urinal (laid on its back, signed by him "R.Mutt 1917", and titled <i><a href="../../../f/o/u/Fountain_%28Duchamp%29_e41c.html" title="Fountain (Duchamp)">Fountain</a></i>) to the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_Independent_Artists_c745.html" title="Society of Independent Artists">Society of Independent Artists</a> exhibition. The Society had proclaimed their open-mindedness by stating they would accept all work submitted, only anticipating that conventional media (paintings) would be. Duchamp was a member of the Society's board, and interpreted the regulations at face-value. His entry was immediately rejected as "not being art", and he resigned from the board shortly after. The original <i>Fountain</i> was lost—an indication of the scant regard Duchamp held for it. Fifty years later, Duchamp commissioned reproductions, which were then highly sought by museums.<sup id="_ref-fountain_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fountain" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1961, fellow <a href="../../../d/a/d/Dada.html" title="Dada">Dadaist</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Richter_84bd.html" title="Hans Richter">Hans Richter</a>, wrote to Duchamp:</p>
<dl>

<p>Duchamp wrote "Ok, ça va très bien" ("that's fine") in the margin beside it, and the quote is often erroneously attributed to him.</p>

<p>There are clearly cases where vandalism takes place, though this can sometimes be by mentally imbalanced individuals. Sometimes art vandalism is used to make a political protest. Whether this is or isn't regarded as a legitimate political act, it is not normally seen as art, nor until recently would the question have even arisen. However, with the increasing dissolution of boundaries between art and life, and the broadening of art's scope, there has been an increasing tendency to view unusual or spectacular actions as art, even though the actions were never intended as art.</p>

<p>There is also a widespread use of the term "art intervention" to refer not to a particular intended or achieved act, but generically to any presence of art or artists in an environment, where this may not have previously been the case, i.e. it just means "art". The extensive use of this is shown in instances from the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Borough_of_Bexley_e3d6.html" title="London Borough of Bexley">London Borough of Bexley</a> ("This Strategy aims to put 'culture at the heart of regeneration', and will build on the success of the first major Public Art intervention in the borough—The Erith Arts Project"),<sup id="_ref-bexley_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bexley" title="">[30]</a></sup> to Neal Civic Center in <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> ("Plans include video documentation of this project so it can be used as a prototype for rural art intervention programs nationwide"),<sup id="_ref-neal_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-neal" title="">[31]</a></sup> and Mayor Howard W.
