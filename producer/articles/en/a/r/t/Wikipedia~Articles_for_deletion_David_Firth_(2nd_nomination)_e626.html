<li><b>Comment</b>, could someone please explain why this meets WP:BIO? I've been googling, and get this flash animator, stats professors and an actor. Apart from a single mention in FHM Estonia (noted earlier) relating to Firth (the flash animator), that appears to be it for reliable information.

<li><b>Comment</b>, how many times would you like me to restate the same thing. Read this submission again... you know, that bit at the top where I explained the problem with this article. One of the requirements of Wikipedia is "reliable information". There isn't anyway in this case. Notable people generally have solid reliable sources for information about them. People whose flash animations have 30 seconds of fame among a tiny section of newgrounds fans... don't. This article is entirely populated with cruft from blogs, personal websites and web forum posts... all of which are expressly ruled out by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 17:50, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I wasn't contradicting your reliability of sources issue. But now you mention it, I will. Expressly ruled out? More like expressly ruled in: from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, "Neither online nor print sources deserve an automatic assumption of reliability by virtue of the medium they are printed in". Basically, take it on a case-by-case basis. In this case, I think the article should definitely stay. Although we can't quantify his fanbase, I'm sure you're underestimating it when you say 30 seconds of fame among a tiny section of newgrounds fans... I admit that I am a fan, but I've never been on newgrounds. And I certainly have been a fan for more than 30 seconds. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonONeill_b6d3.html" title="User:JonONeill">Jono</a> 18:01, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- Well, I notice that you ignored the main part of of WP:RS that relates to this: <i>"At the other end of the reliability scale lie personal websites, weblogs (blogs), bulletin boards, and Usenet posts, which are not acceptable as sources. Rare exceptions may be when a well-known professional person or acknowledged expert in a relevant field has set up a personal website using his or her real name. Even then, we should proceed with caution, because the information has been self-published, which means it has not been subject to any independent form of fact-checking.</i>. There's nothing case by case about it. Nothing in this article comes from reliable sources. It's blogs, web forums and personal websites. What we have here is someone with no notablity outside of a small selection of people, who happen to also be internet users and show up to vote "keep" in AFDs. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 18:21, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP - AND HOPEFULLY A CONCLUSION TO THIS NONSENSE!</b> Dearest Mr Motor Billpg Gareth Owen etc and the others behind deleting this entry - with the greatest respect you have no idea what you are talking about!! I use Wikipedia almost daily as a source of information - I am not really part of the community and I do not really know the ins and outs of Wikipedia's rules and regulations. However I do know what I want from it as a user. I want Wikipedia to provide answers to questions that I have. Here is the prospective of a user:- When a year or so ago I first came across Fat Pie (The website of David Firth) I wanted to know more and so I searched Wikipedia. I found a number of entries and my knowledge of the guy grew. Surely the fact that one person found the information useful should be the end of the discussion? I am increasingly noticing that articles I want to read are marked for deletion due to certain members of the community having no knowledge or understanding of them. If this continues then Wikipedia is destined to only cater for the majority? Or be restricted by the very structure that has created it so far. I don’t want Wikipedia to become the McDonalds of Internet Encyclopaedias! Back to David Firth: (Because I know Mr Motor will ignore what I have said and bleat on about WP:BIO – Christ he is so anal!) David Firth has not just experienced 5 minutes of fame - He has steadily built a following over a number of years, his characters and creations are commonly known throughout UK, USA, Australia and around the world, particularly so amongst students and young people. No he not restricted to just the enormous success of Salad Fingers, he has many other popular individual cartoons and character series and his 'documentary' of Devvo is due to appear on both Channel4 and E4 in the UK in June and July. For some time he has showcased his animations on New Grounds an online community of 1,010,452 (As at 9th June 2006) flash animators where David Firth is known by all and has influenced a large majority, so much so that Newgrounds now pay him so that he can keep animating and submitting to them. (Mr Motor can you show that you have inspired nearly a million people?!) David Firth is a unique and prolific creative talent who has many many fans... Maybe some of these entries need to be cleaned up but deleted? Not if you want to maintain Wikipedia as an important resource. <b>TO CONCLUDE MY LITTLE RANT!</b> I would like to see Wikipedia continue to be the best and first source for information on the Internet. So Stop Bloody deleting it!! Would you delete Ricky Gervais because you have a section titled The Office? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 87.74.59.143 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_87.74.59.143_9ff8.html" title="Special:Contributions/87.74.59.143">contribs</a>) 17:06, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Salad fingers and it's artist David Firth are both very notable. There is absolutely <b>no</b> reason to completely remove this article. Look at all the people commenting here. People are searching for david on wikipedia so please keep the article, however cleaning it up couldn't hurt. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPrettyMuchBryce_e82c.html" title="User:PrettyMuchBryce">PrettyMuchBryce</a> 17:56, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, and yet, as with all the other keep votes, you don't say why or explain how he meets any of the guidelines. Or why a biographical article should remain when there isn't a single reliable source of information for any of the information in it. See <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. But hey, you know... David Firth and his half a dozen flash animations on newgrounds are as notable as Ricky Gervais. Oddly I can point to hundreds of reliable sources of information regarding Gervais, so we can write a nice interesting and informative biography. Unlike, say, the creator of a minor internet meme who's had his 15 mins of blog fame. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 18:28, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> A key player in a community of a million Animators not a half dozen... And the point about Gervais / office is that a creation and a creator can both be notable...
<ul>
<li><b>Comments</b>, "can be" vs "actually is". Gervais is notable outside of the <i>The Office</i>. As I said, Firth is the creator of a minor internet meme. <a href="../../../m/e/m/WP%7EMEME_0b58.html" title="WP:MEME">WP:MEME</a> is a proposed guideline regarding this -- if the meme is notable (and I actually doubt that it is) then have an article, but do not create a biographical article for its creator unless there is something else worth adding. There isn't... because there is no more information available. It's forum posts from a few fans, blog entries and his personal websites. <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a>. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 07:26, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> and clean up the crap. Although i'm not sure where 'pedia stands on "Internet Celebrities", he's not really notable as a person - but notable for his works, which i think exceeds just Salad Fingers. I'm not a deletionist, but maybe it should be deleted and remade when he's actually Meatspace Notable and we have verifiable information on him. -- <span style="border:1px solid #ccc;background:#eee; padding:1px"><a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffthejiff_537e.html" title="User:Jeffthejiff"><span style="color:#333;font-weight:bold">jeffth</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">e</span></a><a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffthejiff_60df.html" title="User talk:Jeffthejiff"><span style="color:#333;font-weight:bold;">jiff</span></a></span> 09:25, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The page is still useful. I was extremely pleased to find the article, then at least equally displeased when i noticed that it had been marked for deletion. I was unable to find the information in the article anywhere else, and it answered several questions I had. It should be noted that pretty much everyone petitioning for the article to be removed seems to be ignorant of mr firth's contribution to and impact on the internet. Even if only a couple of people have been searching for him, that should still validate the article. I knew he created salad fingers; I wanted to know more about him and this article was the only source I could find. Instead of deleting it, we should all be researching David Firth in order to make the article more valid!<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Sexy cam (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sexy_cam_5521.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sexy cam">contribs</a>).</small>
