<li><b>Strong Keep</b>:'Oldest Anglican cathedral in Canada' asserts notability. <i>An important ecclesiastical centre for the Niagara Peninsula, Christ Church was erected in stages, its form altered as the size and prominence of the congregation increased. Begun in 1835 as a parish church, the frame building was expanded in 1852-54 with the addition of a stone chancel and nave extension designed by the renowned Toronto architect William Thomas. The present nave, fashioned by Henry Langley, a specialist in church architecture noted for his masterly High Victorian Gothic designs, was completed in 1876, a year after Christ's Church was designated the cathedral for the newly-formed Diocese of Niagara. Although the building has undergone various alterations and renovations since then, notably the extension of the chancel in 1924-25 it retains its handsome 19th-century character.</i> Source: <a href="http://www.waynecook.com/ahamilton-wentworth.html" class="external free" title="http://www.waynecook.com/ahamilton-wentworth.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.waynecook.com/ahamilton-wentworth.html</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbrownsbody_afca.html" title="User:Johnbrownsbody">Johnbrownsbody</a> 02:50, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> That link doesn't say its the "OLDEST". Thus, the lead sentence that "Oldest Anglican cathedral in Canada asserts notability" is deceiving on two accounts. There is no source for the oldest catherdal claim, there is no source this is on the Canadian historical registry. If these links are supplied it would be an obvious keep, but its lacking <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> now.<a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 02:57, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>One does wonder why this cathedral article in particular is singled out for deletion when it is part of a series on Anglican cathedrals in Canada — and no, I did not create that list; I did rename it from a somewhat cumbersome earlier title. Are cathedrals not inherently notable? At least that which is the second oldest in Canada, the oldest in anglophone Canada and one of only three pre-Confederation Upper Canada/Canada West cathedrals? The issue of older colonial buildings existing in the USA is of questionable relevance: anglophone Canada is of much more recent establishment. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 19:20, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am familiar with WP:AGF, thank you <i>very</i> much. It does <i>not</i> mean to assume good faith in spite of all evidence to the contrary. The use of the term "sect" is at <i>best</i> unfortunate and misleading. I am curious as to what this "widely used sense" is: Wiktionary provides one definition - "A cult or religious movement, a group sharing particular (often unorthodox) political and/or religious beliefs." The <i>connotation</i> here is quite strong, even if the <i>denotation</i> could be argued to be harmless. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolynparrishfan_61da.html" title="User:Carolynparrishfan">Carolynparrishfan</a> 17:58, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Of course, if you look at <a href="../../../s/e/c/Sect.html" title="Sect">Sect</a> you see "A sect is in a non-Indian context generally a small religious or political group. Sects have many beliefs and practices in common with the religion or party that they have broken off from, but are differentiated by a number of doctrinal differences. In contrast, a denomination is a large, well-established religious group...". So to follow AGF, we come to the conclusion that the deletion proposal came from an editor who didn't really understand the subject at hand anyway. -- <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeardo_5fe6.html" title="User:Beardo">Beardo</a> 22:25, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Cathedral buildings as a rule are notable, and this one clearly has a history, both architectural and ecclesiatical. Deleting it as collateral punishment for <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_M._Kendrick_8627.html" title="Donald M. Kendrick">Donald M. Kendrick</a> is way out of line, and the use of "sect" instead of "denomination" is derogatory. But that's beside the point: the article contains notable material, and that's sufficient justification. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 18:39, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Before you conclude that this was a matter of collateral punishment, consider that the article was not in the exemplary condition it is now at the start of the process. The nominator was not the only person who had good faith concerns about the article -- I previously proposed its deletion and was monitoring the article's progress at the time of the nom. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 19:27, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Poorly written articles about notable subjects should be tagged for cleanup, not for deletion. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 23:03, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I disagree in part. There were no apparent sources that could be found to improve the article based on my cursory search. In addition, I disagree with this Cathedral="notable by default" theory that has sprung up in this discussion. I think it is biased in favor of religious institutions that have Bishops and could very well lead to a situation where Cathedrals that aren't very notable are kept "over" individual parishes that are more notable. When there is no apparent basis for notability, bringing an article in for AfD discussion is the only responsible thing to do if you ask me. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 23:13, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Sorry, but I completely disagree with this. Any major church, whether of an episcopal denomination or not, is notable (we have many articles on churches which are not cathedrals). But cathedrals can easily be defined as notable for being the mother church of a diocese and usually (not always, but usually) pretty large. Nobody is saying that the churches of episcopal denominations are more notable than the churches of other denominations, but only those denominations have a group of churches that are defined as inherently notable in this way, so it makes sense to define cathedrals as a class as notable buildings. Like it or not, people are interested in cathedrals. When I visit a new city, the cathedral is always the first place I head for. And I'm not religious in the slightest - I just like fine buildings. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 23:33, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>How long do you believe it will take to add material that may establish the notability of this Church? I'm certainly happy to leave you be for a number of days or perhaps a month before re-checking the article to make sure any concerns have been met. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 08:03, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>
<dd><i>My concern is simply that most Church locations are not notable. There certainly are ones that are, though. What you have mentioned already sounds promising, so I really don't think there will be a problem once you're farther along building the article. In fact, I'm rather looking forward to it. That's one part of the reason why I like to go back and look at the work done. Do remember to remove the proposed deletion template if you have not already done so. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 08:17, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>
<dd>And the last sentence of your 13 September 2006 comment is what caused me to remove the proposed deletion template. Which is what really put the skunk in the air conditioner. I'm still wondering what the issue is with filling in the red-linked articles in a prior list of cathedrals (or indeed of anything). All Wikipedia articles are, after all, works-in-progress and the gratuitous insertion of a proposed deletion template in an article bearing the stub template without any prior notice by <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> as opposed to your approach to the matter does reverse the onus as to the presumption of good faith. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 19:49, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
