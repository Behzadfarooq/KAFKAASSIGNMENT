<li><b>Keep</b> "...(T)he article appears to be written by the subject" is an absolutely false and libelous claim. Additionally, the reference to "promoted to a speaking role" and the admission that "I'm not very in-the-loop on sports terminology," are clear indications that this editor, Kuzaar, despite having very quietly snuck in this five-day only proposal to delete this well-documented "Mouhammad Faye" article, after following it's lengthy history, including numberous, legitimate edits, is TOTALLY UNQUALIFIED to edit this category of article. Wikidpedia might be wise to BAN SUCH IMPOSTERS FROM EDITING SPORTS ARTICLES, as they deem appropriate. KEEP MOUHAMMAD FAYE; BAN THE IMPOSTERS. --Possepartner 21:33, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am bringing to the closing admin's attention, this url: <a href="http://www.georgia-tech-basketball.blogspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.georgia-tech-basketball.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.georgia-tech-basketball.blogspot.com/</a> , where the accurate accumulation of facts in the Mouhammad Faye article will be disseminated (via websearches) to possibly millions of fans of the highest level of U.S. college basketball throughout the world, including Faye's proud homeland of Senegal, and the entire Africa continent. The impact of communicating this accurate knowledge, particularly as the subject's fame increases, is worth another strong, empassioned plea to "Keep" this article in Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Thank you for your consideration. --Possepartner 17:53, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Listen, I know that you want this included, but it just doesn't meet the standards. Right now, the subject is a little under the threshold of notability required by Wikipedia. But I'm sure that given a few years, Faye will become more and more well known and notable in his achievements, and when that day comes, it will be appropriate for him to have an article. I try to be openminded, but when an AFD dispute like this comes along and attracts dozens of sockpuppet votes, I have to be firm in my resolve to stick to Wikipedia policy. I wish you luck in the future. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 22:14, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The information in the article is true, and is of value to anyone that has an interest in college basketball, Georgia Tech especially. Also, there have been numerous online gathering points where the "legend" of Faye was extolled, brought on by a LACK of information about this basketball player from Senegal. Removing information about him, will no doubt again lead to the interested looking for information, and then having to make it up as it will not be widely available. I see no reason why the article should be deleted, except that some have "dug in" to their positions. Is is also, IMO, weak on the part of the editor to infer that the article was written by the subject, as this is an allegation that should have at least the aspect of merit, rather than accusing someone of doing this without any cause. Just because the editor is wrong, he should be willing to leave the page alone to atone for his mistake.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>I said this before and I will say it again, if you people know nothing about sports, please don't talk and please don't decide what should be on here. Faye is a celebrity in Senegal, and actually took part in their NBA camp, and scored very well. If people like Kuzaar are going to sit in front of their computer and discourage people from having profiles on here because they are popular in another country, they have the wrong intentions. Further, there are MANY ncaa athletes on here. A basketball player is a star, and a noteworthy addition to Wikipedia...especially a basketball player at a school that was in the FIANL FOUR two years ago, and holds a lot of sway nationwide. One more thing, to say Kuzaar isn't qualified isn't a personal attack, it just happens to be true that as a non sports fan he's opinion shouldn't be taken as seriously here...this just isn't his realm. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.174.133.128 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.174.133.128.html" title="User talk:68.174.133.128">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.174.133.128_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.174.133.128">contribs</a>).</small>
