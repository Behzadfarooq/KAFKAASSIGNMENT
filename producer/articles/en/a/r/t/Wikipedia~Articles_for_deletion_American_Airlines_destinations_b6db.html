<p>According to Wikipedia guidelines, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> is a criteria for the inclusion of an article in our encyclopedia. <i>A topic is <b>notable</b> if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Wikipedia%7EIndependent_sources_664e.html" title="Wikipedia:Independent sources">independent of the subject itself</a> and each other.</i> It is quite clear that these lists fail this criteria. Except for that, it should be noted that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, and that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>. Based on well, this argument, and some others, the highly relevant <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Livingston_Airline_Destinations_1b29.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Livingston Airline Destinations">AfD on Livingston Airline Destinations</a> resulted in a delete. Please, before submitting your thoughts here, read through the relevant discussion there.</p>
<p>In addition to the nominated page, I would like to batch-nominate <b>172 related articles</b>. Per instructions on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>, I was to add a list of batch-nominated articles below using {{<a href="../../../l/a/_/Template%7ELa_6d37.html" title="Template:La">la</a>}}. However, the sheer size of that list - <b>172 entries</b> - prompts me to link it instead. You may view it <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_American_Airlines_destinations_Nominated_articles_2970.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/American Airlines destinations/Nominated articles">here</a>.</p>
<p>Briefly, it contains <b>every article listed in <a href="../../../a/i/r/Category%7EAirline_destinations_a311.html" title="Category:Airline destinations">Category:Airline destinations</a></b> at the time of writing. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn"><font color="#FF8000">Jobjörn</font></a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 23:43, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment Reply</b> - They inform the readers the places where an airline flies, which is pretty vital information when you think about it, just like airport articles contain large lists of the airlines located within the airport, as well as the destinations flown by those airlines from that airport, a reader would want to what destinations an individual airline flies to. The reason we separate these into subarticles, however, is because they are most often very large and won't fit well within the airline's article itself, thus, these are actually just subarticles attached to the airline articles (just like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_victims_of_the_Columbine_High_School_massacre_3a80.html" title="List of victims of the Columbine High School massacre">List of victims of the Columbine High School massacre</a> is attached to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbine_High_School_massacre_3e4b.html" title="Columbine High School massacre">Columbine High School massacre</a>). It's the same basic information as that list there, just like people want to know who died in that massacre, and people would also like to know where an airline flies to, it gives a better perspective on the airline's goals and achievements. Most of all however, these lists are important information from a main article which doesn't fit in it so, something that exists ALL OVER WIKIPEDIA, if you delete these, then we better get on deleting all of those, too. -- <a href="../../../s/m/t/User%7ESmthManly_78cd.html" title="User:SmthManly"><font color="black">SmthManly</font></a> / <sup><a href="../../../s/m/t/User_talk%7ESmthManly_fa27.html" title="User talk:SmthManly"><font color="blue">ManlyTalk</font></a></sup> / <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SmthManly_7bda.html" title="Special:Contributions/SmthManly"><font color="blue">ManlyContribs</font></a></sup> 07:43, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply to comment reply:</b> The comparison of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_American_Airlines_destinations_10c5.html" title="List of American Airlines destinations">List of American Airlines destinations</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_victims_of_the_Columbine_High_School_massacre_3a80.html" title="List of victims of the Columbine High School massacre">List of victims of the Columbine High School massacre</a> and stating it's the same basic information is, to me, disgusting and revolting. Even though I live on the other side of the world I am unable to comprehend how one can compare a list of murder victims in a highly publicized massacre shown in the news ALL OVER THE WORLD - with a list of trivial airline destinations. The list of Columbine victims is not trivial, it is certainly of encyclopedic value and most definitely passes all notability/verifiability/etc guidelines you could think of.<br />
Now, compare that to a <i>list of destinations of an airline</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Actually, the list of victims of Columbine isn't any more "encyclopedic" than a list of airline destinations. Obviously the event itself deserves an article, but the fact that it was a horrible event doesn't mean it should receive special treatment when it comes to a list of victims. Should we create a list of every single victim of the Holocaust? I don't think anyone will argue that it was less significant than the Columbine massacre. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">DB</a> (<a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbinder_633d.html" title="User talk:Dbinder">talk</a>) 20:17, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> First of all, remember <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, <i>please</i>. Calling the other side "crazy" in an AfD discussion will hardly aid us in the building of an encyclopedia.<br />
Furthermore, you group AfD&#160;!voters in a highly unfair way. I would certainly not defend the inclusion of non-notable high schools (in fact I'd do my best to get even my own deleted), and if I did, I would CERTAINLY not do so <i>to death</i>.<br />
That you use these pages is <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">not an argument</a>. Although I wish you all luck in your campaign to delete record albums, that is a matter ENTIRELY unrelated to this - a <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_wrongs_make_a_right.html" title="Two wrongs make a right">certain logical fallacy</a>, if you wish.<br />
Well, the rest of your comment hardly makes any sense, although your suggestions on other lists do seem quite justified an encyclopedic.

<li><b>Comment</b> - If we are deleting lists of destinations served by an airline, should we not also remove the same information from an article on an airport (for instance <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport_f762.html#Terminals.2C_airlines_and_destinations" title="John F.

<li>I agree with you whole-heartedly, Oden. The same information should indeed be removed from airline-related articles.

<li><b>Comment</b>: To be perfectly frank, I'm seeing a disparity here. While this is certainly useful information, it's also my opinion that it has become something that Wikipedia can't include. (Accordingly, my delete - above - still stands as a blanket.) But that said, given that there is a) precedent to have it exist due to interest, b) precedent demonstrated by other Wikis to take more narrow subject matter off of WP (see, for instance, Wikia), and c) plans to create a transit Wiki sitting on my desk at home, would there be interest in including such information within such a realm? --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 19:52, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I wasn't actually saying that it is a travel guide, I was commenting on the fact that PikDig wanted to keep it because it is useful for travellers, which is (per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a travel guide) an invalid reason to keep articles. I see it more as an indiscriminate list, lacking <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> indepoendent secondary sources discussing this (not just mentioning them) and lacking encyclopedic interest. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 12:55, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Indiscriminate in the sense that the list adds not enough value and the items linked have no relation with the list as such. What I mean is: a list like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_dd89.html" title="List of Presidents of the United States">List of Presidents of the United States</a> bundles a number of articles on the same subject (as does this one at first glance), and when you go to any of the items listed, you'll learn more about the subject <i>of the list</i>. For every entry in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_major_opera_composers.html" title="List of major opera composers">List of major opera composers</a>, if you click on it, you'll learn more about who he was <i>and why he was a majhor opera composer</i>. With the lists up for deletion now, when you click any entry, you'll find no info whatsoever about the subject of the list (airline destinations). Why is it a destination of this airline? What is the history of this connection? You'll get a link to the city or in the best cases to the airport, but that's it. <a href="../../../s/7/_/S7_destinations.html" title="S7 destinations">S7 destinations</a> flies to <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurghada_International_Airport_c152.html" title="Hurghada International Airport">Hurghada International Airport</a>, and there we learn that S7 is one of the airlines flying to Hugharda. This is indiscriminate, and is not encyclopedic. My main reason for deletion is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> though, as explained above. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:30, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I would certainly like to know in what way a list of destinations served by an airline adds little value to a study on the airline itself. What else is an airline supposed to do, then, besides transporting people and goods from point A to point B? You contend that articles in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_dd89.html" title="List of Presidents of the United States">List of Presidents of the United States</a> allows you to "learn more about the subject <i>of the list</i>". In what way does a list of continents, regions, countries, cities, and airports an airline flies to fail to allow you to learn more about the market reach and geographical extent of an airline's transport services? Clicking on any of the airports listed usually shows the same airline listed in the airport's airline list, and allows you to compare this airline's market share with its competitors to and from this destination. Do you not learn more about the competition this airline is facing in this particular market? So in what way is the above an "indiscriminate collection of information"? As for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, I find it ironic that others are also demanding for these articles to be removed because they represent "dublicated" information from relevant sources.

<dd>To reply to your last point first: the sources which give the information (from which it is duplicated) are primary sources , not secondary ones (the websites of the airline companies, to be precise). A good indication that this is not an encycloepdic list is that there are no sources given which give a historic overview of these destinations, only current lists (encycloepdic articles are supposed to be timeless, although of course new info can be added: but if we don't ahev any historcal info, how encycloepdic can it be?) As for your first point: I don't see how a list of what airlines come to what airport show the market these have (how often do they fly: what is the number of passengers? ...). And to clarify my comparison with other, useful lists again: when you click the link to any rpesident, you understand better what he did when he was president and so on. The subject of the list (presidents) is explained and clarified in every single listed subject. Teh subject of the list "XX destinations" is not clarified or expanded in the linked subjects though: I don't see why city YY or airport ZZ is a significant member of the list, beyond the fact (in the case of the airport) that, well, the list is correct. Big deal, this does not learn me anything. But let's agree that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> indiscriminate list is in this case perhaps too subjective, and let's focus on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>... 16:12, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I apologise if I could not quite catch what you are trying to say in the first few lines. Primary as well as secondary sources <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#Primary.2C_secondary.2C_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research">may be used in wikipedia</a>. Just because the former is said to require additional care dosent mean it results in a case of non-Verifiability and a violation of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. If so, we will have to remove tonnes of information in wikipedia, many of which are actually based on primary sources. We even had individuals who insist on removing all sources except official ones in airline articles. Encyclopedias do not neccesary reflect "historical value", and in fact, wikipedia is often lauded for being able to update itself and reflect contemporary information faster than traditional mediums. I thus find it strange why you suggest anything devoid of "past information" is less encyclopedic. If so, are articles like <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Airlines_destinations_caff.html" title="Singapore Airlines destinations">Singapore Airlines destinations</a> "more encyclopedic" because it lists and details terminated destinations? And talking about "historical value", I actually had my efforts to include service commencement dates in these lists removed by members of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Airlines_7d52.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Airlines">WikiProject Airlines</a>. Rather ironic, it seems. All the more so when you also asks why these lists do not include flight frequencies, number of passengers, etc. I once had such information deleted precisely for being a "discriminate collection of information" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Huaiwei/Cold_Storage/Singapore_Changi_Airport_passenger_traffic_by_airline" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Huaiwei/Cold_Storage/Singapore_Changi_Airport_passenger_traffic_by_airline" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Huaiwei/Cold_Storage/Singapore_Changi_Airport_passenger_traffic_by_destination" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Huaiwei/Cold_Storage/Singapore_Changi_Airport_passenger_traffic_by_destination" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. As for your presidential analogy, I beg to differ in opinion. So a click on a presidential's page tells you more about a particular president. Why should a click on an airport served by an airline not tell you more about that airport, and the airline serving it (as per the list of airlines and destinations I mentioned earlier)? Clicking on <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Heathrow_Airport_e5d1.html" title="London Heathrow Airport">London Heathrow Airport</a> after noting its "hub" status from <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Airways_destinations_e375.html" title="British Airways destinations">British Airways destinations</a>, realising the airport is a major airhub as "the busiest airport in the world, based on international passenger transfers", and then noticing the airline flies to plenty of destinations from this airport, and is up against an entire slew of international airlines, many of which fly on the same routes as British Airways, would normally form quite a marked impression on someone wanting to know the kind of environment the airline is operating in, and to better understand the challenges and corporate decisions it makes. I learn plenty just by clicking on one airport link in that destination list, even if you dont.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 17:00, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete all</b>, not encyclopaedic, and because this offers exactly the same information as the airlines, only with a greater-than-zero chance of it being out of date, downright useless. A lot of keep proponents in this discussion are making the mistake of using the "It's useful" defence, and "it's useful" is the reason why the <i>airlines</i> host this information. Why should an encyclopaedia? --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 14:40, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> From what I'm seeing, most of the people asking for these articles to be deleted are probably in no ways interested in the information anyway. There are many people who are interested, and just because you are not does not mean the articles should be deleted. One of the benefits of having such lists on Wikipedia is that they provide an organized listing for a good amount of airlines. One of the arguments by the Con side is that other websites, in this case airline websites, provide the same information. However this argument can easily be put towards a majority of the articles that are on Wikipedia, so I don't see why it can be used here unless the other articles are to be deleted for the same reason. In the case of airline destinations, most airline websites I've visited are very disorganized when it comes to having a list of their destinations, and unless you really know where to find the information beforehand it can be very irritating to find. Wikipedia is the answer to this trouble. And although it may not be quite up-to-date, it still gives a fairly accurate representation in an easy to use, easy to find place. <a href="../../../n/c/s/User%7ENcSchu_9fea.html" title="User:NcSchu">NcSchu</a> 14:59, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Normally when information is removed from an article to reduce the article's size, its notability is still based on the article it came from. While the goal is to keep each article notable, this will be easier to do with some. There is no issue with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> other then the amount of time needed to include references for each and every entry which is apparently what the delete voters are asking for. Just exactly what will be served by doubling the size of every one of these articles to provide these references? Exactly what value will they provide? Will anyone actually look at those references? If anything, trying to add those references would increase the workload so much that the lists would not be updated and become obsolete providing a reason to delete them. Also, main airlines do publish this information in their in flight magazines. Since these are closely watched by stock market analysts, any misinformation would be made know to the public so they can be considered accurate and reliable. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 20:11, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The articles are encyclopedic and verifiable. To fully understand how a given airline works and its function within society, business and aviation, it is nessesary to know where a given airline flies. Remember that Wikipedia not only includes encyclopedic information for Average Joe, but also for people with special interests within specific topics - this is one of Wikipedias greatest strengths. Some people want encyclopedic information on airports, airlines and aircraft, and so there is a lot of usefull information about this on Wikipedia, including information that some would consider excessive, because they are not looking for information detail at the same level as others. Personally the reason I started reading Wikipeida and later editing it, including articles related to many other topics than aviation, was because Wikipedia had a lot of detailed, still encyclopedic, information on airlines, including their destination, that I read simply because I found it interesting to read about (which maybe is the main purpose of Wikipedia). <a href="../../../a/r/s/User%7EArsenikk_9ef3.html" title="User:Arsenikk">Arsenikk</a> 15:53, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> These articles provide information about the airlines and their destinations is important to provide readers with more accurate and detailed information on the subject.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep All</b> The primary reasons for deletion have been: 1) Verifiability - primary is an airline and secondary, at minimum is OAG or the airport itself, so this is no longer a concern. 2) Frequency of change - airline destinantions really do not change that often, and people are watching and updating most of these articles regularly (the ability to update info is what makes Wikipedia valuable compared to a book!). 3) Information is on airline websites - while this info is available on an airline's website, it is often difficult for a lay person to determine as it is usually intermixed with their code-share destinations, whereas this list focusses entirely on those flown by the actually carrier itself. This leaves the question of encyclopedic value. The list has value as it relates to an understanding of the nature of the specific airline - where they fly is of core importance to understanding the business itself. What would be of greater value would be inclusion of service dates, but lack of this information should make it a candidate for improvement, not deletion. Ideally, the information should be included on the main airline page, but doing so would make the article too long. <a href="../../../a/p/h/User%7EAphenry_9310.html" title="User:Aphenry">Aphenry</a> 23:36, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b> per Aphenry. The destinations are an accessible record of an airline's involvement in the cities and airports it serves, just as railway lines. Part of understanding and researching the history of an airline is to know its specific area of service, and summarization in an article won't cut it. Deferring to an airline's website would not help anybody, especially if there's no English translation or is cluttered with codeshare/alliance info, and only adds a very inconvenient step for those who seek Wikipedia for the same information. Improvement of the lists should be the goal. It seems to have been the WikiProject's decision to not include more info about destination lists and make them more "encyclopedic", if that is a viable allegation. Here are some questions I have:
<ul>
<li>How exactly is this information supposed to be adapted for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitravel.html" title="Wikitravel">Wikitravel</a>, for those who suggest it belongs there? According to the English Wikitravel's <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Wikitravel:What_is_an_article%3F" class="external text" title="http://wikitravel.org/en/Wikitravel:What_is_an_article%3F" rel="nofollow">"What is an article?"</a> and <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Wikitravel_talk:What_is_an_article%3F" class="external text" title="http://wikitravel.org/en/Wikitravel_talk:What_is_an_article%3F" rel="nofollow">their talk page</a>, they seem to have little or no interest in having lists of airline destinations, much less articles about airlines or airports (or other transportation modes).</li>
<li>Would categories work (e.g. Category:American Airlines destinations) in which its contents would be airports? They would output exactly the same info as with the destination lists, but prohibit expansion of other info (e.g. inaugural service). Templates could also work, à la those used for radio and TV stations and companies.
<ul>
<li>Categories would present the same problem as putting the destination lists on the airline pages: they would be too long. An airport such as Frankfurt, Kennedy, or Heathrow would be overrun with categories. Keeping it as a separate list enables those who want the information to easily find it, while at the same time allowing those who don't want it to ignore it. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">DB</a> (<a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbinder_633d.html" title="User talk:Dbinder">talk</a>) 02:34, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, there are people who are dedicated to updating airline and airport destinations. Destinations are added and subtracted occassionally, but they are not changed often. (What financial or market-based purpose would changing <i>destinations</i> frequently have for a scheduled airline?) Flight frequencies and days of operation vary, however, and that probably causes the confusion.

<li><b>Strong keep of all the articles</b>. These are all very valuable supplementary articles to our airline articles. They are not intended to give timetable information (there are no departure times, arrival times or flight numbers listed in any of the lists), but to give readers an idea of where an airline flies and hence see where the airline has a comprehensive route network and where an airline does not fly. Information on an airlines destinations is <i>obviously</i> relevant to coverage of the carrier and is very useful to the reader. For example: By looking at the <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberia_destinations.html" title="Iberia destinations">Iberia destinations</a> we can see that Iberia has a comprehensive longhaul network to Latin America while there network to North America is less developed. OK, we could add a sentence which says that in the Iberia article, but for the reader, it is <i>much</i> more informative to have the entire list so that s/he can see for him/herself. As for notability, newspapers regularly write about airlines establishing and closing down routes so I think it easily meets <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> as well.

<dd>The problem is that all of these lists are entirely uncommented. Further down you say that the <i>List of Ryanair destinations</i> tells you that Ryanair tends to fly to secondary airports. Indeed, that's what they do, and it makes all sense to mention that in the article on the airline.

<li>Hello there people! Yes, I am still around. I am sad to notice, however, that during the 36 hours and counting my internet connection has been down, this AfD has been flooded with keep&#160;!votes. The only new argument to come up seems to be Vegaswikian claiming that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is not applicable has he HAS found - namely <a href="http://www.oag.com/NorthAmerica/AirlineAndAirport/RoutesFinder.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.oag.com/NorthAmerica/AirlineAndAirport/RoutesFinder.asp" rel="nofollow">OAG</a>.

<li>The precedent set by the AFD you cited was in fact to merge the list in with the airline per an agreement between me and the closing administrator. In that case I think merging was acceptable because the airline in question was such a small one with a fleet of six aiplanes. In addition, your citing of precedent on a single AFD, which many of the people in the Aviation projects missed, is just as spurious reasoning as the <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> votes you accuse people of making as you will see from reading the same essay. In fact, Huaiwei and Aphenry among others have provided strong arguments for why this is encyclopedic, not just ILIKEIT. Regarding your other arguments, the lists are <i>not</i> indiscriminate, they were made to provide information about an airline's business, and since flying people from X to Y is what an airline does as its main business it is natural that we provide information on where these X and Y are. We did not just make up a random trivial criterion, we made a criterion which is highly relevant to the coverage of the airline. The lists are not a directories either, a directory is something people use to look up a directory entry in. Nobody is going to use these lists to look up JFK International Airport. The lists are lists to illustrate an airline's business. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 15:18, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am confident that this debate will be closed appropriately. I'm actually quite surprised by the number of people who want to keep these pages, as we have a clear and long-standing policy that "Wikipedia is not a directory". This, for me, is the "killer policy breach". What is it about these articles that makes them anything other than a directory&#160;? That's what I can't see. My concern is that no-one who wants to keep these pages has answered this question. I'm quite prepared to accept that the contents of these articles is verifiable, but that's not enough. Several people have suggested that these articles contribute to an understanding of how an airline works: I don't see why - surely the underlying principles of airline management are broadly ( and with certain well-defined exceptions that can be documented in the appropriate articles ) independent of the exact locations serviced. Having just come to this debate today, the balance of reasoning seems to me to be fairly clear, but my worry is that there are several people who seem to have invested a lot in these articles at an emotional level; my hope is that this can be resolved with minimal discomfort for all.

<dd>They contribute to an understanding of how an airline works because an airline's purpose is to fly to destinations. I know to some people it may seem insignificant, however an important aspect of any company is knowing what it specializes in.

<dd>I don't see how <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brit_Air_destinations_fca9.html" title="Brit Air destinations">Brit Air destinations</a> gives more "understanding how the airline works" than a line in the main Brit Air article saying that "Brit Air has regular flights to many regional airports in France and Western Europe" (or a paragraph with the same contents), and a link to the airline website or wherever you get this info from. Similarly, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_destinations_2abc.html" title="American Airlines destinations">American Airlines destinations</a> can for this purpose be summarized as "American Airlines flies to xx destinations in the USA and yy major cities in all continents". The fact that it flies to Barajas International Airport in Madrid is not really relevant or informative for this purpose. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 21:16, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That American Airlines flies to Madrid is <i>not</i> irrelevant to our coverage of American Airlines. It shows that AA has a fairly extensive network in Europe since it sees a market in flying to Spain. Large US carriers such as United Airlines do not fly there, so from a person interested in aviation, the fact that AA flies to this city is quite relevant. Saying simply simply that they fly to 11 destinations in Europe says much less. Which 11 destinations? The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Airlines_destinations_29ba.html" title="Continental Airlines destinations">Continental Airlines destinations</a> article tells us that the airline has 27 European destinations, many of them fairly small cities such as <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cologne.html" title="Cologne">Cologne</a>, <a href="../../../o/s/l/Oslo.html" title="Oslo">Oslo</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast.html" title="Belfast">Belfast</a>. That tells us a lot about <i>their</i> business model, that they see good business in having many direct routes to Europe to smaller airports while some other carriers may rely on routes to larger hubs such as London or Paris. That several of Europe's main airports are missing from <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryanair_destinations.html" title="Ryanair destinations">Ryanair destinations</a> tells us a lot about their business model, how they try to avoid costly big airports and favor smaller regional airports in the interests of keeping costs and ticket prices low. Trying to summarize this into a paragraph as you suggest will be unhelpful to the reader. The author of such a paragraph is forced to make a decision of what is significant enough to fit into a small paragraph and that leads to a certain bias: what s/he determines as significant is not what someone else may determine as significant. Perhaps the author does not appreciate the significance of seeing that Northwest, Continental and USAirways fly to Gatwick rather than Heathrow in London, while United and American go to Heathrow, but from an aviation perspective, this may be quite significant. The reader is left to trust the author's bias and that is detrimental to his or her understanding of the business model of the airline. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:30, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for taking the time to explain your reasoning. I think we'll just have to agree to disagree on this. I think it is much better to explain the business model of the airline in text format, with some enlightening examples (and sourced of course, no OR), than to give a list of destinations and let the user make his own conclusions. While I agree on the difference between Ryanair and other carriers, I don't see a clear difference between the 5 American carriers you mentioned, and it certainly is not obvious (to me) from the list of destinations. But that's my opinion, not really a policy or guideline debate, and "I (don't) like it" or "it is (not) useful" are not really good arguments (not directed to anyone in particular, I use them as well). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 08:21, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An airline's purpose is certainly to fly to destinations, sure. And I can easily understand that there may be differences in the ways that a regional airline serving a large number of small-ish cities and an international airline serving only capital cities, say, may be managed; I'd expect us to cover this appropriately. I can also understand that certain routes ( London to New York, Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, say ) may be subject to special conditions; I'd expect us to cover this. But I don't see what is gained by giving a detailed list of exactly which airports are covered by exactly which airlines. What I'm trying to say is that I think we're right to cover general principles of route management and so on, but that we shouldn't go to the level of granularity you're advocating. I feel that our articles should aim to enlighten people about general principles - if you want to know how an airline works, we should be your first port of call - but if we follow your train of reasoning through I suspect we end up trying to understand how each airline works at a level of detail that, by focussing on the individual airports, tends to detract from an understanding of the more general principles of airline management. I do think that the point that you're making here makes sense, but I think that if we follow it through to its inevitable conclusion we end up being less instructive, by obscuring generalities with specifics. When we get down to the level of granularity you're advocating, I think we move out of the realm of encyclopedia and into the realm of specialist text. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 21:23, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Very Strong Keep</b> I don't understand why these articles have been flagged for deletion. I use them. I enjoy them. Lists in various forms are essential parts of enyclopaedias. The only thing I can think of is that a minority group wants to impose its will over another minority group in Wikipedia. I note that the initial person proposing the deletion of these articles regards himself first and foremost as an anarchist, and I then wonder if this proposal to mass delete is simply part of power struggle to show what a single anarchist can achieve. I note further that this deletion proponent has no particular interest in aviation, and wonder why he is concerned about this subject, when there are undoubtedly a lot of dubious articles in his areas of interest that could warrent further attention. Many people have spent thousands of hours working diligently to collect information that many other people use for a wide variety of purposes. Now a group of "aginers" wants to destroy this invaluable work. I find these lists of destinations at least as notable, and as valuable, as the discographies of countless singers and groups. The sheer number of these articles indicates that there is an interest in them, and the discussion here indicates that many feel a need for them, and that Wikipedia is the appropriate place for these needs to be met. My major concern is that if these pages are deleted it will be a signal to many active editors that their services are no longer appreciated at Wikipedia. They will go on and work on other projects on other websites, and Wikipedia will the looser. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECaviaPorcellus_749f.html" title="User:CaviaPorcellus">CaviaPorcellus</a> 22:22, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I would like to address the issue of these articles as directories as that seems to be a major premise in the case for deletion. They are presented as concisely as possible and without scheduling or routing (stopovers etc). Therefore they are not directories, they are supplementary reference articles. I reject the analogy airline destinations = directory, I would say these articles are more like reference tables. Under the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> there includes the caveat "Wikipedia also includes reference tables and tabular information for quick reference." An example of just such a quick reference is that Air Canada, for instance, flies to several routes in South America but none in Africa. This information is often unavailable or masked on airline websites because of their extensive alliances and codesharing. I argue that including all notable destination information in the body article would be unnecessarily long-winded. It has been well-established in this thread that the information is verifiable (see comment 20:36, 14 January) and that they are updated regularly (see comment 13:38, 17 January 2007; others have noted the possibility of adding a disclaimer). Nothing in the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> directly applies to these articles, including <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE</a>.

<p>All these pages provide information on Airline services information. Wikipedia is a place for information. This should be kept. It is also a very quick reference to find airline destinations. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreekboy_a57b.html" title="User:Greekboy">Greekboy</a> 04:15, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>VERY STRONG KEEP</b> I found this deletion page because I was looking for a reference for destinations to which <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mal%C3%A9v_Hungarian_Airlines_5cad.html" title="Malév Hungarian Airlines">Malév Hungarian Airlines</a> flies. Exactly the point of Wikipedia… to serve as a reference. To those who argue that the airline webpages are where you’ll find this information most accurately, that is incorrect, otherwise I would have gone there first. Many airlines will list destinations without actually flying there… instead their codeshare partners do. Case in point, looking at the <a href="http://www.malev.hu/" class="external text" title="http://www.malev.hu/" rel="nofollow">Malév Airlines</a> corporate page, one would be led to believe that Malév flies from Budapest to Cleveland. They don’t. To get to Cleveland on this airline one would have to take a Malév flight to New York's JFK Airport, and then transfer to an American Airlines flight to Cleveland. While you can’t determine this from the company webpage, you can determine from Wikipedia that Malév doesn’t serve Cleveland. In this case and many like it, Wikipedia’s information is clearly more informative and precise than the airline’s own site. Further, I learned far more about what Malév is as a company by looking at their destination list than what I learned from reading in the main article that “Malév flies to 59 cities in 35 countries.” That last bit of information doesn't tell me much. If I was looking for a travel guide the airline's webpage would suffice. As a traveler I want to go from point A to point B. I don't really care how I get there. As someone interested in both commercial aviation as well as foreign commerce, the destination list is extremely helpful. In addition to giving a clear depiction of the scope of the airline's operations, the destination list also provides an indication of the home country’s trade and commerce partnerships (Hungary in the case). In another example of this, the list of the 157 cities served by <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_destinations_2abc.html" title="American Airlines destinations">American Airlines</a> looks quite different from the list of 87 cities served by <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeroflot_destinations.html" title="Aeroflot destinations">Aeroflot</a>. It is also very useful in comparing the competitiveness of each airline in various markets. Simply put, a list depicting where they fly indicates to me in many ways who they are. The argument has also been made that these pages should be deleted because the Livingston Airline destinations page was deleted. Wikipedia clearly states that precedence is not a valid argument on whether or not to delete a page; perhaps we could forget that argument. The argument has further been made that airline destinations change too often to be listed, implying that updating them would prove burdensome. I used to work in the airline industry and can assure you their destinations do not change all that frequently, certainly not as often as tens of thousands of other ongoing topics that are covered by Wikipedia that change daily! These destination pages are references. They are good references. Please keep them. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENtk53s_64da.html" title="User:Ntk53s">Hebron</a> 05:52, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I haven't studies this example, but how do you know or think to know that this information is more reliable than the company's website? The article is completely unreferenced, so any info on it is uncheckable for now. I know that being currently unsourced is not a reason for deletion, but I wonder where you get the very strong certainty that this page is correct, when you didn't know what info you would get beforehand (if you did, you wouldn't need it as a reference).

Or we could start referencing the source for each change.

<li>No, the article doesn't find the European destination list notable. What the article does is state the thesis that Continental finds it profitable to fly to secondary airports in Europe and then lists those secondary airports that the company put on in the last few years. This is by no means the complete list of destinations in Europe. In contrast, the "List of Continental Airline destinations" is huge, uncommented and supports no thesis whatsoever. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 14:21, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have been arguing pretty strongly that these articles <i>do not</i> violate any policy. The lists are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> (sources are at the very least the airline's timetables, and if you must have something independent you can see OAG per DB's comment). Since the lists are plainly read off these sources without any form of interpretation or synthesis along the way the articles are not <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> either. Since the articles present bare facts and no value judgements, there is no violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Since the destinations of an airline, that <i>is</i> an airline's main business, are highly relevant to the airline's business, and since newspapers frequently write articles about comings and goings of an airline, and business journals frequently discuss an airline's route network, the lists are <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> and not indiscriminate. Saying that the argument for inclusion is based solely on <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> arguments is patently <i>false</i> and it is becoming very tiresome to to have to say this. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 14:40, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
