<p>This is, in essence, a random YouTube video which for some reason has its own article. Deprodded by an anon, this comes nowhere near being notable but has gained some popularity amongst internet forums. Some sweeping references have been made to it in a couple of magazines, but it's hardly been the subject of "multiple <b>non-trivial</b> published works" which WP:WEB requires. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteel359_41ed.html" title="User:Steel359">Steel</a> 21:30, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Steel. Frankly, any non-trivial work would probably be of greater significance than the subject here. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 22:03, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> The article in questionf features information on a popular flash animation that has been featured on multiple pages, YouTube NOT being the main focus or its original intention. In fact, this isn't a YouTube video at all like every other user has attempted to make idle claims to. Misrepresenting this article in order to have it deleted shows poorly on those working against it. Researching and investigating the topic in question before openly calling for deletion is the first step in creating a fair and well-maintained "Free Encylopedia." The article focuses on several points of note, including the satirical nature of the flash animation which is based on the popular Metal Gear Solid. If anything, the article should be revised to include more potentially useful information to anyone creating their own satire of popular video game fiction. With the publication in two widely circulated magazines (with links included), this video has already generated a good deal of non-internet related publicity for itself that is anything but "trivial" <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECiroryder_7623.html" title="User:Ciroryder">Chad Schaeffer</a> 23:35, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not entirely sure what point you were trying to make with that rant, but I ran a Google search <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Metal+Gear+Solid+3%22+%22Crab+battle%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Metal+Gear+Solid+3%22+%22Crab+battle%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and out of the 700 or so results, the top ones (and probably the rest) were all to flash hosting sites. I don't see any evidence of it being the subject of a non-trivial work. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteel359_41ed.html" title="User:Steel359">Steel</a> 10:17, 15 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm just glad you actually investigated Crab Battle a bit more. A popular flash video that is known through-out the Metal Gear Solid community. With this being a popular satire, could it merely be suggested that this article be linked to as a satire or fan-fiction creations of Metal Gear Solid? And my rant was long and all over the place, but I do believe I touched on all of the neglected points of note for this article. I'd also like to note, that the article was not originally created by the person who created Crab Battle, thus indicating some desire to inform people about this satirical work of flash fiction. Further review of your own Google Search will also yield links to various forums, fan-created sites, etc. Also, how does this not fall in line with Wikipedia hosting a site about YTMND <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YTMND" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YTMND" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, a site dedicated to "trivial" work. -- <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECiroryder_7623.html" title="User:Ciroryder">Chad Schaeffer</a> 11:17, 15 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then document it on a MGS wiki. This is a general encyclopaedia, for documenting things which are verifiably significant to the wider world. Tangential content regarded as "kewl" by groups of fans of particular video game does not in most cases qualify as having encyclopadic merit. And this is not "elitist", Steel is an active editor on CVG topics, and was made a sysop even though most of his edits are to CVG topics. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 09:09, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> I took a look at those "references" and like Steel said, they are trivial! Its not the publicity that needs to be non-trivial (Chad Schaeffer says publicity is non-trivial which is not important), its the references that need to be non-trivial which means that an external source needs to devote significant text on explaining the subject. In all the references I looked it was only mentioned in passing, as a "cool thing to see". Nothing more. Also, this AFD is not about <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMNDs</a>. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinhan_d563.html" title="User:Shinhan">Shinhan</a> 19:13, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm amused that no one has commented on my plea to at least link or rework this article in some way. The desire to delete it with no desire to attempt to re-work it or incorporate into the other multitude of gaming related articles on Wiki seems correlate that the attacks against the article have been merely elitist in nature. -- <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECiroryder_7623.html" title="User:Ciroryder">Chad Schaeffer</a> 20:17, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wow all this over a simple internet flash animation. I did my own Google search and here it it.

I dont see why anyone wont add this to a MSG(Metal Gear Solid) wiki page. This is a good thing becuase I use wikipedia for alot of things and i think you should keep this. That is all. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.204.238.103 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.204.238.103_b2a0.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.204.238.103">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> You should do more precise searches. You pull up such things as the <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_ic/episode/0,1976,FOOD_9970_15886,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_ic/episode/0,1976,FOOD_9970_15886,00.html" rel="nofollow">Iron Chef Crab Battle</a>; <a href="http://www.cloudster.com/Sets&amp;Vehicles/ShadowCrab/ShadowCrabTop.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cloudster.com/Sets&amp;Vehicles/ShadowCrab/ShadowCrabTop.htm" rel="nofollow">Shadow Battle Crab from Babylon 5</a> ... Always put quotation marks around the name and you should always exclude wikipedia from the search by putting a " -wikipedia" (space, minus sign, no space, wikipedia.) With a generic phrase like "Crab Battle" you need to include a second keyword to get a proper representation of the google results. Adding "metal gear" (w/quotes) does this. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22crab+battle%22+-wikipedia++%22metal+gear%22+&amp;num=30&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;start=270&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22crab+battle%22+-wikipedia++%22metal+gear%22+&amp;num=30&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;start=270&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">example</a>. Finally, we want to look at how many of the pages google chopped out because they were duplicated.. go to the last page in the google search. It will give the message "we have omitted some entries very similar to the 206 already displayed." So ~230 unique results out of about 26,900 (or less than 1%) are unique. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 05:58, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. To quote the guidelines <i>Content that is distributed by independent online sites will almost certainly satisfy the first criterion.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Then if you say that YTMD movies have no place on Wikipedia then why have a YTMND page on Wikipedia? Its a page dedicated to trival movies and things of that nature. So why is it still around? I believe that the Crab Battle page should be linked into the MSG: 3 page and call it a day. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Viningi (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Viningi_9e1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Viningi">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>We're not discussing the ytmnd article. We're discussing <i>this</i> article. If you don't think ytmnd deserves a page, put it up for AfD, because discussions about it here are irrelevant. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteel359_41ed.html" title="User:Steel359">Steel</a> 18:06, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Please listen to my orignal comment. I did not say "all YTMND's don't deserve their own article" or "YTMND doesn't deserve its own article." I said, every YTMND on YTMND(or flash movie on Newgrounds) doesn't need it's own article, <b>unless</b> it has gotten some outside attention. As far as I can tell, MGS3: Crab Battle has only been popular on Newgrounds. The article makes the assertion that it has been viewed over a million times and yet google searches only get <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;num=100&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=%22MGS+3%3A+Crab+Battle%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;num=100&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=%22MGS+3%3A+Crab+Battle%22" rel="nofollow">479</a> hits. I think if this flash movie was that big of a phonomena it would garner more hits than that. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> <sub><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitaphane_f38a.html" title="User talk:Mitaphane">talk</a></sub> 22:18, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
