<p>I could be wrong and I don't know much about the subject, but isn't this list a little useless? A list of lesbian/bisexual/etc. <b>characters</b> on television could be useful (and I believe we have such a list somewhere here), but a list of <b>actors</b> who played LBG, etc. characters seems incredibly pointless and very much a batch of loosely-connected information, which Wikipedia is not (i.e. one can imagine a similar "List of people who have played politicians, Irish Catholics, Jews, priests, nuns, etc....) . <b>Delete</b> per nom <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 23:42, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't think it is useless. In fact, I think is good. If I came across this article was just because I was interested on it. As a gay man, I like that this page exists for the fact that we are normally interesed in actor who we have seen on movies on a GLB role. Hope this isn't deleted.--Nauki 00:03, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But then you have Hamlet fans looking for List of people how have played Hamlet, and Einstein fans looking for List of people who have played Einstein, and so on and so forth. I can totally see where you are coming from, as I too tend to be fans of actors that previously had roles that I enjoyed, but I don't think this is the place to store that information. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 01:55, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>weak keep</b>. I'm normally not at all listicrufts, but I do see a diffrnce with this one. Firstly, there do not appear to be any categories for LGB actors/actresses, and as there are some heteros who have played homo roles, this list does seem to have a place.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> After a period of intense thought, I think that there's no reason not to keep this list. As for the nominator's other examples of lists he believes Wikipedia is not the place for (actors who have played politicians, Irish Catholics, etc.), I say again: why not? While this list might only be seldom used, that, in itself, is no reason to delete it. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENigelquinine_e86b.html" title="User:Nigelquinine"><font color="green"><u><i><b>NigelQuinine</b></i></u></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENigelquinine_44ea.html" title="User talk:Nigelquinine"><font color="blue"><b>Blather</b></font></a>• <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nigelquinine_2ca3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nigelquinine"><font color="blue"><b>Toil</b></font></a></sup> 02:39, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you saying that "List of actors who have played nuns" is encyclopedic? Really? You could have a million "list of actors who have played X". From policemen to nannies to mothers to celebrities. "Fictional policemen, nannies, nuns, etc." and "Real policemen, nannies, etc." are encyclopedic. Combining the two in this manner really has no value <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 04:17, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wikipedia is known as a very GLB-friendly website, a resource for people of GLB. We must keep this fact in mind. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a>Allon Fambrizzi
<ul>
<li>Not really. Wikipedia is very encyclopedia-friendly, so to speak. There's encyclopedic content and un-encyclopedic content. While, of course, a list of GLB <b>characters</b> would be encyclopedic, and more or less so would a list of GLB <b>actors</b>, a list of actors who have played GLB has almost no value at all. In fact, a list of GLB characters would logically mention who the actor was who played the character, leaving this list with no purpose at all <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 04:17, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I knew we had a list of GLB (or LGB?) characters in film, etc. That list seems to have encyclopedic value.
