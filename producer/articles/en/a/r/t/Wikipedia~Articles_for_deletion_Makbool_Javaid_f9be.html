<li><b>Strong Delete</b> under <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Checked this on Factiva and this lawyer was falsely accused of having terrorist links in the tabloid <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_Mirror_524a.html" title="Sunday Mirror">Sunday Mirror</a> in 1998. This generated a couple of articles in The Lawyer, a legal industry journal, in which the Javaid denied these allegations. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a> followed up with an article explaining Javaid's defense of himself with the editorial note:"Editorial note: We accept Makbool Javaid's assurances that he does not support and has never had any contact with Osama bin Laden, and that he has never supported or been involved in any terrorist activity of any kind." <u>Couldn't find any other hits beyond these four on this story</u>. It seems that Javaid acted as a civil liberties legal observer of a fundamentalist group which may have subsequently exaggerated their relationship with him for their own credibility. Javaid's position in the race relations forum (which he was given in spite of the "scandal") is not especially notable - there are ~28 other members, and it doesnt seem to be a particularly important government body - it meets every few months to offer advice to the Home Secretary and that seems to be it. I would argue that there is no <i>ex officio</i> encyclopedic notability from being Head of Legal at the Commission for Racial Equality - this is not a particularly high bureaucratic position. Recommend deletion under <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, to avoid causing Javaid unnecessary embarrassment over a false accusation that caused a minor splash 8+ years ago. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:22, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Makbool Javaid is a prominent lawyer and an active islamist campaigner, who was a founder of the well known radical islamist group, Al Muhajiroun. He signed a fatwa calling for "the Muslims around the world, including the Muslims in the USA and in Britain, to confront by all means whether verbally, financially, politically or militarily the US and British aggression and to do their Islamic duty in relieving the Iraqi people from the unjust sanctions".</p>
<p>These are matters of public interest, and Makbool Javaid is an important lawyer and islamist political activist. This page should stay.</p>
<p>Al Muhajiroun are admirers of Osama Bin Laden. However, to suggest that he is or was a "supporter" is implicit in his association with that group, and is not of central relevance.</p>
<p>Al Muhajiroun members have been invoved in terrorism. However, Al Muhajiroun is not a terrorist organisation. It is wrong to suggest that a member of Al Muhajiroun is necessarily a supporter of terrorism. What we say about Makbool Javaid's political and religious beliefs should be limited to what is verifiable about him. <i>User:Bukhari please sign your posts</i></p>
<ul>
<li><u><b>Strong delete</b></u> Bukhari, Please sign your posts. Mr Javaid was not a founder of the group, and was not a member. This article could be considered libel, and as stated before he agreed an <a href="../../../o/u/t/Out_of_court_settlement.html" title="Out of court settlement">out of court settlement</a> in his libel case against the british, mainly <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabloid.html" title="Tabloid">tabloid</a>, newspapers. He seems to be a victim of <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sensationalism.html" title="Sensationalism">sensationalism</a>, and a desire to attack government quango's by proxy, because he was linked to one. A google group chat forum is not a credible reference as to who signed what over 5 years ago, so there currently is not credible referenced claim that he signed that fatwa. It seems that Al-Muhajiroun got a bit over-zealos in exagerating their link to him, possibly even falsifying their link for their own ends. <a href="../../../a/a/l/User%7EAaliyah_Stevens_b9e9.html" title="User:Aaliyah Stevens">Aaliyah Stevens</a> 12:12, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><s><b>Strong Delete.</b></s> (you have already said delete above.--- <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">ALM</a> 13:02, 18 January 2007 (UTC)) The so called fatwa signed by this man, is from an unsigned, and unauthenticated message posted by an individual named Gerhard Lange from Germany, in a google chat group. This is not in any way credible evidence according to wikipedia standards of reference, so if you take this acccusation out, and the false accusation that he was a member of al-muhajiroun, this man is a nobody, not a notable. <a href="../../../a/a/l/User%7EAaliyah_Stevens_b9e9.html" title="User:Aaliyah Stevens">Aaliyah Stevens</a> 19:17, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
