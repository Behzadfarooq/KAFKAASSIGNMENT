<li>I'm not going to vote because I'm obviously conflicted as the author but I think this is a litle heavy-handed in the circumstances. I don't know whether to finish writing the article. I have offered to have a dialog with Yuber but have not got a response. This article may cover some of the same ground as Islamofascism, but I assume much of that debate is whether it's a legitimate word or not. No such issue arises here. As for bypassing a vote, that is absolutely not my plan, I'll respect whatever is decided, I just wonder how a judgement can be formed 1) before the article is really seriously started, 2) without discussing it with me at all and 3) based on suspicions and enmities which have nothing to do with me. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalkingeagles_8a85.html" title="User:Walkingeagles">Walkingeagles</a> 07:30, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>the point is NOT whether it is finished or not! The Vfd rules DON'T CARE!!!</b>. OK? Got that? Sorry, but please understand.

<li>However, the real question is what are you presenting in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_fascism.html" title="Islamic fascism">Islamic fascism</a>, and how is it different from <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>? Please, if you can, explain to us how what you have presented is different from the existing page. If they are the same, then you should make your contributions to the other page, and this will become a redirect. If not, tell us why, and we may vote to keep it and let you finish your work. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 07:48, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Before the VFD posting, I had redirected the article to List of political epithets.

I decided not to press the issue because the <a href="../../../w/a/l/User_talk%7EWalkingeagles_6a08.html" title="User talk:Walkingeagles">user is a newbie</a>. Unfortunately, <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">User:Klonimus</a> has already attempted to recruit this user as a soldier in the edit war on the main <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> article.

<li>nonono, how are those two articles different? Aren't they pseudonyms? If not then the article is very very valid, if not then it should be a redirect. Do you understand? I hope so.

<li>My understanding of what he is trying to do, is thay <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_fascism.html" title="Islamic fascism">Islamic fascism</a> is about Islamic Fascist's, I.e muslim units fighting for the Axis, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Mufti_611d.html" title="Grand Mufti">Grand Mufti</a> and friends etc. <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> is about post 9/11 use of that term to describe totalitiarian islamism.

Al Qaeda don't identify as fascists and they don't pursue anything like a fascist ideology.

<li>As I'm not voting, I'll take some liberty and comment on the above if that's OK. This is a sensitive area. Anything to do with religion, the Middle East etc. generally is. But my conern is the vitriolic approach of a few people who've commented above. I don't mind which way the vote goes, although I think it will end up being a good article incorporating many different perspectives and bringing together much information. But look at some of the words used above and ask whether insults and attacks actually achieve anything.</li>

<p>"fuckhead" "bollocks" "editors who are so intent on pushing this anti-Muslim bollocks" "childish" "soapbox for anti-Islamic propagandists" "WRITING IN CAPS" and <b>IN BOLD</b>, in asking and re-asking answered questions...</p>
<p>It seems to me that language like this will - whether intended to or not - exclude people who either don't like profanity or aren't as aggressive. I know I don't appreciate it, I may have asked for it by being bold enough to write an article on such a topic but I think anyone familiar with dispute resolution knows that screaming (or its virtual equiv.) and profanity and aggressive language generally only inflames disputes beyond what they originally were. Because of that, I believe comments of the kind I've listed are really unhelpful and unproductive. Just my opinion but I hope someone listens. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalkingeagles_8a85.html" title="User:Walkingeagles">Walkingeagles</a> 17:46, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I've just removed a section that's clearly inappropriate (consisting of claims about what U.S. white supremacists think of Islamic groups, and a long quotation from a journalist about one person who's Muslim and a fascist), together with a couple of other unsubstantiated claims. I've also reordered the text to flow more smoothly, and corrected a number of internal links. If the article could stay like this, or develop along these lines (though it's difficult to know what else there is to be said), it would at least be NPoV; I could even bring myself to vote for its retention. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 09:19, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was kinda attached to the CNN reference because it was Sat night's show that got me thinking about the topic but you make a good argument and others have made too about it being separate so am persuaded to agree. The issue of Aryan nation lusting after al Qaeda might deserve another article although I can promise this much, it won't be me writing it!

Hence the need for an article on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Fascism_ff36.html" title="Islamic Fascism">Islamic Fascism</a>.</p>
<p>I urge people to think about the encyclopedic nature of the topic of historical and current Islamist alliences with fascists. I the '<b>article in its current form needs serious work to address this issue</b>, but that does not detract from its encyclopedic character and worthyness of inclusion in a great encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 05:38, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Great job <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a>. Does anybody else agree about the definitions? <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalkingeagles_8a85.html" title="User:Walkingeagles">Walkingeagles</a>, do you agree or disagree about that? I would agree about the definition given to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_fascism.html" title="Islamic fascism">Islamic fascism</a> though I remember the picture of the Grand Mufti shinning on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> instead. Do we remember that <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a>?</li>

<dl>
<dd>I totally disagree about the one defining <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>. Does it mean that every totalitarian regime or doctrine would be considered fascist? Does it imply that the Soviet Union under Stalin would have been called Fascist Soviet Union??!</dd>
<dd>Whatever the answer is, why not than have the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> article renamed Totalitarian Islam instead? It is really confusing!</dd>
<dd>After all, from where have we got the definitions? --<a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">Svest</a> 00:06, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I would support renaming this article Totalitarian Islam or perhaps Totalitarianism in Islam would be a more neutral name. I just really <b>really</b> think that the word fascism and its deratives have been made so ambiguous through constant misuse that they are not at all encyclopedic unless the article is about the term. As this article is not about the term and is not really about fascism but rather several flavors of Totalitarianism some of which might contain some aspects which may relate to fascism. In any event a name change would increase its chances of surviving this VfD (I think). <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 07:05, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it's quite confusing, Dalf. You voted delete on Americofascism. You haven't suggested to redirect it or rename it to American Fascism or something else as you are preaching for this article. If we follow your reasoning above talking about the misuse of the term fascism, we would assume that we will be ending having 100 plus articles of Islam. What would be a difference between Islamofascism and Totalitarian Islam? IMHO, this article is just a mirror of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>. Why not merge them? Or do you agree about the classification of klominus?

<dd><sup>You could be right. The truth is I think all of these articles are problematic. I voted delete on Americofascism because I did/do not think it is a real term. That and it was an obvious <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation. Also note that I voted delete here as well ... I am just sort of thinking out loud down here in the comments. As to the confusion you mention, redirecting any article to a title with the word fascism is IMHO a bad idea. Other the word inflames emotions, and even when used correctly it is ambiguous because of the cultural and vernacular history associated with it. My comments here about moving things should be seen as saying "if there is appropriate content for any of these article I think a better title can be chosen". That goes for articles about criticism of or reactions to American foreign policy as well. All in all I still stand my my original statement that I made in my vote <b>*SIGH*</b> <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 09:16, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</sup>

<ul>
<li><sup>I see an agreement with what you explained. I think, if someone wants to denote a fascist, he should simply use "fascist" and then if needed stipulate the religion or the nationality. The vast majority of Muslims are not fascists. Any religion, creed or philosophy can be perverted and twisted to meet extreme aims. Therefore, the term Islamic Fascism can be used as Italian Fascism, Spanish Fascism, American Facsisms, etc... As replied to Klonimus about his ignorant and personal definitions, I disagree totally about the term Islamofascism. The term 'Islamofascism' will need a book length theorisation by somebody who knows the subject inside out before it can be used in serious political discourse, rather than knockabout polemic.</sup></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><sup>For instance, Klonimus wants to reserve it for a specific strand of Wahabbism. Yet the parallel between reactionary Islam and fascism is to my mind best illustrated by the Iranian revolution. Those events met many of the classical criteria that differentiate fascism proper from other types of authoritarianism, such as military dictatorship or peronism. It was - and still is - a regime of crisis, built on the mass mobilisation of the middle class to crush an insurgent workers' movement. Yet it is, of course, 100% shiite.</sup></dd>
<dd><sup>But even though I'm picking Klonimus up on this point, I'm not claiming deep enough knowledge to pontificate with authority. Until a useful definition can be established - assuming that it can be - the term should be used with utmost care. Especially by jobbing hacks who lack any expert perspective.

<dd>LOL, no, I distinctly remember this article being deleted. Check the edit history, there were no edits for 4 days. Is it possible that there was some furtive action to reinstate this article after deletion? Perhaps someone had relocated it to a subpage and then moved it here after it was deleted.

<dd>That may be right. I think that people are still busy with the other one; the <i>one by one</i> rule, I suppose. One of the reasons that there has been no edit for 4 days might be that this article is being forgotten on the basis that it is being clear that this one is just a <i>mirror</i> for <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>.
