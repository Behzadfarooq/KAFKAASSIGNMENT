<li><i><b>Strongly oppose</b></i> - Some of the edits that have taken place in the short time since this entry was added seem to have been done in the first instance by the owner of the site in question, then by others to counter what he is adding. I'm sure it isn't the first wikipedia article that started life under a cloud of controversy, but it is a controversial subject.</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, I'm quite new to the rules for Wikipedia entries, so please bear with me if I make any incorrect assumptions.</p>
<p>I feel the article is needed on Wikipedia, but perhaps under a different heading. I'll try and explain.</p>
<p>Mr Duncan Oldham is becoming quite a personality in his own right. He's certainly done enough over the years to be allowed an entry on Wikipedia (in my view). A carefully-written article on all of these sometimes newsworthy items would be worth adding to the encyclopedia. Unfortunately for Wikipedia, many of Mr Oldham's activities are controversial. However surely as long as they are all cited there should be no problem in them being included, whether positive or negative. In positive terms, Mr Oldham has claimed to carry out a lot of work for charity for example, some newspaper articles could perhaps be added by him to prove this. He's also claimed to be the instigator / creator of the first UK Liverpool FC newsgroup. His Koptalk site is effectively a more up-to-date use of technology. Although Mr Oldham isn't a famous personality as such, he's certainly infamous amongst supporters of Liverpool Football Club and with his involvement in websites promoting other soccer teams and also football in general (I can list these if required) then it's safe to say his infamy may also have spread within those communities.</p>
<p>He's known for a lot of things both good and bad. For example he once changed his name to "Mr Manchester United" by deed poll, something which made the national newspapers of the time if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p>On the controversial side there is (citable) evidence that Mr Oldham has engaged in a long line of dubious activities. The blog mentioned has got a lot of the evidence included, but there is also evidence to be found on the Way-back Machine (archive.org).</p>
<p>Mr Oldham is Koptalk essentially - his "team" seems to consist of his family members, and as such perhaps a seperate Koptalk entry is overkill and merely a redirect would be needed.</p>
<p>There's no need to "spam" with links to other sites, but it did prove a point that other websites are more popular (or they were at the time I compared them after seeing them listed in the article).</p>
<p>So when I say "strongly oppose" I feel that rather than a deletion a rename and slight rewrite would be more in order.</p>
<p>If the Wikipedia policy is to remove entries on people who are controversial then yes, remove the entry, but I am sure that's not the case. It's certainly an interesting article to have in the enyclopedia, but careful monitoring is needed to ensure it is neutral with all claims cited. --Whatthef 15:00, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> From what I've seen, it's not a notable website, and the article should be deleted.

It does sound like it was trivial coverage, rather than anything substantial, but it may not be. I'd tend towards deleting the article, but I'd like to see what this coverage is. Also, it's a shame that the article is being used both to air grievances, rather than just report on criticism, and to promote the owner's own website by blanking the criticism, and manipulating the external links. Hopefully this AfD will manage to keep to the topic of whether or not the website is notable or not. <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithD_2f0d.html" title="User:KeithD">KeithD</a> 15:01, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I do not believe that Wikipedia should eradicate reference to Koptalk - I think it is an interesting case of how a single individual using the net can exploit a respected institution like LFC and exploit its world wide followers. But to give a full picture Wikepeida should not lend credence to Koptalk's false claims and it should link to the sites of others especially koptalk-insider which is a dedicated not-for-profit site set up to expose Koptalk.</p>
<p>The testimonial to Koptalk from major newspapers - The Independent, for example - was given many years ago when Koptalk was, indeed, one of the most populated LFC sites simply because they were early days of the net and there were very few about. Oldham had engineered the takeover of Koptalk from the original creator. Most of that generation of members left Koptalk to open new sites. Mainly they disliked that Koptalk had been converted from a discussion site about LFC into a site about the owner, Duncan Oldham, his unsual sexual interests and and his various money making schemes, most of which had nothing to do with LFC. One of those schemes was a pyramid sales scheme in which he offered readers the opportunity of making quick money with very little effort by setting up sites like his own or by selling the scheme to others who would sell it to others and so on. Another was his attempt to circumvent securities law by selling shares in Koptalk to members. He was obliged to pay back the money. Oldham's response to this exodus of members was to buy up the domain names similar to thsoe of his rivals, and similar even to the LFC offical site, and redirect the traffic to his own site. His active editing of Wikipedia to support his false claim to be the No 1 site and to elminate references to other LFC fan sites is in this tradtion - including his attempt to crush the latest site set up by genuine fans who are upset by what they consider to be his exploitation of LFC and LFC supporters. <a href="http://www.koptalk-insider.com" class="external free" title="http://www.koptalk-insider.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.koptalk-insider.com</a> Actually he just bought that domain two days ago to redirect its traffic to his site.</p>
<p>His claim that various LFC footballers write for his site is false. In those early days - 5-7 years ago - he did contract to buy the rights to reproduce some syndicated articles by Tommy Smith and Ian St. John and the Liverpool writer Paul Tomkins - but he never paid them and they forbade him using their name.</p>
<p>Duncan Oldham claimed last week that he has taken 5 pounds advance payments from LFC supporters for 20,000 copíes of his proposed book "Anfield Exposed". The book is now in its third year of missed launches and he announced last week that it is now postponed until May of 2007. There is no such book. However the rpospeod title is typical of his exploitative attitude to the club he purports to support.</p>
<p>Oldham uses his site to collect for various causes and charities. The beneficiares of some of these charities are members of his family. Whatever the charity or cause he insists that donations are made out to him personally or his mother. He does not register any of them. He never produces accounts.</p>
<p>Koptalk claims to have connection to the players, directors and management of LFC. All these claims are false. Many of his "informers" are in fact aliases of Duncan Oldham He uses these "stories" to drum up paid membership in his Insider and Gold Club. Many of his members are people from Asia, Australia and the Americas who are not in a position to understand how his claims lack feasibility. They believe Koptalk is a Liverpool based site run by LFC fans. In fact it is run from Newcastle by Oldham alone with some help from his mother and a 17 yr old step brother. Oldham has a season ticket for Newcastle United, rarely if ever attends LFC games, and is in the process of starting similar sites for Newcasle, Spurs and Forest supporters.</p>
<p>He repeatedly claims he does not pay his two relatives who work for him. There are many obvious inconsistencies between his claims to make hundreds of thousands of pounds a year, to buy 40,000 sterling mercedes and other vehicle, expensive video equipment and various properties (his latest target being a 300,000 property near the LFC training ground) and his claims to be poor, doing it as a hobby and unable to pay his relatives.</p>
<p>Many observors believe these inconsistences suggest his attempt to duck and weave to avoid investigation of various frauds including fraud of the public exchequer. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 201.139.76.91 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_201.139.76.91_e3c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/201.139.76.91">contribs</a>).</small> I cannot put in the symbols you ask for - my user name is rupert <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 201.139.76.91 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_201.139.76.91_e3c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/201.139.76.91">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>In the article you say that Koptalk was founded by Duncan Oldham. In fact it was founded by Colin Seaman. He gave a share of it to Duncan Oldham. Apparently the Oldham takeover became complete. However, Colin Seaman's claim to co-ownership can be found on his own site at: <a href="http://www.dbcreate.com/dbcreate/content/team.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.dbcreate.com/dbcreate/content/team.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dbcreate.com/dbcreate/content/team.htm</a></p>
<p>The following is a partial list of the sites squatted on by Duncan Oldham. This is not a contentious list he admits to it on his site. He admits that he has sat on these sites and pointed some of them to his own site to punish rival sites. Most of these sites have names similar to the names of rival sites. This list is taken from Koptalk-Insider which monitors his activities. The poster is "whois look up" _________________ Here are eight current squats - all three fanzines and 5 other main LFC sites. There’s probably more. Notice the dates and you’ll see all have been renewed at least once and he’s had some since 2001. A couple were pointed to his site until this information appeared on June 15th in another thread on this blog:</p>

Most of the above is very interesting but doesn't directly relate to whether this article has met the requirements to prevent its deletion.
