<li>I think that routine information on schools should be included on the page of the relevant town or county or whatever. I am fine with redirects as appropriate. If those pages get too large as a result, the information could be transferred to a page on the school district or whatever administrative unit is used by a particular country. If individual schools are particularly significant (as opposed to just having long-winded entries) then that school can have its own page. This allows the information to be kept and the proliferation of small, often poor quality articles to be kept in check. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 01:37, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)

<li>He said "if someone wants to write an article about their high school, we should relax and accomodate them, even if we wish they wouldn't do it."

<li>You are putting words into his mouth. You know the old saying "Even Satan may cite scripture to suit his purposes." You're taking a quote out of its original context, made in references to a <i>completely different situation</i>, and stating that somehow it applies here. Very unwiki of you. Again, please <b>stop</b> such activity. It's not fair on Jimbo, and it's not fair on the opposition. As for any chance of reaching consensus, you don't seem to be intent on giving an inch, so any claim that it is required for reaching consensus is entirely hypocritical. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk back</a></small> 03:18, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm giving a lot of "inches".

<li>Wikipedia is not a general knowledge base, that is, it is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information.

<li>Just that regardless of your opinion on the article you should do more research before accusing fellow wikipedians of acting in bad faith; though I assume you are smart enough to realize that and are just egging me on a bit, because that is a more positive thought than the alternative. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 06:35, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually I'd just like you to explain how you arrived at the conclusion that a coherent arrangement of information on a single mundane topic is nonsense - or as you so nicely put it, an "indisciminate collection of items of information". I see no nonsense here, and hence no reason for deletion. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 07:06, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You have misread the quote. The phrase "indiscriminate collection of items of information (which is taken straight from the policy page and is not how I put it) refers to wikipedia and not to an individual article therein. Whether you agree that including this article violates said policy or not is immaterial to whether this is a valid VfD. There is a difference of opinion about what information belongs in the encyclopedia and what information would turn it into an indiscriminate collection of items of information (something quite different from nonsense; I am intrigued at how you pulled that definition out of those words), which is why we have these discussions and votes, but this nomination is perfectly in-line with policy. Your view that only vanity, original research, and nonsense should be deleted is actually a narrower view than the deletion policy itself puts forth. You are entitled to have that opinion and vote based on that opinion, but you are not entitled to accuse users of nominating articles contrary to the actual deletion policy when they have not done so. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 07:18, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As you are well aware, the Wikipedia default position on all articles and the information contained therein is <i>retention</i> - unless - and <i>only</i> unless - there are compelling reasons for deletion. This is the clear and unambiguous intent and spirit of the deletion policy as it currently stands. Nonsense, vanity and original research are the only stated compelling reasons to delete content from Wikipedia under that policy. This nomination fails that basic test, and is therefore invalid. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 23:47, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Have you even read the deletion policy? The following reasons are unambiguously given for listing an article on VfD: "No potential to become encyclopedic (see WP:NOT), Original research, Inappropriate user pages in excessive or stubborn cases, Vanity page, Advertising or other spam, Completely idiosyncratic non-topic." Notice that WP:NOT is unambiguously tied to the deletion policy as the place to go for a definition of no potential to become encyclopedic. If one were to bother to read that page, one would see the following categories unambiguously stated: "Wikipedia is not a dictionary, Wikipedia is not a soapbox, Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files, Wikipedia is not a free host or webspace provider, Wikipedia is not a general knowledge base, Wikipedia is not a crystal ball." Wikipedia is not a general knowledge base is further defined as follows on the same page: "Wikipedia is not a general knowledge base, that is, it is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia. While there is a continuing debate about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries, current consensus is that Wikipedia articles are not: Lists of Frequently Asked Questions, Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics, Travel guides, Memorials, News reports, Genealogical entries, or phonebook entries, Directories, directory entries, or a resource for conducting business."</li>
<li>I have directly cut and pasted this information from the appropriate pages which expound the official deletion policy of wikipedia. This policy unambiguously states many more categories of articles that can be placed on VfD and properly deleted than just nonsense, vanity, and original research. Your position is directly contradicted by the express words of the policy. You are certainly allowed to vote your conscience and vote to keep the article, but the listing is perfectly valid. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 00:22, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You can cut and paste as much as you like, but unfortunately you still haven't demonstrated any direct correlation between Wikipedia's deletion policy and this nomination, which clearly does NOT comply with ANY of the policy requirements listed above or anywhere else within Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 00:58, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is plenty of play in the joints of the unencyclopedic criteria and in what wikipedia is not. The listed examples are only those for which a strong consensus has been reached, and some of those examples are ambiguous themselves. Due to this ambiguity and differences of opinion on what the limits of this criteria are, there are naturally debates that play out on VfD. You interpret the guidelines narrowly, others do so more broadly. Claiming that there is no room for debate is simplistic, and claiming that only vanity, original research, and nonsense are the only criteria is just plain wrong. And besdies, if these school nominations are not valid, why do admins honor the results whether it is to keep or delete? <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 01:09, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you. Thank you so much. That is exactly my view. People seem to think that a school automatically has a Vfd-proof bubble around it and vehemently oppose any naysayers. However, I wouldn't say two weeks is overly long. Since the Schoolwatch team have now made the deletion of all schools a point of contention, each and every deletion discussion that would otherwise be short and simple now becomes a bitter struggle of wills between the "keep every school no matter what" and the "delete if it's useless/obscure" camps. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 00:43, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
