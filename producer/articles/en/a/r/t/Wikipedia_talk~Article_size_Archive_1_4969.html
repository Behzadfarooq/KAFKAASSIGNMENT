<dd>Brion? on the Wikipedia-l said that 30-50 was the range... I thought it suspect at first, but Im not sure where the range really is... this was an issue on 911.wik where Martin and Elo? fought over how whether the 911 list should be broken up - I suggested why not both? If you cant deal with... you have options still, and that list can be broken up by category... this begs the question of course... lists are better dealt with by software... Either way, it seems like the warning needs some clarifying and consensus... i just signed to wiki-en - ill repost this there... -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo"><strong>豎眩</strong></a></dd>

<dd>30-50k is <b>way</b> too long. First of all, it's a technical problem in that many users <i>cannot</i> edit pages of such length. Second, I think it's simply uncomfortably long for an article. Can you provide links to some pages that are that long that you think are comfortable to read, easy to edit, and simple to cite? --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 03:31 Mar 7, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

It'll only need to be edited every year, when they induct new members, and I guess for disambigging as needed, though if I do a good enough job wikifying, that should be rare.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Moved from the pump:</span></h3>
<p>I'm currently engaged in a project describing detailed the history of all the coin denominations of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_coinage.html" title="British coinage">British coinage</a>. At the moment I'm doing probably the largest article, <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_British_coin_Penny_51e8.html" title="English/British coin Penny">English/British coin Penny</a>, which has some 1200 years of history to recount and at the moment I've got as far as 1422. I'm aware that there's some maximum size to a Wiki article, but I've no idea of how big that is compared to what I've already written -- could someone suggest an article that's near the maximum size so that I can see how much more I can write before I run into problems? By the way, I know some people have complained about the naming style of the different articles for the individual coins, but that was adopted before I ever found Wikipedia - maybe we can rename them in a more elegant fashion once they've been written! Thanks. --<a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> 23:55 Apr 2, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's no theoretical maximum, but our server only has 2 gigs of memory, so don't push it please.&#160;;) In all seriousness though, I very strongly recommend against letting articles grow beyond 32 kilobytes. (This page right now is about 34 kilobytes.) Not only is this uncomfortably long to navigate if you're only looking for a small bit of information, and very annoying to edit if you want to touch on something in the middle somewhere, but it's technically problematic because some browsers (including most browsers on MacOS) cut off the text around this point when editing. If a page can't be reliably edited, it really should be refactored into several smaller, more self-contained sections.</dd>
<dd>When a page reached about 28kb, you'll see a warning message appear on the edit screen letting you know that you're entering the danger zone.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Recommendation to use bad html formatting?</span></h2>
<p>The article recommends using incorrect html formatting for tables if they get too long? Umm... This may be okay for now, but what happens when xhtml becomes standard? In my opinion, this recommendation should be changed, as most wiki editors will only visit here once, and never again, once they know what it says. We don't want editors five years from now remembering the recommendation to use bad html formatting, and then wondering why it doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>I'm removing the recommendation, but am willing to hear arguments to the contrary. - <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Herboso_fb30.html" title="User:Eric Herboso">Eric</a> <a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EEric_Herboso_ef91.html" title="User talk:Eric Herboso">Herboso</a> 02:49, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, that's not the best idea.&#160;:) I've reverted it. Note that MediaWiki <i>attempts</i> to put in the closing tags, but this won't always come out right. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 07:41, Mar 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, I was going to post this yesterday, but then there was the database hoo-hah and I only got to do the revert. MediaWiki outputs correct, <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWikipedia%3AArticle_size&amp;charset=%28detect+automatically%29&amp;doctype=%28detect+automatically%29" class="external text" title="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWikipedia%3AArticle_size&amp;charset=%28detect+automatically%29&amp;doctype=%28detect+automatically%29" rel="nofollow">validating</a> XHTML 1.0 Transitional. At least, it tries to. And the wikitext shown in the example (now that I've reverted it), if you view the source of the output HTML, spits out the following:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>so it's really a wacky hybrid of wikitext and HTML, but it <i>does</i> work, and creates perfectly good XHTML. Is it right to get users in the habit of not writing end tags?

The list is much more informative than a simple list of names would be, it contains the information people are interested in when trying to find out about a particular clerk, who they clerked for before the SC, their law school, and years of each. However even with the template reducing the size of formatting elements a bit, the article is already large and will grow. According to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_featured_list__6de1.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a featured list?">Wikipedia:What is a featured list?</a>, desireable attributes of a list include comprehensiveness, but making this list comprehensive will make it quite large. Currently there may be up to 37 names added a year. Although many current and former clerks do not have seperate pages now, I believe that will change as the list matures. These represent the top-tier of legal minds and many go on to become SC Justices, Federal Judges, and influential legal scholars or government attorneys.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A 'Root page' suggestion</span></h2>
<p>While working on <a href="../../../n/o/i/Noise.html" title="Noise">noise</a> I came across a fundamental problem. Some wanted to turn it into a 'disambiguation page' because they perceived noise to mean many things. But doing this took away all the well thought out common structure of the article, leaving a collection of fragments that you would't go to unless you knew exactly what you were looking for. Furthermore, the germans wanted two pages because of problems over the fact that they use two words for noise. And then there was the problem that 'environmental noise' is a form of 'acoustic noise', which 'radio noise' is too, but it isn't if you are looking at the electronics! There's a complex hierarchy, based on two meanings (random and /or unwanted) and its futile to try to explain this on every page.</p>
<p>I put the original page back, calling it a 'root page' and linked to specialist pages for all the detail. They each have a link taking you back to the root page. It taught me that 'disambiguation' is best kept for truly different multiple meanings, not for branching out. Is there a case for promoting the 'root page' concept here? --<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELindosland_587d.html" title="User:Lindosland">Lindosland</a> 15:46, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article length: judge by book standards?</span></h2>
<p>The assertions stated here about article length ("Anything above 20KB of readable text tries the patience of readers", "I think it's [30-50K] simply uncomfortably long for an article") reek of a violation of supposed Wikipedia policy, as they lack any kind of supporting evidence.</p>
<p>But rather than ask people to document these assertions, I have a question which may be useful to help establish how long really is too long. That question is: how long are articles in "real" encyclopedias (Americana, Funk &amp; Wagnalls, Brittanica, etc.)? How long are the longest articles in print? Seems like this should be pretty easy to determine. (After all, weren't a lot of articles here just lifted from Brittanica?)</p>
<p>I think this would be a better metric to judge length by, rather than the very computer-ish 32K (as if some kind of psychological research has established that MEGO(1) sets in at 32,768 bytes!). It seems the 32K limit has become, for the most part, obsolete because of technical reasons (mobile browsers and a few other cases excepted): the question now should be, how long can an article become before people lose interest?</p>

<dd>I think there are some cases where 32K just doesn't make sense. Say you look up an article on World War II. Would you really expect the text to be limited to 32K? I would say that 100-200 K is easily justified for topics about which there is so much to say. --MvH Jan 13, 2006.</dd>

<dd>Britannica has 63 pages on the World Wars. And the articles "Islam" "Islamic arts" "Islamic world" together are 132 pages. Of course, in wiki you can still find quite a lot of the same material because it's divided over numerous articles, and you can still find quite a bit in wiki that's not in Britannica. But in any case, I'd think 100K for WWII would certainly not be so long that it would have to be split. --MvH Jan 13, 2006.</dd>
<dd>PS. That doesn't mean that I'd like a lot of articles to become longer. My point is that if an article is very well written (and there are many jewels here at wiki) then the length of the article should not be an issue. <a href="../../../m/v/h/User%7EMvH_874c.html" title="User:MvH">MvH</a> Jan 13, 2006.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the research. I agree with your conclusions; as I said, it seems to me that the recommended 32K article size limit is both arbitrary and very "computerish" and therefore not a good measure of what "too long" is. (Of course, given how many people are idiots with short attention spans in the Computer Age, maybe it is a good limit, but that's a whole 'nother rant.) --<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 02:52, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

No reason to repeat all that here since it has all already been worked out. Also, most articles in EB are small and the large ones are huge for reasons relating to the fact that EB is not a hyperlinked work where detailed treatments of subtopics can be treated. Thus all aspects are treated in one place whereas we can summarize various points and provide links to more detailed treatments of those subtopics. This is far more useful to the reader, who then has a choice of the amount of detail he/she reads. In short, we are not limited to the way things are done in print and can thus try to keep articles at a size that can comfortably be read in s single sitting (7000 to 10000 words long, depending on the topic). Get a copy of EB and look for yourself. It's coverage is highly uneven and often does not make sense. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> 00:07, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica article on the Bible is approximately one megabyte's worth of ASCII text. I don't know the actual figures but a quick inspection of the current Encyclopedia Britannica will confirm that the typical Wikipedia article more closely resembles those in the 12-volume portion known as the "Micropedia" than the long articles in the 18-volume "Macropedia." Our article on <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Britannica_0925.html" title="Encyclopedia Britannica">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> notes that Micropedia articles are mostly "from one to five paragraphs" while Macropedia articles "range from a few pages to over three hundred pages." Given the relatively large page size and relatively small print, I don't actually have one at hand but I'd guess that a Britannica page probably weighs in at about 10K, which would mean that the <i>shortest</i> Macropedia articles are in the 32K ballpark. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:17, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The persons providing the justification for limits on article size are predominantly "techies" for whom the writing part is a chore compared to the joy of formatting pages, blocking miscreants and otherwise engaging in the plumbing aspects of html page production. These are the folks who theorize that readers will get bored with articles that are longer than x kb (notice how the limits are in kb and not words - very instructive) often because of their own inadequacies in that department. What is lost in this discussion is that some articles are well written and can hold the readers' interest far longer than much of the mediocre prose found in other entries. One look at the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> books belies the belief that people will not read long stories. What I often see happen is many editors in obescience to the size limits create daughter articles that end up on AfD. Once the daughter article is deleted, the text in the main article rises to compensate. Then you find yourself back on the same merry-go-round. Of all the rules on Wikipedia this one is the most counter-productive. Its unsoken assumption is that people writing cannot do so in a literate manner. That assumption is simply wrong. <a href="../../../j/t/m/User%7EJtmichcock_d337.html" title="User:Jtmichcock">Jtmichcock</a> 14:44, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Reading time is still a very important part of readability of an article but, as you state, good writing can help mitigate for that (but only to a point&#160;; wiki is not paper, but Wikipedia is not Wikibooks either). Also, some topics simply require more space than others. Thus the sliding scale used at <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a> along with the mention of readable prose and approximate word count. Encyclopedia articles cannot grow to be book length. So some soft limits and stylistic guidelines are needed. The beauty of hyperlinks is that we can have summaries that lead to more in-depth treatments. Thus we can serve those who need varying levels of detail. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> 15:21, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note of sarcasm there, judging from your edit summary? I don't think mobile users are too much of a minority to be honest. And 32K is quite a generous limit too (4000+ words) so by the time you get to that size it does begin to get a bit large from a readability perspective too. OTOH what I did find to be more of a problem was trying to access articles of any size with the default stylesheet, though you can of course change that in your preferences. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJammycakes_f7ef.html" title="User:Jammycakes">Jammycakes</a> 13:14, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm just going to toss in my $.02 worth here without slogging through all of the previous discussion: It's my experience that essentially every non-trivial article in Wikipedia triggers the "may be longer than is preferable" warning. Ergo, it's time to change the criteria for triggering the warning. Obviously, most editors (including me) disagree with it and aren't heeding it. It feels like a glaring anachronism to me, and as such it harms WP's credibility. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlBunker_d26a.html" title="User:KarlBunker">KarlBunker</a> 02:12, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As this message is invisible to readers and only seen by editors, I disagree with the credibility problem. Would you be happier if the warning trigger was moved to 50k, which is what the guideline suggests as maximum article size? Any article longer than 50k should definitely trigger a warning, because it is in danger of becoming too tiring to read, a Bad Thing for an encyclopedia article, which is supposed to give the reader a quick overview over a topic. Personally, I really think 32k text plus whatever the references, onfoboxes and similar nonsense take should be the limit above which articles should be shortened. The only problem is that this is a bit harder to measure than the length of the wikicode. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 02:38, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>People make a lot of sweeping statements on this subject, often about "what readers want." Something that would be interesting and useful would be some actual data on that topic, but I suppose it would be hugely difficult to--say--(temporarily) add a little feedback form to each article that asks "was this article: [] too long&#160;&#160; [] too short&#160;&#160; [] just right."</dd>
<dd>One form of feedback WP <i>does</i> have is the talk page to each article. Any reader can leave a comment complaining that an article is too long.

<p>Two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>As the content page states, it is the size of the *readable prose* that matters most. The total size of the wikitext is no longer as much of a concern due to fix browsers and very widespread use of broadband to access the Internet (even dial-up users can start to read the article while it is downloading). Any properly footnoted and referenced article with lots of intwikis, internal links, external links, see alsos and tables will often be two to three times the size of the readable prose. However, articles that do not have all that will have a total page size that is comparable to the size of the readable prose. Thus to catch the later group of articles when they may be getting too long, we still must keep the current trigger size for the long page warning (what we really need a feature that counts readable words outside of the list-like sections).</li>
<li>The lead section is supposed to be able to stand alone as a concise version of the article. Thus no reason to have a separate micropedia.</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Some articles -- not many -- are by nature, sometimes long.</li>
<li>If so, do what can be done to keep them short, and pay <i>above average</i> attention to readability. But if it genuinely would not make sense as two articles, leave it as one.</li>
<li>Readers of such articles will probably expect them to be long. If they are easy to read, and well structured, and justify the length, then that helps.</li>
<li>Excessively long articles are not encouraged and should not be the rule.</li>
<li><i>Readability is the key criterion.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>

<p>Realistically there are many articles over 30-50 kb, and will continue to be. So a section that at least covers when and why and when not, would be valuable. It's not long so I added it.</p>
