<dd>People don't have to take the test. We <i>know</i> we are conscious, and don't have to prove it to anyone. The test for whether I am conscious, if any were required, is that I ask you 'Am I conscious?' and you say 'Yes'. If you say 'No' then I know you are lying. You might say 'I'm not sure', meaning that you are not sure whether I exist, i.e. that perhaps I am only a machine. People take it for granted, and have to take it for granted, that what they know as their own self-awareness is experienced similarly by other people as their self-awareness. When we talk of tests, we are only talking of how artificial consciousness is to gain a semblance of reality, and of course, self-awareness as you or I know it cannot be tested, which is why it cannot be one of the pre-requisites for artificial consciousness. Tkorrovi, what is your first language? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Stannard_9e17.html" title="User:Matthew Stannard">Matt Stan</a> 23:44, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My first language is English. I don't think yours is. We are conversing here in English. Others have remarked on your syntax. I am interested in your different perception of certain matters to do with consciousness. If consciousness is itself partly an illusion, as I have suggested, then culture might make us susceptible to different illusions, and our expression of them through different modes of language. Any knowledge I had of your first language, or could acquire if I knew what it was, might help in my interpretation of your idiosyncratic prose. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Stannard_9e17.html" title="User:Matthew Stannard">Matt Stan</a> 19:53, 5 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"...tkorrovi is either a troll or very misguided. From my experiences on UseNet, I would say his behavior is very trollish and would most likely be dismissed as such if the argument were happening on UseNet." "Claims to be acting reasonably, but shamelessly reverts other people's edits (pehaps because he suspects new editors to be aliases of the person who originally pissed him off, but still). Also a common troll tactic; try to claim you are being reasonable despite all appearances to keep people on your side as long as possible." "Another difficulty with his posts is that his English is below the general standard of Wikipedia, yet he often insists on having his wordings preserved exactly, regardless of whether the edit is a semantic difference or merely correction of grammar, spelling, style, etc.."</dd>

<dd>Please stop the blasphemy! Show me one example that causes you to think that I am a troll. I have not the slightest idea of the cause of all that blasphemy. One reason I can possibly conceive is my nationality. I may be a person you or somebody else doesn't like. Not everyone likes everyone, but I don't write blasphemy in every possible place about people I don't like. Please say what you want from me, I cannot figure out what would please you. Sorry if there was anything what I did wrong. I have the courage to say sorry. A simple statement from you that you stop calling me a troll would end the argument. What would it cost you to say that? Please understand that we cannot seriously discuss anything if we become personal. Then it would not be a discussion about the topic, but rather a discussion about our personal qualities. This is pretty much the reason why it was impossible to discuss things on the talk page and which caused an edit war. Please think about it, what should we discuss now, the question of whether I am a troll or not? <a href="../../../t/k/o/User%7ETkorrovi_0c02.html" title="User:Tkorrovi">Tkorrovi</a> 13:36,</dd>

<dd>I've corrected the English in the paragraph above. There is nothing wrong with Tkorrovi. There is no such thing as an Estonian troll. The Estonian people are very proud of their unique language and the contribution that their nation has made to world culture. I do not decry your nationality - only your use of English. You seem to use the dictionary as the sole source of reference. It is not. There is grammar and correct usage that may not be found in a dictionary alone (at least not the Concise Oxford - go for the Shorter Oxford at least). That is why we make the distinction between artificial and simulated, real and genuine, predict and anticipate, and so on. I am also interested that someone from a different culture may indeed have a valid and different definition of consciousness because of his different cultural identity. I am interested for instance in the fact that Estonian has no future tense. Does this affect one's appreciation of the meaning of the English word 'prediction'? Does having no future tense imply a different consciousness about what the word <i>future</i> actually means? Unless we can be clear on our definitions of simple words and overcome whatever language barriers there are, and be aware that they exist, I fear that the assertion that Tkorrovi is a troll might persist. I aim not to use <i>ad hominem</i> arguments, so there is no question of blasphemy. Who is accused of blaspheming against what, anyway? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Stannard_9e17.html" title="User:Matthew Stannard">Matt Stan</a> 16:29, 10 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you continue to talk on the topic of whether I am a troll or not: "Unless we can be clear on our definitions of simple words and overcome whatever language barriers there are, and be aware that they exist, I fear that the assertion that Tkorrovi is a troll might persist." -- *stop* it. Estonian has no future tense, but this only means that what is said like "I shall do it sometimes later" is said like "I do it sometimes later" and it means exactly the same -- something shall be done in the future, only a peculiarity of the grammar and no difference in thinking. Estonian is similar to Finnish (I can speak Finnish also) and there is no future tense either, nobody yet said that this somehow influences the thinking of the Finns. Concise Oxford Dictionary has often been chosen as a basic dictionary for international agreements, ie only the words from that dictionary may appear in these agreements. This is why that dictionary is a kind of standard and preferred over the others. English being your first language is your advantage, but many Wikipedia articles in English are written by people whose first language is not English, including some featured articles, so also don't overestimate that advantage. I'm not proud to be Estonian, but this has nothing to do with the discussion here whatsoever, if your only intention is to disregard me, then please leave alone me and my nationality. <a href="../../../t/k/o/User%7ETkorrovi_0c02.html" title="User:Tkorrovi">Tkorrovi</a> 17:36, 10 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am happy to confine vocabulary to keywords in the Concise Oxford Dictionary in order to avoid obscure words, but when it comes to definition and coloration of words, then one needs to cast a wider net. The advantage of having English as a first language, if such is an advantage, is merely to know what is correct usage, whereas others are not always so confident. This doesn't give me a problem in the Wikipedia context, because one can always go in and correct someone else's grammar/syntax. So it's no big deal. Difficulties can arise, though, when the intended meaning of a non-native speaker is unclear. I think that has happened here. (I'm much clearer now on <i>prediction</i> having read Tkorrovi's explanation about modelling within a closed loop process control system.) <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Stannard_9e17.html" title="User:Matthew Stannard">Matt Stan</a> 09:28, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I rather think that the topic is complicated and difficulties may arise from that, especially when the discussion is often much too fast, with no time to think enough your response. It's of course sure that the native speaker can express himself faster; in very fast discussion the non-native speaker is certainly at a disadvantage. Otherwise, nobody has yet said that my English is very bad. For example, I translated this <a href="http://www.highpark.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/dallas/pressxpress1998.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.highpark.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/dallas/pressxpress1998.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.highpark.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/dallas/pressxpress1998.htm</a> for High Park Records, a record company in Canada (rubbish as it is, but I mean the language). <a href="../../../t/k/o/User%7ETkorrovi_0c02.html" title="User:Tkorrovi">Tkorrovi</a> 16:00, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am hesitant to criticise at all in a public arena such as this, as it is not likely to be fruitful. (Adage: Praise in public; criticise in private.) Another criticised Tkorrovi's English, and I followed that up by making some suggestions. I am also bashful about criticising the English of someone who has evidently spent considerable time learning a language that is not their own - so who am I to criticise? However, when it comes to plain understanding, I think we are making progress, albeit rather verbosely, and I wouldn't make any further criticisms anyway. As for speed, well, we can take our time in Wikipedia - no one forces us to respond immediately. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Stannard_9e17.html" title="User:Matthew Stannard">Matt Stan</a> 20:32, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Artificial Consciousness: I have added in a good para from Psb777. Possibly you should calm down a little. 203.221.246.35 21:11, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I included your change and didn't remove that. If you are Ataturk, then the problem was that to reverse Paul's changes (one of these removing almost all content) I had to make all changes in my copy and then put it up. Believe me, in such conditions it's feasible to include only very clear changes, the gentle changes of changing order of the text are not for such situation. I sincerely tried to do all my best to include your changes as completely as it ws possible, sorry if I failed to satisfy all you wanted. Please understand that this situation was not normal, if you see what this page was before Paul come -- people adding their changes without any dispute, why then coming of Paul changed all of that. tkorrovi</p>
<p>Where we were at the point I got involved was at this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Artificial_consciousness&amp;oldid=2676043" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Artificial_consciousness&amp;oldid=2676043" rel="nofollow">work of art</a>.

<p>And this was also result of editing by several people. tkorrovi</p>
<p>You are fixated on who. Better to be fixated on what. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 16:08, 15 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, I fixate on reasons of dispute. tkorrovi</p>
<p>This is demonstrably not true. Whatever I do you revert. The same edit by someone else you allow.</p>
<p>I see you now fail to log in, something you are critical of others about. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 16:57, 15 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>&gt; Whatever I do you revert.</p>
<p>This was only in the end when I couldn't cope with all your tricks any more in any possible way. All messages so far in talk bage signed with Tkorrovi (tkorrovi) were written by me.<a href="../../../t/k/o/User%7ETkorrovi_0c02.html" title="User:Tkorrovi">Tkorrovi</a> 15 Mar 2004</p>

<p>Tkorrovi, you have violated many Wikipedia policies. First, one may not revert a page more than three times in a row. Second, one should listen to others' arguments. Third, one should review another's changes before blindly reverting them. Fourth, one should not flame and troll other users. I will now unprotect <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_consciousness.html" title="Artificial consciousness">artificial consciousness</a>.

<p>The comment above is as a proof that I cannot continue to work on "artificial consciousness" article in Wikipedia. I started this article after it was started by one editor and then blanked by another editor for no content.

<p>No, because they explained it in their summary: "rv: you can only blaspheme against God, or he who thinks he is a god" (Paul Beardsell) and "there are certain circumstances when that is advisable" (Ugen64).

<dd>So this was the explanation, not only your archive was reverted, but the <b>whole talk page</b> with my two comments deleted. And the archive you talk about (<b>one</b> archive) was not an archive of original posts, but your summary of them, and a <b>wrong</b> summary, this was the reason why I deleted a link to it.

<dd>"If you don't want to discuss it with the other people involved in a dispute, there's no point in others getting involved." Yes, this is what I always tried to do, but the reason why I wrote in Village Pump first was that anybody else don't do that first. I explain. Paul Beardsell complained in public places (one was Peer Review) and Ugen64 talk page that he has an edit war with me, <b>without</b> trying to discuss it with me first. I explained him why I reverted his posts, ie that he tried to remove the whole content of the article, but instead of discussing with me, he started to make his changes even faster. If he did stop, and we did discuss, there was no reason to get others involved. But he did that, and towards him it was legitimate reason to protect the page in order to protect <b>him</b> against <b>me</b>. Where is the equality here, why are different users treated differently? If I then did write first in public place that Paul Beardsell started the edit war and tried to remove content, maybe I was the one who were protected. So this is why I try to write in public place first, and have no time to discuss it before. How it was against me, there may be no other way how I can protect myself. I really want the things to be different, but I was attacked, an nothing is so easy after that. <a href="../../../t/k/o/User%7ETkorrovi_0c02.html" title="User:Tkorrovi">Tkorrovi</a> 04:52, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is false. I mean, I want to be clear: This is a set of <b>lies</b> by Tkorrovi dressed up in a suit of half-truths which <b>deiberately</b> misrepresents the history. A brief perusal of the version history and comments demonstrates that I repeatedly tried to engage with Tkorrovi before getting others involved.

<p>Misrepresentation is Tkorrovi's strong suit. I try to engage and it's archived as "blasphemy". At best Tkorrovi lacks self-awareness.

<p>Correcting your grammar is considered racist by you. You need a "do" between "Why" and "sysops". <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 10:10, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes in general, but sometimes it's allowed to write it more shortly, like "Why make so much fuss?" (A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language by Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech and Svartvik). I don't know South African English though. <a href="../../../t/k/o/User%7ETkorrovi_0c02.html" title="User:Tkorrovi">Tkorrovi</a> 10:21, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. In the latter example you have missed out two words, "do you". Which has a different effect to missing out the one word "do" in the former example. If you had left out the word "sysops" also then that would have been correct grammar but would not have conveyed your meaning. The noun-subject requires the "do". <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 10:49, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, you have already given your opinion and I have already explained why you are wrong but, as ever, you do not read the reply with enough attention. I will try again: You think your grammar book agrees with you but it does not. If you supply a noun-subject you need the "do" in a question. In the example you give from your grammar book there is no noun-subject so the "do" becomes optional. Although leaving it out can sometimes change the meaning a little but that is not the point. It is invalid to leave the "do" out where you left it out. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 12:01, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sometimes it's just allowed to omit the noun subject and "do", or only "do", though it's not the best, just when it would be necessary to write quickly. English is not a language with so strict rules as you try to suggest, there is no official grammar in English. By strict rules the example would be far from correct. I already said that I agree that with "do" it was more correct, this is what my grammar also says. Was it supposed to be a proof that my english is "very bad and far below Wikipedia level", or how it was said by these who claimed that they "pissed me off" or, sorry, I don't tend to remember offenses very exactly. <a href="../../../t/k/o/User%7ETkorrovi_0c02.html" title="User:Tkorrovi">Tkorrovi</a> 12:17, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The purpose of me correcting your English was not to correct your English: We all understood that you had made a simple error or that you were a non-native English language speaker but your meaning was clear - that's good enough (for me) on a Talk page. My purpose was to demonstrate that you are unable to admit that you are wrong. This you continue to do. And to demonstrate that me indicating an error in your writing (the missing "do") or an error in your reasoning (the argument about the missing "do") is invariably taken by you as <i>personal</i> criticism. It is not personal criticism. Your response (and here I do get personal) is a typically dishonest and unjust <i>ad hominem</i> attack - the racism one is just the latest of several. <i>Ad hominem</i> attacks are always unfair but sometimes they are at least truthful. So your unfairness is demonstrated. But your dishonesty is also in this case as you have no reason other than a possible persecution complex for calling me "racist". But I am not writing this to you: I am writing it for others to read so that when they see my name they do not have a lingering suspicion in their minds that I may be a racist. Consider the lingering impression you make. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 12:36, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes I did admit that I made simple errors, read the talk page, this was simply hypocritical from you. But you cannot take from me a right to say my opinion, what I did, and it's not always just black and white so that you either admit your mistake or say that you were entirely correct. And that you don't write to me but to others on my talk page is wrong also. This shows that you don't want to discuss with me, but seek support against me from others. At least on my talk page it's not honest. <a href="../../../t/k/o/User%7ETkorrovi_0c02.html" title="User:Tkorrovi">Tkorrovi</a> 13:13, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, if you're going to copy the talk page, put it in an archive or something. The talk page is currently 80 kb, which means that I will have to archive it now. <a href="../../../u/g/e/User%7EUgen64_718c.html" title="User:Ugen64">ugen64</a> 21:29, Mar 30, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When the threats against me end? I was threaten to be blocked already second time <b>without no reason</b>. Why I'm treated like that, can you show <b>a single</b> vandalism by me? I always tried to discuss and solve problems so, the talk page is 6 volumes long, but attacks against me didn't end. I didn't delete other people's additions to article, even if I found them wrong, I did not have any bad intentions against anybody. But nobody never said me welcome. Please believe me, I'm not a bad person, why you attack me? <a href="../../../t/k/o/User%7ETkorrovi_0c02.html" title="User:Tkorrovi">Tkorrovi</a> 04:06, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tkorrovi made only a handful of edits before March 2004. Correcting Tkorrovi's spelling is considered a personal attack by him. A gentle enquiry by another user as to his home language was taken very personally by him. What he accuses others of he always seems to be guilty of himself in spades. I am <b>not</b> the most reasonable, level headed Wikipedia user but I am a saint in comparison <b>and</b> I contribute to many Wikipedia articles with the perhaps the occasional edit conflict which is always constructively resolved - Tkorrovi should try his antics in any article other than <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_consciousness.html" title="Artificial consciousness">artificial consciousness</a> (where practically his only Wikipedia contributions occur) and he would see how well he would be tolerated there. I reverted the Talk page because he was deleting my comments on a Talk page. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 09:40, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As you see, the attacks don't end. I deleted only Paul's comment "Yes, but someone has to keep the Estonians happy." what was not informative and I considered it offensive. Previously South-African Paul Beardsell said that it needs an anthropologist to find out my nationality, or maybe he meant to find out whether I'm human or animal. <a href="../../../t/k/o/User%7ETkorrovi_0c02.html" title="User:Tkorrovi">Tkorrovi</a> 09:50, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
It wasn't only the deletions of <i>my</i> comments I was concerned about. The comment to which Tkorrovi now chooses to take offense above was meant humourously <i>and Tkorrovi's response to it shows this was understood at the time.</i> The anthropologist comment I made was directed not at Tkorrovi but at Matt Stan <i>who is one!</i>. Tkorrovi seems to be embarrassed to be Estonian! But here we have a typical example of Tkorrovi's twisted thought process: He <b>falsely</b> accuses me of criticising him on the basis of his nationality (or if he is even human - where he gets this from is difficult to see) and then he uses this to justify mentioning my (supposed) nationality trying thereby to do what? Tkorrovi stabs himself and blames it on me. Incidentally, Tkorrovi, if we continue here we are likely to annoy others. If you insist on a public forum I am happy with staying here. Otherwise I suggest we go to your Talk page where you currently revert my comments and where those amused by the conflict can join us too. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 10:08, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

This last reversion of yours is vandalism. Wikipedia obviously works differently than you think. The myriad of improvements to wording, grammar and structure you have senselessly reverted is not constructive. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 02:41, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
