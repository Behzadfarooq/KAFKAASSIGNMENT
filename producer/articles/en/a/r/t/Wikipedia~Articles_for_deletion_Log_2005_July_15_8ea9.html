<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>EXTREME Cleanup</b>. I am entirely fed up with the opinionated 15-year olds going around on the article talk pages, vandalizing my talk page for protecting it, and other stuff.

<dd>I would say this is fairly good precedent that at least some warez groups are encyclopedic.

<li><b>Keep</b> - unlike the category, it seems like this table provides pretty good concise summaries / short descriptions of the groups. Agree with Dragons flight above on the necessity of limiting the groups to sufficient notability, though that of course carries the caveat of flame wars, vandalism, etc. when someone decides that warez group X or Y is not notable. Verifiability, IMHO, should not be too problematic, either. <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidG_2ba7.html" title="User:RidG">RidG</a> <a href="../../../r/i/d/User_talk%7ERidG_5b69.html" title="User talk:RidG">(talk)</a> 07:34, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Not to overtly criticize, but that's a rather unsophisticated comment. 95% of all released warez comes from a small number of well-established groups, with anywhere from 2 to 5 groups vying for the top position in a specific niche (i.e., PC games, DVD movies, etc.). Given the attention that piracy receives in this country and others, I would argue that such major contributors to piracy are indeed sufficiently notable.

<li><b>Bicycle keep</b>. As it clearly states atop this article, this is a list of warez groups for the parent article on <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warez.html" title="Warez">warez</a>. It was created because the list of names was becoming too long for the main article and it was appropriate to export it; I believe this is an acceptable reason for the creation of a list on Wikipedia. If non-notable or non-verifiable groups are added they can always be removed, but that is certainly not a valid reason for the deletion of the entire list. Secondly, this list serves to document notable groups which do not yet have articles rather than create a host of stubs.

<dd>RaD Man brings up a good point. This article, while being placed on VfD, has not had a chance to be improved. That really weakens this VfD, because one of the benefits of a VfD is that the article itself often gets improved during that time. If this article gets deleted (and it's pretty borderline right now), that makes it a strong case for a VfU. Perhaps this article should be unprotected and placed on VfD for another week. I'd like to see how (or if) this article gets improved. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 17:29, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> for several reasons: 1) moved to sub page since <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warez.html" title="Warez">Warez</a> was getting too large 2) stops the main warez article (which has been a repeatedly used resource/reference by major media organizations NY TIMES, BBC) itself from being vandalized constantly by joe schmoe the 12yr old warez kiddie to hype his latest l33t group. 3) Its really easy to verify existance of groups, but many are not noteworthy enough to get a stub article. This is a way to list smaller groups, as well as larger more verifiable groups with a brief 2-3 sentance description of them, and save the hassle of vfd's of small stubs because one person decided group X was non notable. Sadly a category (which I do find useful) would get cluttered up way too fast if we were to start including data on each group since there have been probably 15,000+ warez groups worldwide in the past 20 years. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/18px-Radioactive.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" /></a> 00:17, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Agreeing with RiDG, the fact that cracked/pirated software/media makes up such a large margin in the computer market (a given, since anyone somewhat knowledgeable on a computer has heard of p2p, and the general makeup of those networks is for distributing such files) should account for it's place it notability. Second, agreeing with RaD Man and ALKIVAR, the need for a seperate list to be created should be obvious given that someone that doesn't know what the term warez means probably doesn't want to have to deal with a huge list of groups on the same page. Also, not to be critical, but it seems that most of those giving a reason for deletion simply find the subject offensive. A wiki not only allows editing by anyone from mister PhD to his 4 year old daughter, but it also promotes free-speech. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHello_World_f110.html" title="User:Hello World">Hello World!</a> 18:02, July 19, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - notable Australian show. <b>Comment</b> - it would be really appreciated if people who are nominating articles for deletion which relate to a country or theme other than one they are familiar with, referred the issue to the noticeboard for that country or theme. I myself have done that for an Irish article that appeared to be nonsense (it was confirmed to be nonsense by Irish wikipedians) and for an Islamic article (was not nonsense).

<li><b>Keep</b>, why delete it? Its obviously a rather new org, and thus would explain the low number of google hits (mainstream US press doesn't give much attention to organizing on the left). As per verifiability, there is a) a registered webdomain (do you seriously suspect that some other org or political tendency has launched a false website?) and a snail-mail address. If you want to check the verfiability, check whether the snail-mail address is faked or not. The article just needs a stub-tag and be rewritten.

<li><b>Delete</b> as I was fishing and indeed caught my fish as Kokiri has given me enough evidence to demonstrate my point on another issue. For those interested, <i>Beautiful Land</i> is indeed a translation of what Koreans and Chinese use for <i>America</i>. However, most modern Japanese use "Ah-Meh-Lee-Kah" and not <i>Rice Land</i>, an antiquidated term in Japanese. The point I was trying to make was that Koreans use the term "East Sea" (Donghae) for the "Sea of Japan" in Korean, yet some people are too stubborn and want to use the Korean word but put into English. My point is that if they want to use the Korean name and put it into English, why would the reverse not be called for?

Police forces, school boards, municipal services, etc are named after these census divisions. The same cannot be said for people in Alberta - Do the Division No. 6 Regional Police exist? How about the Division No. 6 District School board? Or the Division No. 6 Transit Comission? The content of the article itself are fine, but this article needs a different name and/or to be merged with one of the other Calgary articles. The only people with blank stares are the people reading this article and wondering what the hell it is talking about, and I think your zealous attitude towards this article needs to be adjusted.

<li>What justifies notablity is not whether everyone knows about it anyways. The fact is, it's a place, and places exist- and therefore should have an article. It's not an insignifigant place either- it has over 1,000,000 people. Whether or not people have heard of it is not the issue. Wikipedia is not a polling firm. The fact is, StatsCan says it exists- so it does. Why dont we just delete all the Census Boroughs in Alaska while we're at it?

<li>It's not a place as much as an entity created by StatsCan. Here in New Brunswick the province draws its school district boundaries irrespective to anything else, and they're numbered too. Are you going to say we should have articles for all 18 school districts, with a list of attractions and parks? If you're going to list attractions, MPs, highways in this article, then I suggest you add a complete list of them nationwide to <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Canada_2cfd.html" title="Demographics of Canada">Demographics of Canada</a>.

<li>The Alaskan Census Borough pages don't contain any information beyond the simple census data. You are trying to make this article into some grand central source for everything around Calgary. You could argue about keeping this page about simple census data, but having information such as highways, MPs, MLAs, attractions, etc goes well beyond the whole point of the census area to begin with. This page MUST be altered and/or moved to a page more fitting for the data it contains.

<li>It's not just a statistical division, it's a geographical division as well. The Alaskan boroughs all have information on their geography.

<li><b>Comment</b> Also, before anyone makes any sudden judgements, I would first take a look at the various Alaskan Census Borough articles. A list of them is available in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Alaska_borough_and_census_area_name_etymologies_1387.html" title="List of Alaska borough and census area name etymologies">List of Alaska borough and census area name etymologies</a> article. Earl seems quick to point out the notability of these articles, but at the same time these articles contain nothing more than simple census data. Listing attractions, MPs, MLAs, highways, etc is beyond the scope of a simple 'census' article, regardless of what Earl would have you believe. What's next, a Wikipedia article for every single census tract that StatsCan has created for every single CMA? If this article is kept in its current form, I propose that Earl be forced to create an article for every single census tract within the Calgary CMA, and update it and defend it with the same zeal as he does this particular article - after all, if we're making articles for un-named census areas that serve no purpose other than gathering statistical data, we may as well do the same for individual community tracts! Otherwise, I think it's time for a merger and a move. <a href="../../../s/n/i/User%7ESnickerdo_538d.html" title="User:Snickerdo">Snickerdo</a> 10:22, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well I am sorry if information is such a bad thing for an encyclopedia. Heaven forbid there be information in an encylopedia! And, it is not wiki convention to force its users to do anything.

<li>Information is great, but information that can't be used for practical purposes is almost as bad as no information at all. This is the whole reason why we're having this debate. As for census tracts, I'm sure the census tract containing <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Park_%28Toronto%29_15c6.html" title="Queen's Park (Toronto)">Queen's Park</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_Hill_2546.html" title="Parliament Hill">Parliament Hill</a> would pass the notability test - but is it practical?

<li><b>Rewrite</b>: Since Alberta census divisions are not based on real-world municipal organization, the article is definitely needed, but it should be confined to things related to the census.

<li><b>Keep</b> These divisions are not all relevant, but some such as this one (see also, the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Vancouver_Regional_District_5406.html" title="Greater Vancouver Regional District">Greater Vancouver Regional District</a>) are actually more important. In the case of Div. 6, it essentially represents an area that corresponds to Calgary's metropolitan area, but is distinct from its censused CMA. This is not unlike the GVRD. Alberta just happens to number these divisions instead of name them as is the case in BC. -Tyson2k
<ul>
<li>Actually, that's not quite the case. There's a difference between the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Regional_Partnership_0ac3.html" title="Calgary Regional Partnership">Calgary Regional Partnership</a> and the numbered census divison. It's also interesting to note that the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Toronto_Area_aadf.html" title="Greater Toronto Area">Greater Toronto Area</a> is spread out over at least five seperate census divisions, and the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Horseshoe_397e.html" title="Golden Horseshoe">Golden Horseshoe</a> is spread out over even more. <a href="../../../s/n/i/User%7ESnickerdo_538d.html" title="User:Snickerdo">Snickerdo</a> 06:21, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well... you're right, the CRP is completely different. It is also a corporation and not a census boundary. However, even though they do not complettely match, Div. 6 is the basis for Calgary's StatsCan CMA (same as the GTA and the GVRD). It is also the <i>basis</i> for the boudaries of the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary-Edmonton_Corridor_f424.html" title="Calgary-Edmonton Corridor">Calgary-Edmonton Corridor</a> and the Calgary Health Region, which are also StatsCan divisions. So, you're right, Div. 6 does not equal Calgary's metropolitan area, however, as a boundary, it is no less relevant that any of the other afformentioned regions. -Tyson2k
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Toronto_Area_aadf.html" title="Greater Toronto Area">Greater Toronto Area</a> and the Toronto CMA are entirly different things. For example, <a href="../../../o/s/h/Oshawa%2C_Ontario_1b5b.html" title="Oshawa, Ontario">Oshawa</a> is in its own CMA, while still considered part of the GTA. Just the same, <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orangeville%2C_Ontario_29ef.html" title="Orangeville, Ontario">Orangeville</a> is part of the CMA, but not considered part of the GTA, as it is not within <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halton_Regional_Municipality%2C_Ontario_ba8d.html" title="Halton Regional Municipality, Ontario">Halton</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peel_Regional_Municipality%2C_Ontario_f2f7.html" title="Peel Regional Municipality, Ontario">Peel</a>, <a href="../../../y/o/r/York_Regional_Municipality%2C_Ontario_8b85.html" title="York Regional Municipality, Ontario">York</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham_Regional_Municipality%2C_Ontario_1377.html" title="Durham Regional Municipality, Ontario">Durham</a> or the city of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> itself. The difference here is that each one of those regions is its own census division, has a cultural tie to the region around it, and each one serves more of a purpose than simply keeping track of StatsCan data.</li>

<li>If you remove those from the Div. 6 article then you MUST be consistent and remove them from the other census division articles where they exist (such as <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_No._11%2C_Alberta_b015.html" title="Division No. 11, Alberta">Division No. 11, Alberta</a>).

<dd>Earl, even the Ontario census division articles don't generally list politicians and attractions and such; they simply list the cities and towns within those divisions. A few do have "attractions" lists, but those should really be listed mainly in the individual towns and cities. The articles for <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto%2C_Ontario_4d0b.html" title="Toronto, Ontario">Toronto</a>, <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa.html" title="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton%2C_Ontario_a636.html" title="Hamilton, Ontario">Hamilton</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Sudbury%2C_Ontario_966f.html" title="Greater Sudbury, Ontario">Greater Sudbury</a> are a different matter entirely from most census division articles, because those census divisions are actually single united cities, and thus their articles simultaneously function as city articles; most Ontario census divisions don't work that way. So the Alberta census divisions, which also don't work that way, have to be treated less like Toronto and more like <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frontenac_County%2C_Ontario_6056.html" title="Frontenac County, Ontario">Frontenac County</a>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 17:37, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do have to support <b>keep</b>ing this; whether it's common knowledge or not, it <i>is</i> a region with definable boundaries which serves an important purpose that fits within the definition of what Wikipedia is supposed to cover. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 17:42, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b>: I think what's unfortunate here is that Alberta has chosen to number its census divisions. Snickerdo is right that many Calgarians do not know what Div. 6 is while most Ontarians know the "Peel Region" and many Vancouverites know the "GVRD". HOWEVER, even though names like Peel Region and GVRD make much more sense than Division No. 6, they are NO different. They mean exactly the same thing to StatsCan. All census divisions in BC are "<i>Something</i> Regional District", most census divisions in Ontario are "<i>Something</i> Region" (GTA is not quite the same thing) and all census divions in Alberta are "Division No. #". It's not very descriptive, and so nobody pays much attention to it. However, since it means exactly the same thing as something like the Greater Vancouver Regional District, then it should stay in Wikipedia for exactly the same reasons. Modify the article if necessary, but I have voted to keep it. -Tyson2k</p>

<dd>The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Toronto_Area_aadf.html" title="Greater Toronto Area">Greater Toronto Area</a> is not a census division. It's actually a combo of the CMA and the regions surrounding Toronto. It doesn't even exist as a legal entity, and is rather used as a rough reference to the areas surrounding Toronto by various businesses, tourist groups and chambers of commerce. The whole debate here is the fact that Alberta's "Census Divisions" exist for no reason beyond book-keeping purposes. In Ontario and British Columbia, the census divisons also follow legal municipal boundries, and have a cultural link to the community. Sorry Earl, but writing an article is not going to suddenly make "District 6" a part of the Calgary culture. <a href="../../../s/n/i/User%7ESnickerdo_538d.html" title="User:Snickerdo">Snickerdo</a> 19:30, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The GTA is a lot like the CRP. Agreed... it is not a legal division. I don't believe I ever made that case. However, Div. 6 DOES follow legal municipal boundaries like true census divisions in Ontario and BC do. Why do you think they don't? Look at the northern boundary of the municipality of Rockeyview and Div.6.... they are THE SAME. Furthermore, I would say that there is very little cultural similarity between communities in the GVRD (not unlike Div. 6). I have lived in both Calgary and Vancouver and can tell you that CULTURALLY Aldergrove is no more like Vancouver than Airdrie is like Calgary. The way of life, the ethnic/racial composition, and the socioeconomics of the cities of the GVRD are very different. I am not going to list off stats, but there is plenty of information at StatsCan if you need a source. -Tyson2k
<dl>
<dd>You totally missed my point. The individual census divisions of Ontario are actual legal entities onto themselves. Even the Greater Vancouver Regional District is exactly that - it is a regional municipality, and even has an upper-tier government. What government does District 6 have? Is there a 'District 6 Health and Welfare Department'&#160;? Is there a 'District 6 Regional Police Service'&#160;? District 6 has ZERO impact on anyone in the area, nadda, zip. GRVD and the various Regions and Counties, however, play a significant impact on a BC and Ontarian's day-to-day lives. Hell, I live off of Niagara Regional Road 83. Could you please show me where Alberta Census Division Number 6 Road 83 is? It's a census article, nothing more. <a href="../../../s/n/i/User%7ESnickerdo_538d.html" title="User:Snickerdo">Snickerdo</a> 01:47, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Internal political divisions in eastern Canada operate completely differentely than those in western Canada. The same is true for counties and municipalities in the west. They have very little political or legal power. No division in western Canada greater than that of the municipality has its own police force for example. BC's system is identical to Alberta's. The GVRD does operate a parks network and a transit system, but only by virtue of the fact that it has been incorporated and follows the StatsCan-determined boundaries of Greater Vancouver (it is the same situation that would arise if the boundaries of the CRP or the Calgary CMA were to correspond exactly to that of Div. 6, which they don't). You will not find the same in the BC division of the Caribou Regional District for instance. And the same is true everywhere in western Canada whereby provinces are governed almost exclusively by the provincial government without internal divisions. What do governance and political structure have to with whether or not this article should be kept anyway? Police forces, transit systems, etc, are a direct reflection of an area's government or lack thereof. Boundaries and divisions are no less valid in their absence. The boundaries of Div. 6 correspond exactly to the <i>legal</i> boundaries of the municipalities contained within it. Thus, it is a legitimate division which happens to be one unit of magnitude larger than the municipality and one unit smaller than the province itself... just like the GVRD. -Tyson2k</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> as long it's kept up-to-date. A map showing the names of the member municipalities would make the article quite useful. It's impractical to fit the names and borders of every community on a provincial map, but might be possible on a Division map. It lets people learn about Alberta, one piece at a time. Ideally people should be start at the Alberta page, work (drill) down to the division level (with a map showing each), then go down to an individual municipality. Divisions give a nice middle step, even with no legal signficance. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 09:39, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Every time I reread this article it gets worse. The title is completely misleading, as it suggests that the article is going to contain a discussion of actual problems that are soluble, or at least open to intricate philosophical debate, with reference to a particular set of faith assumptions (like, for example, the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Problem_of_evil.html" title="Problem of evil">problem of evil</a>). That's not at all what this article is. It would more appropriately be titled Flaws with religious belief or Reasons that religion is incompatible with society's now fully evolved rationality-based belief system—and to state that is to realize that the topic is inherently POV and therefore unencyclopedic. I think Colby and Peter Ellis are overly optimistic in their assessment of the salvageability of this article.</dd>
<dd>Oh, and what's with the "topics for further discussion" at the end? When did this become Wikitextbook?</dd>

<li>Also, note that in regards to WarioWare and Camelot RPG, the two games were confirmed by NGCFrance, but did not have an announcement from Nintendo or Camelot.

<li>Also, I vote <b>Strong Keep</b>. For one, there is NO SPECULATION IN THE ARTICLE. Hell, there are links on Nintendo Revolution's page confirming each of the games. For another, this article will be expanded upon, so why is it causing problem? If it were a larger list, it wouldn't be a problem. It's not an ideal VfD nomination, because it will, no doubt, be a noteworthy article. It wastes no bandwith because it is small, and when it begins to waste bandwith, it will be notable enough to warrant a place. There is no Crystal Ball, Hocus Pocus magic involved in this list; only the words from the horses' mouths. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 04:50, July 16, 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>So, what you're telling me then is if we have this article with these games confirmed and at an early development, they will forever be there. Wikipedia is written on the internet, not stone tablets. We don't need to wait until it becomes impossible for the games to be cancelled. As of now, there's little reason to believe they'll be cancelled, and even then, if they're cancelled, <b>change it</b>. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 06:16, July 16, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And yet this page still breaks the rule of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Most of the games listed are all "Untitled" and <b>all of them</b> are already listed at <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_Revolution_dcb8.html" title="Nintendo Revolution">Nintendo Revolution</a>. There is no point to this article. It should be deleted and recreated at a later time (in the correct name) when a proper list can actually be made. Please read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, it is policy. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 06:35, July 16, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is what they are. If you say they don't exist, then you'd be a liar. They are in development, that is not even arguable. And if this applies to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, then Twilight Princess does. AND, I fail to see the reasoning in deleting a harmless article that will return at a later date. There is no speculation on if these games exist, since they are confirmed by people with the authority to confirm it, so they are Revolution games. We should assume they're coming, like we do with Twilight Princess, Super Mario Strikers and Katamari Damacy DS. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 06:44, July 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And on another note, if you're arguing this, then I dare you to go to each and every page for an unreleased game (like, Twilight Princess), and delete any mention of a release date. You're assuming that these games won't come out just because we haven't seen pictures, so logically, you must assume that game won't come out, right? -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 06:19, July 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Upon further consideration, I'm changing my vote to <b>Keep</b>. While I would greatly prefer that game lists of this type distinguished between released games and upcoming games, that it not how they work. Given that, my biggest problem with the list is probably that the games on it don't actually have titles, and it seems to me like that's not a very good reason to vote to delete. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKairos_73c0.html" title="User:Kairos">Kairos</a> 20:36, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>These are all the remaining 9/11 casualties I could find who haven't yet had their articles transwikied to the <a href="http://sep11.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Memoriam" class="extiw" title="sep11:In_Memoriam">September 11 memorial wiki</a> (which was set up a long time ago for the hosting of these pages, and to which nearly all articles like this have been moved), and who didn't appear to be notable in a way that would merit their inclusion in the main part of the encyclopedia (I was quite conservative about this and decided not to VfD many borderline cases).

I'm not sure how much there is to say about them of real encyclopedic value that wouldn't actually fit better in that article, since their role that day relates to the story of the flight, instead of having it in two biographical spin-offs with personal padding. If Ogonowski's farming side of things is encyclopedic enough then he would be independently notable and deserve an article, but I would tend to think of the actions of the two flight attentdants as making them worthy of note as part of the story of 9/11, not in their own seperate articles. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 09:13, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment: The article now begins... <i>Ecologics ([Ikologiks])is defined as a cumulative-progressive system (science) of philosophical thought or study into universal phenomenlogical knowledge; within the context of integrated dialectical, metaphysical, revolutionary transformational praxis.(Davis, 1977,1999).</i>. I don't think this has any meaning. Certainly it is incompatible with <i>Ecologics is a research term used to describe a field of study or theory that is an extension of the academic discipline known as Human Ecology.</i>. A term cannot be "is" something other than its definition. Still delete, sorry. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M.

<li><b>Provisional Keep</b> - This document is awkward. It seems to be either a very talented piece of historical research or a remarkable fraud. In the spirit of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good faith</a>, I am going to assume the former. Google seems to verify the existence of many of the key terms (Ikologiks), organizations (Cornell College of Human Ecology, Eco.Logic Powerhouse) and people (Adisa Maina Omar). However, my use of google is not able to establish certain other entities or the connections between them. For example, I have not been able to connect any "Roger M. Davis" to either Adisa Omar, Cornell, or Ecologics. Key facts of this type clearly need citations. At the very least, I would feel a lot better about this work if the author would provide full references for some of Davis' ecologic work. Also, it seems that the term "ecologics" existed at least in 1971 when Libbie Agran &amp; Bobbie Gilbert wrote a book by that title. Of course, it is not clear whether they were refering to the same concept as this article. In response to the original research comments, I would observe that most of this article is presented as a collection of facts. As such, it should be possible to document these issues in sufficient detail to avoid the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> prohibition. Assumming the author is willing to start filling in the citation details (and s/he seems to have expressed a willingness to do this) then I support the existence of this article. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 08:02, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Adisaji, here is a copy of the citation information from my university's online catalog. Frankly it reads rather strangely, since the "publisher" is given as "Los Angeles". I wonder if this was someone's thesis, or something like that.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> pseudointellectual claptrap. Even direct citations have spelling and grammatical errors, which leads me to believe this is a hoax. Also, as a professor of philosophy who has read much in the vein of environmental ethics and metaphyics, this is (a) like nothing I've ever seen published and (b) too religious to be analytical as the article implies. It would be a disservice to readers to maintain this article. As far as the author below claiming that he will provide "copies of news articles and clippings," I find this claim dubious because he expects prompting, rather than freely presenting the information in the first place.

<li>I addressed the issue at hand, and I hope that rather than attacking me, you or any supporter of this article also address the issue at hand, perhaps by providing citations. If you would like an extended academic critique of this article, I am prepared to give one. Feel free to report me yourself. As for my reference to <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dianetics.html" title="Dianetics">Dianetics</a>, I am pointing out an article which deals with a controversial subject, points out that the subject is controversial, and provides citations which prove the subject isn't so much hot air.

<dd>Your tone is still belligerant -- for the record I NEVER attacked you. I just replied to your bias and responded to your offensive language and non-verification of your academic qualifications. I don't want to waste more time with "negativity-bickering" so like you said I'll make the corrections and you can vote the way you want. Dianetics and Scientologist (Tom Cruise, John Travota, etc.) may be bogus or "kooks" in your opinion, but some had that same feeling about other movements like Mormans, Hare Krishnas, SevenDay Adventist or those that once said the world was round when the common thinking was the world is flat (middle ages). We may disagree with their ideas but that doesn't mean wikipedia should not list them. I suggest opinions remain just that and pure objective scientific review not be based on cultural,racial or intellectual bias. That should be the golden rule at wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdisaji_5e6e.html" title="User:Adisaji">Adisaji</a> 04:44, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>you DO NOT CITE, where you received your degrees in Philosophy</i> reads like an attack to me.

<li>To User:William Connolley, when someone uses language like "hoax" "dubious" and "pseudointellectual claptrap" I TAKE THAT VERY PERSONALLY AND AS AN INSULT ABOUT MY INTEGRITY AND HONESTY. Had he simply referenced the article that would be acceptable, but he personally attacked my sincerity, honesty, integrity. I had every right to question his "academic credentials" when he used them in a paternalistic/condesending fashion and as a basis for discrediting my submission and essentially calling me a liar.

Also, feel free to see his user talk page where I have provided him a list of revisions he could make to meet "my" and Wikipedia's standards. Two citations, relation to current literature, and a revision of the article's definition (which at this point is nearly the same definition for <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecology.html" title="Ecology">ecology</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biology</a>) doesn't seem too much to ask (Since if this is provided, I could do the grammatical/spelling revisions as penance).

<p>Note from page author:</p>
<p>Talk:Ecologics From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. ECOLOGICS</p>
<p>I am responding to those citing the submission for "deletion" on ECOLOGICS. I spent a lot of time preparing and researching this submission. Yes, it has historical relevance and I am prepared to offer copies of news articles and clippings that would substantiate this claim.</p>
<p>I think it is unfair and unreasonable to delete an article submission just because the reader has NO KNOWLEDGE of the subject. If you don't have knowledge about this topic then you should not comment. I would appreciate any serious contributions and help in editing this material since I am brand new to the Wikipedia community.</p>
<p>I really think this online source is important specifically because minor topics or information often ommitted in commercial dictionaries or encyclopedias can be now be viewed by researchers.</p>
<p>Thank you. Adisaji</p>

<p>I really found the assistance of <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">EvilPhoenix</a> very helpful and supportive. The "comment" by <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> seems well-founded. I am trying to locate the actual article by N. Hare so I can determine whether the term "black ecology" was used in a generic sense in the journal article or as an actual introduction of a new english word/term. It is possible that both N. Hare and R. Davis both began to popularize the term. For example, the 1960s black activist Stokely Carmichael is largely viewed to have introduced the term 'Black Power.' However, the term 'Black Capitalism' is accredited to former President Richard Nixon, and there is some indication he (Nixon) might have also introduced the term 'black power' preceding Carmichael (see book "Star Spangled Hustle" -- I'll cite detailed references later). I have located several scanned copies from the following presses: The Washington Post, Bronx Press Review, Our Daily Planet, NY Daily News and Cornell Daily Sun which all pertain to the material in the article -- Ecologics. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW I CAN UPLOAD THIS IMAGES, so interested parties can review them and assist in the ongoing discussion. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> Your comments were I believe a violation of the very Wikipedia policies you accused me of violating. It seems you just want to emotionally dismiss the submission -- for the record, I did not attack an editor. I'm trying very hard to be polite and scholarly.</p>
<p><b>(Updated!!!)</b> <s>I think at this point ... maybe the article should just be DELETED. I'm feeling so pressured to revise this article before your "five day review" deadline. The nature of this research for acquiring citations will take time, since the material is not easily recoverable and deals with material over thirty years ago. This was well before the digital age and internet age -- so most citations will have to be manually researched at the libraries -- not Internet. Before, I take time and money to do that (often to get archived reprints from journals or newspapers cost money) PLEASE MAKE THE DECISION TO DELETE OR NOT DELETE.</s> --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdisaji_5e6e.html" title="User:Adisaji">Adisaji</a> 01:39, 22 July 2005 (UTC) I will revise the submission as needed "as a work in progress" in good faith if I can just have some patience from all you editors and respondents.

Part of the reason people objected to the suggestion that it was original research last time around was that there are three interwiki links, though people didn't seem to appreciate that it's possible to create articles worthy of deletion in multiple languages. The French and Spanish versions of the article are extensive but have unanswered questions about such things as just how significant this language is on their talk pages.

Let's say I write an article on Origami chocolate and manage to convince just enough people its a real thing so that it just barely misses consensus to delete. It looks like that vote was a fluke and it will be deleted when it comes up for a vote again. So I nominate it in 3 months, and it again evades deletion because "it's last vote was not 4 months ago". Now it has another 4 month reprieve. Again in 3 months I nominate it, etc. This process goes on forever, and my travesty of an article on chocolate origami stays in Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:17, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

I understand and appreciate the above comments concerning consensus, ie: it is possible to abuse our system by repeatedly placing an article on VFD. However, this isn't about the VFD process, it is about what Wikipedia is all about. The issues regarding <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> are at the core of our ability to maintain a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, ie: to give <b>undue coverage</b> to a language virtually no one has heard of is to allow Wikipedia to be used as an <b>advertising platform</b>. I think the Wikipedian who wrote the original article was perfectly aware that by placing <b>his creation</b> on Wikipedia, it would be copied to dozens of mirrors, floating lists of conlangs, etc. We are not here to <b>establish</b> the notability of the things we write articles on: they have to <b>already be established</b>. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func"><tt>func</tt></a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func"><tt>(talk)</tt></a> 16:15, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It defaulted to keep last time after no consensus based largely on some flimsy claims. Several people voted to keep because it has interwiki links... well, the Spanish version (the only other one I can read) is longer, but it too fails to address any claims this language has to relevance outside the personal dabblings of its creator. It's not surprising that a conlang has interwiki links; conlangers are likely to be also speakers of several natural languages. This is not like the repeated GNAA VfD, which received a good deal of attention and roughly 100 votes and still arrived at no consensus; this got comparatively little attention, and many outstanding concerns from last time were not addressed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the 6 Keep votes last time, three were based on its having interwiki links. One makes the claim that "conlangs are a special case", not backing it up with any reasoning. One is from an anonymous user claiming that it is a "well-recognized auxlang name"; when challenged, produced a Wikipedia mirror as more evidence of its existence. The last claimed it was a userful article even if the subject was not widely known -- taking the position that all original research should stay if the articles are good?</p>
<p>I don't care about Comunleng; I just want to make the case that the renomination is not out of process (and yes, I will kick the <a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EASS_3337.html" title="WP:ASS">WP:ASS</a> of anyone who renominates GNAA anytime soon), and that the previous default keep should not be a reason to dismiss this nomination entirely.

<dd>I don't think anyone is making the case that <i>in general</i>, "no consensus" results are errors to be corrected, and I agree with the default to keep where the community is genuinely split. But sometimes we come to no consensus based on faulty or incomplete information—why shouldn't we be able to correct that within a reasonable timeframe?

<li>I agree in part and should have been clearer - the POV alone is not a reason for deletion, it was a criticism of the article as it stood. However it's an interesting question how to replace the POV with verifiable neutral information when the subject is inherently unverifiable, being apparently someone's unpublicized and undiscussed (let alone analyzed) invention. My personal view (irrelevant to this discussion) is that a conlang is inherently more interesting than lots of other kinds of thought experiments, but until the language achieves notability by being known to somebody besides its creator, this isn't the right place to publicize it. -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 02:49, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Would you really want an article reading "poop" to stay in wikipedia for 4 months based on a stupid principle? You must not care much for the contents of wikipedia then. I'm sorry but sometimes votes are skewed by incomplete information, and when new information is brought to light it makes sense to readdress the issue. Three months is a very long time. Now, assuming this is kept because people are voting purely on the previous vote not on <i>the actual article</i>, would we have to wait 3 months from its original nomination or three months from this one?

<li>My common sense tells me that it is <i>so much better</i> to let one stupid article (that no one but the author will ever look up) live here with a "totally disputed" tag for a month and half, than to establish a precedent that articles can be reopened on Vfd sooner.

Since the Wikipedia solution seems to be to add to CSDs to reduce volume, I could also imagine such an upsurge contributing ultimately to more bureaucracy. Normally, VfD's are very accurate at screening out crap, but when they fail, better to abide with them, then to propose other solutions which either increase the risk of VfD expansion, or cause the proliferation of regulation, or both. An extra 90 days for a stupid article is simply not damaging enough to merit unbalancing the VfD process. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 03:16, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Referencing the English wikiarticle for the Spanish one was as much an inappropriate citation as referencing the Spanish article here is. The difference between self-referencing in an article and referencing another wikiarticle is nil: both are unverified recursion, and may as well be original research. It's no different than citing a mirror of this article. Only sources that are completely independent from any form of wikipedia whatsoever should be regarded as eligible for being considered valid; I would think that would be obvious enough that it shouldn't need a policy dictating it, though I would be glad to propose such a policy if there isn't one. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 15:32, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There appears to be no argument regarding this article's merit for inclusion. The only open point is what the appropiate process for <i>inconclusive</i> VfDs is. In the absence of affirmative arguments about merit, I suggest we don't need anything further about its obvious crapitude.</li>
<li><b>All</b> of the keep votes are based upon concerns about abuse of VfD. The mosr recent GNAA nomination was in fact about <i>respect</i> for the process, about insuring that the standards were maintained. In <i>this</i> instance there was no irregularity, just disagreement. If <i>even half</i> of the people who voted keep before come back and vote keep here, we're again at no consesus.

<li>In light of point one, though, I wonder why the process matters. I.E., in the absence of affirmative arguments, does that not obligate us to repeat the deletion process until such time as an affirmative argument about merit is produced or the article is successfully deleted? Whether we wait 4 weeks between nominations, 4 months, or 4 years, all of the first bullet will remain true in the absence of affirmative arguments or changes to the article's content that meet, for instance, the requirements set forth by <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func">func</a> - which would constitute an affirmative argument for keeping it. What makes a 4 week interval disrespectful or abusive of the VFD process, but not a lengthier one? An article that is infused with "obvious craptitude" has obvious craptitude, regardless of the time at which it is discussed, the number of edits between nominations, or any other consideration not related to the content of the article and the standards for an acceptable article. I believe voting to keep or delete an article based on the results and date of a previous VFD is what constitutes abuse of the VFD process. The process exists to judge the article's content in its present form and, if the present form is unacceptable for Wikipedia, to determine the proper remedy: merge, redirect, delete, move. Either this article is or is not acceptable; if a user judges it unacceptable but votes keep, that is abuse. If a user judges it acceptable but votes delete, that is abuse. If a user judges it unacceptable and in light of that nominates it for deletion, as <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> has, that's proper use of the process.</li>

<li>I must object most strenuously to one user thinking he can hold the VfD to ransom. If you want something done around here on the Wiki, do it yourself. Don't go demanding that other users do it for you. Your vote is no more (and no less) important to the process than anyone else's. If you want to vote keep because of the reasons you give above, that's fine, but don't go <i>demanding</i> that the rest of us do things to placate you. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 02:50, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>And, you seem to think there is some lack of clarity over inconclusive VfDs. There's not: they are kept unless there is a "rough consensus" to delete. Then, they can be renominated anytime someone feels like it. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 02:52, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Held to ransom? Did my vote somehow become <i><b>really important</b></i> and I wasn't notified? Stating conditions upon which you'll change your vote is almost standard practice: I'll vote "keep" if (this article is expanded <i>or</i> the other one is deleted <i>or</i> its notability is proven to me). Look closely that last one. Isn't that, to use your word, "demanding", that others commit some action to "placate"? I'm also puzzled by your repeated misinterpretations. I state I think "we should wait four mounths between VfD nominations", your response is about "locks on editing articles". I raise "how long is appropiate between nominations", your response adresses " no consensus means keep". I'm left with several possibilities: Either you aren't reading my comments before you respond, you are failing to understand my intent (which could be my fault), or you are being deliberate. This questions was raised when <s>Trilobite</s> func first stated he was going to re-nominate (see Eventually Back to VfD) so it should some as no suprise now. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 04:32, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Voting delete-unless-made-better is quite different. It (in my case, anyway) usually means that I don't think the article <i>can</i> be made into a keepable one, but I am not sufficiently knowledgeable of the area to verify this fact to my own satisfaction. I mean to encourage others to help out who know where to look for information. Your condition here, however, has nothing at all to do with content and is something you <i>could</i> just go and do and yourself rather than expecting that others will do it for you just because you say so. As for my <i>"no consensus means keep"</i> response, this was because you said <i>"The only open point is what the appropiate process for</i> inconclusive <i>VfDs is"</i>, and the appropriate process is keep. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 16:09, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm starting to doubt my ability to form english-like sentences. If it were <i>not</i> the default that a VfD without strong consensus was a de-facto keep, we wouldn't be having this discussion now, would we? From the context of this discussion, a reasonable person would read that sentence as <i>"The only open point is what the appropiate [time until renomination] process for</i> inconclusive <i>VfDs is"</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> It seems that to me that Wikipedia's rules state that if there is no consensus, the default is to keep the article.

<li>Brenneman, I answer your four questions in this way:</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>1. Closely re-nominating inconclusive votes for consensus (which does not apply in this case, as the month's time passed does not constitute "closely following") improves perception of the process by allowing the process to do what it exists to do: efficiently dispose of articles that do not belong on wikipedia through an appropriate method, of which deletion, merging, renaming, and redirecting without merger are common choices. It ensures that the appropriate keeping of inconclusive articles is kept as a temporary measure, and forces debate to continue until it is resolved in consensus - either clear consensus to keep or to delete. Indeed, I believe that policy should <i>require</i> renomination of any inconclusive VFD after no later than two to three weeks.</dd>
<dd>2. The possible follow-on effects are desirable, as more inconclusive VFDs may be revisted. Furthermore, we are setting valuable precedent that inconclusive VFDs, rendered inconclusive due to keep arguments that are quickly shown to be factually false or otherwise faulty (accurate descriptors, I believe, for all the "keep" votes in the original Comunleng VFD) are no different from consensus-to-keep VFDs that are subsequently shown to have been kept on false premises. Finally, we are establishing that articles are to be voted on due to judgement of their content alone, and not due to procedural matters that have no place, I believe, in VFD discussion. I repeat and clarify what I said earlier: to vote keep for this or any other article, for any reason at all, if you believe it does not meet such criteria as verifiability required, no original research allowed, no advertising allowed, or encyclopedic nature required, is a worse abuse of VFD than any renomination could ever be.</dd>
<dd>3. What other options are there? This is an unsalvagable article. It is vanity about a conlang so unnotable that it is unverifiable to the point of being indistinguishable, in my mind, from a hoax. Three or four reasons all of which the deletion policy defines as grounds for deletion. I can't find anything in this article that belongs on wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>4. As I see it, as a VFD can be closed after 5 days, then by the same reasoning that 5 days is sufficient time for consensus to be reached and edits that would change an article's status from Deletion Required to Keepworthy to be made, 5 days is sufficient time for new edits to be made prior to a revisiting. I believe inconclusive VFDs are more often inconclusive because of faulty reasoning one way or the other than because the article's contents do not lend themselves to consensus; 5 days allows enough time for those articles whose contents do require some clarification to be edited enough to tip the discussion in the appropriate direction.</dd>
<dd>Every article and every topic has a fundamental essence. That essence is either Deletion Required or Keepworthy. It is the purpose of VFD to discover that essence with maximum efficiency. If its essence is Deletion Required, our duty as editors is to eradicate the offending article. If its essence is Keepworthy, our duty as editors is to edit and reshape the article until it is someday transmuted to Ideal. Yes, I'm being foolishly metaphysical, but I believe it is wholly inappropriate to allow inconclusive VFDs to stand. They <i>need</i> to be renominated. And in this case, it <i>needs</i> to be deleted, and it did not "pass" anything. Discussion was closed too soon, and the original "keep" votes were never legitimate to begin with. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 03:43, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: It seems to me that making a redirect sort of endorses this as a variant spelling. Common misspellings are fine, but someone finding "Meanderthal" leading here would probably cause confusion, just as Kozart redirecting to Mozart would. Also, apparently this does have a "real" meaning, it just happens to be a neologism and therefore unsuitable for Wikipedia. Someone looking up that neologism would be better served finding no result than this one. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:10, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Indeed it is, it's some sort of article about ships. Title is compeltely misleading, so I'm thinking it's some sort of silly joke.

<p>Term: Munted is used within New Zealand culture. To describe the destruction of a car or other comparible object. I believe this is a case of double meaning. Where one word is good in one culture and highly insultive to the next, aka Culture Clash. It shouldn't be deleted but noted down as a offensive word in some cutures and the cultures the meanings belong to, be applied. T94xr 29th July 2005 - New Zealand.</p>

<li>Comment: About the only part of the article that one can't get from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_beers.html" title="List of beers">list of beers</a> (perhaps clicking on the Thai beers mentioned there) is "due to import restrictions a number of locally brewed Thai beers, sometimes brewed in partnership with western brewers, have sprung up in recent years." (That most Thai beer is lager is not significant; most beer is lager just about anywhwere.) That single sentence, if substantiated, doesn't really warrant its own article, and can be mentioned elsewhere. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:34, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>So should we mention in every article about some sort of beer that "lager is the most popular form of beer", and other basic facts about beer: standard ABV is around 3 - 6%; it's made from water, malt, hops, and yeast; etc.? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:45, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>If lager is the most popular form of beer in a particular country, that needs to be mentioned, unless you think lager is the most popular form of beer in every country, and that wikipedia readers can all be assumed to know that. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 19:17, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is an article on a particular type of financial services web site and the internet company that started them in the UK, not what could be strictly defined as an advert. If Wiki policy was to remove all references and external links to any money making business in case they are seen as an advert, then Walmart, Disney, and thousands of other pages, should also be removed, which I don't feel would allow wikipedia to continue presenting itself as a useful source of encyclopaedic information.--Bod 13:45, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I appreciate the effort you put into the rewrite, but while the <i>presentation</i> may be substantially improved, I still think the <i>topic</i> is just not encyclopedia material.

<li>I dont follow. You disagree with this topic (could be called Etiquette of an Office), but agree with another exactly parallel article <a href="../../../e/t/i/Etiquette_of_Japan_4c54.html" title="Etiquette of Japan">Etiquette of Japan</a>? Please explain why one falls on one side of a line and the other does not - in Topic terms, not content terms. We need to be consistant in this matter, so all articles in the Etiquette category need to need to be deleted or not (excluding the meta article <a href="../../../e/t/i/Wikipedia%7EEtiquette_76f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Etiquette">Wikiquette</a>). Can we create a VfD for All distinct Etiquette articles and hash this out there instead? <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavedave_48c1.html" title="User:Ravedave">Ravedave</a> 19:31, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<li>The articles I cited contrast cultures around the world. I find that interesting (obviously, there's a lot of subjectivity here). Etiquette in the office seems rather banal to me. Perhaps if I were Japanese I would find the Japan article banal as well. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 19:43, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Let's see. First, strip out the how-to (Wikipedia is not a finishing school). Next, strip out the unverifiable information (e.g., snapping at someone is considered inappropriate in some parts of the US). Next, strip out the non-encyclopedic gas and filler (customs vary by region). And we're left with ... a dicdef!

<li><b>Keep</b> - Office culture is vast and varies greatly, its a deep topic with alot of factual evidence to potentially make this a very insightful article, it's encyclopedic.

<ul>
<li>Source? This is ridiculous, you walk into any office and be relentlessly moody and see what happens.. snapping at someone being considered not good etiquette shouldn't need any linkage or a source provided, what could possibly be linked to anyway? Maybe there is some obscure thesis out there or research on how lashing out at others all the time is not considered polite, but you've got to be kidding me if I have to provide it.. having said that, by the same token I don't see it as a very informative thing to be put in an article, its a bit.. obvious?

<p>And basically every other article in the Category:2005 English cricket season matches, which is hundreds of articles. Wikiepdia is not: any spiel that comes out of the mouth of Bob Costas (or whoever his British equivalent is). I think several hundred thousand cricket games have been played in the world (multiply that times the number of sports out there) and we've got millions of poor articles, written in a completley unencyclopedic manner, that made the Tuesday paper and were lining parrot cages on Wednesday. Important games should have their own artciles, but these aren't them. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 15:37, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Transwiki</b> this and all other articles on recent individual cricket matches to Wikinews; failing that, do a proper merge</s>. <b>Abstain</b>. (I was unaware of the temporary nature of these pages.) These are not encyclopedia articles. They are news reports. I don't know how many cricket matches there are per year, but <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLB_d3e5.html" title="MLB">MLB</a> plays 2,430 regular-season games. Articles on the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a> and national cricket championships belong in an encyclopedia; articles on individual games do not, unless there's something particularly interesting about them. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 16:01, July 15, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The articles cannot be merged because they are being transluded in multiple articles. Merging them into those articles would result in duplicate content and would be a maintenance nightmare. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 16:06, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see that now.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Note also that the "national cricket championship matches" - akin to the baseball World Series - that Android79 speaks of, do not exist in England - instead, the regular season tables determine who becomes champion. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 16:09, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then why not summarize the season as a whole? No doubt plenty of dead tree is used in England to describe the progress of the season as a whole and of individual teams during the season. This can be done without describing every match in excessive detail. I'm not very familiar with how Wikinews works, but it looks like there's <i>nothing</i> being added about cricket in England. This sort of content would be perfect there. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 17:03, July 15, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is correct, and it is exactly what we are doing - in a format very similar to what dead tree is used for in <i><a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisden_Cricketers%27_Almanack_6214.html" title="Wisden Cricketers' Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a></i>, a yearly dead tree publication in England (yes, it DOES describe every match in excessive detail).

<li>Unfortunately, it seems the other VfD came when I was out of town, and while I try to keep up with older VfDs I do miss some (particularly as VfD is so huge, a reason why I support several new speedy proposals). It seems that the main defense of these "articles" is that they are not to be their own pages but "sub-pages". What exactly is the difference? There's a "/" in the middle of the name? They still come up in Random page searches, they have all the characteristics of "real" pages, but with longer names. As someone pointed out recently <a href="../../../a/c/2F/AC_DC_2284.html" title="AC/DC">AC/DC</a> is not a subpage of <a href="../../../a/c/_/AC_4144.html" title="AC">AC</a>. That excuse is a cop-out. Are we going to see Giants vs. Brewers April 17, 1967? "Anderson hits it toward the rightfield wall, its going...going... it's good! Out of the park! The crowd is on their feet, Higgins and Maloney are brought home and this game is <i>far</i> from over!" (OK, I made all that up; I know very little about baseball, particularly from the 60's). -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:33, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The main defence is that they're part of bigger articles on the entire season - and because each match is relevant to several articles, (in this case: <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_English_cricket_season_%2815-31_May%29_629a.html" title="2005 English cricket season (15-31 May)">2005 English cricket season (15-31 May)</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex_County_Cricket_Club_in_2005_4f3a.html" title="Essex County Cricket Club in 2005">Essex County Cricket Club in 2005</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glamorgan_County_Cricket_Club_in_2005_fb9d.html" title="Glamorgan County Cricket Club in 2005">Glamorgan County Cricket Club in 2005</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_Division_One_in_2005_6027.html" title="National League Division One in 2005">National League Division One in 2005</a>. The reason why they have to be in the article namespace is so that the content can be picked up by mirrors such as answers.com <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 16:37, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> or transwiki to wikinews or a wikicities project.

Given the split result (quite a few merge, transwiki, and delete votes) I don't find it very useful as a precedent. I do find setting a precedent for including detailed results of all of the tens of thousands/year of regular season sports meets quite troubling. Last I checked the other two sports-related WikiPortal projects are wisely avoiding this level of granularity. Wikipedia is a <i>general interest encyclopedia</i>, not a <i>cricket</i> (or even sports) <i>almanac</i>. Several people expressed concern about this <b>major expansion</b> of Wikipedia's scope on the Village Pump a month ago<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15178979#Unusual_transclusion_issue_not_covered_by_policy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=15178979#Unusual_transclusion_issue_not_covered_by_policy" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 21:13, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>And the argument you're using against it, that it's too detailed, flies in the face of wikipedia policy, especially <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper#No_size_limits" class="external autonumber" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper#No_size_limits" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 21:54, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I obviously failed to make my point clear. My primary concerns are A) These are news items, not encyclopedia topics, and B) It is a major expansion of the scope of Wikipedia at a time that newpages and recent changes patrol are already overtaxed, so more vandalism and patent nonsense is making it into Wikipedia unchecked, and this expansion just exacerbates the problem. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 22:26, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To A) I'd say that professional sports events have a significance beyond the event itself, and thus should be kept in an encyclopedia, to describe how the season progressed. We are a very detailed encyclopedia, like it or not. Point B) still comes under the No size limits policy. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 22:43, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This article (although sub-article would be a better word) feeds through to four separate articles (see "What links here").

<li>Another question I feel I need to bring up: is anyone going to address the unencyclopedic and generally just plain poor writing style of these articles? My Giants/Brewers parody above was an exaggeration, but not enough of one. And I don't want to hear that that's how "Wisdens" does it. As it stands I think most of this info is terribly trivial. Why not do a season wrap-up with a chart giving the teams, final score, etc? The whole "this is part of a larger article" argument is crap. It's its own article, even if it is made into a "sub-page". -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:18, 17 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Can you grasp the "long term" thing? In the end, these articles will cease to be articles in their own right.

<ul>
<li>Yes, it is. What's the delay? If they're not going to be articles "in their own right" does that mean you will be merging them? Why not now? Why the poor prose? If this is a work in progress and these aren't <i>meant</i> too be articles then why not work on them offline? You seem to be admiting that these are news reports that will somehow become articles (well, not articles, because you just said they won't to be articles in their own right). So what exactly is the deal with them? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:51, 17 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Can you specify exactly why you think this is poor prose? As far as I can see this is a description of how the match unfolded - yes, it includes vivid adjectives, but as far as I can see wikipedia doesn't ban vivid prose, and the article praises those who did well in the match - by perfectly objective criteria, such as scoring runs and getting people out. Merely quoting statistics and results, now THAT is poor prose (in fact, it's not prose at all...). Yes, it's in a newspapery style, but that's not forbidden either (see <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_writing_better_articles_3c0a.html#News_style" title="Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles">Wikipedia:Guide_to_writing_better_articles#News_style</a>). The only thing it possibly lacks is an introduction to the subject it treats - I can understand that. However, that is because the pages onto which it is transcluded (meaning that the entire content of the page is included) give an introduction to the topic already - it becomes obvious from the context of the page it is on. Reading "This was a game of cricket played in the National League in 2005" in every single section of <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_Division_Two_in_2005_39d1.html" title="National League Division Two in 2005">National League Division Two in 2005</a> gets, believe it or not, tedious.

<li>While I am no fan of the articles on individual episodes pf TV shows, there is a major difference in that these shows are often referenced and viewed multiple times. They are re-run. Many are available on DVD. This is not true of these sporting events (truly importnat games, such as finals, world cup, world series, etc. are the exception, and not included in this VfD). Ther is also a <i>huge</i> differenc in sheer numbers. A typical season for a TV series is about 25 shows.

<li>Um, who described that scenario? Smoddy sort of haphazardly mentioned something sort of like that, but has declined to go into the specifics. Everyone else seems to be defending these articles as "part of bigger articles on the entire season", which seems to mean they are detailed breakouts, with no scheduled deletion at the season's end. If I'm wrong here someone please correct me. There's been some talk of moving these to "sub-pages", but such subpages are still separate articles. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:40, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's the assumption the editors of these pages, me incldued, have been working on for most of the time - sorry for not making that explicit enough. When the season is over near the end of September, we'll do a rewrite and copyedit of all the articles on the season, and then use "subst" or something to remove the transclusion, which will make this article content fairly redundant, so it can be deleted. But I suppose that isn't good enough either? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 20:53, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I completely resent that allegation. When did you <i>ask</i> for specifics? If you had wanted them, I would have given them. I also fail to see how it was haphazard.

Your reply responded to a different question, which this talk of "cleanup" and "rewrites" has done something to address and put me a bit more at ease.

<li>Firstly, I am not Sam Vimes (unless I am bilocating in South <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a> and Norway...). Secondly, I didn't see that. The options are
<ol>
<li>Have absolutely nothing in the main article namespace until well after the end of the season. This is possible, but undesirable, because we can have something now.</li>
<li>Do what we're doing: have slightly odd articles until the end of the season, then quickly merge them into good, coherent articles. That will happen in the fullness of time.</li>

<li>Basically, I think this whole ugly affair comes down to a failure of communication of intent. Perhaps this should have been better-documented. But, as it is, it hasn't been.

<li>Sorry about confusing you with Sam; this discussion is getting rather complicated. I think this discussion sort of boils down to a question of "temporary articles". As far as I can tell, no such thing exists in WP policy, and this is the first I have heard of it.

<li>I'd suggest putting a boilerplate notice of some kind on each of the subpages' talk pages; there's at least a chance that those would get noticed. Now that I know what these articles are being used for now and that they're only temporary, I have changed my mind. I still think they would be better off on Wikinews, or at least in User space, but I can see that argument is going nowhere. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 23:11, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>

Our intention is to rework each of these summary articles at the end of the season so that each forms a 'season review' targeted to the team or competition in question -- this is absolutely encyclopaedic, an innovative use of Wikipedia and something that *no other resource*, either online or in print, provides.

<li>Boredom aside, <b>transwiki</b> to Wikinews or anyway <b>delete</b> from WP, following the arguments of Uncle G in the earlier VfD debate.

<p>I've created a new heading here to make adding comments easier for we who have size limits with our browsers, and to try to open a discussion of temporary articles in general (see my comments above). I had never heard of such a thing before, and I think it warrants some discussion. While I think this is a good place to formulate such a discussion, I think it should soon be brought elsewhere. If I am incorrect and there is a policy or precedent for temporary articles, please point me in the right direction.

<dd>Almost all things in WP are done without there being an explicit policy saying you can do it. Really, as long as what is being done is within the aim of improving and/or adding to the encyclopaedia, it should be encouraged. New ideas, methods, approaches will be developed as we progress. Whilst they should accord to the normal WP style, we'd be fools to ourselves to prevent them on the grounds that as nobody has thought of it before, there is no explicit "policy" saying you can do it!

<dd>I think it's a bad idea to have temporary article snippets in the main article namespace. There are ample policies and precedents that describe what a wikipedia article should be--temporary article snippets that do not meet these criteria and that never will themselves be expanded to legitimate artices have no business being in the namespace, even temporarily. Anything else requires a change of policy with a broad consensus--a couple of very obscure VFDs is not enough to justify such big change in what is acceptable as an article. If it's such a wonderful idea, why is there so much resistence to getting a broad consensus for it? (By the way, when these articles are no longer wanted, don't they have to go through the existing, labor-intensive deletion policy, or are snippets exempt from this policy as well?) <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPRiis_d9fa.html" title="User:PRiis">PRiis</a> 19:14, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When you say keep "them" I assume you mean keep redirects, otherwise we're back where we started. As for PRiis's comments, I'm tempted to agree. While I suppose it might not be against policy to have temporary articles, it does seem just sort of, well, strange. It also sort of opens a door that I'm sure can be abused. While I realize wikiepdia itself will always be a work in progress, this creation just to delete seems sort of contrary to wikipedia, in a way. Now, should this discussion be moved to a policy page somewhere, because that's where this is going? I think such a move would also get opinions from a wider perspective outside of this VfD. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:51, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think anyone can accuse the Cricket WikiProject of being bad for Wikipedia - indeed, it has done much good work for Wikipedia - and has many featured articles and featured lists to its credit. The WikiProject can hardly be compared to an instance of a rogue editor, or a newbie not used to WP ways - it would be easy to distinguish circumstances where what is happening here is being used as a precedent where it shouldn't be, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 20:16, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't seen anyone accusing Wikiproject Cricket as being bad for Wikipedia. This VfD is about a somewhat small portion of the project, and this section at the bottom is about temporary articles, which should be seen as a separate issue entirely. This is a new thing, as far as I can tell, and if there's no policy on them there should be, whether the policy is "no temporary articles" or simple rules/guidelines for how they are used. There are issues here. Who decides what articles are temporary? I assume the originator, but since no one "owns" WP articles what happens if a contributor objects to their temporary status? How do we prevent the use of them from being abused, and people from using temporariness as an excuse for poor articles, or ones that are early stages of works-in-progress that are a jumble of cut-and-paste messes from other sources? (I am not accusing Wikiproject Cricket of doing this, but I can see it happening somewhere in Wikipedia.) At the very least there should be a template:temporary for each such article, and there should be discussion among general Wikipedians. Again, that should occur elsewhere, as it is not really a VfD issue. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 06:04, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I haven't seen anyone except smoddy suggest these articles are temporary. If that is true then keep them in the User namespace, the Project Cricket (which I am not challenging) namespace, or anywhere but the main article namespace. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 13:46, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why the concerted and continuous attack? They were subpages to begin with. That was attacked as being not in keeping with page-naming, so they were moved to separate pages. Now the subpages are being VfD'd one by one. When there is no consensus to delete the first, they move on to the next. Now you want them userified? Why the systemic attack on one of the top two sports in the world? Any First Class cricket match is at least as noteworthy as a minor character in a Harry Potter book, or a DS9 episode, and they don't even get VfD'd. Or are you saying that first class cricket matches are less important than minor Pokemon characters? <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 14:03, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> - There aren't special pages for Mortal Kombat's original controversy that created the ESRB in the first place. This is the internet celebrating itself.

<li><b>Create disambiguation page</b> People searching for "hot coffee" will most probably be looking for this article rather than actual "coffee".

However, this article merits separate mention from the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Grand_Theft_Auto%7E_San_Andreas_e6da.html" title="Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a> article because the controversy bears ramifications that extend far beyond the scope of the game itself.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> THIS MADE NATIONAL NEWS AND THE ADEQUACY OF THIS ARTICLE ISN'T EVEN CLOSE TO ANY OF THE SHITTY ARTICLES THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED FOR DELETION</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Votes to delete the article have not generally recommended deleting the content, but merging it to <i>GTA:SA</i> under the "controversies" heading. Deletion pertains mainly to the usefulness of having an article under the name <i>Hot Coffee</i> -- NOT to the validity of the content itself. Many of the votes to keep the article seem to have been made without respect to alternatives to merge the content. The fact is that people will look for this information under <i>GTA:SA</i>, not by searching Wikipedia for <i>Hot Coffee</i>. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 23:25, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Let's fast forward 5 years. It turns out that Pokemon Unleashed has a mature hidden level that people are able to get into. It causes quite a stir, "Like what happened in 2005 to Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas bug known as 'Hot Coffee'". No matter what we do, the link to future events can point to GTA:SA#Hot_Coffee or to Hot_Coffee. People will be able to find the event in either section. So, does one who wants to learn about GTA:SA necessarily want to know about Hot Coffee? Maybe -- so follow a link. Does one who wants to know about Hot Coffee want to know about the rest of GTA:SA? Maybe -- so follow a link. In either case, they're related, but the content and audiences of the two articles are potentially different.Chrysrobyn</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I should remark on the circumstances of this VfD. It's one of several that were tagged on the bogus speedy justification "not notable". Some of them were wrongly speedied, and I have restored those. Also the person who listed this on VfD didn't insert the VfD notice in the article. I have added it now, and whoever closes this discussion should take into account the fact that it wasn't properly tagged until 18th. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 10:16, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This appears to be a "vanity" article about a new software project which is not (yet) notable. The user who wrote the Wikipedia article is the same person who is the author of the project.

<p>I vote against deletion. I get so much out of reading Betsy's Page and think her blog deserves the recognition. -- Crystal</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> It's not a vanity, and Betsy deserves an article because she's well-known and well-regarded amongst the major conservative blogs I frequent, but this article doesn't say anything that doesn't sound like the generic fawnings of a generic fan of a generic blog. Add to that it makes it look like shameless family promotion, when in fact a regular reader should find the associations to be substantive with respect to her commentary. As long as deletion allows someone to subsequently come back and actually write something informative, I say delete until then. -- Chris Culbertson - 04:21, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>PULEEZE... what standards are being applied here? She is not writing about her sex life and her dog... she aggregates information, provides commentary and relevant links, focuses mostly on politcal issues, and does so with a high degree of wit and erudition.

<p>I vote against deletion. Betsy's iconoclastic blog allows me to see what's going on in politics and education in a new, better-informed light. She has a wonderfully independent way of looking at things that brings me back to her blog at least several times a day.

<p>Strong Against Deletion - space is not a problem, so what's wrong with having entries that are relatively minor in import? Like it or not, Betsy's Page is an excellent example of the blog as citizen journalism.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It was very confusing to list all five of these articles together.

<li><b>Delete</b> all. Monkey Day for being a holiday observed by very few; Sorrow and Millikin because even if their comics were notable, it would be sufficient to list their names there; and Feral Calf and Fetus-X for being non-notable. Feral Calf is easy: no Alexa, <a href="http://www.feralcalf.com/offal/all/" class="external text" title="http://www.feralcalf.com/offal/all/" rel="nofollow">11 comics in archive</a>. Fetus-X is tougher because it has a somewhat larger, albeit not huge, archive (it's numbered strangely, so I didn't count exactly how many), and the article does have some outside links/comments. But with Alexa #335,262, I really don't see it. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 01:48, July 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I vote "keep", because I can see that the only reason this article has got a lot of "delete" nominations is because it is about controversial subjects (fetuses, sex, politics) and it is about a controversial comics scripter, who American Christians, Catholics and many similar people do not like.</p>
<p>I am surprised that not more people listed above have the brains to be able to spot this, and instead put down pathetic reasons such as "non-notable" (a really stupid term, by the way, Wiki creators. As are some of your other bureaucratic neologisms.)</p>
<p>If I am researching comics or web comics, I naturally expect there to be extensive articles about anyone of note on the scene, such as Millikin - and his best-known comics. If Wikipedia deletes these entries, Wikipedia. is even stupider than I previously thought it was.</p>

<p>It's inherently POV. Before, at the earliest, 1920, most notable public figures in the U.S. and many other countries expressed white supremacist ideas. The number of white supremacists is so large that any list is going to be limited, which means that we're going to be unfairly singleing out certain people as racist. A related problem is that almost no one these days (not even <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a>) consider themselves white supremacist, so labeling them as such is POV. Finally, it has been suggested that the article be restricted to people notable for their white supremacist beliefs or who are leaders in the white supremacist movement. The problem here is, who decides who is notable for white supremacist beliefs and who isn't? Again, I don't see any way to put the list together that isn't inherently POV.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> if you look at this very VfD page, you'll find a lot of people deciding what is and isn't notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> - simply a list of people who express a certain belief.

<li><b>Keep</b>. As repulsive (or not, depending on one's POV) as this list might be, as BD2412 said, it's a list of people who express a particular belief.

<li><b>Rename</b> to List of modern white supremacists. It seems from this discussion like the historical change in attitudes that the nominator mentioned is going to be an issue; I see a lot of people here using slippery slope arguments, and if there's technically nothing preventing, e.g. Abe Lincoln from being listed due to his many pro-slavery statements, the slippery slope would get ridiculous and the article would just become a free-for-all. However, I think the definition of this list <i>can</i> be pinned down, if limited to a certain timeframe. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 23:24, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> because it's an unmaintainable list. If one believes, as many do, that white supremacy was systematic and inherent in western society before the Civil Rights movement, then practically anybody can go on the list if you can pull up a quote that would justify their inclusion. Yet, to do so would be to apply modern moral standards to historical people, a practice which presents POV problems. There are already problems with, for example, Margaret Sanger, Woodrow Wilson, and Thomas Jefferson appearing on the list, and conceivably it could go on forever: Shakespeare, Jack London, H.L. Mencken, FDR, Lincoln, George Washington, Mark Twain...??? It might be possible to exclude historical figures, which would keep the list limited to people like David Duke who clearly belong. But in practice, is that really going to happen or is the list going to be cluttered up with edit wars by people who insist that their own POV be represented by the inclusion of one historical figure or another that they don't like? Alternatively I would support a name change to "List of notable modern white supremacists". <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaibabsquirrel_3907.html" title="User:Kaibabsquirrel">Kaibabsquirrel</a> 02:43, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I find the notion of "white supremacy" alone to be, more often than not, a laughable mirespresentation of any semblance of racial awareness or interest expressed by any White. Let's face it: supremacists don't really exist anymore, and if they do, Sharon or the powers that be behind the oddly named "Aztlan" movement should be named in similar manner. This list is useless and, what's more, ignorant. The term alone sounds comical, much like the overused term "racism," today a meaningless moniker used to smear any opponent of the prevailing religion of egalitarianism, much like "heretic" was once employed. Some simply do not share the views of the lumbering majority, and the voices of the dissenters amount to just a bit more than "supremacist" ideas, but very valid concerns which should be presented in a fair light.

<li><b>Delete</b> This is actually very racist that Wikipedia calls these people, "White Supremacists". I guess that Jews cannot be "Supremacists", only "Zionists"? What is someone called who acknowledges races are different but doesn't feel "supreme"? Does that definition take on a more sinister tone if you are a European?

I recently added the names of several dead U.S. presidents, along with a few others, to the list to make a point: white supremacy is a pervasive ideology -- and has been, for centuries. We might just as well undertake to make a list of people who are <i>not</i> white supremacists.

<li>I think your entry of Harry Flood Byrd, whomever he happens to be, is a substantial example of why this list is a moot concept. He was a 'racist' and an 'old fart'. I'm not quite sure which applies to declaration of white supremacy out of those two? On one hand, almost all white 'old farts' (pre-1930's) are white supremacists, yet almost all 'racists' would be, by capita, not white as whites are not a majority and racism is a proven facet of the human psyche. So in theory, how can we list 'racists' in a 'white supremacist' list when most racists aren't white?</li>

<dd>The fact ultimately remains, there is not enough underlying definitive quality of product provided by this article, the concept is a loose name-calling / labelling project similar to a nazi death-camp, except in this modern era of 'enlightenment' where we forego our forefathers who worked to put us in a position with so much leasure time that we can damn the entire history of human development as an evil empire, we are instead handing out more than just stars of david to people.</dd>
<dd>We had the 'communist' badge of the post-WWII era, dozens more between, and now we have our current 'terrorist' badge. The question is, where do we draw the line at generic stupidity of attempting to label or catagorise everything into big broad sweeping statements?

<dd>I think you're trippin' a bit, Jachin, though we essentially agree, I think, on this list. No. Racism isn't a come-with kinda thing; it's not, <i>ipso facto</i>, automatically part of being human. That's far too facile; it reads like somone was looking for an excuse. Your argument may pretty much be correct in the case of whites, given the pervasiveness of the ideology of white supremacy -- which has been my experience. It certainly has not been my experience with regard to many peoples of color (though, it seems to me, Asians (of the Far East) rank pretty high on the list of folks with racist tendencies). Be that as it may, there is absolultely no question of Harry Byrd's racism or white spremacist beliefs and policies. And, yes, white supremacy <i>was</i> pervasive in a particular time period -- but it is pervasive, still; it simply has been sublimated to political correctness, its prominence among those in the news pretty much relegated to backroom/backwoods/boardroom/country club conversations, instead of front-page media quotes and explicit public policy agendas. But then -- oops -- there're always the public slips/foot-in-mouth gaffs; the atrocities, like the lynching of James Byrd, that surface from time to time. Again, white supremacy is so pervasive, it might be easier to make a list of who <i>isn't</i> one than who is. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 10:20, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>The problem with restricting to strict criteria, or with trying to keep it to people for whom white supremacism was essential or major or some such is that this is also POV. If you are going to keep people off the list who were clearly, by word and action, white supremacist (like <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodrow_Wilson_eb76.html" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, for example, or <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_Davis_8885.html" title="Jefferson Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>, or <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jefferson_1b17.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Columbus_1595.html" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> or even <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>) then you are going to hugely minimize the extent and power of white supremacy as an ideology. You could make a pretty good case that white supremacism was a central part of the ideology of America for the first couple hundred years of its existence -- it's enshrined in the Constitution, no? The problem isn't that there's a threat of the list being too large and therefore libellous -- the problem is that for the list to be inclusive is impossible, and that a non-inclusive list is hopelessly POV -- both unfair to the people on the list (since their white supremacism is not properly contextualized) and unfair to people of color (since it downplays the power of racism in our culture.) <a href="../../../n/o/a/User%7ENoahB_93fe.html" title="User:NoahB">NoahB</a> 14:50, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You got a point there, but I don't think it's enough reason to give up on what could be a potentially useful list. I think the list should be designed with this usefulness in mind.

If, after a few months or so, this article turns out be nothing but a bait for edit wars, I'd have no problem with deleting it. For now, I have faith in the Wikipedia process of establishing criteria for inclusion (this is what we do constantly, not just for this list).

<li>The thing is that though the band might have existed, but I want you to look at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> to show what we think bands have to meet in order to get articles on here. Better yet, I am going to pull examples to show you on why I placed it here. "Chipmonk is the name of a little-known improv/punk band from Cape May, New Jersey formed in January 2002 by a group of friends composed of bored, 20-somtething, college dropouts and some high school students. While Chipmonk was short-lived (lasting only 3 months), they were quite prolific, producing three self-released albums, consisting of a total of over 90 songs." A local band lasting for three months, self produced records. That does not meet the requirements for notability. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 21:15, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Got it. I didn't know of the notable rule before I started creating the page and since they never released an album I guess that they're not notable (Though you'd be hard-pressed to name another Improv/Punk band from South Jersey with 90+ songs).--Runciblerabbit 21:44, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Mainly, users do not want Wikipedia to be used as launch-pads for advertisements for bands, shows, groups, etc. That was why we have the WP:MUSUC guidelines to set a bench mark on which bands should be included in here or not. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 21:47, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi, I'm the person in question. I did not write the article. My boyfriend did, sweet of him. I would actually have no clue how to figure it out. I am only writing this comment thing right now because he set it up for me. And honestly, I don't really mind whether or not I have a Wikipedia page. It's true that I'm not famous. I have a few poems published and lots of people used to read my blog before it became an exclusive community, but other than being Nat Friedman's sister, I'm not that noteworthy.</li>
</ul>
<p>BUT! Not in my own defense, rather for the sake of Wikipedia's consistency, there are MANY people with Wikipedia pages who are really not well known at all either, EXCEPT IN TECH FIELDS. It does seem like there's a real slant toward technies in here--so I may be as well known in the field of poetry as another is in the field of Linux, and you guys will only recognize the Linux people. Makes you think, no? I'd ask the question of whether or not you're representing the whole population of people, or just one slice of the big ol' pie. I'm known in certain cirlces. x's and o's, peach.</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I'm the page's primary author. Two reasons have been listed thus far, both of which are not grounds to delete a page. First, if the Omninerd page should be deleted because it is considered an 'advertisement' then other similar pages covering webpages (such as <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">slashdot</a>) should also be deleted for the same reason. Second, there is nothing in the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia deletion policy</a> that lists a certain popularity level as requisite for coverage in Wikipedia. If the page is to be deleted, there needs to be a concrete reason as defined in the deletion policy. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUriah923_8a36.html" title="User:Uriah923">Brandon</a> 03:58, 17 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Slashdot is sufficiently notable to qualify for an article. Listing the popularity level is a way to illustrate if a website is truly important or well-known enough for an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETregoweth_2a9b.html" title="User:Tregoweth"><i>tregoweth</i></a> 06:30, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> I'm not seeing the delineation in the delete policy either. All that aside, I find it troubling that it's just assumed that this page isn't worthy due to it's at-a-glance 'non-notability.' The site is a quality one, it's not a spam-center, and has features like the listed 'NerdRank' that are quite unique to the site. It seems silly to me to delete a wiki entry due to the lack of current membership and then re-add it when that barrier is broken in the near future. OmniNerd is a solid site with solid growth. I could understand if it were a personal website or a non-interactive page, or even just another bulletin board using the same code found on every site, but it's not. OmniNerd is built on 100% original code. I think it's unfortunate that such a site is getting resistence in a forum like wiki that seems to promote original thought and user interaction. If it is decided that this page must be removed, can we at least have the privledge of knowing some exact criteria for acceptance? We're not trying to abuse wikipedia, just add to it. Helpful suggestions, not abrupt deletion, would be much appreciated. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkMcB_4180.html" title="User:MarkMcB">MarkMcB</a> 05:02, 17 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>It may be the highest-quality web site ever, but quality does not equal notability. Also, as one of the site's founders, you might have a slight bias. It would be best to allow someone else to create the article, to avoid the appearance of a vanity article. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETregoweth_2a9b.html" title="User:Tregoweth"><i>tregoweth</i></a> 06:30, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't see any way that this article could eventually conform to NPOV. It has about as much potential as a page devoted to examining the Scriptural backgrounds of papal proclamations. Furthermore, by analyzing the claimed prophecies, it would violate the "No original research" policy.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Agree strongly with K. This was how the page was originally organized, but this was opposed by several users. I think the page should have prophecy, evidence for, and evidence against -- this make it useful to see how Smith's prophecies have been interpreted by supporters and critics. Perhaps a neutral editor could be brought on board to help sort these issues out.
<dl>
<dd><b>Response</b>: Absolutely. The article certainly needs work, but I think that it can be worthwhile. NPOV doesn't mean no POVs are allowed; it simply means both (or more) POVs should be included. I have never read any of Smith's prophecy's and have no idea how to work out if they came true. This article could help by explaining both how supporters think it came true and why critics say they didn't. Being new to Smith's teachings, I'd be happy to help in adding different interpretations. --<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonrad_West_6f02.html" title="User:Konrad West">K.</a> 00:23, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Provisionial Keep</b>, This article can be informative and a worthwhile article on Wiki. However, it should be limited to a list of prophecies and possibly a very, limited explanation of each prophecy.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The article is problematic. Smith was constantly issuing prophecies. A list of all of his prophecies would be a good part of his writing and speeches, much too long to fit in one article. Most of the prophecies listed so far are ones which are considered to have come true, gathered from pro-Mormon sites. Most of the prophecies are as unspecific as Nostradamus's prophecies. Almost anything could match the prophecy. Discussing the accuracy of the prophecy is worthwhile. Where does one go to find out information about <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophecies_of_Joseph_Smith_9c6d.html#Dan_Jones_to_visit_Wales" title="Prophecies of Joseph Smith">Dan Jones</a>? <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophecies_of_Joseph_Smith_9c6d.html#Word_of_Wisdom_related_conspiracies" title="Prophecies of Joseph Smith">Prophecies_of_Joseph_Smith#Word_of_Wisdom_related_conspiracies</a> is similarly vague, but meaningful to modern Mormons. How can a casual viewer determine what these mean without further references? Maybe that is the point of a prophecy, it is general enough that it is probably true. <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> 17:45, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The difficulty of analyzing prophecies is first identifying the meaning. As you review the current article's history, the two sides are miles apart on what Joseph Smith meant in a prophecy. I do find it interesting that those outside of the LDS church seem so stridently confident that their interpretation is the only legitimate prism through which to review Smith's prophecy. Conversely, those who are followers of Smith believe there is only one prism; the one that makes a prophecy true. I still remain unmoved that readers are not capable of reading individual prophecies and making their own interpretation of what it is meant. An introduction to the prophecy is adequate, but an analysis will only result in constant revert wars as is so evident in this article. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> 22:29, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. Interpreting the Independence temple prophecy in D&amp;C 84 depends on what Joseph Smith meant by "generation." Critics believe he meant within his lifetime. Believers believe <i>generation</i> is synonymous with <i>dispensation</i>. Some context here is necessary to understand the possible interpretations. I say give both and let the reader decide which is correct (or if they want a third alternative). --<a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrWhipple_f285.html" title="User:MrWhipple">MrWhipple</a> 23:13, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>An analysis shouldn't be original research or opinion; it should simply state what different groups believe as to how the prophecy came true. That isn't POV, it's presenting facts about what people believe. How will there be edit wars about that? Does anyone disagree on what the LDS think about his prophecies? --<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonrad_West_6f02.html" title="User:Konrad West">K.</a> 04:01, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Many of the prophecies do not have official LDS interpretations. This is especially true of prophecies which may not have come true. There definitely is not a monolithic non-LDS viewpoint. However, this should be attempted. Let's try it with one or two prophecies, perhaps in the talk section, and see what it looks like. <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> 13:21, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That sounds good.

<li><b>Merge</b> with FM104. It's on the bubble of notability IMHO, though I suspect the standards for what makes a notable drive-time radio show depends a great deal on the size of the radio market in question. Just as an example, I'd take as a minimum standard Loren and Wally from <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a>'s WROR -- they are so well known in the Boston radio market that their parody songs have been played on other stations in the area from time to time, and their presence pretty much overshadows every other jock at the station (Matt Siegel, from WXKS in the same market, probably also qualifies). That said, I would ironically consider their station to be non-notable -- it's not exactly a cookie cutter station, its format defies easy categorization (classic hits, I believe it's best known as), but they are not the first station to hold those call letters and they're one of a stable owned by a fairly minor conglomerate whose major claim to fame is being early adopters of <a href="../../../h/d/_/HD_Radio_b245.html" title="HD Radio">HD Radio</a>. I would argue that if we were to assume some validity to the "Loren and Wally" test, altogether very few jocks meet the standard to begin with, and few of those jocks would be outside major markets. (I don't consider syndicated jocks in the same category -- they tend to be inherently notable. This "test" applies strictly regionally.) <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 04:38, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>How can Manning Bartlett be a serious Wikipedia editor if he calls an Anti-congestion initiative "shameless advertising" with the top of the site saying "Nothing for sale"?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because Wikipedia is not a crystal ball and is not for original research. Even though I listed this for deletion, I do think it is a very interesting proposal. <b>However</b>, it is only a proposal. Unless it is accepted or at least gains support in a wider sense, then it is not notable enough to be included in an encyclopedia. Perhaps if there was a prototype to show or if a technical journal had described it or if a newspapaer had done an article about it, then it could stay. As it stands the only evidence is a single website describing the concept. As an encyclopedia, WP should be very conservative about including new things - it should record history, not be a party in creating it. I am sorry, because I can tell this is something you are passionate about, but you should be directing that energy into gaining support for your ideas from the people that matter (venture capitalists, politicians and the media). <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbis_377c.html" title="User:Bobbis">Bobbis</a> 12:29, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thousands of edits over nearly 4 years pretty much gives me some credit as a serious editor. I am not suggesting your ideas aren't interesting or potentially successful. I also have no doubt your ideas might become encyclopediacal one day, and they will rightfully take their place in the pedia. But in the early days it was decided that the 'pedia is not the place to present every new idea on earth. Most new ideas fail and we cannot record them all. Hence the "Crystal Ball" rule that Bobbis describes above. It's nothing personal. Get your project implemented and you'll get no end of coverage here. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManning_Bartlett_95ec.html" title="User:Manning Bartlett">Manning</a> 10:58, July 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The difference (and significance) of an electronic (as opposed to physical) encyclopedia is that it can rapidly respond to events, and has lower institutional barriers to entry. The Hallitube Initiative has over 20 separate proposals, here is what academics say about it from our news release:"An innovative strategy that merits consideration for alleviating congestion and encouraging alternate transportation". Dr. Stephen Mattingly, Univ. of Tex. "A great attempt to solve the current urban transportation problem", Dr. Morton Gulak, Va. Com. Univ. "Maybe we cannot beam you up, but we can tube you over" Dr. Kenneth Waldron, Prof. of Mech. Eng., James Clark Faculty Scholar, Stanford Univ. "Makes a lot more sense than the public vehicle aspect of other PRT systems" Dr. K. Kockelman, Univ. of Tex. "An interesting project worthy of consideration" Dr. Kevin Krizek, Director, ACT Transp. Research Group, Univ. of Minn. "Sounds really promising" Prof. R. Gakenheimer, MIT, Chair, Int. Sci. Cmte. of Coop. for Dev. and Improvement of Urban Transp. "Hallitubes should provide everyone who is frustated and disgusted by the traffic situation in our cities with the hope that very soon,we well be able to cost-effectively tame the monster that the car has become." Dr. J. Kolo, Florida Atlantic University. "The (referendum) microflyovers make sense..." Dr. R. Layton, Prof. of Transp. Engineering, Ore. State Univ. "The proposed Hallitube pylons are an innovative potential use of prestressed concrete.." Dr. A. Schokker, Henderson Prof. of Civil Eng., Univ. of Pennsylvania. "This is an innovative private market solution that deserves further study and consideration." Friends of S. Calif. Highways,Fixtraffic.org.</p>
<p>Traffic is the biggest urban problem of the day. This is not a remote subject, unlike the surface composition of Mars, it carries intense public interest. The costs of this problem are extreme, and we have waited for 20 years for academia and government to act. You say you cannot present every idea. For most areas that makes sense, but in this particular area, you should really present every idea, in part because it does not take experts to examine the viablity. If you become like bureaucrats defending rules, you fail to fullfill a novel role wikipedia can represent. If major academics say this deserves attention, and you suppress, you identify yourself clearly as part of an establishment that apparently has decided someone's interest are served by traffic congestion.</p>
<p>How do you go about deciding that a discussion of the French Trottoir Roulant should have a concept design of an American version removed, or that "car stopping" technologies should not be included in an enceclopedia, when 1000 California mothers could not pick their children up in time because of another police chase&#160;? By definition, the discussion of any concept is an advertising for itself. If you write a thread on a BB, prior to the existence of the web, the idea of an "online encyclopedia called wikipedia" is this a new concept, or should it be suppressed because it is "advertising" something&#160;? You need to look for informational density and novelty to determine if something is an advert. The California Stem Cell proposition was 2 years in the making before it was passed. Should this be suppressed from discussion because it has not been voted on yet&#160;? The inclusion criteria must be 1)relevancy and 2)informational density. The fact that it is being proposed cannot count against inclusion. Would you have allowed Michelson-Morrison to allege that there is no Aether when everybody in Physics thought there was one&#160;? Open up a little, and think about the collective costs of traffic congestion for humanity as a whole. You are saying " let the west fail, we don't like it anyway". Incidentally, the current entry for Hallitubes is not written by our staff. (<i>by 66.27.105.251 16:02, 26 July 2005</i> )</p>
