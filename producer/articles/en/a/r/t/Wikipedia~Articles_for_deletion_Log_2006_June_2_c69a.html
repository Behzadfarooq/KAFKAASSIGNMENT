<li>Merge - KChase and I are updating a table of the locks. Our open question is what to do with the pages where other content was added (e.g. Locks 2 - 11). I've requested speedy deletion for locks 12 - 35. I also suggest the templates Template:Erie Canal Lock and Template:Erie Canal Locks be eliminated. <a href="../../../c/p/a/User%7ECPAScott_7db1.html" title="User:CPAScott">CPAScott</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> all. I got an old mule and her name is Sal. The few I've looked at have been fairly nice, and illustrated: merging them all into one page may make it unwieldy. Call it a logical fallacy if you must, but we do have <i>many</i> separate articles on <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arisaig_railway_station.html" title="Arisaig railway station">railway stations in Scotland</a>, and locks on the Erie Canal are at least as notable as they. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:29, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a>. Besides, if we are keeping culturally insignificant buildings like elementary schools, I think we've set the bar low enough that a couple of doors holding back water deserve their own article.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:36, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as separate articles. Some of the locks may have additional cultural or historical features. For example, the overspill from lock 32 has been turned into a whitewater kayacking practice course. Some of the locks are also State or local parks, with bike paths and other facilities. It is unreasonable to expect every article to be perfect in less than 24 hours. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:40, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While some of these have nothing but the template box, several of these articles are rather interesting. These are individually substantial structures which seem notable enough for me. I wouldn't be against getting rid of the ones that are basically empty until such time that good articles can be created. But so far as a nomination for all of them goes, I say they should be kept. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 17:36, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>. Having this many short articles makes things difficult for readers and editors alike. Combining them would create an article of the right length – perhaps slightly picture-heavy, but not unpleasantly so.<br />
The arguments of <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a>, that our inability to keep other parts of the encyclopedia encyclopedic somehow means we must abandon any effort to do so and simply let the whole thing slump into one unreadable, unmaintainable mess, strikes me as very odd. Schools are a lost battle due to the sheer number of children who can't understand how a building they spend half their life in can be insignificant, but it simply does not follow that we should have several dozen poor articles on these locks rather than one brilliant article. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 19:47, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> CPAScott and I are currently working on a new table at User:CPAScott/Erie locks, with relevant discussion at his talk page.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think it does.. The existence of an article abot your toilet won't hurt anybody but may help someone! You guys don't have respect to information; if you want to protect your YahooGroups GoogleGroups pages, then make an understable reasoning for it.. Say that a company should have this much market valuation to be featured on Wikipedia.. Or if you find this page too much like an ad, then edit and normalize it.. I just tried to make a similar article with del.icio.us; otherwise I wouldn't mention about myself. Go delete it if you want so much; it is not so precious for me. But it's bad to see that there are so much folks who do not respect information. I believe that most of you try to "protect" rights of your companies (why link to GROU.PS on MSN Groups don't get deleted?) and the others just follow the crowd.

<li><b>Comment</b> I get 2.7 million hits for Paul Douglas CBS. That's a lot of hits for someone no one ever heard of until he got killed. For reference, Terri Schiavo gets 4.5 million hits.

<li><b>Comment</b> WP:BIO includes the line "This guideline is not Wikipedia policy." WP:NN begins with the line "This is an essay. It is not a policy or guideline." <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 20:19, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, WP:BIO says "this is a notability criteria guideline", and NN says "there are consensual guidelines for notability". Don't wikilawyer based on one line, especially since everybody else uses these exact same criteria for AFDs all the time. This isn't a unanimous vote requiring process either, so whether your vote stays or not doesn't concern me very much, but I did point you to the criteria you wanted. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 08:08, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a (amateur/social) university lacrosse club. No sporting notability is present.

<p><b>Delete</b> on the following grounds: This article on an "alternative medicine" technique provides no independent sources to establish verifiability or notability, and seems like more of an advert than anything else. Google gives the linked-to website, and the Wikipedia article itself, and that's it.

<li>I'm not sure how to use the WP jargon for what I'm saying, but I think this just needs to be made into a redirect into Alternative Medicine, where there is already an entry for IRECA.

<li><b>Do not delete</b> Try to search IRECA on Google in SPANISH. There is a lot of info there. The article should be rewriten to explain better what IRECA is and how is different from Reiki. Wikipedia shouldn't be a place for advertising but should still reflect reality and contemporary events as they are, not only from the point of view of english readers or people not interested in energy techniqes. There is significant interest in IRECA and this article should indeed be less biased and more concise. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Geoser (<a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeoser_e9ae.html" title="User talk:Geoser">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Geoser_9d82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Geoser">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> There are 830 Google hits for IRECA, and less for IRECA method, many of which are pretty useless. There is an extreme lack of reputable nonprimary sources. It doesn't matter what langauge you search in, as Google automatically shows results from all languages unless you choose to specifically limit it to one language. I've not done that, so I'm seeing them all. Every result reads like an advert, and I'd hate to let another pass on the Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 03:28, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - The UK Top 40 placement should be enough to give them notability, although this brings up to mind the problem with making articles about dance music projects. With producers creating a variety of aliases for themselves and for collaborations, a lot of different articles about the same team can be created that can be merged. Freemasons could conceivably be merged to <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phats_%26_Small_2017.html" title="Phats &amp; Small">Phats &amp; Small</a>, although the absence of Jason Hayward from the Freemasons project should prevent that. The article is also badly named, since the Freemasons, like most house music collective names, are not a real band, but a dance music project/act made up of two producers and fronted by a guest singer. --<a href="../../../p/c/1/User%7EPc13_2b27.html" title="User:Pc13">Pc13</a> 08:37, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I believe this article is simply for promotional purposes and contains no value to stay inside the encyclopedia. It is only a list of participants of the event. Without the list of participants, there is merely no contents.

<li><b>Keep</b> IF and only IF there's some context added and references added. I agree it's just a list of participants right now, and that's neither interesting nor encyclopedic. There's no indication where these kids come from, who's sponsoring the program (if it's an official government program, that's one thing, but if it's because they pulled some names out of a milk carton, eh), and what the goals of the program are.

<li><b>Keep</b> even though it appears to be against the majority. I don't know or much care about the sample lyrics being included, but the song itself is notable and there is room for expansion into a decent article. While I recognize that there is controversy over the inclusion of lyrics, it seems that some sort of compromise or understanding could be reached on that issue rather than just having the entire article scrapped.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Information about filmmaking companies, including independent ones, is actually interesting to many readers, and level of interest to a specific company can quickly rise. This isn't a two-word stub, but rather mostly appropriately written article, it just needs some link cleanup.

<li>No kidding; is anyone seriously proposing that the bar for whether an article is notable or not is whether the creator's a skilled writer? If so, sign me up.

<li>Not the bar, just the article itself is almost OK, and might be useful for people looking for indies info. Its subject exists, and, according to the claims, has at least some local acknowledgement.

<li>Well except:
<ul>
<li>The film of <i>The Heidi Chronicles</i> is from 1995, which if you are correct suggests these guys made an ad when they were around 7 or 8 years old.</li>
<li>Nothing suggests they were "hired" to make whatever it was an ad for (my guess: high-school theater production of the PLAY <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Heidi_Chronicles_7a95.html" title="The Heidi Chronicles">The Heidi Chronicles</a></i> -- that the movie version is the subject seems purely to be your supposition).</li>
<li>There's not the slightest suggestion they were "hired" to do anything whatsoever -- they don't even make that claim, in fact.</li>
<li>There's not the slightest bit of third-party verification of anything in the article -- "products", projects, people -- and no, IMDB, as a user-built database, doesn't count.</li>
<li>Twenty-eight Google hits, in fact, tells me that there ISN'T going to be much, if any, third-party verification. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:37, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A college dorm at the University of Georgia, yet another place to warehouse students. That's it. Was Prod'ed, but tag removed with the comment, "Since this is one of the largest dorms on the UGA campus, I imagine it will be expanded as it plays an important role on campus."

<li>"dorm haters", huh? Yep, you got us, the Cabal of Haters of Dorms, dedicated to wiping out the evil that are dorms from the face of Wikipedia, waking up each day and plotting new tactics in our War on Dorms. Myself, I've vowed eternal vengeance on dorms ever since that day that dorm shot my dog. Look at them! Laughing at us with their bad architecture, cramped living condidtions, and inedible food!

<li><b>Comment</b> - Fires of Heaven has consistently pioneered the end-game content and aided in development of the two largest MMO's to date: Everquest and World of Warcraft. They are legends among the MMO community because of their prowess, determination, and ability to consistently progress months ahead of everyone else. Just because a few of you think "It's just a video game thing", doesn't mean that they have not had an enormous impact on millions of gamers through their efforts. They are comparable to an MMO Louis &amp; Clark. This is why they are not like "Thousands of other groups", and deserve a place on Wiki.SuperJoe 22:13, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Dismissing this website because it is just another MMORPG guild site would be much like dismissing the significance of Studio 54 because it was just another Disco club-- the community is important not because of the setting but because of who congregates there with regularity, including notables such as John Smedley and Brad McQuaid. MMORPG's are very much mainstream nowadays, with millions of gamers enjoying them in North America alone, and those millions may have an interest in reading an unbiased account of what happened regarding their hobby in the past. Anyone who conducts even the most basic study of that history will discover that the community at the Fires of Heaven forums has played a important role in determining its' course.207.81.74.251 05:12, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Interesting comparison. Studio 54 was frequented by quite literally dozens upon dozens of major internationally known <a href="../../../s/t/u/Studio_54.html#Noted_Patrons_and_Performers" title="Studio 54">celebrities</a>. By contrast, the lead Google hit for John Smedley is for an eponymous line of clothing, and no doubt many thousands of players even of the games they created neither know nor care who these gentlemen are; I certainly know nothing beyond the names of the creators of the games I've played. In any event even the most famous of them have zero name recognition beyond hardcore MMORPG fandom. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 06:37, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> This article needs clean up/editing, not delete. The above commentators calling for delete would be correct, if this were merely about a gaming guild's website. However, fohguild.org's MMORPG discussion forum is of note and separate of an average MMORPG clan/guild's site. In fact the actual guild forums section is private and not visible to non guild members. Although one person may not know who John Smedley president of Sony Online Entertaiment is, wikipedia does (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smedley_%28developer%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smedley_%28developer%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smedley_%28developer%29</a>) as does the 2nd and 3rd entries of google, or of Brad McQuaid president of Sigil Games (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_McQuaid" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_McQuaid" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_McQuaid</a>). Often game developers, producers and staff for various games come to fohguild.org to discuss their games, reputations and past decisions, for good or ill with the public. Another frequent poster of note is Gallenite (Scott Hartsman, senior producer of Everquest 2). Here are the links to their posts: <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/search.php?searchid=162406" class="external text" title="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/search.php?searchid=162406" rel="nofollow">John Smedley</a>, <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/search.php?searchid=162408" class="external text" title="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/search.php?searchid=162408" rel="nofollow">Brad McQuaid</a>, <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/search.php?searchid=162403" class="external text" title="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/search.php?searchid=162403" rel="nofollow">Scott Hartsman</a>. As you can see by the number of posts and the interactive discussion, sometimes these posts are the sole place for this information and sometimes these developers/producers post here more frequently than their own official sites. If you are looking for external media sites citing fohguild.org, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/02/21/tech/gamecore/main1335511_page3.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/02/21/tech/gamecore/main1335511_page3.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a> is a CBS article linking to an FoH discussion with John Smedley. The majority of these dicussions are taking place with people who are not members of Fires of Heaven, nor have ever been members of the guild whether that was in Ultima Online, Everquest 1, World of Warcraft or Everquest II. They also are not seeking membership to the organization as many have their own blogs, fansites or are unnamed/anonymous developers of games. Fohguild.org is also linked to IRC discussion channels, uberguilds.org free guild tracking, voicechat services, and host to game servers for MUDs and other games. The amount of traffic the site receives alone due to this developer discussion would make it of note, since people go there to get insider information.

Also your admission to the "fact the actual guild forums section is private and not visible to non guild members" makes this even more of a canidate for deletion, since majority of readers of this Wikipedia article can not then access all aspects of the forums without being a part of the guild. --<a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoeron_c492.html" title="User:Moeron"><font color="darkblue" size="-9" face="Constantia"><b>MOE</b></font><font color="darkblue" size="" face="Constantia"><b>.RON</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoeron_169b.html" title="User talk:Moeron"><b><font color="red"><i>talk</i></font></b></a> | <a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoeron_Completed_Goals_7ed1.html" title="User:Moeron/Completed Goals"><b><font color="green"><i>done</i></font></b></a> | <a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoeron_Sandbox01_fec4.html" title="User:Moeron/Sandbox01"><i>doing</i></a></sup> 20:12, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry for the confusion, the point about the private forums portion is that the real guild website is not available to the public, as such fohguild.org isn't really a guild website. My point was calling it a guild website isn't really accurate. The public section(s) which we are discussing is completely public. Maybe some other readers can pull up more published works. I just pulled up an example I knew of out of my reading, since you asked for it. --<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnaxamandra_2be7.html" title="User:Anaxamandra">Anaxamandra</a> 20:29, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Demanding the removal based on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html#Criteria_for_web_content" title="WP:WEB">multiple non-trivial published works</a> is demonstrating a lack of understanding of what the article is really about. The article needs some work, but the kernel is there. Fires of Heaven has had a significant impact on millions of MMO gamers, which is something no other "guild" can claim.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Many outfits assert notability in one fashion or another with varying degree of extravagant claims. Several times we've asked for actual, verifiable sources to back them up.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Err ... that online wrestling link has a single BBA "event" listed in over a hundred event cattle call from March 2002, which fails the general notability bar of "trivial" coverage. The Daily News link is blocked to non-subscribers, but the paragraph header makes it plain that BBA is not "featured;" this is a generic article on backyard groups. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 09:31, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Check again, the March 2002 Independent Results lists two BBA Results. For a page that only covers a month, two events are pretty good (This is not WWE, who has at least ten shows in a month). Craig 17:22, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>He has more than 40,000 people in his district. From my East-European point of view, he is much more important than e.g. Mike Bach (a mayor of a 2,000-people town).

<li><b>Comment</b>, No opinion yet, but I'd like to see some <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information that he is indeed a regional governor. Most of what I see about him is wikipedia related or from the Turkish Wikipedia, site which is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> in my opinion (and this is not bias; I don't consider en.wikipedia to be a reliable source for wikipedia articles either). I'd also strongly suggest removing the <i>"He is an active user of Wikipedia and supports the project - he has started the first and only official Wikipedia campaign so far in Turkey..."</i> text. It is self-referential and not really important in the grand scheme of things; lots of people are active users of Wikipedia and support the project. Oh, and if anyone wants to bring Mike Bach to AfD, I'd vote delete on that one.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:43, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>The verifiable information that he is a regional governor:</b> It is enough to search in Google for "Beşikdüzü Kaymakam" (name of the province + "governor" in Turkish language); you get e.g. this: <a href="http://www.aksam.com.tr/haber.asp?a=12045,3&amp;tarih=30.10.2005" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aksam.com.tr/haber.asp?a=12045,3&amp;tarih=30.10.2005" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> (a newspaper).

<p>To correct various pieces of misinformation offered above: Turkey is divided into 81 <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provinces_of_Turkey_ba25.html" title="Provinces of Turkey">provinces</a> or <i>iller</i>, comparable to French <a href="../../../d/%C3%A9/p/D%C3%A9partement.html" title="Département">départements</a>. The head of a province is a governor or <i><a href="../../../w/a/l/Wali.html" title="Wali">vali</a></i> in the sense of the head of the highest regional subdivision. Wikipedia considers governors <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>. Below the province is a district (<i>ilçe</i>), with a sub-governor (<i><a href="../../../k/a/y/Kaymakam.html" title="Kaymakam">kaymakam</a></i>) as its head. This is comparable to French <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrondissement.html" title="Arrondissement">arrondissements</a>.</p>
<p>Eyüp Sabri Kartal is not the governor of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trabzon.html" title="Trabzon">Trabzon</a>, in which case he would be notable <i>ex officio</i>. The governor of Trabzon is Hüseyin Yavuzdemir. Kartal is the sub-governor of a district of Trabzon province named Beşikdüzü (pop. 40,000), and as such he is not notable <i>ex officio</i>, just as a <i>sous-préfet</i> is not notable. A search on Lexis-Nexis also yields no English-language newslinks over the last two years. The only reason why we're discussing this is because Kartal had the chuzpa to create his own entry (against <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>) to promote his campaign (against <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a>) <strike>and uses a sockpuppet to continue this campaign (against <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>).</strike> ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 05:43, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. New article to me. Don't see how it fails <a href="../../../b/a/l/WP%7EBALLS_8227.html" title="WP:BALLS">WP:BALLS</a>. Spokane is the second largest city in Washington State and the largest city on the BNSF(110+ trains per day)/I-90 corridor between Seattle and Minneapolis. I have lived here for only three years and I have heard 2/3 of the perjoratives used in the article (hadn't heard "Spocannabis" and "Little Africa" tho) and have heard all of the traditional and commercial variants. These get mentioned in [<a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/search?tb=art&amp;qt=%22Doug++Clark++The+Spokesman-Review%22" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/search?tb=art&amp;qt=%22Doug++Clark++The+Spokesman-Review%22" rel="nofollow">| Doug Clark's columns</a>] in the local Spokesman Review. So I think the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is not insurmountable. An aside, I've heard Spokane named 2X in gansta-rap lyrics in the context of percieved overreaching by the police-powers (popo) - Spokane is no Big Apple but it has some big city problems. -- <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPaleorthid_ad30.html" title="User:Paleorthid">Paleorthid</a> 18:34, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> (or delete, but don't merge). I am the one who split this article off from Spokane. While in that article it received more edits than the rest of the article, with each addition more imaginitive than the last. I have never seen another city article with nearly so many nicknames. It was getting ridiculous and after discussion on the talk page I split it out. It is not a POV fork (which is an article that covers the same material as another article but from a different POV). Ever since the split it has been serenely quiet. I was content to see it deleted as unverifiable, but now that <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPaleorthid_ad30.html" title="User:Paleorthid">Paleorthid</a> is sourcing it I think it is worth keeping.

<p>Contested Prod. No reason given for removal of tag, but I am assuming it was done by the subject of the article, given the username of the person who removed the tag. Much of this page contains non-notable information about the person, but there is one major claim to notability in this article: "A journalist by trade, Lacche has authored more than 1,000 articles". Unfortunately, this claim cannot be verified after a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Justin+Lacche%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLD,GGLD:2004-25,GGLD:en&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Justin+Lacche%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLD,GGLD:2004-25,GGLD:en&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">Google search</a>. I found a total of two real articles that he wrote for student newspapers after going through the 158 Google results. The only link that supports this claim is <a href="http://www.lacche-media.com/justin_lacche.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lacche-media.com/justin_lacche.html" rel="nofollow">his own personal web page</a>, which reads as a resume and I don't feel can be used as a reliable source for one's own claim to notability in this case. His resume also contians several interesting claims, such as "Yahoo! Sports: 12 articles on Pac-10 football." In a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2004-25%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=%22Justin+Lacche%22+Yahoo+Sports" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2004-25%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=%22Justin+Lacche%22+Yahoo+Sports" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> for ""Justin Lacche" Yahoo Sports", only 2 results appear, one of which is his personal web page and the other of which is a <a href="http://sports.groups.yahoo.com/group/bostonredsoxfanclub/message/2052?viscount=100" class="external text" title="http://sports.groups.yahoo.com/group/bostonredsoxfanclub/message/2052?viscount=100" rel="nofollow">post of his</a> on the "bostonredsoxfanclub" Yahoo sports group message board.</p>
<p>The only thing I have verified is that he is indeed the chair of the International Association of MBA Presidents. Unfortunately this doesn't do much for his claim to notability as this is an NN online group that has <a href="http://www.lacche-media.com/IAMBAP_membership.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lacche-media.com/IAMBAP_membership.html" rel="nofollow">44 members</a>. It does look as if he may have won at least one of the MBA awards his page claims, but winning student awards at a university doesn't make someone notable enough for Wikipedia. His claim of "President, Oregon State University MBA Association (2004-2005)" is true, but a <a href="http://www.bus.oregonstate.edu/services/organizations/mba_associations/contacts.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.bus.oregonstate.edu/services/organizations/mba_associations/contacts.htm" rel="nofollow">search</a> reveals that this is simply a student group and hence an NN claim.</p>
<p>After investigating his claim of being the "Father of the Neo-hieroglyph art movement, <a href="http://www.hieroglyphsku.com" class="external free" title="http://www.hieroglyphsku.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hieroglyphsku.com</a>", I can't get the page to load for me. Perhaps you will have better luck. The extent to which I found any information on this was an <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Invest-Collect-Enjoy-World-Exclusive-HieroglyphsKu_W0QQitemZ7417384763QQcategoryZ552QQcmdZViewItem" class="external text" title="http://cgi.ebay.com/Invest-Collect-Enjoy-World-Exclusive-HieroglyphsKu_W0QQitemZ7417384763QQcategoryZ552QQcmdZViewItem" rel="nofollow">EBay auction</a> of which one of his pieces of "art" is going for $0.01 with no bids, with him as the seller. Finally, his baseball mentions are NN. I think this is clearly a vanity page. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 07:28, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom's excellent research. The one-cent eBay auction with no bids really clinched it.

<li><b>STRONG KEEP!</b> I would like to see Wikipedia continue to be the best and first source for information on the Internet. So stop trying to bloody delete it!!</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Honestly, it would be ridiculous to simply get rid of the page. It provides users with information on the animator, and if people even a single person has come here looking for information on him, then why would there be a need to get rid of the page? One should not delete the article simply because they find it unimportant, because that could be said about numerous articles on Wikipedia; it should be kept for those who visit the site, and actually want to read more about the animator. Having obscure articles like this is what makes Wikipedia so great! You can find information about new things all the time, and those who have knowledge on the topic can make contributions to the site by fixing/adding/removing information. Please don't limit the site, simply because this is unimportant in your own eyes - after all, I searched it, didn't I? Lastly, just for the record, Jerry Jackson is quite notable, and many people on Newgrounds know who he is. Whether or not they all like him doesn't matter, the fact is that it is not as if he is completely unknown. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandwiches99_3cbd.html" title="User:Sandwiches99">Sandwiches99</a> 23:07, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Would you delete Ricky Gervais because you have a section titled The Office? Would you delete a secrtion on Mickey Mouse because you already have one on Pluto? Or Walt Disney. (A lengthier comment has been added to the even more ridiclous suggestion to delete David Firth)... - I dont know how to sign it in the Wikipedia way but I am Bob Slayer!</p>
<p>Jerry Jackson can not be deleted he must get a lot more visits than over pages on this website it is interesting because Jerry Jackson is orginal.If you delete Jerry Jackson because you have no prove he is real then you should delete all the stuff on the bible because have you got any proof that is real.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Lc691 02:58, 6 June 2006 (UTC) Joe Beaudoin's proposed porn bio guidelines would systematically exclude gay and especially trans porn stars.

I do assume Joe and Jll are acting in good faith and are simply ignorant of some of the people who live in the same world as them.

<p>I thought that this is a case that is interesting, that it might be worthy of creating a separate page demonstrating how to create circular notability by use of wiki. Maybe there is already such a page on wiki? Initially I just thought simply to put it up for speed deletion, but as I thought about it, this may actually be worth using as a demonstration of how quickly wiki can create circular notability.</p>
<p>Bjorn-Arild Berthelsen was deleted on Marts 19, 2005 as vanity; see here <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bjorn-Arild_Berthelsen_620c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bjorn-Arild Berthelsen">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bjorn-Arild Berthelsen</a>. The same article was recreated as Bjørn-Arild Berthelsen on Marts 25, 2005. For a little over a year few has paid attention to the article, so it has just quietly been living on wiki for over a year. However you go to google today and search for “Bjørn-Arild Berthelsen” you get around 400 hits. Upon examining these hits you quickly realize that 95-99% of all these links take their information from this wiki page or the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> page that has a link and a little text on it.</p>
<p>For the un-observing reading “Bjørn-Arild Berthelsen” now appear to, at least to a little degree, to be a notably person, as there surely are google links for him. But these google links exists only because he has been living on wiki for a year now, e.g. circular notability.</p>
<p>Is that not really an interesting phenomenon to document? As said maybe there is already such a page on wiki?</p>
<p>Anyway <b>delete</b> as per decision established in previous article name “Bjorn-Arild Berthelsen” <a href="../../../t/w/t/User%7ETwthmoses_5da0.html" title="User:Twthmoses">Twthmoses</a> 10:38, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> You're right, if I saw this now without the above info, I'd have thought that being around that long, it must have been notable. I guess some things just fall through the cracks though - if this page was made now, it'd be marked with {db-band} for sure.

<li><b>Delete</b> and I agree completly on the circular notability part, It's always been my biggest fear with wikipedia that one day it stops documenting facts and start making them.

<li>Are you suggesting that wikipedia ends up storing the results of every professional sporting event ever? Because that's the natural spin-off. If the 1911 Sydney Rooster get a full listing, then we need the 154+ results of every major league baseball teams for every year since 1880, every division 1 soccer game for 100 years in at least six major countries, every NFL/NBA/NHL game ever played, every top flight rugby league or rugby union result...

<li><b>Keep</b> per Athenaeum's reasoning. Of course, this assumes that the Sydney Roosters are notable enough.

<li><b>Keep</b> as per Athenaeum although we need a policy for Foo team season. I voted delete for a similar Afd a few days ago. The Sydney Roosters are a notable Australian rugby league playing in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rugby_League_51b9.html" title="National Rugby League">National Rugby League</a>. In those days, they were called Eastern Suburbs so this article should be renamed in my view. It would also be better if it was an article covering the Sydney rugby league competition in that year as a whole. The logo appears anachronistic as well. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 00:06, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I created the page and I believe it is an extensive resourceful piece of information, to answer a few questions:</li>
<li>1. I named it Sydney Roosters 1911 Season as many people associate the club with that name and Eastern Suburbs is not a name that is recognisable by today's generation. The purpose is that a search of the Sydney Roosters is more likely than Eastern Suburbs and will show the necessary information, also I have noted that the club was named Eastern Suburbs within the article. However if the decision was made to change it Eastern Suburbs 1911 Season I would have no objection.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>2. The logo is used as I consider this page moreso an archive to the Sydney Roosters main page. In the effort to uniform all archives, I have opted for the current logo so that is more recognisable by the reader. I was also planning of including the old logo in the near future.</dd>
<dd>There will be more additions to come making it a resourceful database, events including the playing squad and their point statistics as well as including season highlights. The information justifies its existence as well as the promise of more updates. Sbryce858 02:14, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, just realised I haven't voted myself. Wikipedia may be an almanac, but there has to be a limit. Listing every result, for every single season is not encyclopedic. The <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Roosters_833b.html#Season_Standings" title="Sydney Roosters">Season Standings</a> section in the main Sydney Roosters article is sufficient. The <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Roosters_833b.html#Club_history" title="Sydney Roosters">Club history</a> section could be added to, or made a seperate article giving a rundown of any <i>notable</i> seasons. Either that or, as previously proposed, there could be an article for each NRL season, eg 1911 National Rugby League season. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStumason_6d03.html" title="User:Stumason"><font color="green"><b>Stu</b></font></a> <a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStumason_50e2.html" title="User talk:Stumason"><font color="green"><sup><i>’Bout ye!</i></sup></font></a> 08:00, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Article was AfDed in 2005. Nothing has been done with this dicdef and inherently PoV article. Non encyclopediac.

<li>There's probably something useful to be said about Media Whore as a term in general; although WP is, of course, not a slang dictionary, it's worth remarking upon as part of the current social and cultural make-up. Unfortunately, this article as it stands is complete tosh - it's an arbitrary list of celebrities whom the editor doesn't like, and it lacks any sort of NPOV or verifiability. <b>Delete</b>, until someone can bring it back in worthwhile form, if at all. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 13:54, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't delete</b> I don't think linking from IMDB Insinuates any kind of connection between IMDB and this site other than that they have a similar purpose - one is for movies and one is for books. Maybe google PR is a better measure than Alexa rank and I checked ibookdb home page has PR3, nowhere near ibdof with PR 5, but ibookdb is new. I was browsing around the ibookdb beta site and I found it to be much more useful than ibdof as far as book information goes. Celmeyi 14:45, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Comment</b> I thought this page had a previous AfD, though I can't seem to find it. In any case, it was once merged with beep because it was not considered to be enough of an article to stand on it's own, but consensus was that it should me merged with other onomatopoeic sounds. (Note that this was before the article had any references - <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> or not.) Then, for some reason unknown to me, it became its own article again. (I will try to find links for this history, later when I have more time.) In any case, I'll vote later when I evaluate whether I could fix this article up with serious effort, but I'm leaning towards keep. (Perhaps a {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-verify_e98c.html" title="Template:Cleanup-verify">cleanup-verify</a>}} tag would be better for now.) <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 16:51, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</s>

<li><b>Comment (History)</b>. Okay, so so there was in fact no previous AfD, but there was a short discussion about deletion on <a href="../../../m/e/e/Talk%7EMeep_1922.html" title="Talk:Meep">Talk:Meep</a>. The consensus was to merge Meep with <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beep.html" title="Beep">Beep</a>, which was done on January 21, 2006. (Note that at this time, the article had no references, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> or not.) Beep was then moved to <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beep_%28sound%29.html" title="Beep (sound)">Beep (sound)</a> on February 3, 2006, and Beep became a disambig page. On March 26, 2006, and anon thought the redirect to a disambig page was page blanking vandalism, and reverted it. However, Meep remained on Beep (sound), in addition to having its own article. Thus, there are now too versions of Meep - one on Meep and one on Beep (sound). <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 20:55, 2 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Based on the above, I vote <s><b>strong remerge</b></s> with <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beep_%28sound%29.html" title="Beep (sound)">Beep (sound)</a>. I agree with the original consensus to merge with Beep (which is now Beep (sound)), but I believe the present revision of Meep is mostly better than the one on Beep (sound). Meep would then redirect to Beep (sound). However, it still needs considerable cleanup, but I believe this can be done. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 21:00, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, regarding the history talked about above: <a href="../../../m/e/e/Meep.html" title="Meep">Meep</a> is a complete mess... which was then dumped (rather than merged) into <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beep_%28sound%29.html" title="Beep (sound)">Beep (sound)</a>. As a result, there are two dire articles rather than one. The Meep stuff that was dumped into the article <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beep_%28sound%29.html" title="Beep (sound)">Beep (sound)</a> needs to be removed (unless we think that <a href="../../../w/i/t/Wittgenstein.html" title="Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein</a>'s last words really are rumoured to be "Meep Meep"), and the <a href="../../../m/e/e/Meep.html" title="Meep">Meep</a> article deleted, since there doesn't seem to be a single encylopedic entry in it. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 00:16, 3 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Could you be more specific about what is still a "mess" about it? It now has several relatively reliable sources (an academic paper, a truck-fixing article, a couple episode transcripts, a couple links to official sites). Some of the personal sites, at least, are the site where the actual "meep" is located. Yes, there are still some things in there that could use more reliable sources. The article has also been reorganized. (As for the meep section in Beep (sound), I have made no effort to clean that up. Some of the material in Beep (sound) was deleted from Meep due to being wholly unreferencable, such as the Wittgenstein rumor.) Also, the Beep (sound) article wasn't very good without the stuff from Meep... it only has one reference. Why not try to put specific cleanup tags on the top, and provide some specific criticism? (Not that it should be deleted, but a {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup-verify_e98c.html" title="Template:Cleanup-verify">cleanup-verify</a>}} tag could attract attention from editors willing to try to help.) In any case, it's far from being one of Wikipedia's best articles, but I think it's good enough to be included, with the potential to become better over time. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 17:37, 3 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, specific criticism is exactly what I provided in the nom. The article is not remotely encylopedic and is, at best, a collection of indiscriminately googled up mentions of the word "Meep". You might try moving it to wiktionary and see how they react. Your one "academic" PDF comes from a personal website and is merely routed via google scholar, the rest are blogs/forums/websites that have been formatted according to wikipedia guidelines and a "Fantasy creature" section that is <a href="../../../b/j/a/WP%7EBJAODN_1a71.html" title="WP:BJAODN">WP:BJAODN</a> material. As for the schools point below: that is not an argument not to delete this article. You need to argue about those articles elsewhere. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 20:10, 3 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I tried to make it less of an <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate collection of information</a> by reorganizing it. Do you have further suggestions on how to make it less of an indiscriminate collection? I'll look into the reliability of that PDF and see if there's anything else to use, but it will take time. (For the record, the references were found with google, but I have no idea how the information was found in the first place.) The references are at least better than they were when the AfD started, and I think the article has the potential to improve. Also note <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Self-published_sources_in_articles_about_themselves" title="WP:RS">Wikipedian policy regarding self-pulished sources in article about themselves</a>. I believe Denni was referring to past precedence. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 22:58, 3 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes... as I said, <b>Delete</b> it since it is unsalvagable as an encyclopedia article, and large chunks of it are <a href="../../../b/j/a/WP%7EBJAODN_1a71.html" title="WP:BJAODN">WP:BJAODN</a>. I think you should re-read <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Self-published_sources_in_articles_about_themselves" title="WP:RS">WP:RS#Self-published_sources_in_articles_about_themselves</a>, since it has no relevance here. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 23:28, 3 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I believe it can be made not to be an indiscriminate collection of information (it is already less of one than it was a few days ago). The trick is doing that without crossing over into <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, but a skilled editor could do it, given time. I believe that section of WP:RS does have relevance to some of the references in the article. In other words, I agree that the article is bad, but not that bad, and I believe it has potential. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 23:53, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as nonnotable. As far as I can tell, there are only two external-linked items in the article that actually mention Holley Nethercote (the "Money Management" and "Good Returns" links). The article in Money Management features a single quote from one of the firm's partners, giving his opinion on another company's legal troubles, with no further mention of Holley Nethercote. The article does not feature or concentrate on Holley Nethercote <i>itself</i>, and is not evidence of notability. The second article, from Good Returns, is a "special report" on that site -- however, Good Returns is an online-only "magazine" started in 1996. I'm not sure what this means in terms of its influence -- perhaps someone else could illuminate me here. Certainly, it's not on the level of, say, <i>Fortune</i>. In summary, these two links do not make Holley Nethercote's notability obvious to me.

<li><b>Comment</b>, could someone please explain why this meets WP:BIO? I've been googling, and get this flash animator, stats professors and an actor. Apart from a single mention in FHM Estonia (noted earlier) relating to Firth (the flash animator), that appears to be it for reliable information. Right now we seem to have an article full of opinions from "Jeffy's ultrablog" and web forum posts. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 07:29, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, how many times would you like me to restate the same thing. Read this submission again... you know, that bit at the top where I explained the problem with this article. One of the requirements of Wikipedia is "reliable information". There isn't anyway in this case. Notable people generally have solid reliable sources for information about them. People whose flash animations have 30 seconds of fame among a tiny section of newgrounds fans... don't. This article is entirely populated with cruft from blogs, personal websites and web forum posts... all of which are expressly ruled out by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 17:50, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I wasn't contradicting your reliability of sources issue. But now you mention it, I will. Expressly ruled out? More like expressly ruled in: from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, "Neither online nor print sources deserve an automatic assumption of reliability by virtue of the medium they are printed in". Basically, take it on a case-by-case basis. In this case, I think the article should definitely stay. Although we can't quantify his fanbase, I'm sure you're underestimating it when you say 30 seconds of fame among a tiny section of newgrounds fans... I admit that I am a fan, but I've never been on newgrounds. And I certainly have been a fan for more than 30 seconds. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonONeill_b6d3.html" title="User:JonONeill">Jono</a> 18:01, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- Well, I notice that you ignored the main part of of WP:RS that relates to this: <i>"At the other end of the reliability scale lie personal websites, weblogs (blogs), bulletin boards, and Usenet posts, which are not acceptable as sources. Rare exceptions may be when a well-known professional person or acknowledged expert in a relevant field has set up a personal website using his or her real name. Even then, we should proceed with caution, because the information has been self-published, which means it has not been subject to any independent form of fact-checking.</i>. There's nothing case by case about it. Nothing in this article comes from reliable sources. It's blogs, web forums and personal websites. What we have here is someone with no notablity outside of a small selection of people, who happen to also be internet users and show up to vote "keep" in AFDs. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 18:21, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP - AND HOPEFULLY A CONCLUSION TO THIS NONSENSE!</b> Dearest Mr Motor Billpg Gareth Owen etc and the others behind deleting this entry - with the greatest respect you have no idea what you are talking about!! I use Wikipedia almost daily as a source of information - I am not really part of the community and I do not really know the ins and outs of Wikipedia's rules and regulations. However I do know what I want from it as a user. I want Wikipedia to provide answers to questions that I have. Here is the prospective of a user:- When a year or so ago I first came across Fat Pie (The website of David Firth) I wanted to know more and so I searched Wikipedia. I found a number of entries and my knowledge of the guy grew. Surely the fact that one person found the information useful should be the end of the discussion? I am increasingly noticing that articles I want to read are marked for deletion due to certain members of the community having no knowledge or understanding of them. If this continues then Wikipedia is destined to only cater for the majority? Or be restricted by the very structure that has created it so far. I don’t want Wikipedia to become the McDonalds of Internet Encyclopaedias! Back to David Firth: (Because I know Mr Motor will ignore what I have said and bleat on about WP:BIO – Christ he is so anal!) David Firth has not just experienced 5 minutes of fame - He has steadily built a following over a number of years, his characters and creations are commonly known throughout UK, USA, Australia and around the world, particularly so amongst students and young people. No he not restricted to just the enormous success of Salad Fingers, he has many other popular individual cartoons and character series and his 'documentary' of Devvo is due to appear on both Channel4 and E4 in the UK in June and July. For some time he has showcased his animations on New Grounds an online community of 1,010,452 (As at 9th June 2006) flash animators where David Firth is known by all and has influenced a large majority, so much so that Newgrounds now pay him so that he can keep animating and submitting to them. (Mr Motor can you show that you have inspired nearly a million people?!) David Firth is a unique and prolific creative talent who has many many fans... Maybe some of these entries need to be cleaned up but deleted? Not if you want to maintain Wikipedia as an important resource. <b>TO CONCLUDE MY LITTLE RANT!</b> I would like to see Wikipedia continue to be the best and first source for information on the Internet.

<li><b>Comment</b> A key player in a community of a million Animators not a half dozen... And the point about Gervais / office is that a creation and a creator can both be notable...
<ul>
<li><b>Comments</b>, "can be" vs "actually is". Gervais is notable outside of the <i>The Office</i>. As I said, Firth is the creator of a minor internet meme. <a href="../../../m/e/m/WP%7EMEME_0b58.html" title="WP:MEME">WP:MEME</a> is a proposed guideline regarding this -- if the meme is notable (and I actually doubt that it is) then have an article, but do not create a biographical article for its creator unless there is something else worth adding. There isn't... because there is no more information available.

I was unable to find the information in the article anywhere else, and it answered several questions I had. It should be noted that pretty much everyone petitioning for the article to be removed seems to be ignorant of mr firth's contribution to and impact on the internet. Even if only a couple of people have been searching for him, that should still validate the article.

<li>While we certainly understand that there needs to be criteria to ensure the integrity of Wikipedia, we feel that the criteria are inaccurate in determining if an artist is notable or not especially in the internet age. There are many artists who are prolific without chart action or major tours. So, we first recommend that you take a hard look at these critieria especially considering this is a web site. Furthermore, Chris Sparks is in the Rodeo genre which is mainly underground and is a genre with no radio or tour support. Radio airplay on a mass scale is not even possible. Even so, Mr. Sparks still has a major tour coming up with numerous major sporting events as well as several articles with major music publications. He is sponsored by Wrangler, the largest apparel company in the world, and Resistol Hat. Also, Mr. Sparks' contributions to the music industry are also as an editor and developer for a large network of music and music-related sites in his genre. Separately from music, he is the creator of one of the largest business and career site networks in the world. So perhaps this means some changes in the bio and the category. Given this information, we would certainly appreciate any suggestions you have so that we may abide by the guidelines and still have an appropriate bio for Mr. Sparks. ChrisSparks</li>

<li><b>User-fy</b> Close, I'd almost say keep, but I really can't tell much of the notiblity. I mean, there's some stir on google, but his name is so common. Though apparently Mr. Sparks has some competition for notability, as <a href="http://www.sustainlane.com/article/662/152/The+Big+Haul:+An+Interview+with+EcoHaul%92s+Founder.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sustainlane.com/article/662/152/The+Big+Haul:+An+Interview+with+EcoHaul%92s+Founder.html" rel="nofollow">this dude</a> founded a company, and its not the same person as the article say. I see a resume of a guy by that name, but they went to the wrong to college to be this Chris Sparks. The other spattering of early results are for things reguarding the 3-4 websites this person runs to help forward themselves. Who knows, maybe in less than 5 years he'll be listable. The user ChrisSparks can have the article on their userpage. If this article is user-fyied, I remind the admin that the artwork is fairuse, so don't forget to nix that out of the user space. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 05:48, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I will try and sign, but have not had much luck with that cliche aloof part of this site. 20K a month is a low Google hit rate? How many hits did EGM have in their first year? None, because the internet was not around as strong back then. Your kind of comments is why I consider this site to be combative in how their mods run things. Please point out how it is poorly written, aside from being revised so many times because the rejections kept changing. I am about ready to just completely ban this site from my memory.</p>

The arguments of the many anons that the article ought to be kept because it's likely that many will search for Close in the wake of her victory not only fail to assert that the subject is notable and encyclopedic but also, in view of their insistence the temporal propriety of our having an article, seem to evince that Close will not be perceived as notable in the future and seem not to comport with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, viz., that Wikipedia is not a news service (cf., Wikinews).

<p>Keep it. The Bee is now prime-time, big-time, with books and movies. The winner is a culturally significant person.</p>

<li>I disagree with deleting this article. This person warrants an encyclopedia entry. This is an amazing achievement; of 6 billion people, how many have completed high school? This individual completed postgraduate studies before even being able to vote or drink! Stories like this need to be told to inspire today’s youth. Educators, athletes and politicians worldwide are always encouraging today’s youth to stay in school. They need stories such as these to provide motivation and inspiration. According to these sources, Nandeep himself was inspired to complete a university degree after hearing of other exceptional feats. What if he had not heard about them? It would be an injustice to deprive people access to this article. Not only do I think this, but so do my friends, family, colleagues, and others whom I have shown this article. Furthermore, major media outlets such as the BBC agree! This Wikipedia site alone links to newspapers on three different continents in several languages!

<p>How does this article go against that? I cannot understand why people would contest this article, especially when we are discussing a positive, inspiring story. There has to be a sanity check; serial murderers are in Encylopedia entries. Just because they have killed dozens, does that make them more "worthy" than positive stories?</p>

<dd>What makes serial murderers more encyclopedia-worthy than Mr Bamrah is not their actions, but the notoriety they achieve through their actions. <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_Dahmer_e378.html" title="Jeffrey Dahmer">Jeffrey Dahmer</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Bundy_c512.html" title="Ted Bundy">Ted Bundy</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Gein_9bdd.html" title="Ed Gein">Ed Gein</a>, and <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Fish_0dfc.html" title="Albert Fish">Albert Fish</a> garnered tons of press at the time and even now are objects of morbid fascination for thousands of people.

<dd>I'm not suggesting that the treatment doesn't exist, I'm saying that "Diet of Worms" needs to shown to be a phrase that is commonly used to refer to the treatment. Don't give in to constant vandalism / misguided editing - that shouldnt be a reason for keeping this article. A rash of punning newspaper headlines (mainly regurgitations of the one New Scientist magazine headline) are not enough to show common usage.

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I just deleted it from the Diet of Worms article because the Disambig page works just fine for that 0.005% of people who come to <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diet_of_Worms_ad33.html" title="Diet of Worms">Diet of Worms</a> looking for <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helminthic_therapy.html" title="Helminthic therapy">Helminthic therapy</a> and its integration into that article was both highly off-topic and redundant with this article.

<p>SUZANNE GOES DOWN Should Not Be Deleted</p>
<dl>
<dd>Suzanne Goes Down is a significant poem that should not be deleted. For one thing significance of poetry is often a matter of the world view and experience of the reader. Also, this poem is mentioned in several reviews as an excellent example of American Outlaw Poetry. One review by Mark Spitzer can be found at Jack Magazine, in which the poem is mentioned as well as several lines quoted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="http://www.jackmagazine.com/issue8/reviewmspitzer.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jackmagazine.com/issue8/reviewmspitzer.html" rel="nofollow">[http://www.example.com Mark Spitzer</a>]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The poem has additional significance in that the author is the editor/author of a particularly controversial book <i>12-Step Horror Stories: True Tales of Misery Betrayal and Abuse in AA, NA and 12-Step Treatment,</i>which was banned in bookstores in certain areas due to the clamour of local recovery houses and individual members of 12-step groups. The dialogue in the poem also points to the uselessness of A.A. meetings for the speaker. Because of this social blasphemy, the poem is just as likely to be a target of a book-burning-minded minority as the book was.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All of this history can be verified by dialogue between Mrs. Fransway &amp; members of 12 step groups during 1996-2000 recorded on google groups.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The poem itself should not have been removed from the article. Mrs. Fransway gives permission for it's use on her web site <a href="http://gothicromance.net" class="external autonumber" title="http://gothicromance.net" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Fransway's other work does not make this poem significant. Her book is mentioned in the article on her. The poem is copyright 1996 apparently, if the poem is "just as likely to be a target..." there would probably be some action being taken already since it's been 10 years already. As for her poem being allowed on Wikipedia, where does it say that anyone can reproduce it elsewhere? I don't even see anywhere that states that it is her website. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 22:24, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<b>Additional Comments</b></p>
<p>Anyone who has not seen the permission on the website gothicromance.net needs to clean their eyeglasses.</p>
<p>As far as gothicromanc.net, one can very easily perform a whois on the site and find out who it belongs to: Rebecca Fransway.</p>
<p><b>Suzanne Goes Down Has Been Expanded</b></p>
<p>The article Suzanne Goes Down has been changed, adding a paragraph proving significance of the poem.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Okay, I'm trying to assume good faith here, but that notice was not there yesterday. That website changed in the last day. In addition to adding that line about permission, it also moved the poem down in the page In fact, here's a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:W2L3rIQYLaAJ:gothicromance.net/+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:W2L3rIQYLaAJ:gothicromance.net/+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">cache</a> of what the website was just a few days ago.</li>

<dd>And yes, I did a registrant search now, but I shouldn't have to do that just to find out whether or not its her website. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 12:12, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
<b>These points are now moot.</b> The article has been expanded, explaining the significance of the poem. Later the poem itself will probably be added again, once I learn how to register permission for use.</p>

<li>Just wanted to add a few things. I'm disagreeing that being a member of the PGA Tour for 2 seasons is enough to assure notability. Looking at his stats, he barely got his exemption in 1997 (finished like 112th on the money list, 125 is cut-off) and played pretty lackluster (as explained by article) for the rest of his career. There are literally hundreds of golfers in the recent past that have had short careers on the PGA Tour, and IMO, I don't think winning a PGA event should even assure you of an article. Even Calvin Peete, one of the best golfers of the 80s who won 12 PGA events (including a Players Championship) does not have an article. I feel that notability guidelines should be written for sports figures, or more in-depth ones. Also, looking at the BIO link given, there are different guidelines for the dead than living. And I’m a pretty big golf fan, and I’ve never even heard of this guy until I was editing some other pages. Burgwerworldz 05:06, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is NOT a policy. All the criteria should be the same for living people as for dead people.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> There are thousands of articles about sportspeople further down the hierarchy of sporting achievement, eg losing Olympic competitors, Aussie Rules footballers who played one AFL game and reserve players in the English Premiership who haven't played at all. A player who finished 112th on the PGA Tour money list would probably have been in the top 200 global practitioners of the this major sport at that time, and Wikipedia goes a lot lower than that in accepting notability in thousands, probably tens of thosuands of cases. If you think that Wikipedia's criteria should be narrower, that is your right, but this guy very clearer falls within the consensus level of notability and there is no justification whatsoever for this totally random and arbitary nomination. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalsicol_c774.html" title="User:Calsicol">Calsicol</a> 18:46, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Random? I was cleaning up all the pages for events on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationwide_Tour_cc90.html" title="Nationwide Tour">Nationwide Tour</a>, which had all past champions of said events listed. Most are redlinked, as a vast majority of winners never had long or steady careers on the PGA Tour. When I got onto a page of a tournament that said subject won, I visited the page as I had never heard of the player to make sure it wasn't directing to another Michael Christie. So, this was not a random posting whatsoever. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgwerworldz_a32c.html" title="User:Burgwerworldz">Burgwerworldz</a> 20:24, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This nomination is dangerous threat to Wikipedia's golf coverage, which has been improving more rapidly lately than it did before. He was the equivalent of a major league player in team sports, and when was the last time one of them was deleted? <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolfcam_2c26.html" title="User:Golfcam">Golfcam</a> 21:48, 3 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First off, golf is not a team sport, so calling him equivalent to a "major league player" is dubious at best. Your logic is also quite flawed. So if someone had played on the PGA Tour for a season (even if they missed all cuts), they are notable enough to have an article? I hardly see how a journeyman golfer can be one of the 1,000,000 most important subjects in the world. There needs to be some set guidelines for including athletes rather than the vague suggestions given by BIO. Also keep in mind, this golfer is dead, so he should be judged by the simple question posed by BIO at the time being. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgwerworldz_a32c.html" title="User:Burgwerworldz">Burgwerworldz</a> 22:51, 3 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think it's unreasonable to consider a PGA Tour player equivalent to a major league player in team sports. There are over 1,000 players on opening day rosters in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a> and over 700 players on opening day rosters in <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>. Looking at the PGA Tour exemption list, there are fewer than 250 players who can claim tour membership at this time. <a href="http://www.pgatour.com/players/pgatour-exempt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pgatour.com/players/pgatour-exempt" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> That's fewer even than the number of players on opening rosters in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Basketball_Association_2e33.html" title="National Basketball Association">National Basketball Association</a>. We can dispute whether a deceased player who spent two years on the PGA Tour meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, but if Michael Christie doesn't meet the criteria, neither should someone who played only two years in the NFL, NBA, or MLB. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:54, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think it's quite unreasonable, and i'm stunned that there aren't more delete votes. Also, golf is not as popular as other team sports, and that means that the proportion of golfers included from a roster should be lower. I look at a lot of the players on the 1997 money list, and if you get toward Christie's name, there are a bunch of players who may have only had status for a few years that I just couldn't fathom an article being created for them. Christie's case is the same, except he shot himself. His suicide is his most notable characteristic, and if you let him in, you'd have to let every golfer that has ever played a full season on tour, and that is just absurd. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgwerworldz_a32c.html" title="User:Burgwerworldz">Burgwerworldz</a> 05:03, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> There aren't many delete votes because it really couldn't be much clearer that he meets the relevant criteria. You can't dispute whether he meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> without making yourself look ridiculous. He just does, period. If you don't like it, that's tough, but please try to read what's there, not what you want to see. In the long run there probably will be an article for every player that spends a season the PGA Tour in the future, but Wikipedia isn't mature yet. There are articles for most current players in the top teamsport leagues in the English speaking world, including fringe squad/roster players. There are a lot more of them per sport than there are golfers on the top golf tours. <a href="../../../r/e/e/User%7EReeseM_4987.html" title="User:ReeseM">ReeseM</a> 11:43, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> If anything the requirements for living people is *higher* than that for dead people, because we fear autobiographies. Over time, we've progressively "opened up" the rules on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> to more people. Such updates have gone in the "living section", because most new bios are obviously for living. And it makes it look now, like we're softer on the living. But this was never the intent.
