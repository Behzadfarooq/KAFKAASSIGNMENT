<p>I don't think that this page belongs in Wikipedia for several reasons. First of all, on its own it lacks the context and additional information necessary to be useful. Here it's just a list from which the reader is left to just draw whatever conclusions they want without regard for what it actually means. Such a list would be far more useful if integrated into an existing article, such as <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a>. However, this list has one other major problem. It draws the IQ's from a number of different sources. Each source almost certainly varies widely with regards to what the sampling methods and IQ tests it uses were, which means that the results of each source can not be compared in this manner without inherent inaccuracy. A list like this does nothing but result in completely erroneous and misleading conclusions and is in fact utterly useless. Comparing the IQ's from different studies in this manner comes very close to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. A new list could be created in the context of the above mentioned article if all the IQs were drawn from one source, but this list as it stands is not at all independently notable, accurate, or verifiable. <a href="../../../d/y/c/User%7EDycedarg_1cf0.html" title="User:Dycedarg"><span style="border:1px solid red;color:red; padding:1px;background:#000"><b>Dycedarg</b></span></a> <a href="../../../d/y/c/User_talk%7EDycedarg_ffee.html" title="User talk:Dycedarg"><b>ж</b></a> 01:13, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Joshdboz arguments, but Keep it, if not Wikipedia will only merge the title of the article and not what the table shows. The content are relevant to all the Race and intelligence series at Wikipedia. Buj and Zeidner is for example new information. It seems that Wikipedia do not like Buj. They have deleted things about him earlier. It seems like "IQ and the wealth of nation" and "Race and intelligence" shall be the only truth inside here. Seems like some like what these articles tells, but there can be other truths???? If "Race by ancestry" should be deleted; Also the other articles about race and intelligence should be deleted. Further...: The "IQ by ancestry" article tells that there is not only one indian race. It is true. In other articles indians seems to be one race. Why shall Indo-Aryans represent Indians in generally and Dravidian people? Many says that the article "IQ by ancestry" is racism. It is not more rasistic than other articles about the subject inside here.SuganthinifromJaffna</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> and redirect the title to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a>. I was tempted to say the data should be merged in some way, but as observed above, this is Original Research in that it draws from varying sources with the suggestion of a meaningful relationship between the data. There's nothing here that can reasonably be merged. Only if there was an external source in the form of an article that attempted to meaningfully sythesize this data, could the information be presented fairly. If such a published article or report existed, then it would be possible to take a Neutral-Point-Of-View while presenting reactions to and interpretations of the report. But such a report does not exist outside this Originally Researched list, and it does not allow NPOV evaluations.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 17:58, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>SOLUTION</b> Dycedarg and I have had participated with some other editors in a rigorous debate at <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a>. The outcome is that the list as written is not appropriate for inclusion there for several reasons, and has been removed. However, I will try to salvage the better material and try to develop a more balanced and well resourced chart. The value I see of inclusion at <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a> is to disagregate some of the overly condensed categories presented there, such as lumping all whites, blacks and hispanics into three overly narrow categories (are hispanics a race or speakers of a common language?). Also a chart (modified) allows multiple studies to to be evaluated side by side. Variances in IQ are not simply a result of genetics, but also include environmental factors such as nutrition and education (hard to distiniguish from inherent intellegence) among many others. Like it or not the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a> article has been through rigorous review including two recent AfD processes, and is not likely to go away. If you oppose the validity of the information, it is better to work with the process to improve the presentation of the article toward a NPOV. If you have some ideas on how the chart can be improved please contact me -- some suggestions have been discussed at <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a>. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 04:20, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- This article is definitely assuming a POV straight off the bat (that race and intelligence comeasurement are reportable correlations). Since race is mostly sociological while intelligence is entirely psychometric, such an article is either entirely <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> or it is POV-pushing a conservative racial agenda ala <i>The Bell Curve</i>. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 19:05, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>This would be a reason to delete <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a>, which has passed AFD twice. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshdboz_c913.html" title="User:Joshdboz">Joshdboz</a> 19:18, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Racist. IQ measuring is depending on the subjects knowledge and education, therefore this is not a like-for-like comparision and biased. <a href="../../../h/a/g/User%7EHagenUK_df58.html" title="User:HagenUK">HagenUK</a> 19:47, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
