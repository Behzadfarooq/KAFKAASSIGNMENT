<li><b>Comment</b>: The article is not currently referenced, but the claim that it's original research is not supported by prior AfD logs or any comments here. If this was not used rarely in economics, as has been claimed, that should be verifyable. Verifying that is a prerequisite to the restated claim of original research. This nomination is flawed until/unless the OR claim is substantiated. Though it should be properly referenced, lack of references is not a valid reason to delete. Closing admin is recommended to review whether OR claim has been substantiated in the discussion; if not, it should simply be closed with no action when it times out. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 08:24, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The claim of OR is supported by the editor responsible for the article's content (68.19.116.130 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.19.116.130.html" title="User talk:68.19.116.130">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.19.116.130_e40b.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.19.116.130">contribs</a>)), who has stated that the definition "was derived BY MYSELF several years ago in response to questions relating to my use of the term in various discussion forums, and in an essay authored by me which may be found at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/brittone/eco.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/brittone/eco.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/brittone/eco.html</a>"; in other words, it is sourced to a self-published essay and reflects one editor's coinage and definition of a neologism. If the term exists independently of the editor's usage as a notable, verifiable term, an article can be created to reflect that usage, but as trialsanderrors says, unless someone rewrites this as a viable article, it should be deleted as OR.--<a href="../../../m/u/c/User%7EMuchness_6152.html" title="User:Muchness">Muchness</a> 23:26, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> per JJay - this is NOT OR, it's an economic term that's been in use for decades, the only thing the original editor likely 'derived' by himself is the particular string of words s/he used to explain the concept. (Which is exactly what an editor is supposed to do, as the alternative would be copyvio, no?)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> It's a 90s neologism, but I'm not convinced that it's a failed neologism because it seems useful in certain contexts to people in the real world. Here's an IEEE Spectrum article <a href="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/jun06/3655" class="external free" title="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/jun06/3655" rel="nofollow">http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/jun06/3655</a> from last month that uses the term to describe "Web 2.0 database-driven sites." The tone of the article is to mock the terms and their usage, but if published articles are still mocking the term so many years after it was coined, I see that as an indication that it's still being used and still should have an article here. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 08:15, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I've previously heard of the "Cernettes" as having the first band website. Also, Silvano de Gennaro isn't just some guy, he's a Ph.D. in Computer Science at CERN who has been there since 1977.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've added a new section to the talk page, I think I 'may' have disproved the claim. However I was never connected to the internet before the web came along, and need to confirm a few points. As there is discussion as the the factual accuracy of this article in the talk pages, i'm sure whoever decides on this one will look there. --JeffUK 00:21, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> As I've said before, there is no reliable way to verify this claim - All we have is one person who claims this is true, and a single news source that parroted it. Merging this to <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Horribles_Cernettes_804a.html" title="Les Horribles Cernettes">Les Horribles Cernettes</a> will not solve the fact that it's still unverifiable information, regardless of the article in which it resides. ~&#160;<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooyabazooka_79a9.html" title="User:Booyabazooka">Booya <sup>Bazooka</sup></a> 00:35, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't agree that it cannot be verified. It certainly can't easily be verified by multiple sources, but I believe it's arguable that Gennaro is a reliable source, also that it's possible for TBL to be contacted (although that needs to be done carefully, we don't want to spam the poor guy! Also, the fact that this has been <i>claimed</i> by Gennaro is a verifiable fact, the cernettes article need not say that it is the truth, only that it has been claimed.--JeffUK 00:46, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm also concerned about the copyright status of this image. I'd hate to shoot down such an interesting discussion with a technicality, but i think we need to look into the 'fair use' claim. (do we need to consider Swiss copyright law?) If anyone agrees that this may be a copyvio, can they tag the relevant image, or ask me to do so. --JeffUK 00:46, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - we're clearly in US fair use territory (critical commentary on the image itself). I think the question of complying to Swiss law may be moot; my read of the situation is that someone who wants to bring a case against en.wiki under a provision of foreign copyright law would have a lot of obstacles in asserting jurisdiction in the foreign country. (Possibly excepting Germany, as I understand there is a mirror there?) The applicable part of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright_law_of_Switzerland_3c2f.html" title="Copyright law of Switzerland">Swiss Copyright Law</a> <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/231_1/a25.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/231_1/a25.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, according to a rough machine translation, appears to be:</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> - 35 U.S.C. 102(f) requires that the true inventors, and only the true inventors, of an invention are named as inventors on the patent. If someone is named who is not an inventor, it could invalidate or otherwise limit the enforceability of the patent; if someone who materially contributed to the invention is not named as an inventor, and later found to have been a true co-inventor, they have full independent rights to the patent, including the right to license away to a competitor unfettered joint rights to the patent; which they have been known to do, to very great remuneration. Either way, millions of dollars often ride on naming the inventors accurately; it is a big deal. This is not like a senior professor plugging his name onto his students' research articles. The distinction implied above is without a difference. And for anyone, 86 patents is extraordinary territory. Note also, that <b><a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;r=0&amp;p=1&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;Query=in%2Flindsay-jeff%24&amp;d=PG01" class="external text" title="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;r=0&amp;p=1&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;Query=in%2Flindsay-jeff%24&amp;d=PG01" rel="nofollow">he is also named on 107 pending patent applications</a></b>, at least most of which can be expected to become issued patents in the next few years - and those are only the ones that have been pending at least 18 months.

<li><b>Re-rejoinder (???)</b> - Hey man, where would civilization be without wet wipes dispensing technologies?&#160;:-) While not all patents are on par with inventing laser or warp drive, but looking only at issue rate per application masks the self-limiting layers of in-house counsel, managers, and outside counsel deciding whether or not an engineer's submission for a patent application is likely enough to be passed to be worth the mound of cash and the years of effort to apply. A lot of would-be applicants are counseled - even by their outside attorney (including myself) - that their idea is not likely to get an issued patent. In short, I don't think the arguments for minimizing the accomplishment of a guy with 86 patents and over 100 more in the pipeline hold much water, and I think that in itself satisfies notability. There are a number of astronauts who list a single or a handful of patents on their bios alongside their spaceflight experience. Ray Kurzweil is famous as an inventor, and he holds <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;Query=in%2Fkurzweil-ray%24" class="external text" title="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;Query=in%2Fkurzweil-ray%24" rel="nofollow">15 patents</a> and <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;r=0&amp;p=1&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;Query=in%2Fkurzweil-ray%24&amp;d=PG01" class="external text" title="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;r=0&amp;p=1&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;Query=in%2Fkurzweil-ray%24&amp;d=PG01" rel="nofollow">37 published pending patent applications</a>.

<li><b>Re³joinder</b> My point is mostly about the very limited value of patent counts. Patents are a massive <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_tail.html" title="Long tail">long tail</a> story, with only a tiny fraction creating the bulk of value. I'm a bit disinclined to buy the in-house controls argument if the subject himself is in control of the process. I should amend my comment above though by noting that the decorative elements seem to be about the riffles on toilet paper and paper towels rather than feminine hygiene products. If there is a patent among the bunch that received significant outside attention, I'm willing to reconsider. On sheer counts, I'm not. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 19:37, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I guarantee you, he does not have unfettered rights to pour the company's money into a collection of vanity patents for himself. If they are anything like other F500 companies, there is a big department of in-house patent attorneys and managers taking a long, hard look at every thousand dollars being spent and deciding whether the likely benefit to the company of each patent application is worth the expense, with the knowledge that only a tiny fraction of patents are ever useful for litigation.

<li><b>Comment</b> I left the stub template in the rewritten article because I realized it was a first stab at a new article. Since then, Trödel has greatly improved the article, so it can probably be removed by now, although there is more work to be done (like Criticsm). BTW - the guy is a chemical engineer, specializing in things to do with wood pulp who works for a paper company. Chances are his patents aren't going to be glamorous and exciting to those of us who don't appreciate the wonders of paper.;^) He did have two "best article" awards from a trade magazine, and co-winner of a "Best Technical Paper" from a professional institute, which sounds like professional recognition. <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 02:47, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Lindsay is famous for polemically dismissing anything not faith-promoting to Mormonism, and his scientific expertise is often touted by his followers in this regard, who represent a fundamentalist faction within Mormonism, unyielding in their literalism. So Wikipedia is touting his scientific expertise for these followers without precedent, thus giving his controversial and unrelated apologetics added weight. Here is the problem explained, from a Mormon researcher: <i>My particular interest is Missouri Mormon History. Of this time ( 1831 - 1838 ), I concentrate on 1838. The 1838 Mormon War in Missouri - This is THE definitive book on the 1838 period, and is a must read for any student to the topic. Please note that Jeff Lindsay has written an unkind rebuttal of this book, and I fully dismiss Lindsay's work here as almost totally inaccurate. For an alternative to LeSueur's work, see Alex Baugh's A Call to Arms: The 1838 Mormon Defense of Northern Missouri. I know both authors personally, and they are two of the best historians in the field. Bro. Lindsay has done a disservice to his church in this area - he would be best advised to read Baugh's book, and follow his example. A full bibliography of the Missouri period can be found at the bottom of this page. For a rather complete chronology of 1838 Missouri, see 1838 Chronology, o this site. <a href="http://www.tungate.com/Missouri_1838.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.tungate.com/Missouri_1838.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tungate.com/Missouri_1838.htm</a></i> Anon166 15:50, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Trodel, yours is merely an argument for including anything. Whether or not it can be neutral is another question.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I notice that the resume-esque bullet points have been removed from the article. It's a good start, but everything I'm reading just seems so unremarkable and not NPOV. Allow me to illustrate: It says that he interrupted his time at BYU for a mission thing. That's great, but it's a <i>normal</i> thing for LDS members to do. For instance, the claim that he is a "prolific" inventor wreaks of NPOV issues. Looking at the article, I just find it extremely hard to justify its inclusion in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="maroon"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font>talk</font></b></a></sup> 18:30, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>First the article should decide what it wants to be. As a corporate executive, the subject is wildly non-notable. As a former academic, he seems to fail <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. As an inventor, he doesn't seem to be anywhere near <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;RS=IN%2FLemelson-Jer%24&amp;Refine=Refine+Search&amp;Query=in%2FLemelson-Jerome%24" class="external text" title="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;RS=IN%2FLemelson-Jer%24&amp;Refine=Refine+Search&amp;Query=in%2FLemelson-Jerome%24" rel="nofollow">the top</a>.

<li><b>Response</b> I admit I didn't do a good job of the initial rewrite. (I'm better at tweaking than creating), but the discussion should be based on the topic, not the quality of the article.</li>
<li>Everyone's milage may vary, but the LDS DNA article isn't (IMHO) the most important thing he did. What makes it unique, is that it is the only paper that the official church web site references. (lds.org usually limits references to articles to top church leaders.) What he is best known for (for good and bad) is a variety of papers in the anti-mormon field. As I mentioned earlier, if you google "anti-mormon", his site shows up on the first page. That should indicate he is notable within <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Mormonism_32bf.html" title="Anti-Mormonism">Anti-Mormonism</a>. The next question would be "Is anti-mormonism notable?" If the answer is yes, then it seems that Jeff Lindsay is noteable. If the answer is no, then the answer would be no. His page is linked to from <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Mormonism_32bf.html" title="Anti-Mormonism">Anti-Mormonism</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon_apologetics.html" title="Mormon apologetics">Mormon apologetics</a>, and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Mormonism_77f4.html" title="Criticism of Mormonism">Criticism of Mormonism</a>, which lends credence to him being known among Mormons. Now, granted, if you aren't a Mormon, a former Mormon, an Anti-Mormon, or a friend of a Mormon, that may not mean much. But does that make it non-notable?</li>
<li>I also should point out that <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_L_Rattigan_f48b.html" title="User:David L Rattigan">David L Rattigan</a> has greatly stripped down the article, so I would encourage people to look at it again. <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 22:16, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> High praise for David for cutting it down to size and removing the more blatant vanity elements. On the notability of his LDSDNA engagement, the problem is that the LDS webpage has to be seen as a partisan site in the debate, so what really matters is 1. whether the opposing site takes his arguments seriously enough to engage him in a debate, and 2. whether this spills over to a forum where I as an outsider could possibly be informed by it. For instance the LA Times article is good evidence that the debate is of interest to outsiders, but since Lindsay isn't mentioned in it it gives no testimony of his role. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> brings up the issue of undue weight, and if it isn't established that he holds a central role in the debate (outside web forums, which are almost never encyclopedic), this article could be seen as a POV fork. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 23:36, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, absolutely. Patent discussions aside, I agree that Lindsay is notable as an LDS apologist — I've become very familiar with his work both as a Mormon and after leaving the church (and know many others who read him that have nothing to do with Wikipedia, Anon). For the record, I've communicated with him via email in a (suspended) effort to fill this article out some, and he was surprised that it had been written — he did not author any part of it.

<dl>
<dd>I must confess I'm confused about what is needed for retention. For my initial rewrite, I added lots of references, which caused several people to call it a vanity page. Then it got stripped down to mainly apologetics, and now it is too narrow.</dd>
<dd>So far, we have identified:
<ul>
<li>Two books that reference his site, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1568582838&amp;id=Iy-F3Dg3LccC&amp;pg=PA616&amp;lpg=PA616&amp;dq=jeff+lindsay&amp;sig=WtncZxe9fuVQVUJ3V2cVPy5tFlo" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1568582838&amp;id=Iy-F3Dg3LccC&amp;pg=PA616&amp;lpg=PA616&amp;dq=jeff+lindsay&amp;sig=WtncZxe9fuVQVUJ3V2cVPy5tFlo" rel="nofollow">one for religion</a>, and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1411646746&amp;id=ZyhxhPLnqNYC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;dq=%22jeff+lindsay%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;sig=WbMiTE_pAe0ZbhQCEpD9OAT8z9g" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1411646746&amp;id=ZyhxhPLnqNYC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;dq=%22jeff+lindsay%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;sig=WbMiTE_pAe0ZbhQCEpD9OAT8z9g" rel="nofollow">one for magic</a>.</li>
<li>Two professional organizations (<a href="http://www.tappi.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.tappi.org/" rel="nofollow">TAPPI</a> and American Paper Institute - now AF&amp;PA) cited his works for best technical papers</li>
<li>He served as director of AIChE Forest Products Division from 1989 to 1995</li>
<li>If you search for "Anti-Mormon" on google, his web site appears on the first page of hits.</li>
<li>Brittanica.com and USA Today each spotlighted his site as a "Hot Site" and "one of the best on the Internet when reviewed for quality, accuracy of content, presentation and usability" respectively. The site has received various other awards and recognitions.</li>
<li>The educators' magazine, <a href="http://www.edweek.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.edweek.org/" rel="nofollow">Education Week</a>, ran a story on Oct. 3, 2001 discussing his <a href="http://www.jefflindsay.com/Block.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.jefflindsay.com/Block.shtml" rel="nofollow">Block Scheduling site</a>.</li>
<li>BYU Chemical Engineering Dept. designated him as the outstanding alumnus for 2004</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>It seems to me that the above list indicates he is notable within apologetics (at least for the lds.org article and high ranking by google on "Anti-Mormon"), professionally (best papers, outstanding alumnus, and director of AIChE Forest Products Division, and the number of patents), general public visibility (USA Today and Brittanica.com), and other fields (e.g., Block Scheduling), so I'm not sure that he has not received any recognition outside of the world he is active in.</dd>

As I mentioned before, since Lindsay has no standing based on formal training his standing must be established by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">outside sources</a>. If he has been involved in a public debate on LDSDNA or has been cited by his adversaries, those are ways to establish his role. Magicianship and expertise in block scheduling aren't. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 00:42, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He doesn't even really have a good background in block scheduling. Most people in the education field who I've talked to regarding him consider his arguments to be pretty soft. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Riley_1176.html" title="User:Adam Riley">Riley</a> 04:33, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>One of the problems of finding outside sources from adversaries is that one of the characteristics of most anti-mormon literature is to ignore any apologetic material, and frame their arguments to imply that no counter-arguments have ever been expressed to their claims. This was recognized by two christian theologians in: Mosser, Carl and Owen, Paul (1997) in <a href="http://www.cometozarahemla.org/others/mosser-owen.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cometozarahemla.org/others/mosser-owen.html" rel="nofollow">Mormon Apologetic Scholarship and Evangelical Neglect: Losing the Battle and Not Knowing It?</a>.</dd>
<dd>The fact that his article appears on the official lds.org site is quite significant, indicating recognition from the apologetic side. This is a site that normally has only writings by high level church leaders and maybe faculty from church-sponsored schools and universities. Every article is carefully reviewed and given approval from high authorities before it is added to the web site, so his DNA article being there is a big deal.</dd>
<dd>As for block scheduling, it sounds like he is known (if not respected) in that field.</dd>
<dd>Let me be clear: I don't agree with much of his non-apologetic writings. He's a conservative and I'm a bleeding-heart liberal, and I think he is dead wrong on a lot of his opinions. Nevertheless, I have to admit that he is at least known in various circles. <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 13:04, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have no idea whether this is true or not, but this very lack of discussion or outside reporting makes it clear that we have a problem with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. But in any case, unless there are other sources forthcoming I think we have discussed this from all sides and have to leave it to the closing administrator to decide whether the article can be kept. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 00:58, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you read the article I pointed to, you will see that at least the authors (who were not LDS, and in fact were on the anti-mormon side) believe that is one of the problems with their approach so far. This also illustrates how it is sometimes very difficult to teach people with no familiarity of a subject matter enough to make informed decisions. It reminds me a little of when people complain about not having reliable references for video games. The fact is, there really isn't many books written about video games, but the comments that appear in the articles I monitor do reflect the "general opinion", based on talking to others. If there isn't a clear answer, hopefully people will trust those who are more familiar with the topic.</dd>
<dd>I still don't understand why, if his web site shows up on the first page of a google search for "anti-mormon", how he can't be notable within that field. Is the problem that anti-mormonism isn't noteable? <a href="../../../w/r/p/User%7EWrp103_3edd.html" title="User:Wrp103">wrp103 (Bill Pringle)</a> 01:19, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I didn't read the full article but I noticed that they 1. don't mention Lindsay but 2. mention <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Nibley_f37e.html" title="Hugh Nibley">Hugh Nibley</a> as the "father of apologetic scholarship", i.e. someone who by academic standing has an article in WP. So I hav no idea if your claim is correct, and it isn't really my job to investigate. My job is to check whether we have sufficient reliable outside resources to write an unbiased article based solely on those sources, and my opinion is no, for reasons amply discussed above: no coverage in the media, no publications is reputable academic outlets, no discussion of his claims in those media. In other words, we are asked to give notability to someone who hasn't established notability for himself in the kinds of sources we consider reliable. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 01:37, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> After a Google image search it seems the Tronichord is quite distinct from the Omnichord: <a href="http://www.suzukimusic.co.uk/images/omnichord.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.suzukimusic.co.uk/images/omnichord.jpg" rel="nofollow">[11]</a><a href="http://www.morgan-fisher.com/images/tronichord+sm.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.morgan-fisher.com/images/tronichord+sm.jpg" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. However to justify itself this article needs to explain in what way the Tronichord is distinct from, say, a standard electric keyboard. It also needs to explain why "Tronichord" is a distinct intrument and not just a brand name. In light of the <a href="../../../s/t/y/Stylophone.html" title="Stylophone">Stylophone</a>, I don't doubt that these are both true. --<a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslaySolomon_7ae5.html" title="User:IslaySolomon">IslaySolomon</a> 02:16, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> A <i>generic</i> musical instrument cannot be non-notable, however <i>this</i> brand of <i>this particular</i> musical instrument, (i beleive) is non-notable. As a parallel example - <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washing_machine.html" title="Washing machine">washing machines</a> are notable white appliances, however there should not be an article on each and every brand and model of washing machine ever produced ... Wikipedia would end up looking like a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comet_%28retailer%29.html" title="Comet (retailer)">Comet</a> catalogue.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Well, the H.P. Lovecraft universe has no fictional military forces, nor does Flatland, The Space Triolgy, Cordwainer Smith's work, King Kong used the very real US Air Force, Blade Runner or Minotry Report movies mention no militaries, Berstein Bears, various Newpaper Comics, the list goes on and on with fictional universes WITHOUT fictional militaries. The list is maintainable, and the pagehistory has shown that various editors have worked very hard to see that each army is verified and categorized properly. I may also note that this list is also quite helpful in catching anyone who makes vanity material and easier to track down other vanity material on wikipedia and elete it. --Eldarone 04:38, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Lists that are so broad that they cannot ever be comprehensive are generally "idiosyncratic non-topics", per the deletion policy. This is just a bunch of things that are all foo, which is an idiosyncratic non-topic. There's no possibility for overview, because there's nothing you can say about all (or even most) of these things besides the fact that they're fictional military organizations. This illustrates no trend or topic, and there cannot ever be an accompanying article nor can this list ever be even half-way comprehensive.

<li><b>Delete</b> per A Man In Black. Is the list entertaining? Not particularly for me, but I'm sure it is for some, but that's not really material to this discussion. Is the list maintainable? It's certainly not the worst offended I've seen, but, as has been said, it has very little chance of becoming comprehensive. Is the list useful? Not unless you already have prior knowledge of the subject, and if you have said knowledge, the list pretty much fails to augment it.

<li><b>Delete:</b> In my opinion, a good list should have some sort of specific cross-referencing use, IE: An index. Or, a good list can give interesting information on its topics, IE: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_United_States_Presidents_64c0.html" title="List of fictional United States Presidents">List of fictional United States Presidents</a>. A good list also has a narrow scope and sticks to it, in this article, the scope is too broad, such as to include government-sponsored militaries, and mercenary corporations which, in some cases, aren't even "military", IE: The A-Team. Not exactly listcruft, but, not exactly useful either. <a href="../../../j/j/j/User%7EJJJJust_79de.html" title="User:JJJJust">JJJJust</a> 19:21, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment'</b> - The A-Team is still a mercenary force, a group that gets paid for military activities. The list only includes, and only, military forces. Throughout history there have been many different types of militaries groups, from small Freelancers to Rome's Voleenteer armies to Warrior caste to paramilitary forces. There is such a board variety of fighting forces in real life as well --Eldarone 20:38, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> While I recognize the A-Team as a mercenary force, I do not recognize them as military and I do not recognize them as an organization and therefore discount their inclusion in the list, and by extension, discount the rationale, scope, and viability of the list. <a href="../../../j/j/j/User%7EJJJJust_79de.html" title="User:JJJJust">JJJJust</a> 23:34, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The A-Team is still a mercenary company, dispite it's small size. It's like saying a Mom and Pop store isn't a bussiness because they don't have 20 stores. Size dosn't matter. If you have a problem with The A-Team being on the list, then go the discussion page and debate it. --Eldarone 02:36, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's symptomic of this list's problems.

<li>Of course not, the A-team is a small Mercenary force that's sort of like a special ops team for hire. Eventually, the A-Team does become part of a larger military agency in the last season. Starfleet is the Military and exploration arm of the United Federation of Planets built more along the lines of traditional military forces. Starfleet is chartered by the Federation, overseen by polticians, and is diffinately a much largeer organization. But both Starfleet and the A-Team are still trained, professional military forces, regardless of size or wither they get paid or not. What exactly is the problem though? I don't quite understand what the problem is. Do you have a problem with Mercs being classsifed as Military? --Eldarone 04:30, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>There's no topic, just a shared attribute.

<li>Yes there is a topic for this list: "Fictional" as in non real, "Military Organization" is the term chosen becaused there is a variety of Military forces, from regular Armed Forces, to Rebels, Mercenaries, Militia, and even culturaly based warriors. Nothing to say as a group? All these are fictional Military forces. That is the topic. If you have issues with the article , then go to the discussion page and discuss it with the editors there. --Eldarone 04:40, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Again, this is such a broad list that it isn't a topic, just a list of things that have a single shared attribute, like a "List of blue things" or "List of three-word phases."

<ul>
<li>It's not a broad list. Every single unit on that list is a Military Force, by diffition (from Dictionary.com):military- adj 1: of or relating to the study of the principles of warfare. All these orgziation have to deal with WARFARE, they are Fictional, must be a group, and they have to be from a notable source. They do not share a single artbute, they all share several attributes. --Eldarone 04:54, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not all of these organizations deal with warfare (I see several exceptions, mostly untested defense groups, mercenaries, and terrorist groups), and nothing in the introduction implies that this is true. All these things seem to have in common is one shared attribute: they're fictional military groups. Just like "things that are blue" and "people with red hair", there's no topic, just a shared attribute. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:04, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is an unencyclopedic entry with a great many problems. The statements concerning nominations for the "Governor General's Prize" [sic] and the Griffin Poetry Prize are incorrect. A Google search for something called the "Governor General's Peace Prize" receives one hit: this very Wikipedia article. Doiron is a little-known figure whose last two books were issued by a print on demand house. This article goes to great lengths in an attempt to raise his profile; and in doing so reveals its point of view. I'm not convinced that there is no place for an article on Doiron in Wikipedia, however I do feel that the exising article should be deleted. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 03:50, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. WP:BIO and WP:WEB by definition don't make space for radical groups outside the mainstream, because they depend on some form of mainstream support for their inclusion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A Squadron and a Wing are rather different. If it was 'renamed' then with was the creation of a new unit.

<li>I have included some additional information in the history. This unit was active in WWII so it likely meets the notability requirements from that action alone.

<dd>Ah, I didn't search on her adopted name. But now that the AfD has been listed, I'd like to see how it plays out. Note that it wasn't she who was extended an invitation, it was her husband.

<li><b>Keep</b> - If we impose this criteria on this article, we will then have to, in fairness, delete a very large number of other articles of major party Congressional candidates that do not meet this criteria.

<p>Yeah I would like to say, that I wanted to make this page for Hope Marie because I honestly feel in my opinion that she supports a lot of good and moral stuff. Her music is powerful and helps people understand that life is short, you only live once and don't dwell on things. She is also a active member of the Army and likes to help people...I honestly feel that in the next year a lot more people are going to be hearing and seeing a lot of great things from Hope Marie. She is a role model to a lot of females and repersents good will and being strong for yourself in a positive way. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirewhiskeyangel_ec73.html" title="User:Firewhiskeyangel">Firewhiskeyangel</a> (<a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFirewhiskeyangel_d792.html" title="User talk:Firewhiskeyangel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Firewhiskeyangel_605c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Firewhiskeyangel">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>You think the articles are about other organ grinders coincidentally named Joe Bush? And the article says he was locked in his room with George, the name of his monkey, not George Bush. I agree that unverifiable facts need to be weeded out of the article, but if you read the articles to which I linked, a lot of these facts are corroborated. <b>Update</b> I should note that those articles are actually the same one article printed in a number of different newspapers.

<li><b>Keep</b> - the article itself describes his notability - much of which in itself appears minor, though is not insignificant, and the cumulative effect of which is to build up the body of an interesting man. A lot of his activity took place in the years before the internet, and in Spain, so finding a lot of sources is perhaps asking too much. However - he directed Boletín de la Institución Libre de Enseñanza for 9 years - and a search for that publication returns <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-08%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22Bolet%C3%ADn+de+la+Instituci%C3%B3n+Libre+de+Ense%C3%B1anza%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-08%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22Bolet%C3%ADn+de+la+Instituci%C3%B3n+Libre+de+Ense%C3%B1anza%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">25,700 ghits</a>. The books mentioned do exist and are for sale. He was "Minister of Communications, Transport and Public Works" during the Spanish Civil War. He was "General Secretary of the Presidency of the Republic". He seems exactly the sort of person a modern and expansive and liberal encyclopedia like Wiki should be picking up and writing articles on.

That's what we're doing." We are not doing that if we are deleting articles solely due to their obscurity. <i>"Detailed obscure topics hurt no-one because it's pretty hard to find them by accident, and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia isn't paper</a>" (from <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Wikipedia:Importance</a>).</i> The man is verifiable. A search shows that he has done the things the article says he has done. The things he has done lift him above the ordinary, and while they do not make him famous they certainly show his life has coloured and enriched the lives of others. His contributions form part of the fabric of the history of Spain and in particular of the debate surrounding Spanish architecture. Ghits is a controversial test anyway and in this case is inappropriate given that this is a Spaniard (a country with a small interest presence) who was mainly active in the days before the internet and in a field which doesn't tend to attract the interest of internet geeks. My feeling is that the article itself (the contents of which are verifiable) gives a good explanation of how notable the man is. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 09:15, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Bad faith? I thought we weren't supposed to assume that. My concern is indeed that some of these sites are self-authored (and vain). Perhaps reworking some of them is the better way to go, perhaps not. That's why I called for this discussion. (<b>None</b> show <b>any</b> indication of having been self-authored? Really?) I would urge further editors to look at the sites. I'm not invested in these articles being deleted, I just am calling for discussion.

It seems to me, with all good will, that GACK is a case-in-point: a deconstructivist wannabe who's gotten some dubious work published in this one press, but has failed to engage the rest of Austria, much less the German-speaking world, much less the English-speaking world.

<li><b>Comment</b> I know I should be taking a wikibreak, but look at this sentence in the article: "He self-identifies as a deconstructive novelist." It's the self-identification bit that is emblematic here. I can't find a single source of anyone else identifying him as any kind of novelist, much less a deconstructive one, much less a notable one. The only sources I find are on his own webpage, that of his good friend, who edited the German article, and the sales page of Passagen Verlag, which lists several of his works on their backlist. Is the bar for notability really this low? <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversitytruth_ac59.html" title="User:Universitytruth">Universitytruth</a> 20:31, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What is your reasoning behind calling them self-authored, then? In this particular case, the article's creator has several hundred edits and has created a number of articles (quite aside from giving his name, which is <i>not</i> "Thea Dorn"). I stop short of calling the nominations bad faith, but if nom's intent is to improve articles, he's misusing the AfD process to do it.

<li>The article's creator is actually the article's translator, but my search of the German site indicates that the article also had several editors there, so seems legitimate after all. Will be glad to improve the article myself at this point. Sorry if I shot the AfD gun too quickly. I think I was confusing (1) whether an article should exist in wikipedia and (2) whether any published German writer should belong on a list of German 'authors'. That is, my concern to distinguish between the Herman Melvilles and the Dan Browns of German lit led me astray. (This is not to say that I would not include Dan Brown, just that that might be an issue internal to the talk page of the relevant list, rather than an AfD.

<p>I nominated this for PROD a few weeks ago, but the notice was removed, and per the agreement on the talk page, I agreed to not nominate it for AfD until the preliminary NTSB report was released. That has now happened, but the report, in the words of one of the article's defenders, "not very interesting". Basically, this is a non-event. Aircraft have minor technical failings leading to emergency landings all the time. No-one was injured or killed in this accident, and it does not look like much is going to come of this. I am not convinced this is notable enough; this year alone, there have been 748 aviation incidents that the NTSB has reported on (did a search on <a href="http://www.ntsb.gov" class="external text" title="http://www.ntsb.gov" rel="nofollow">their website</a>). Unless you are proposing articles for them all, we need to be selective about which ones we keep, and, in my opinion, this is not one of them. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 10:04, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I am the quoted "defender of the article". I'd like to thank Batmanand for holding off on bringing this to AfD until the NTSB preliminary report is out. However, I'd like to clarify that my remarks about "not very interesting" was in regards to the NTSB report specifically, not the entire event. It is still just a preliminary report. I find the event to be interesting, well documented, and notable. I don't claim it is a hugely important event, but I do think it is notable enough to be included here. This incident is very similar to <a href="../../../j/e/t/JetBlue_Airways_Flight_292_52ed.html" title="JetBlue Airways Flight 292">JetBlue Airways Flight 292</a> which did survive AfD. I don't suggest that we should have an article on every incident that generates an NTSB report - some of those reports are even less serious than an emergency landing - such as someone getting injured in the air because they tripped going to the bathroom. However, emergency landings of commercial airliners are not common, and when they generate coverage in the reputable media, as this one has, then they are legitimate topics for articles. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 13:24, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The JetBlue 292 article only survived AfD because it was nominated the day after the incident and a whole crowd of people failed to grasp that it would be forgotten within months. As it indeed was. Nine-odd months down the line, I am not so sure it would survive a second AfD now that people have had a better chance to put the event into perspective. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 15:33, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Looking at other articles in Accidents and incidents on commercial airliners in the United States, it seems like the other noteworthy articles in that category either involved fatalities or extensive injuries, or at least substantial news coverage. Also, the other accidents and incidents in that category usually have some lessons learned and implications for future safety improvements. I don't think those criteria are true for this article (unless the final NTSB investigation shows that there's an issue with airworthiness or maintenance), so in that case, I'd recommend a <b>delete</b>.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. There are some instances where a non-fatal aviation incident is notable. A few weeks ago I wrote <a href="../../../g/-/t/G-TIGK_North_Sea_ditching_7ef5.html" title="G-TIGK North Sea ditching">G-TIGK North Sea ditching</a> because it was featured in an episode of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Crash_Investigation_a016.html" title="Air Crash Investigation">Air Crash Investigation</a>, and the investigation had ramifications for the design ofhelipcopter blades. Some other non-fatal incidents such as <a href="../../../h/a/p/Hapag-Lloyd_Flight_3378_37fc.html" title="Hapag-Lloyd Flight 3378">Hapag-Lloyd Flight 3378</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Transat_Flight_236_dee6.html" title="Air Transat Flight 236">Air Transat Flight 236</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Airways_Flight_5390_c3eb.html" title="British Airways Flight 5390">British Airways Flight 5390</a> had a sufficiently dramatic series of events (fuel exhaustion and the captain being sucked out of the window and surviving) that they are definite encyclopedic topics. In this case we have a nose gear failure and collapse on the runway, but an ultimately successful emergency landing. To me, the incident looks like a thing which will be fairly quickly forgotten. The NTSB makes it report, and takes such incidents very seriously as it should do. However, I fear articles on such minor incidents without any ramifications beyond the incident itself, are likely to clog up the aviation incidents category. If the report produced some findings which for instance led to the grounding of all MD-80 planes for fix-ups of the landing gear, I would reconsider. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:11, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

The current article does not, but there is a difference between "Doesn't meet" and "Article doesn't currently show how they meet". Subject just has to be notable.

<p><s>*<b>Keep</b></s>:Although Egypt has a very long and ancient history of great architecture, its present has very few scientists and engineers. Dr. Prof. Michel Bakhoum was one of the few present engineers who highly contributed to the current Egyptian engineering. He was not only a great and genius engineer but also a great Professor, who taught as mentioned in the article more than ten thousand civil engineers. His designs and teachings has greatly affected the urban development of the city of Cairo and many other cities in Egypt. I believe the article should be kept to inform young students all over the world about his great achievements that are an incentive to each and everyone to achieve more in his/her career. I as a young Egyptian female engineer do not rely on what our ancient Egyptians did but value their mind and their great architecture as much as I value Dr. Michel Bakhoum, the teacher and model of thousands. People like him, who achieve and serve for all their lives are for all of us, young researchers, great examples. Therefore I, and my fellow young scientists and engineers, believe the article must be kept because Dr. Michel Bakhoum is not a forgotten history but a living influence. User:Dina Bakhoum</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I do understand and appreciate your concern about our votes being relatives to the subject but I want to assure you that the reason for our votes is not because we are related to Michel Bakhoum, but because we believe he was an important Egyptian figure with great achievements. Michel Bakhoum is listed in wikipedia in the list of famous Egyptian people among other Egyptian architects. His contributions to Egyptian engineering are no less important than those of the recent architect Hassan Fathy or the ancient Egyptian architect Imhotep. As engineers and as Egyptians (not as relatives) we would like our votes to be considered as we believe that he is, as mentioned before, a living influence and not a forgotten history. <small>Dina Bakhoum</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Please, keep this article. It helps preserve the legacy of a great person who contributed a lot to the development of modern Egypt. I grew up in Cairo, Egypt and went to the school of engineering in Cairo University. Many of us regard him as the greatest civil engineer and one of the best professors of civil engineering in the 20th century in the middle east. I believe people who know about him can contribute to this article and eventually turn it into a first class biography. <small>George Jonaris</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Like it or not, there is a lot of precedence for using WP:BIO as a litmus test. And what is at all notable about having held professorships at different universities? In plain English, all that means is that he's a college professor who has changed jobs.

<dd>Correction, in plain American English, that may be correct, however, the rest of the world doesn't use the term that liberally. He has held chairs, no? Are they not higher than the typical lecturer?

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Since Parks works in the US, "American English" is the relevant interpretation. And there is absolutely <b>nothing</b> notable about being an Associate Professor or Professor in the United States. Are those the "chairs" you were referring to? If so, you should have a look at the article on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor.html" title="Professor">professors</a>, in particular, the section on the North American system. Associate Professor and Professor are not "chairs" in North America (see "named chairs" in the article). <a href="../../../f/b/b/User%7EFbb_fan_c791.html" title="User:Fbb fan">fbb_fan</a> 02:41, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Not merely a school committe member. Longest serving member of one of the largest school districts in the US, the largest by one measure. Leader in education policy both locally, statewide and nationally, as evidenced by references provided. Key figure in local politics (in Florida's second largest county) for decades. I agree with the premise that some school board members might not be notable. For example, the average American school board oversees a district with a couple of thousand students and maybe three sschools. Very large school districts, such as Broward, with its more than 250,000 students and well over 200 schools and other facilities are simply in a different league and are themselves notable entities in American education. As such, such a notable leader of such a district (and leader in other contexts) it notable. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a> 15:02, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Notability requirements do not necessitate his independance of the school board. His notability is quite prominently tied to his membership on the school board. Furthermore, he is well known locally, which also meets wikipedia's notability standards. In other words... just because you haven't heard of him doesn't mean he's nobody. I also believe that taken together, the school board and the university prominence should edge him over the "notability threshhold".

<dd>I should add that I neither know Bob Parks nor either of the other contributors to his article. I don't even remember if I voted for him or not in the last election. I <i>do</i> know of him. I also know that our school board, being elected county-wide, is heavily covered in the news, and its members more often than not tend to be local celebrities who often move on to other elected positions. Furthermore, I am a longtime contributor to Wikipedia and know something about our notability requirements. Let me quote:</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. My objection was not "he's not notable because I haven't heard of him". Since you claim to be knowledgeable about notability, I'm sure you know that the burden of proof of notability is on the editors; it's not the reader's responsibility to track down the appropriate references to establish it. The article was nominated because as written, it did not come close to establishing any significant notability. <a href="../../../f/b/b/User%7EFbb_fan_c791.html" title="User:Fbb fan">fbb_fan</a> 03:13, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I disagree with the comment that "as written, it did not come close to establishing any significant notability". Although I freely acknowledge that I did not write the perfect article here, I did provide a link in the form of the school board web page about him (and somehow questioning the factual accuracy of a governmental webpage about one of its officials sems a little bit over skeptical) that discussed his numerous roles in the educational community and the community at large. Although perhaps more sources would have been useful, enough evidence of local notability was present that, though a clean-up or add sources tag may have made sense, an AFD nomination was overkill. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a> 03:45, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. If the "governmental webpage" you're referring to is the Broward Schools site, I think the bigger issue is whether that establishes notability (though I still claim that they might not be totally objective - they certainly aren't going to post something negative about their own board member). Listing his degrees, work experience, and community activities doesn't meet the Wikipedia standard for notability, in my opinion. I agree that it establishes that he's active in the community, but every community has people like that, and most of them are not notable by Wikipedia standards. <a href="../../../f/b/b/User%7EFbb_fan_c791.html" title="User:Fbb fan">fbb_fan</a> 22:22, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> First, I agree with your "every community has perople like that" point to an extent. The problem is that this is not any community. This is one of the five or six largest school districts in the country (and the largest by one measure). Beyond the school district, Broward County (in which he plays a prominent role, as evidenced by the sources provided), is the 15th most heavily populated county in the US <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/counties/CO-EST2004-08.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.census.gov/popest/counties/CO-EST2004-08.html" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> and number 2 in Florida <a href="http://www.eflorida.com/countyprofiles/ranking.asp?level1=3&amp;level2=127&amp;level3=339" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eflorida.com/countyprofiles/ranking.asp?level1=3&amp;level2=127&amp;level3=339" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. You are correct that the school district website may be biaed in favor of including positive information, but it is unclear why he would be any less notable if negative information were also included. In fact, negative information (eg some kind of controversy, though as far as I know he has never been involved in one) would actually make him more notable. Finally, although I admit that this is not official wikipedia policy, several dedicated, long-term wikipedia users have worked diligently to improve wikipedia coverage of Florida in general and Broward County in particular. One of these users, who is also an administrator (<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastique_e135.html" title="User:Bastique">user:Bastique</a>, above) has weighed in with further evidence of Parks' notability. If there is ambiguity in this situation, wouldn't it just be more collegial of you to defer to those of us who have worked so hard to improve this corner of wikipedia? <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 00:13, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I'm not sure that your final point is valid. Editors of a page or a set of pages are likely to be biased (for obvious reasons) in favor of keeping pages they have worked on, or that are part of a project they work on (realistically, do you think anyone would vote "delete" on their own work?). Also, I have never seen any evidence that people "take the editor's word for it" that an entry is notable. In any case, I still remain unconvinced that Parks personally deserves a page. I think good arguments have certainly been made in favor of an entry on the Broward School Board - but not necessarily the individuals that comprise it. <a href="../../../f/b/b/User%7EFbb_fan_c791.html" title="User:Fbb fan">fbb_fan</a> 01:08, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. per nom. Although there has been much dispute, which I have been involved in, over this article, the added references are regarding shows that took place at the theater, mostly by other production companies who rented the space. There are still no references for numerous points in the article which the creator and her sockpuppets are not allowing others to edit, even when there have been references (including the New York Times, which the creator now agrees is a reputable source). Based on these actions of the creator, it remains a vanity article.--<a href="../../../n/y/t/User%7ENYTheaterHistorian_5ef1.html" title="User:NYTheaterHistorian">NYTheaterHistorian</a> 06:16, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Grove Street Playhouse, originally the Courtyard Playhouse, is VERY NOTABLE for being one of the very FIRST and longest surviving Off-Off Broadway theatres. the "small NYT blurb from 5 yrs ago about an obscure zoning dispute" which Merzbow cites on the Marilyn Majeski project page, is actually a full 1/2 page article on page 3 of the NY Times, complete with photo of Ms. Majeski, which details a much longer and richer history of this theatre, which dates back to the days of Cino's Cafe. ("Making It Work: Serial Drama at Grove Street Playhouse", Corey Kilganon, NY Times, 01/24/99). I also found an article on Backstage.com ("Miss Majesty's Licked: Grove Street Shudders) which also chronicles the 49 year history of this theatre. Perhaps for vanity reasons, Majeski has limited the editorials exclusively to the period after 1994 when she changed the company's name.</p>
<p>I trust the NY Times fact checkers, according to Wikipedia's standards this is considered a highly reliable source. Likewise, Backstage is equally reliable as the #1 trade publication for theatre. Grove Street Playhouse is an important part of theatrical history and should not be deleted, but kept and cleaned up.</p>
<p>I think that NYTheatreHistorian should be blocked from editing this page, because clearly he has some sort of personal vendetta against this woman. The edit history shows a clear pattern of vandalism on his part. Most disturbing aren his repeated attempts to reveals her current place of employment. My understanding is that divulging personal information is strictly against Wikipedia policy. Although, I disagree with Ms. Majeski's use of socks, if she is being "stalked" as she claims, perhaps she is doing this out of fear. Irregardless, the history of this organization should not be deleted because of it's former artistic director's bad behavior.</p>

<li><b>DON'T Delete</b> --GaelMac 00:24, 8 July 2006 (UTC) -- I first caught a sample of Ms. Hiller's work on a United Airlines flight -- an interview with Ben Stein that was possibly one of the finest interviews I've ever heard. Evidently the other posters don't travel much -- or don't listen to the broadcasts available to them inflight. The shows Ms. Hiller produces for Sky Radio have included interviews with such notables as Pres. Jimmy Carter, Madeleine Albright, Johnnie Cochran, Donald Trump, Steve Wynn, George Maloof &amp; Eli Broad -- to name just a handful. I'd say that's a pretty impressive roster -- not to mention her interview with the late Caspar Weinberger -- and that's only the tip of the iceberg of the interviews she has either conducted, written and/or produced. The targeted listeners are top-of-the-line CEOs, Chairmen and Presidents of major companies/corporations, and Ms. Hiller is often a behind-the-scenes person, so perhaps that is why the posters here are not aware of the quality AND quantity of her work. I guarantee, however, that the folks mentioned above know Ms. Hiller and her work and would consider her "notable" enough for inclusion in Wikipedia's database.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, yes... and a note to Isotope23... I believe Ms. Hiller's remark about the porn bio was with tongue firmly planted in cheek... as in facetious...</p>
<p>(from someone "notable" enough to have worked on 40+ films/TV shows, have music in about a dozen and appeared in a handful)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> GaelMac 01:00, 10 July 2006 (UTC) -- from Wikipedia's own guidelines: <i>"...Lack of fame is not the same as vanity..."</i> so while Ms. Hiller might not be famous, she certainly doesn't merit a "vanity" claim. After all, when was the last time any of the above detractors sat down for a chat with any famous folks? Ms. Hiller certainly has been an integral part of many interviews with major policy-makers and corporate leaders who HAVE changed society (for better or worse, depending on one's point of view) -- the content and effects of which will likely last far beyond any of our lifetimes (which IS a criteria noted in the BIO guidelines, along with: <i>"...widely recognized contribution..."</i> -- and I'd say that millions of listeners -- including Presidents, Congresspersons, Secretaries of State and major, worldwide corporate CEOs -- constitutes a <i>"widely recognized contribution"</i> despite Ms. Hiller's lack of out-of-the-industry "fame"). Ms. Hiller's work is WHY millions of people get to hear what these current and former leaders have to say. That seems pretty "notable" to me.</li>

<p>wikipedia does however reflect small scale growing sports, as all of the major sports had their origins in small groups of people. as such this article must be allowed as it gives good publicity to a sport we are seeking to publicise. already there is a tournament held for anyone next weekend at bournemouth beach.</p>

<p>This is intended as a testcase. There are added recently many very short stubs about gotras, which are basically clans. This is a typical one. It just says, if I understand it correctly, that this is one of the many clans in this region of India. This seems to be rather useless and an example of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. I am not going to list all of them yet, as there are way too many (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jat_clans_e278.html" title="List of Jat clans">List of Jat clans</a> for just one region, and <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajput_clans.html" title="Rajput clans">Rajput clans</a> for another), but if this one gets deleted, I would like a proposal as to how I (or anyone) can best procedd to delete all the other ones (of similar content: there are some which are notable (clans of rulers etcetera) and undeletable for other reasons). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 14:00, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewlia.html" title="Jewlia">Jewlia</a> is on social group of India. It has been written encyclopedic way. I got it in svenska wikipedia and thought to put on English wikipedia as well. I do not think there is any harm in it. It is going to increase a knowledge base. I searched Jewlia which I found on wiki- svenska and not on eng-wiki. I think it is not violating the policy of wikipedia in any way and hence should not be deleted. <a href="../../../l/r/b/User%7ELRBurdak_7c15.html" title="User:LRBurdak">burdak</a> 16:10, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> primarily based on the fact that this article is not in any way <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiably</a> sourced, so it does violate that policy. Beyond that, I don't see the purpose of numerous individual articles on gotras that just say "X is a gotra of the Jat Clan". <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jat_clans_e278.html" title="List of Jat clans">List of Jat clans</a> seems to sum that statement up quite nicely and at least to me makes the individual articles completely unecessary. In the case of particular gotras that have made a significant contribution to society (that can of course be sourced), perhaps an individual article can be created. I don't see any common sense purpose for individual articles right now, though I am willing to consider reasons why this should stay.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:32, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I saw a few of these while new page patrolling a couple days ago. This one is typical of those I saw. The whole package can go, either by prod or by a group nom.

<li><b>Comment</b> With respect, if you're setting about writing an encyclopedia entry about yourself <i>before</i> you've finished your first animation you've probably got your priorities wrong. Also, wikipedia is a terrible way to get yourself heard about. The Mediawiki software has a very inflexable search engine, the only people who'll be able to find your page will be you.

There are plenty of up-and-coming bands, authors, and so on that simply don't meet Wikipedia's notability guidelines yet. Again, if you've got a decent argument for why she meets Wikipedia's notability standards for people (as provided in my link), please let us know — we're <i>not</i> poets, and thus may not be as familiar with Ms. Habel as you.

<li>Hello. Well, I will leave it up to you. I guess I would consider her a significant poet and to have a significant following in the world of chapbooks and paper arts, but I don't want to step on anyone's toes. I mean, I've never met her or anything. I know a lot of my colleagues found her book beautiful. She's not as infamous as WS Merwin or Sylvia Plath, but there are so few poetry superstars in the contemporary world...it's not the same as the world of fiction or rock, where there are clear celebrities...I guess, looking at the link you sent me, I consider her to have a fan base. Thanks, I'll leave it to your discretion. Parkerposes 04:23, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, let me ask you this. One criteria for people's notability is: "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work." Can you provide references of Ms. Habel having received multiple independent reviews of or awards for her work? (I know that there's the reference to her semifinalist — but that's not an award, just a placement.) —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;<span class="plainlinks">(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk</a></span>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">contribs</a>) 04:36, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. All this is very confusing with the moves, redirects, blankings, and so forth.

However, if the <i>content</i> of this article is to be retained, it looks like it should go under an article named "Virtuso Universal Server" rather than this article name (OpenLinkVirtuoso), as that appears to be the correct name... so I will now move both the article to that (just-deleted) name, as well as this AfD, and relist this AfD, hoping that that makes the most sense. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 16:49, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> To clarify - OpenLinkVirtuoso has now been moved to Virtuoso Universal Server, so this AfD is now actually an AfD on the article named Virtuoso Unviersal Server. The previous article named Virtuoso Universal Server has just recently been deleted per consensus at that AfD. It's claimed above that the content of thetwo articles was very similar, for what that is worth. The whole thing looks a ploy to prevent Virtuoso Universal Server (or at any rate the material in the article) from being deleted at its AfD, so in a way this could be seen as a re-creation of a deleted article, but it's not as clear-cut as that, since the article OpenLinkVirtuoso was created <i>before</i> (the original) Virtuoso Universal Server article was deleted. Ploy or no, I don't see that convincing arguments have been made at either AfD, so I think we should look at it again and that the article should stand or fall on its merits. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 17:17, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note that the PC mag article doesn't describe the term as used here (read it). There are, in fact, more than three companies who make a product which they dub a "Universal Server," but they all do different things. Not listed in the article, for example, is RealNetworks's <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,543721,00.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,543721,00.asp" rel="nofollow">Helix Universal Server</a>, which is a web server with a streaming media feature. Then there's <a href="http://www.pgp.com/products/universal/500/pgpuniversalcomponents.html#unserv" class="external text" title="http://www.pgp.com/products/universal/500/pgpuniversalcomponents.html#unserv" rel="nofollow">PGP Universal Server</a>, which is a firewall that can supply public keys. There are many other examples, but I'm purposely limiting discussion here to those which are substantially more well-known than the OpenLink product. Oracle Universal Server, while referenced in the article, doesn't meet the "definition" given there. In short, an accurate definition of the term might be, "A server for which the vendor's marketing department has determined that the adjective 'Universal' would maximize revenue." That's all fine and good, but it's not notable in my opinion and it's certainly not what the article says right now. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraig_Stuntz_f2ad.html" title="User:Craig Stuntz">Craig Stuntz</a> 13:50, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> This article was previously nominated in January and was kept with No Consensus. The previous AfD discussion is <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_I_LIEK_MILK%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21_b10f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/I LIEK MILK!!!!!!!!">here</a>. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 20:02, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The previous AfD had quite a few Keep votes. This may have been influence partly by the first commenter in the previous AfD, who noted 19,000 Google hits on the phrase; I get 274 unique hits, so one of us is doing something wrong. It may meet <a href="../../../m/e/m/WP%7EMEMES_a511.html" title="WP:MEMES">WP:MEMES</a>. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 20:10, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>It sounds like he didn't quote the phrase properly in the search. Also, note that <a href="../../../m/e/m/WP%7EMEMES_a511.html" title="WP:MEMES">WP:MEMES</a> is merely a proposed guideline and it has a significant number of detractors (myself included) who think that it sets the bar for inclusion in the encyclopedia far too low. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 20:49, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, reviewing <a href="../../../m/e/m/WP%7EMEMES_a511.html" title="WP:MEMES">WP:MEMES</a>, maybe it's not as bad as I thought. The only guideline for notability is "has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works in reliable sources independent of the meme itself". There's no way in hell this meme meets that guideline. Maybe, <i>maybe</i>, it was written up in a newspaper, but it wouldn't have been anything but a fluff piece, and thus trivial. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 20:52, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete.</b> The article has absolutely no legitimate basis for existing within Wikipedia's database, for it was clearly created based on an individual's biased perspective on an internet website. The article contains many unnecessary references to certain individuals and actually derides them within its text. This is absolutely unnecessary and should not be tolerated. Very little factual information is being displayed, for the article is filled with opinionated, idiosyncratic statements with the sole intention of <i><b>promoting</b></i> the website. The absence of a neutral point of view throughout it, the inability to verify many of the article's statements, and the fact that it was written from an idiosyncratic perspective with the intention of advertising the webpage on Wikipedia, thus, legitimizes its deletion. Furthermore, one can visit the website's forum itself at www.mvpmods.com and discover that the creation of this page has clearly been an immature advertising campaign in order to arouse amusement amongst its members.

<li><b>comment</b>It is the duty of the voters here to change their votes from deletion to keep. The article is cited in the media unlike other forums found on wikipedia. The initial creation of the article, far before this version, was done without the members of the site's knowledge for purposes dealing with information, not advertising. People here hinge their deletion arguments on "dopesn't satify wiki requirements" or "too much pov statements." These have all been deleted and citation has been added. Change your vote, change your reasoning, or admit that you have no interest in sticking to wiki's actual rules and purpose: information for the people. --wikilagata, 7 July 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment for vote</b> That doesn't subtract from its legitimacy.</li>
<li><b>Comment against vote</b> Same reason as Razum's. Seems that those who support MVP Mods are either contributors or their friends. While I think the site should get a mention in the article for the game that it's based on, this attempt to create an article is simply for promoting the site. Also, there's seems to be implication that those who are for keeping the articles are somehow "management" or "bosses" of Wikipedia who are holding the good guys down. I sense immaturity is running rampant here. -- CRiyl 01:55, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment against comment against vote</b> So, those who are interested in Subject X are unsurprisingly interested in Subject X in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> If by "Subject X" you mean MVP Baseball, then yes as it is a well-known franchise that has (p)reviewed by many in the video game media and was a subject (or victim, depending on your POV) of the sports game licensing wars. If you mean modifying video games in general then there's already an article for it. I don't see anything wrong with contributing to either MVP Baseball or game mods article to illustrate how places like MVP Mods extend the game experience given those contributions conform to policy.

Is that what is being claimed here (because that's what <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>3 is referring to)?

<li><b>Comment</b> I have to agree with JChap. I have been contributing to this web site for quite some time and just cannot see how this article can be included in its encyclopedia database. Yes, certain web sites that are NOTEWORTHY (IGN, Yahoo, Google) should certainly be the subjects of articles. I have never heard of MVPMods, however, prior to locating its page today.

<li><b>Comment</b> Ok, well if YOU have never heard of it, it must not be worthy of inclusion. I personally don't think there should be any entires about modding and mods for any games in the wiki but there are. There's loads of entries about mods and sites for first person shooters <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Computer_game_mods" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Computer_game_mods" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>but because the best selling baseball game of all-time is not popular among Wikipedians it becomes not worthy of inclusion (example - it is not even listed as a 'Notable release' here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_in_video_gaming" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_in_video_gaming" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>. MVP 2005 is a popular game amongst the general public, many of whom are not as internet-savvy as those in the first person shooter communities. The PS2 version alone was the 7th highest selling game in the US last year<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=7794" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=7794" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>, (The mvpmods site is a site devoted to PS2, Xbox and PC versions of the game) I have yet to see anyone 'expert' in the world of sports video-gaming disagree with the notion that mvpmods is the most popular site for video game baseball modding. Also there are no big ign or gamespy awards for mods and sites like there are for first person shooters. And it is also difficult for major sites like ESPN and others to refer to the site because of a concern about being seen to tacitly endorse possible licencing violations with various 'unlicenced' players (Barry Bonds) and things like beer advertisments being included in some of the mods.

<li><b>Comment</b> If the ARTICLE does not prove that it passes <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, it fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. This has nothing to do with popularity among Wikipedians. This has to do with proving notability as per agreed guidelines as they stand at this time. The burden of proof is on the article to demonstrate it is a notable subject, not on Wikipedians to prove it isn't. If the activities of the website are such that they potentially break game licenses and cause potential legal issues for reliable reporting sources (as seems to be claimed here), then why on earth should Wikipedia be left open to those same potential legal problems by including an article about the site on here? Wikipedia insists on reliable third party sources exactly because it wants verifiability, which guards against any potential legal issues. This is not a blog hosting site for mavericks and avant-garde niche artistes who are otherwise put down by The Man and his awkward insistence on the Law, this is an encyclopedia, beholden to applicable laws itself.

<li><b>Comment</b> It does, a piece has been provided from Computer Games Magazine ABOUT the site. You say the article is not about the site, but it is, if you actually read it. Wikipedia has no legal problems refering to the site because wikipedia does not have a commercial relationship with Major League Baseball. The burden of proof seems to be much lower for games with a large following amongst the 'hardcore' internet community. It seems a mention in a magazine is all they need.Corinh 23:45, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep if cleaned up</b> POV writing does not require deletion of an article; it can be cleaned up. The case for deletion in this case then seems to be about notability. Above is correct that you <i>can't</i> say it is the #1 site without citing that claim to an outside source. If it really is that popular, however, its popularity (even if not #1-ness) should be verifiable. That it isn't done so far doesn't mean it can't be done, and if it really is mentioned in published magazines as said above, it could be done. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 20:53, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It meets the guidelines more than many of the sites listed in that category. Unlike the First Person shooter fan-sites, due to MLB licencing restrictions 'modding' for this game is not endorsed let alone even acknowleged by the game's manufacturer (The original game itself can no longer be sold by EA Sports). The licencing issue and the legal grey area mods for licenced sports-games occupy contributes to the lack of 'official' (read-corporate owned) references. It should be noted that the one reference in the entry is from the only independently owned videogames magazine in the United States.Corinh 02:59, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>OK, well I don't make a habit of reading Italian nationalist/fascist websites, but I don't claim to be an authority on Italian musicians, either. Seems like the artist's obscurity in America is the reason for citing her as "non-notable." Again, this isn't about the artist's politics, it's about her notability.

<li>Do Not Delete - The argument that supposes that this should be deleted because it is too new seems absurd. Einstein's Theory of Relativity was published on a certain day—say, Tuesday. Does it hold that it shouldn't have been written about on Wednesday? Would the Wikipedia community have deleted an entry for "The Theory of Relativity" because it was too new? Simply put, the argument for deletion has nothing to do with the content of the article. If it goes down, it should go down on its own merits. Further, others in the Wikipedia community have now sourced other materials that speak to the same phenomenon. To my mind, this only bolsters the case for not deleting it. If my arguments remain unpersuasive, however, I am certainly open to the idea of moving this to a subsection of Derbyshire’s biographical page. --BeingClever 08:31, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Do Not Delete. Move, Instead.</b>. Careful now. When you call someone a “hack” because of where he works, you’re giving us insight into your political bias—and some possible motivations for wanting this entry deleted. It did go a long way toward proving my point: that the argument is still barely (if at all) about the Hypothesis itself. Engaging in libel for the purposes of getting your way? For shame. Further, HCI has apparently begun to branch out to the world at large. See <a href="http://nashvillesnews.net/node/190902" class="external text" title="http://nashvillesnews.net/node/190902" rel="nofollow">this</a> for a (very) small example. I am ultimately convinced, however, that this argument is all but over. It would likely be best (and most appropriate) for this to be moved into the Wikipedia entry for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Derbyshire_3a10.html" title="John Derbyshire">John Derbyshire</a>, awaiting further citations from the world at large.

<li><b>Comment</b> Do we really keep <i>all</i> locations worldwide no matter how tiny, basically because there's no conflicting policy that says otherwise? This is a genuinely new one on me, and it leads to some odd situations - I've seen several articles about locations deleted vigorously in AfD in the past, and these were of much greater significance than a Californian town with no inhabitants, for example. Admittedly, these weren't Californian locations being deleted...</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, short answer: yes. There's no real policies on notability, either - only "guidelines". The guideline for towns is noted from precendent in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents</a> (under <i>Cities and shops</i>). You can also look up historical debates on towns that were nominated and read the debates, some of them have much longer answers to your question. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Morristown%2C_Ohio_7957.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Morristown, Ohio">Morristown, Ohio AFD</a> has a good mini-essay from <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">User:Geogre</a> that may be useful.

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for those links. The articles deleted were, I believe (bit vague, sorry), boroughs or suburbs of UK cities. Notability seemed an issue in those discussions. However, per this AfD, I am not sure notability should have been an issue at all. A suburb can have a demonstrably stronger significance as a local identity, population, bunch of buildings, etc., whatever you like, as compared to a "town" with nobody living there, as an extreme example. I will bear in mind what has been said here. But, IMO, if a suburb of a city that may hold (say) 10,000 people can warrant deletion, that shows some kind of hole in current policy/precedent re WP locations. But thanks again. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 01:21, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article about this director is a stub; and, as a community, we are supposed to value stubs as useful first steps toward complete articles. If this article is deleted on the grounds that the director has only made one film, or on the grounds that the film has not yet been released, then steps should be taken to delete other US Film Director Stubs on the same grounds. There are quite a few such stubs, including articles on: <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Roecker_f333.html" title="John Roecker">John Roecker</a>, Adam Minarovich, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicedisc.html" title="Nicedisc">Nicedisc</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrik-Ian_Polk_ae60.html" title="Patrik-Ian Polk">Patrik-Ian Polk</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennyson_Bardwell_0287.html" title="Tennyson Bardwell">Tennyson Bardwell</a>, and <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Giglio_4046.html" title="Tony Giglio">Tony Giglio</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - First off, I unbolded this "vote" and bolded your original one, since you've already posted your opinion (at least) once. (Forgive the snarkiness, but maybe you need to make sure you know which username you're logged in under before signing "unique" comments?) As for your reasoning here, as <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> noted, bad articles are not an excuse for more bad articles.

<p>This is not a valid <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criterion for speedy deletion</a>, so I'm instead taking the issue to AfD on their behalf.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Yes, it's a poorly written article, and there is some overlap with <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat_pump.html" title="Heat pump">Heat pump</a>, but I'm not convinced that it is totally redundant. <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phase_change_heat_pump.html" title="Phase change heat pump">Phase change heat pump</a> attempts to look at yer basic fridge in more detail, while <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat_pump.html" title="Heat pump">Heat pump</a> tries to take on too much. Some kind-hearted engineer (don't look at me; I've lost my copy of Eastop &amp; McConkey) needs to overhaul all these heat pump pages. At the very least, someone should look at the articles on the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnot_cycle.html" title="Carnot cycle">Carnot cycle</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rankine_cycle.html" title="Rankine cycle">Rankine cycle</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stirling_cycle.html" title="Stirling cycle">Stirling cycle</a> and think hard.--<a href="../../../b/a/u/User%7EBaumfabrik_141d.html" title="User:Baumfabrik">die Baumfabrik</a> 22:45, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It could be improved especially in making it clear that it is a type of heat pump and the specific fundamental difference between this and other types of heat pumps. (I understand the difference but not due to the article.) Note that the other types of heat pump would need to also be AfDed or merged as well. Fyi the phase change heat pump takes advantage of <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latent_heat.html" title="Latent heat">latent heat</a> of a phase change.

<li><b>Keep</b> notability <i>is</i> claimed - Michelmore is a TV news presenter in the UK. I see nowhere in the article that mentions he's a weather-person.

<dd>Agreed, but the links do show notability of the subject. I'm happy to do the work to expand the article based on these and other links, though hopefully the original author will do it. A poor article about a notable subject should be expanded, not deleted in the general case.

<p>From deletion guidelines: <i>The published works must be someone else writing about the company, corporation, product, or service. (See Wikipedia:Autobiography for the verifiability and neutrality problems that affect material where the subject of the article itself is the source of the material.) The barometer of notability is whether people independent of the subject itself (or of its manufacturer, creator, or vendor) have actually considered the company, corporation, product or service notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works that focus upon it.</i></p>

<p>So people who care a lot about coffee around the web are talking about the aeropress. It would seem to me that a Wikipedia entry is called for. I'm new to this though. If not, then please tell me why. Should any of the above reviews be linked as references? As the reviews are overwhelmingly positive, this might seem even more spammy.

<li><b>Comment</b>: blogs do not count as reliable sources, as anyone can write anything and there is no accountability.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I can understand this with regard to comments on blogs, but when prominent bloggers themselves write something on their blog, there is as much "accountability", if not more, than many other publishing media. Thanks for the links. I see this:</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Exceptions may be when a well-known, professional researcher writing within his field of expertise, or a well-known professional journalist, has produced self-published material. In some cases, these may be acceptable as sources, so long as their work has been previously published by credible, third-party publications, and they are writing under their own names, and not a pseudonym.</i></p>
<p>So a blog by someone like Juan Cole might be considered a reliable source. I'm not saying that any of the above qualify as such. I doubt they do. Thanks again for helping me with the process.--Bephillips 23:15, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm the contributor who contested the prod, and my reasons remain valid: "The Crystal Ball policy states that articles must be verifiable- the sources provided in the article provide that verification; the article doesn't contain speculation ungrounded in statements by the persons involved. It next states that to merit inclusion, the subject matter would have to merit an article, assuming it actually occurs. There is a fairly good history of including major studio films in Wikipedia, and Varjak Paw will be a major studio film." All of the statements in the article come from the Jim Henson Company press release (duplicated off site, which can be confirmed with a trivial Google search) and Movie Insider. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 21:02, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per above, Crystal Ballisms are things that can not be proved to exist and are like "hopefully (insert name) will aprove and it will win a million dollars."

<li>If the consensis is I have misapplied the crystal ball, no problem; but my take on reading the press release was that the book was only optioned (along with the second book); also the cast has yet to be anounced as per the article - while the reputation of those involved is not in question, if this film will be made and released is (in my opinion).--<a href="../../../g/a/y/User%7EGay_Cdn_0b6b.html" title="User:Gay Cdn">Gay Cdn</a> 21:57, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article has been much improved and the copyvios removed. Since sponsorship is a big part of the FIFA World Cup, I feel the article arguably has merit as a standalone article, separate from a treatment of on-the-field antics. The content seems verifiable. What it could maybe use is a little NPOV consideration, as it reads a little too heavy on the negatives for me, and does not tell us, for example, exactly what the sponsorship cash is spent on, what the WC would be like if there wasn't this kind of sponsorship, etc. It surely can't be <i>all</i> evil corp greed can it?&#160;;-) But, whatever, this can all be cleaned up in time. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 19:48, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are incorrect. This term was actually used by Twins fans. Twins television broadcasters (Dick Bremer and Bert Blyleven) liked to talk about it in particular. I am not sure I am spelling the term correctly and was planning on making redirect links to possible alternate spellings (mainly "Dusty Kielmohr"). Actually, I just did a Google search for that spelling, and found numerous hits. See: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=dusty+kielmohr" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=dusty+kielmohr" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=dusty+kielmohr</a> .

<p>Dusty Kilmore lives! This is great, as a huge Twins fan, I just want to say that this is exactly the kind of thing I come to Wikipedia looking for, history that can not be found anyshere else. This is for real, it was a major part of a highly rated baseball telecast in a major market for an entire season.

<p>I disagree with a few things. First, this article is not <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">"fancruft"</a>. The term "Dusty Kielmohr" was used by a large number of baseball fans in the Twin Cities, who were closely following the local Major League Baseball team as it pursued a pennant (which it won). The Google link I cited above demonstrates this. There are all sorts of articles on obscure occurrences in Major League Baseball, whether it involves the Twins' <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circle_Me%2C_Bert_7910.html" title="Circle Me, Bert">Circle Me, Bert</a> phenomenon or <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Bartman_33a7.html" title="Steve Bartman">Steve Bartman</a>'s unfortunate day at a Cubs game. These events are important to baseball fans in their respective markets, and there are thousands upon thousands of such fans.</p>
<p>I wrote this article specifically because I was chatting with somebody the other day, and he used the term "Dusty Kielmohr." I remembered the term, but couldn't remember what it meant. This is exactly the sort of situation where Wikipedia can come in useful. To be sure, it's trivial, but so is a lot of the stuff on here. Unlike fancruft, I researched the article before writing to ensure the accuracy of the statistics (i.e., combined batting average, home runs, etc.) and facts (i.e., who was traded for whom on what date). I wrote it in a tongue-in-cheek fashion, but that is a stylistic choice that other writers can change if they so desire. (It seemed appropriate for a piece of baseball trivia.) It doesn't detract from the value of having the article in the first place. The only thing I got wrong was the spelling of the term. (It's a term coined by local sportswriters, so it's not something with a proper dictionary spelling anyway.) Other people could likely make the same spelling mistake, so it seems reasonable to have a redirect link from the other spelling.</p>
<p>Second, I do not think it is appropriate to link this article to Bobby Kielty, any more than it is appropriate to Dustan Mohr. The term "Dusty Kielmohr" was used specifically to refer to *both* players, and not one or the other. It might be appropriate to have a link to the Dusty Kielmohr article on both <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dustan_Mohr_2e45.html" title="Dustan Mohr">Dustan Mohr's Wikipedia page</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Kielty_3543.html" title="Bobby Kielty">Bobby Kielty's Wikipedia page</a>, or to have a link to both of those pages from this one, but not an entire redirect.</p>
<p>Dusty Kielmohr is a legitimate piece of Twins baseball history and deserves a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkyfry_2cab.html" title="User:Sparkyfry">Sparkyfry</a> 02:54, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> There seems to be a lot of these fan-based Twins references, including <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_Patrol_%28baseball%29_c4e0.html" title="Soul Patrol (baseball)">Soul Patrol (baseball)</a>, which you don't mention above, and which itself alludes to <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dusty_Kielmohr_48ed.html" title="Dusty Kielmohr">Dusty Kielmohr</a>. Since these are just fans' colloquialisms for this or that set of their own players (jeez, the sports teams I support, there have been hundreds of these names over the years), using a redirect to the relevant article involving either the team itself or the players themselves (wikilink to one, make the assertion about the naming convention plus links to the other articles from there) surely makes more sense than having these spurious articles everywhere duplicating information? Other than the yoking together of players under a temporary soubriquet, these names say nothing that can't be handled in the players' own articles IMO. It strikes me as a bit odd that this is apparently a very important name, and yet it gets only 15 Google hits, and the <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Kielty_3543.html" title="Bobby Kielty">Bobby Kielty</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dustan_Mohr_2e45.html" title="Dustan Mohr">Dustan Mohr</a> pages currently don't reference each other or this name <i>at all</i>. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 03:38, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>First off, I never claimed that Dusty Kielmore was "a very important name." Few people would attempt to argue that the contributions of Dustan Mohr and Bobby Kielty to the Twins franchise rival those of <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirby_Puckett_892b.html" title="Kirby Puckett">Kirby Puckett</a> or <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmon_Killebrew_67d2.html" title="Harmon Killebrew">Harmon Killebrew</a>. I certainly wouldn't. What I did say is that it is a *legitimate* part of recent Twins history. It was a term many people who followed the team used, and as such, is part of the history of things associated with the team. Neither would I describe these terms as simply "fan-based." The terms were of course used by fans, but this is primarily because the local sports media -- I'm talking about major networks and newspapers, not fanzines -- were strong advocates of the terms, writing articles about them and discussing them on TV. I don't have access to Lexis Nexis, but I bet a search of "Soul Patrol" or "Dusty Kielmore" would turn up several stories in the Minnepaolis and St. Paul papers. Finally, giving a nickname to a group of players on one team is not a quaint practice used up here in the backwards Upper Midwest, but is commonplace in our sports-obsessed nation. This practice is reflected in Wikipedia articles such as <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murderers%27_Row_149a.html" title="Murderers' Row">Murderers' Row</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purple_People_Eaters_f28d.html" title="Purple People Eaters">Purple People Eaters</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Horsemen_%28football%29_12eb.html" title="Four Horsemen (football)">The Four Horsemen</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monsters_of_the_Midway_f99a.html" title="Monsters of the Midway">Monsters of the Midway</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steel_Curtain_bac2.html" title="Steel Curtain">Steel Curtain</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hogs_%28American_football%29_31b5.html" title="The Hogs (American football)">The Hogs</a>, etc. Dusty Kielmore may not compare to these legendary groups of athletes, but being a recognized, major-league entity certainly makes them worthy of a short article on Wikipedia. And a redirect wouldn't work for such a group, because the group is distinct from the individual players. It doesn't seem particularly remarkable that neither Kielty's nor Mohr's pages reference Dusty Kielmore, but I imagine it will happen with time. If it's truly that important to you, I'll add it myself. Oh, and your mention of the Soul Patrol was interesting. (I should add that I wrote that article as well.) I think team followers (including the media) liked having a nickname for the outfield so much, that they attempted to replicate the feeling by creating the hybrid Dusty Kielmore. Obviously, it didn't have the staying power of the Soul Patrol. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkyfry_2cab.html" title="User:Sparkyfry">Sparkyfry</a> 05:10, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Whether or not male college basketball players are <i>inherently</i> notable, Gray is notable either way. First off, I've heard of him, and I hate college basketball. But let's ignore that, as it's not really a reason for voting keep. This is a player whose team won 20 games and was a high seed in the NCAA tournament, and he led said team in points, rebounds, and blocks (two years in a row, in fact). According to his ESPN profile, he went to a JuCo (junior college) before playing at Oklahoma and was the runner-up for JuCo player of the year. Although he wasn't drafted, ESPN ranked him as the 41st best prospect before the draft <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/nbadraft/draft/tracker/rank?draftyear=2006&amp;action=upsell&amp;appRedirect=http%3a%2f%2finsider.espn.go.com%2fnbadraft%2fdraft%2ftracker%2frank%3fdraftyear%3d2006" class="external autonumber" title="http://insider.espn.go.com/nbadraft/draft/tracker/rank?draftyear=2006&amp;action=upsell&amp;appRedirect=http%3a%2f%2finsider.espn.go.com%2fnbadraft%2fdraft%2ftracker%2frank%3fdraftyear%3d2006" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Mr. Gray was actually the Big 12 player of the year in 2005 and is currently playing on the summer league team for the Sacramento Kings. <a href="http://www.kotv.com/news/?107041" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kotv.com/news/?107041" rel="nofollow">[70]</a> In a similar AfD for <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Quinn_4fdd.html" title="Chris Quinn">Chris Quinn</a> I suggested we let this sit for a month or so and see if he makes an NBA roster.

<li><b>Request</b> Ok, so I updated this article with some relevant information I found. It seems as though the article I refrenced above was incorrect in saying he was the Big 12 player of the year in 2005. Upon further research he was the <i>preseason</i> POY which is quite differant. Anyways, I tried to put together a better article for him, I would ask that folks take a look at it now and see if he warrants keeping. Keep in mind this is really the first article I have ever tried to create so be nice. <a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrunkenSmurf_f5fc.html" title="User:DrunkenSmurf">DrunkenSmurf</a> 19:27, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think you have done a nice job and this is undoubtedly a much better article than what passed for an article before. It would also help if you were able to source closer the key pieces of information that you inserted. Sadly, though, this confirms my view that the guy is not notable. He started his college career with great promise but he does not seem to have achieved anything particularly notable. Had he been a notable player surely he would have been signed by a pro team? That he wasn't is the clincher for me. If he subsequently makes pro then the article can be recreated. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 20:24, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> My feeling here it that within a month we will know if he has signed an official pro contract with a team. We have no time restrictions here, and I see no big issue with waiting a month to see how it shakes out.

Regarding Philopaideia:</p>
<p>I made this article.</p>
<p>I am working on a book project called The Philopaideia Project compiling the classical knowledge of various human cultures.</p>
<p>I work in philanthropy.</p>
<p>I own philopaideia.org. I'm working on the website.</p>
<p>philosophy=love of wisdom philopaideia=love of learning</p>
<p>"paedo" is an entirely different word from "paideia."</p>
<p>Also: There is a long history, especially in Greek, of scholars creating words for their own purposes. For instance, Eratosthenes of Cyrene (c. 275-194 B.C.E.) was the first to call himself philologos (philology, φιλολόγος).

<p>To the ancient Greeks, Paideia was "the process of educating man into his true form, the real and genuine human nature." (1) It also means culture. It is the ideal in which the Hellenes formed the world around them and their youth.</p>
<p>Please look up <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a>. It is clearly stated in this article that the root word means boy and has an entirely different meaning from Paideia: pais (παις, "child")</p>
<p>I did read <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, however I believe that Classical Civilizations is not a subject that can easily be governed by the vagaries of popular culture. Most of what is the Classics will never be accepted under the greater whole of humans. Most people, especially Americans, have no idea what the root words are of the most basic Greek words like anthropology or philosophy.</p>
<p>It is a valid point that Philopaideia is not in widespread use at this time, but I believe in the spirit of the Greeks, which invented new words to suit their purposes (similar to German), such constructive concepts should be encouraged.</p>
<p>In addition, I don't think it should qualify as a neologism because it merely merges together two widely understood words- love (philo-) and learning (paideia). Rather than pedophilia, it would be better to relate <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedagogy.html" title="Pedagogy">Pedagogy</a> and the word <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaideia.html" title="Encyclopaideia">Encyclopaideia</a> (all learning). In fact, Wikipedia itself could be written instead as "Wikipaideia" rather than Wikipedia as that would be truer to the original spelling for <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaideia.html" title="Encyclopaideia">Encyclopaideia</a>.</p>
<p>My website for The Philopaideia Project will be up soon and as soon as I said, I own philopaideia.org. This is not a for-profit operation but instead a non-profit venture and I have a long history of successful work in local and global charities and philanthropic foundations (many in my native Chicago).</p>
<p>Also, please keep in mind that I am new to Wikipedia and I would like to follow the rules and learn how to properly post. Thanks--johnhenry312</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> First of all, non-profit vs for-profit is irrelevant. Secondly, everyone who tries to create a Wikipedia article on a newly coined word has a reason why they believe that their word should be exempt. The fact is that, in addition to violating <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, it's also, as your own work, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Original Research</a>. Wikipedia is a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">Tertiary source</a>, and not the place for original ideas, uncited by anyone else. Wikipedia is deliberately not a place for people to float new ideas, but to document things and ideas which are already known to, at least, some significant number of the public. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 17:18, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Mr. Quinn was at one time considered the top point guard in college basketball and made the unfortunate decision of returning to school after his sophmore year. Had he entered the draft at that point he most certainly would have been drafted, but he had a less than stellar end to his career at Notre Dame. At this point I would bet he gets a spot on an NBA roster this year, although I understand that is clear crystalballism. My opinion is that we let this stay for a couple months and see how his pro career shakes out. <a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrunkenSmurf_f5fc.html" title="User:DrunkenSmurf">DrunkenSmurf</a> 01:52, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - the reference says 'Chris Quinn (Notre Dame) and Mike Gansey (West Virginia) have been signed to partially guaranteed contracts. But Spoelstra cautions that doesn't mean they'll make the team. "That just means they're here," Spoelstra said. "We do that every summer with guys that are prospects that we like just so they don't go somewhere else or to somebody else's summer team."'

<li><b>Response</b> LOL, Hey <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> are you following me?? I think the quote you have produced speaks for itself, I mean I probably can't give a better explanation than what is there. All NBA contracts are fully guaranteed, meaning if Shaq gets cut for some reason he still gets paid for the remaining years left on his contract. The guys you mention above signed 2 year deals but if they don't end up making the team this year they would not get the money for the second year. Essentially the guys who are the best of the undrafted class usually get signed to these types of deals so that they can't just jump ship and sign with another team in the middle of the summer league. Anyways, as I said in the <a href="../../../t/a/j/Taj_Gray_a003.html" title="Taj Gray">Taj Gray</a> Afd, we will know in a month or so if this player makes the team and since we have no time limit here my opinion is to wait a few weeks and let it play out a bit.</li>

<p>Thanks guys. As you might have noticed not native english. So feel free to improve. The article is background to te related article about Holland mechnics.

<dd><b>Comment</b>---Bobbest 13:40, 11 July 2006 (UTC) The company builds machines where other have no change. The major technological player in the branch use these machines. They are able to produce better wheels by machines than ever being able by hand. This is proven to the test as I cannot state names of customers try to phone 5 if the biggest quality players in the marked and I can confirm at least 4 if not all. We are small but you do not have to be big to be notable. We do make the difference from Canada to Australia. Not nad for a small company I would say. Ok enough bla bla. I am a technical guy rewrite it if you need to else leave it for what it is (correct the bad Englisch would be appriciated). Just for your information I am also the editor of the piece on our compatitor (bigger but low tech). I am extending the history and tech pages with a bit more inside of wheels. A bicycle wheel is one of mans big mechanical constructions. 150 KG guy on 36 spokes try this balance for an airplane.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> AfD them all!!!&#160;;-) In truth, "unique" hits doesn't mean there aren't more hits, it's a Google filtering system kicking in that removes "similar" hits. <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOG_53bf.html" title="WP:GOOG">WP:GOOG</a> is just a rough rule of thumb, except that you'd expect notable <i>websites</i> etc. to have more than a handful of hits if they're "notable". For a band, Ghits on their own don't mean a lot, except that they can quickly verify whether an act actually exists, and they can obviously tell you the types of sites referencing the band - reliable music sites and reviewers = good, obscure forums and blogs generally not-so-good. WP:GOOG is a technique that's been the subject of <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia_talk%7ESearch_engine_test_16f1.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Search engine test">a lot of debate</a>, and is not even a WP guideline.

<p>It's a college rivalry, which in my opinion isn't all that notable, and apparently <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Clean%2C+Old-Fashioned+Hate%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Clean%2C+Old-Fashioned+Hate%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">google</a> agrees. All colleges have rivalries, but the only people that have any interest in them are current students and those closely involved in the program.

The rivalry engages the entire populace of the state of Georgia (8,000,000 people) once a year for football, once a year for basketball, and three times a year for baseball. This is what American sporting is about, hardcore rivalries. They keep the games interesting and intense. I personally have never heard of the Old Firm rivalry in the United States but the average American college sports fan knows that Georgia Tech and Georgia hate eachother's guts. As a previous poster's mentioned, college sports and college rivalries in the United States are equivalent to European club rivalries. You guys get your rivalries, we've get ours.

<li>Having lived in Georgia, I know first-hand that people go crazy about it: Georgia fans don't use mustard (as yellow is Georgia Tech's colour), GT fans don't use ketchup for the same reason. If you get married to a person who went to the other school, both families disown you. So therefore, <b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Although this article can definitely use some cleanup/expansion, the rivalry is both historic and huge in the state of Georgia and has involved mainly notable coaches (e.g. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Heisman_5766.html" title="John Heisman">John Heisman</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Scobey_Warner_b62b.html" title="Glenn Scobey Warner">Pop Warner</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Dodd_4868.html" title="Bobby Dodd">Bobby Dodd</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Dooley_0649.html" title="Vince Dooley">Vince Dooley</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Curry_a725.html" title="Bill Curry">Bill Curry</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Ross_f16f.html" title="Bobby Ross">Bobby Ross</a>). --<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoswell_native_a674.html" title="User:Roswell native">Roswell native</a> 12:16, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable college rivalry. Per DarkAudit, I'd say that college sports is <i>bigger</i> than pro sports through most parts of the southeast. That said, I'm not running out to create an article for the Textile Bowl, but Tech–Georgia is a biggie as rivalries go. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 13:43, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The consensus at <a href="../../../h/o/c/WP%7EHOCKEY_7a0a.html" title="WP:HOCKEY">WP:HOCKEY</a> seems to be that while junior hockey (the highest level of amateur hockey competition) is relevant and notable, midget (one step down, and for players 17 and under) is not. This league is not particularly noteworthy and falls a little too far down the scale. Also, a team in the league, the Connecticut Renegades, was nominated <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Connecticut_Renegades_ebfb.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Connecticut Renegades">here</a> with no consensus, and another team was deleted <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Newington_Nighthawks_2bc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Newington Nighthawks">here</a>. I voted to keep both teams but would now change my vote per further consideration and discussion; if anyone wants to re-nominate the Connecticut team I would support that deletion. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoojiBoy_02a7.html" title="User:BoojiBoy">BoojiBoy</a> 17:29, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
