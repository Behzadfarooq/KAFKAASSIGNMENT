This all started with a comment we posted on DU's page adding that another forum had been created by ex-DUers. Our comment didn't attack or smear DU and yet they took great offense to it.

After all, there's no real upper bound on how many articles Wiki can have. I'm also troubled whenever I see partisans of one faction attacking the articles of partisans of another faction. On the other hand, as of the moment that the AfD was posted, this article really needs work and Wikifying so that it doesn't read like a vanity posting/marketing brochure.<a href="../../../a/t/l/User%7EAtlant_5157.html" title="User:Atlant">Atlant</a> 12:34, 13 April 2006 (UTC), updated 15 April 2006</li>

When progressive sites such as What Really Happened and Wayne Madsen Report provide links to a progressive forum, that forum is certainly of note. The internet is becoming a grassroots gathering place for independents and progressives, and Progressive Independent is becoming a hub for vital information, activism, and informed discussion.

<dd>I was the one responsible for deleting the notice becuase it said "delete this if you are intending to edit the article" which i have done since then. While I do understand that my use of the phrase "internet phenomenon" was an overstatement, he is still widely known and regarded within the toronto private school community and I have known other wikipedia artciles which target a similarly small audiance. I did not author the article origionaly but I have done alot of work to clean it up from the origional post. I think considering how new this article is it should at least be given time to be refined. several people have expressed thier interest to me about seeing this article kept alive and made more legitimate and I have told them to voice thier opinions here on wikipedia. hopefully they will take my advice. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Faltru (<a href="../../../f/a/l/User_talk%7EFaltru_879f.html" title="User talk:Faltru">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Faltru_25ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/Faltru">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Reid Horkins may be non-notable to you because you do not live in Toronto. He is a well known individual within the independant music scene in southern Ontario.

<li><b>DON'T DELETE</b>. I am in the same boat as Mr. Marx, Reid Horkins seems to have struck upon a bountiful and Lucrative market, his novelty is greatly respected and appreciated by youth in their late teens. He has a political message and is a refreshing new prespective on the Toronto Rap scene. From reading previous (now deleted) posts and from word of mouth, I have learned that even young adults who are not inspired by mainstream Rap are captivated by this young phenom. Mr. Horkins is the hairbringer of the new wave of Rap and Hip Hop in youth, and I would be devastated if he were to be eliminated from this superior website. A Rapper and overall character of his calibre is not something WIKIPEDIA should shy away from. Granted that he is greatly different from other Rap artists, what would the mainstream media think of a website that turned away the next Eminem. I eagerly await the next hot single or music video that Rappin Reid releases, and please Wikipedia, and commited readers, do not delete or vouch for the deletion of this rising star.

Whether he might do any of these things in the future is irrelevant. Whether you like the one song he's ever done is irrelevant. Whether you like his performances is irrelevant too.

<li><b>Dont Delete</b> Isn't Wikipedia all about inclusiveness? You sound like George Bush, trying to put a man down for being different. If Wikipedia's policy is that he has to have a charted hit, doesn't that exclude all those indy artists who may be just as talented as charted ones, but play to small crowds and intimate audiences? The fact that McNugget hasn't sold out yet, in my opinion, makes him more noteworthy.

With more time and editing, this article can be made to better reflect wikipedia standards. -James Wolfe</li>
<li><b>Dont Delete</b> I am a record producer and Alumn of Crescent School and I was looking at the Crescent School wik and I came across Reid Horkins under Notable Alumni. I noticed that he had a link and we all know that Wikipedia's best asset is not the articles its' links. I clicked on his name and found out that he is a rapper who is taking over the private school sector of Toronto. The private school sector is one of the largest producers of Hip Hop music in all of Canada so I followed the links to his web page and bought his CD 'Stickin to the Man'. I loved it and have been in touch with Mr. Horkins on a possible deal. Thanks Wikipedia for your help in finding the next Canadian Star.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, there's the solution. If you're a record producer, sign him to a deal, and release a CD on a recognized label. As soon as that happens, and it shows reasonable sales volume, he would qualify to be added back into Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 00:13, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If his only appearance is on Youtube, he's not notable. I'm on youtube, do I get an article too? Heck, do the other 10000+ youtubers get articles? The answer is no.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. I am a student at Jarvis Collegiate a high school that is very different both socio-economically and geogrpahically from Crescent School, and I have heard of and enjoy Reid Horkin's music. He is popular among my peers, and we all feel that this page shouldn't be deleted, and it's deletion would be an insult to Reid and his fan base. I am tired of people voting against this who don't live anywhere near Toronto, and who have zero knowledge of the Toronto Hip-Hop scene.</li>
<li>"Don't Delete" I also witnessed Reid's performance at the Marquee theatre, and I feel he has potential as not only a rapper, but an entertainer. Wikipdeia has a lot more to lose then gain by deleting Reid from its database. If people are digging his beats and rhymes, why shouldn't they be able to learn about this budding rapper off of Wikipedia. Personally, whenever I want to learn more about anything in particular, this site is the first one I go too, and I know that applies to many people. Why should all these people be shut out from learning about a possible new up-and-comer, just because a select few feel different?</li>
<li><b>In response to all the people saying hes not a muscisian</b> Although we belive he is and should be listed as such several people have told us he doesn't belong in that catagory, so if there is a more legitimate catagory for him please tell us and we can change it.</li>
<li><b>In response to all the people saying non-notable</b> There are many other articles which speak to a small audiance, one much smaller than this I might add. If need be i'll pull some up.</li>

<li>"Don't Delete" I go to Jarvis Collegiate in Toronto, a high school which is socio-economically, and geographically very far from Crescent School. I and many of my peers have heard and enjoy Reid Horkins music. His fan base is much larger than the stereotyped WASPy community the deleters seem to have been portaying. It is unfair to Reid and all of his fans to delete this entry.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unverifiable from reliable sources (Urban Dictionary is not a reliable source, neither is number of hits on Google).

<dd>Do you not consider the British Library, and newspapers such as the Guardian and the Telegraph to be reliable sources? They have all used this term and commented on its implications. Amongst the Google results are many usages by colleges and librarians etc, defining characteristics which relate to it, and seeing it as a phenomenon which needs to be addressed. It didn't mean anything to me, until this AfD came up. I suggest looking into it a little more thoroughly. I think it would be a credit to Wiki to provide this information, and disappointing if it doesn't. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 12:20, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Like Ric Romero said "Anyone with a computer can become their own publisher on the internet." While he was refering to blogging, WP is a type of encyclopedia. WP may not be a blog, but it did however state the facts of Ric Romero. It told of his early years up to the point that he became a cliché. I'm certain there are more sites than this one that state the same facts as WP and I feel that deleting this would prove nothing. WP has only published the facts of Ric Romero. It isn't the writer's opinion that he is a cliché. It is only a statement that reveals the truth and reveals the reason of his internet popularity. IMO, the only thing hurting the fact that he is refered as a cliché is the popularity of WP. It won't go unnoticed if it's deleted. Society will still refer to him as a cliché.--Ellis d 09:03, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you mean my comment, Romero is a Fark meme, and more likely to get the attention of people coming here (solely) to vote in favour. Put it another way, if we were discussing the removal of some Pokemon fancruft and it was posted on the front page of a high-traffic "Pokemon Fancruft Fans" site, it's unlikely that the views posted would be an entirely representative cross-section of opinion.

I<i>m not saying that every single piece of data on Earth should be in Wikipedia.

<li>Ric Romero is a tv personality in LA, a considerably large market. His basic information should be left in, as there are many people of the same or less notability who still warrant an entry in Wikipedia. Perhaps this discussion should be centered on whether or not to keep the "fark.com" references in, as that portion appears to be an inside joke among users of only one website. However, it is setting a frightening president of censorship if the non-disputed facts concerning a tv personality are deleted because of prejudice against a website like "fark.com" that has adopted him as a mascot. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/a/l/User%7EGallup_f8e5.html" title="User:Gallup">Gallup</a> (<a href="../../../g/a/l/User_talk%7EGallup_29fb.html" title="User talk:Gallup">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gallup_6779.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gallup">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - He's a TV personality which makes him notable. He may not be an important person (opinion) but the fact is that his name gets thrown around all over, so people will end up here looking for information on him. I don't think we need a full-blown biography and family history, but a few tidbits of info and his picture (and why he's so often mentioned) would suffice. I don't know the guy, and it doesn't look like I'd like him, but I think for the purpose of spreading knowledge [of any kind] it should stay. <a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhostalker_d602.html" title="User:Ghostalker">Ghostalker</a> 17:13, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. As someone else said, the fact that we're arguing over this surely means this article should stay by default. Besides, this is censorship from people who can't take a joke, which is on one level what this is and another is the fact that this is a real person.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -- This is a second comment but I wanted to add several points. First, in my job as a researcher for one of the Big Four search engines, memes like this become popular page hits due to news stories or even Saturday Night Live. Wikipedia would be my first stop, if I were trying to evaluate a search for 'Ric Romero Obvious'. It is most authoritative, has the largest number of editors and is the most-likely to have the underground/cultural interpretation. Second, my Wikipedia sweatshirt says "Edit this page" and it comes closest to the spirit of Wikipedia, not "Delete this page". But maybe someone sent me the wrong sweatshirt. Third, being an Internet resource edited by Internet users is what defines Wikipedia -- this is not a resource edited by perfesseurs for the hoi polloi, as is Encyclopedia Britannica. That editors even believe this is Romero/meme page is an issue is an indication that they neither understand the users nor the donors to this site. ACzernek</li>

<li><b>Conditional Keep</b> - Ric Romero IS a known television personality in Los Angeles, so at the very least he should have his own Wikipedia article. However, I dunno if the Fark.com stuff is relevent, unless he's in on the joke too. Maybe if more about Ric's personal information and other non-Fark.com sources were added, the Fark.com stuff can remain? ... Something else to consider: Just because Fark.com is a web community, it doesn't mean anything that only Fark.com users would know shouldn't be on Wikipedia. I mean, how many farkers are out there versus any community of people (including nation states, towns, cities, etc), and how much more is known about smaller communities of people and not about Fark?

The only way you're ever going to have heard of her is if you watch the weather forecasts on the BBC West Midlands local news. Yet she has an entry and there is no clamour for deletion. If Ric didn't have a Fark meme associated with him then I doubt that there would be any objection to a page about him. And yes, I posted the same comment on Fark: bite me.</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Aside from the information about the meme (which falls under the criteria for delete per the ruling on Webcest, despite my strong opposition to said ruling), the article contains information about a person with a reasonable amount of fame in his community. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people have heard of him, either through the Internet or on the air, and keeping this page intact provides them with a resource to learn more about him. (Disclaimer: I did follow the link from Fark, but this is not my only contribution and I wouldn't have voted if I hadn't already contributed to Wikipedia. I'm not a fan of the meme, but I strongly disagree with the exclusionist philosophy that automatically dismisses memes as non-notable- especially when good and otherwise noteworthy information is deleted as well).24.188.143.81 08:40, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh, that's a wonderful point of view to take. "Let's just relist it later when people aren't paying attention. Then we can just claim that all these interested participants were just sock-puppets rather than people who actually have too little time to watch 27,000 articles to make sure that things are kept the way consensus wanted them to be in the first place. As has been stated elsewhere, there are plenty of local news celebrities that have wikipedia articles - the only reason you are against this one is because the fact that he has gained MORE notoriety than other people because he's associated with an internet meme. Calling it sophomoric just displays YOUR OWN bias, and aren't we supposed to divorce ourselves from anything that makes us autonomous while we are Wiki-drones?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I use Wikipedia regularly, and much of what I use it for is to find out what an inside joke is referring to. I suspect that many others use this site for the same reason. If this was an inside joke on a much smaller forum, like "Option J" on Baseball Think Factory", I would be in favor of deletion -- particularly because BTF has its own wiki, but FARK is a massively popular site, and consequently I would expect that there would be a high level of interest in knowing the backstory of an in-joke.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Even without the Fark.com references, Mr. Romero is someone is someone seen regularily by millions. And if his article is to go, then a significant fraction of Wikipedia needs to follow him into deletion. There are certainly articles on memes that don't have any non-Internet fame. Heck, WP has articles on minor aspects of minor past TV shows. And besides, it was usually to find out what all the Romero references were. Though I will grant that if his fame was completely limited to Fark WP's mention of Romero should have been limited WP article(s) about Fark. But as I said, that is not the case.

<li><b>Neutral</b> JordanLund 04:22, 17 April 2006 (UTC) It's simple enough to monitor bandwidth and hits. If the page is generating sufficient interest and hits are up then it doesn't matter if it's a Fark generated Internet Meme or not. Enough people are interested in the page to keep it around. If the hits drop off then delete it under a "not enough readership" reason. If it's truly limited to Fark traffic and everyone on Fark already knows who Ric Romero is then it won't generate enough traffic to keep.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I remember splitting Ric off from the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fark.com.html" title="Fark.com">Fark.com</a> entry because there seemed to be need (and public interest in him) to separate his bio content and his FARK notoriety into a separate entry, away from the FARK page clutter. As long as the content in Ric's entry is factual and verifiable (and not too opinionated), it certainly meets the content guidelines for a separate entry and therefore should be kept. Surely more meat and potatoes content should be added, making the Fark stuff less prominent / more trimmable, but I don't have that knowledge me-self.</li>

<p>Although I have not seen a Cd released yet, the musician is featured on a demo on a local recoding company "panda productions", and does play outside of Omaha Nebraska on such tour with these musicians. Also, i do believe that the artice does qualify under these standards of Wikipedia:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers, personal blogs, etc...). ---Omaha World herald Newspaper, KXVO news ( twice), as well as is published in a childrens book "Super kids&#160;:Ordinary kids that have done extrodinary things"--by lisa Fitt.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability.</li>
</ul>
<p>---has become known for the local "young" notable musican scene in Nebraska</p>
<ul>
<li>Has won or placed in a major music competition.--National Orchestra participant(ASTA organization)</li>
</ul>
<p>How else could there be improvements in the artice, to make it more suitable? .OmahaEntertainment</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm sorry, you've painted a picture of a talented high school kid who's won some high school awards. As to your other points: a demo is a demo; it's not an actual release. Playing backup for a touring act doesn't count if your name isn't listed in the band; there are thousands of backup players. The book looks pretty minor (Amazon sales rank almost 2 million). A few features in local media that say "here's a talented local kid" don't qualify as notibility. There is no source that she's a <i>"prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city"</i> (remember that clause about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>). <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 03:48, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This artice is only a stub for now, due to the rise in populatrity.Aren't all articles on Wikipedia works in progress, in that anyone can add to them at any time?( This article does have a solid start.The merit that you are looking for is truly there, and if not, it will be there soon. )</p>
<p>I do believe that it fits under the standards, and is a work in progress. Newspaper articles and Television media are not completely for public stunts. (some articles are scouted, and have real merit.)</p>
<p>Also, the "rock violin" is a new category, which gives rise the the article's importance. It is a little know category that is new to the music scene, due to the image of "violin" always being under the "classical" view.<a href="../../../o/m/a/User_talk%7EOmahaEntertainment_5faf.html" title="User talk:OmahaEntertainment">OmahaEntertainment</a></p>

<p>This is an autobiography. It was created by an IP October last year, but this seems to be a one-person IP,202.67.119.44 (<a href="../../../2/0/2/User_talk%7E202.67.119.44.html" title="User talk:202.67.119.44">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.67.119.44_d670.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.67.119.44">contribs</a>) - all of its edits are to the work and productions of this chap. The other articles edited by this IP, was to credit the subject of the article as a "star" in the film <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romper_Stomper_3727.html" title="Romper Stomper">Romper Stomper</a>, and plug a play, Children of the Dragon (also up for deletion), directed by the subject of the article. The article is only substantially edited by Nghesi30 (<a href="../../../n/g/h/User_talk%7ENghesi30_07e3.html" title="User talk:Nghesi30">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nghesi30_4881.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nghesi30">contribs</a>) (meaning "artist30" in Vietnamese), who created an account this year, presumably to create other articles Aussie Bia Om, Chay Vong Vong, and Australian Vietnamese Youth Media- (all up for deletion). Nghesi30 then adds the subject to the list of prominent people at <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnamese_Australian_532b.html" title="Vietnamese Australian">Vietnamese Australian</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Vietnamese_actors_6cc1.html" title="List of Vietnamese actors">List of Vietnamese actors</a>.</p>
<p>The reason I feel that Nghesi30 is <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Le-Nguyen_b8b5.html" title="Tony Le-Nguyen">Tony Le-Nguyen</a>, is because he is challenged to explain a copyvio at Aussie Bia Om. Nghesi30 replies at Talk: Aussie Bia Om that he is the owner of Australian Vietnamese Youth Media and the copyright - meaning Nghesi30 claims to be <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Le-Nguyen_b8b5.html" title="Tony Le-Nguyen">Tony Le-Nguyen</a>, and has been plugging himself on <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnamese_Australian_532b.html" title="Vietnamese Australian">Vietnamese Australian</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Vietnamese_actors_6cc1.html" title="List of Vietnamese actors">List of Vietnamese actors</a>.</p>

<li><b>Very weak keep</b> The appearances for which the subject has an IMDB profile do not, I think, confer notability; indeed, were those the sole basis on which notability rested, I would support "delete".

<li><b>Keep</b> Needs to be reworked as per NPOV policy, but its notability should override the initial vanity edits. Not AfD.

<p>I believe that this page is a hoax. It was originally created (and speedied) as an attack page, then immediately recreated by the same person, who has removed deletion tags when I've placed them there but offered no explanation. "Charles Guo" + opera, "Charles Guo" + "Yi Guo", "Charles Guo" + "Guo Yi", and "Charles Guo" + "El Tigre" all get nothing on Google; and while the picture is really of someone named Yi Guo, I haven't been able to find evidence that what the article says about Yi Guo has any relationship to the truth. There are sources listed but I can't investigate them further because I don't speak the language. <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMa</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdelaMae_cb14.html" title="User talk:AdelaMae">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AdelaMae_415e.html" title="Special:Contributions/AdelaMae">contribs</a>)</sup> 02:53, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> If this hadn't been initially an attack page, I would have assumed it was legit, but insufficiently referenced. That's because there is really a Chinese opera singer under the name Yi Guo <a href="http://www.kunqu.org/eyg.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kunqu.org/eyg.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:CyBKfIz4CGUJ:www.kunqusociety.org/artists.htm+%22Yi+Guo+%22+opera&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:CyBKfIz4CGUJ:www.kunqusociety.org/artists.htm+%22Yi+Guo+%22+opera&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> and the names of the operas &amp; references check out. So, clearly the author knows something about Chinese opera. Since there is a real Yi Guo, perhaps we should delete this title and move only verifiable info, from the links above, to Yi Guo. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrillig20_55d1.html" title="User:Brillig20">Brillig20</a> 05:23, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

If there were such huge mistakes (date of birth off by 18 years, stated he was known for directing rather than performance) in the original text of the article, how reliable is it now - considering that all this material was contributed by the same author? Based on the English sources we've got, the only thing we can verify is basically that he's a Kunqu artist who graduated from the Shanghai Chinese Opera Academy and he performs in clown roles. That's not even a stub. Also, I am not convinced that Yi Guo meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>... lack of Google hits doesn't necessarily mean much here, but I don't get the impression from the Kunqu website that he has done much that would merit inclusion in a Wikipedia article about him.

<li><b>Comment</b> Google tests dont really have any meaning with non-latin based languages. If he has been a prominent performer then it may still only be in chinese script.

<li>I met Yi Guo on a trip to Beijing last year. I talked to him on the plane, and he called himself "Charles." I apologize for my mistake about the date of birth, but this is a real person who addresses himself as "Charles." I believe having articles such as this one on Beijing opera is essential; we must broaden our horizons. Sure, Yi is not the most famous actor, but he is certainly well regarded for his performances and is well known in the Beijing opera circuit. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../e/a/d/User%7EEadinsmore_018c.html" title="User:Eadinsmore">Eadinsmore</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/d/User_talk%7EEadinsmore_b533.html" title="User talk:Eadinsmore">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eadinsmore_c5f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eadinsmore">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The question really is does this agency exist and does it accredit? If it accredits we should keep the article.

I would point out that the CBS link above does not name the ACPCU. It was also not named in the video. The John Bear link does not say that this agency is exclusive to Hamilton. Given the inconclusive evidence, I believe the article should be kept. The goal with all these accreditation mill/diploma mill looks to be exposure to me since if we were going by notability this along with most of the articles would be deleted (or merged in a single article since they are all similar scams). Therefore, why reduce the exposure through a redirect? -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 23:55, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The point wasn't that it was set up by Hamilton. The point was that article includes schools connected to various fraudulent accreditors. There is only one "school" listed as "accredited" by American Council of Private Colleges and Universities, which is Hamilton. The other fake accreditors mention various schools and even the vague "and others."

<p>A "brigade" of the Texas A&amp;M University Corps of Cadets, an ROTC-esque organization. There are a number of "brigades", but I don't see how they could be considered notable; from here they look like university student groups (I can't tell if there is year-to-year continuity of the brigades). The article is completely <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a>, written in the first person and mostly names, with little content that could possibly be relevant in a year or two.

<p>Well, there are a few reasons why its wrong, #1, a brigade would imply that we are army, but if you read The Corps page you would see that we are in the Wing, not the brigade. We are an outfit of the Air Force ROTC at A&amp;M. #2, if you read closely to the A&amp;M page, we are an Outfit. hints why there is no need to be merged with the whole corps page. each outfit has their own histroy, own legacy. which unless you are an aggie, and you where in the corps, you will not understand. considering, i havent spend much time working on it, will be updating it constenly for a while(next 3 years or so). I am trying to dig up as much information as i can, to make the page more full, of useful information. I appologise for sounding rude, but it is aggrivating that the pages hasnt even been up for 24 hours, and i am being badgered about the content not being usful. I do not intend to be rude, i am just pointing out some of the facts that you might not understand if you are not from Texas A&amp;M Corps of Cadets. I am currently going and gathering as much information, about the outfits history, and past so i can make the page more usful to those people who might want to look.</p>

<li><b>Weak keep if thoroughly rewritten</b>. The article at least suggests that the group has some year to year continuity. I know next to nothing about student life at Texas A&amp;M, other than by rumour and repute, but it may be that this is an institution similar to a fraternity or sorority, conditioned by the local quasi-military student culture. If so, it may be notable enough to pass: especially given the fact that due to conditions unique to Texas A&amp;M, student organizations founded there are ill adapted to spread to other universities. At minimum it must be thoroughly rewritten for <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> and preferably in the third person. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:10, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I originally prod-ed this article, but due to the bug with the prod templates, I instead nominated it for speedy deletion under CSD/A7. After some discussion with the article's chief contributor I've concluded that it's definitely not a speedy candidate; thus, I'm listing it on AfD. I'm not familiar with any policy that addresses amateur clubs, but it seems as though <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> would not be appropriate to employ in this case. Similar articles, such as <a href="../../../b/a/r/BARC_6408.html" title="BARC">BARC</a> have been kept, but I still believe this topic does not warrant an article. Therefore, I vote to <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 04:32, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Before the Hijra, Abu Bakr purchased the freedom of several Muslims who were slaves and suffered torture at the hand of their owners.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>, though from reading the arguments of many of the "delete" voters (JamesTeterenko for instance), this is much to do with the quality of the article and not not the notability of the subject. Right now, it consists only of a fleet list and a list of routes and little real encyclopedic information (history, ownership, community impact), hence no prejudice against a rewritten article. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:57, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This appears to be notable enought to be considered simply more than an ordinary campus club. It's fairly significant that this organization is permitted use of the House of Commons. That's not just a hall that anyone can rent out. It's obviously a significant enough organization for the Speaker to decide to grant permission for its use.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. So this university club gets to use the House of Commons hall (during a time when it's otherwise empty, by the bye) for their make-pretend game once a year. Big deal, there are high school moot legislatures in every state in the United States, and no doubt in Canadian provinces as well, that do the same thing, get the use of the legislative halls for a day or two, have photo ops with smiling politicians, and aren't restricted to a couple schools yet.

<li><b>strong keep</b> The Laurentian University Model Parliament is notable. First of all it is one of two universities which are granted permission to use the House of Commons. Second, it is ran by Rand Dyck, one of Canada's most notable Political Scientists, his publications include Canadian Politics Critical Approches, a text book which is used by almost every university coast to coast, and since he is running this event as an intevative way in order to have university students understand politics and their government, why would this not be notable enought to deserve an article. Thirdly, it is a serious acidemic excerise done by university students, if this was done at harvard there by a promant professor at Harvard in the US Capitol there would not be this dabate for inclusion. Finally, it is one of the few events where Laurentian Students at Sudbury are mixed at Laurentian Students at Barrie, this is notable beacuse of the inclusion of the different campuses which usually have nothing to do with each other. I strongly hope that this article is kept, it needs some serious editing, maybe merging the section concerning the SGA at the LU with this as a subsection editied, but i think it is notable enought to be kept.</li>

<p><s>There is no Scouting in any of these places at all.

<dd>"subjects about which nothing can be said"? Something can be said about every subject, else you'd not have a Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Interest in Scouting articles on Wikipedia is quite recent and the numbers involved in even large countries outside the USA like the UK and Australia is quite small but growing. Before too long people from these small countries will add content. Most of them probably do have scouting but we need locals to give us the information. It is not like the Olympics where we know whether a country had participants or not. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 02:09, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I have found some small pieces of evidence that Scouting in these countries has existed in the past and I have edited them all except the Vatican City article. There I tend to agree that Scouting would likely be linked to Italian Scouting although one link does suggest that they are working to WOSM recognition. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 03:25, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry about the harshness of my original nomination. It does appear that Scouting exists in some form in these countries although there is little verifiable information. I think it is dangerous to just "wait for someone from one of these countries to write something" because that borders on inviting original research. It seems like there is very little if any information on these which could not be said in an article like Xorox has suggested which had a list of countries where this held to be the case.

<dl>
<dd>That would defeate the purposeful and very intentional idea that someone from those nations would seek out and edit the article on their own country, and it will make incomplete the lists, articles and templates that the Scouting WikiProject has been so diligent on compiling and completing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A corellary to this would be that since <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting_in_Vermont_9acb.html" title="Scouting in Vermont">Scouting in Vermont</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting_in_South_Dakota_0495.html" title="Scouting in South Dakota">Scouting in South Dakota</a> have essentially stock articles at the moment, with nothing to set them apart, would we create an article "Scouting in places without very good articles"? No, it would leave gaps where there <i>is</i> a political entity with Scouting. Recognized or not, this is also the case with the national articles.</dd>

<dd>Having heard from <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a>, I no longer believe this to be a bad faith nomination, but I still maintain even a merger into a bulk article to be ill advised, for the reasons stated above.

<dd>I replied to this on my talk page. However, I do want to add in this discussion that all of the current verifiable information for these would be the same: hence one big article. The currents lists and templates would not be disrupted because we could easily redirect these pages to the merged articles. The reason I am hesitant to wait for someone from these places to write these, is that if none of us have been able to find any information, what they find is unlikely to be verifiable. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 20:37, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do not Delete</b>. Dr Lazlo Pozsgay was a real doctor. My mother was a nurse at the Fyfield Clinical Research Institute and had fond memories of this rather odd man. Dr Pozsgay returned to Hungary at the time of the 1957 uprising and did not return. I myself am now a Doctor and the article is medically correct (more or less). I suspect the writer is not a doctor. I would be interested to know what efforts the other contributors to this discussion have made to verify Dr Pozsgay's work beyond doing a Google search against his name – believe it or not, there is a whole word of knowledge out there that is not on the internet. With thanks Dr John Keyes. 15:33, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The stuff about Hungary checks out. The medical stuff is in the ball-park if a little short on detail - people have been know to appear significantly younger as consequence of surgery. Overall the article is too boring and obscure to be a hoax. Who would bother making it up? Lansdale 00:01, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think you need to recuse yourself just because you love the game, given you are a WP editor with a history, as long as you think you can make a proper judgment. But as I write below, the Alexa rank is <b>not</b> for the game, it's for the entire game studio's website. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 16:39, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I share Saberwyn's concern, but I do believe the potential exists. That Alexa rank number is very good for a flash game, so this is definitely notable; let it remain with a {{cleanup-sources}} tag, and see if it can be improved. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 14:26, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>The Alexa rank is not for this flash game, but rather for xgenstudios.com's entire website. That rank, incidentally, is 13,283, which is not particularly good for a game studio. Certainly it does not make the game "definitely notable." <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 16:39, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Subject: Information on yourself and your website for Wikipedia

Hello Ryan,

I am an editor on Wikipedia, a site I'm sure you have heard of. The
article on Digital Blasphemy
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Blasphemy) was nominated for
deletion today, and I was wondering if you could provide me with any
information that would help me prevent that.

Have you had any interviews or reviews of the site by independant
sources, such as newspapers? Are there any well-known websites or
other organizations that have used your images?

I think that your site is fantastic, and most certainly notable enough
for an article on Wikipedia. However, if we have links or references
to published sources that reference your work, it will make the
article stronger.

Thanks, and keep up the good work!
Michael

Subject: Re: Information on yourself and your website for Wikipedia

Hi Michael,

Thanks for writing.  I had seen the article on Wikipedia a while ago and
thought it was interesting.  Flattering to be included.

Not sure what I can tell you.  My site was named one of the Top 100 sites on
the web by Yahoo Internet Life magazine (now defunct) back in Dec 2000.
I've been mentioned on BBC World (on the Webscape segment) and was mentioned
many times on Tech TVs "The Screensavers".   I had a write up in my hometown
paper, and I'm sure I've been written about in other papers but I can't
think of any specific examples.  To my knowledge, I run one of the most
popular "single artist" galleries online.

The accolades and free press sort of stopped not long after I opened the
members gallery.  Once you start charging for your content, people are more
reluctant to site you as an "online resource".  It's just the nature of the
game I guess.

I'm happy to be included in Wikipedia, but I'll understand if the article
gets deleted.  Let me know if you need anything else.

<dd>"The Middle East Forum, a think tank, works to define and promote American interests in the Middle East through research, publications, and educational outreach.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Yup, it's about verifiablility not truth. Verfiability from <b>reliable sources</b>, unlike the web forums cited in this article. So let's have a category for converts to Islam. Not a <i>list</i> of <i>rumoured</i> converts, which is subject to two separate problems: repeating other people's unproven speculation; and applying categories to living people without making any change to the person's article which is likely to get seen and challenged by the editor comunity on that article. Also note that there are constitutional implications if Prince Charles were to convert to Islam - the fact that this has not been discussed in the major British news media indicates that as speculation goes it's pretty unlikely. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:17, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Tricky. The term gets &lt;1000 ghits, but one of them is a book by the same title from Cambridge University Press - on the other hand, there is preciouslittle evidence that this term is much used. It originates within <a href="../../../r/a/n/RAND_0a12.html" title="RAND">RAND Corporation</a>, apparently. I'd say if anything here is truly verifiable it could go in an article on the theory's originator, James A. Dewar, if we had one, otherwise it's "just another management theory", of which there is no shortage. This article is, by the looks of it, not much more than a synopsis of Rand's two books on the subject. So <b>delete</b> this. Userfy is also an option, if it's wanted for reference, and if the author wants ot create an article on Dewar, and can show that he meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, I would encourage them to do so.

<li>The term assumption-based planning was indeed used in the book, but there seem to be several "similar" methods of assumption based planning, e.g. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critical_assumption_planning.html" title="Critical assumption planning">Critical assumption planning</a>, 'discovery driven planning' and 'milestone planning'.</li>

<li>Can somebody explain to me what the difference is between writing about a planning method like assumption-based planning and a writing about any other planning method varying from strategic planning (e.g. BCG matix, 5-forces model) to wikipedia's entry about the <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_plan.html" title="Business plan">business plan</a> (which more or less follows the New Venture method and does not follow other "business plan" methods.).

<p>The result of the debate was delete. The nomination presents a clear challenge: unverifiable claims. No one has provided anything like a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, and testimony of wikipedia editors about something's notability is insufficient. As to redirection to list of shock sites, while redirects are cheap, they aren't free, and an article having the word "list" in its title doesn't provide exemption from the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> criterion. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 05:29, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> This article´s dispute is due to Original research, see Talk page. The article was listed PROD, but will need consensus, due that the dispute is just between me and the original researcher. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisco_Valverde_0ec9.html" title="User:Francisco Valverde">Francisco Valverde</a> 13:01, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Further To Above</b> I've removed the prod, and made changes to the article. The article is till subject to discussion, and a wider consensus. In the mean time, I've listed a few external references. Not much is online, probably due to Burns having died ashortly before the internet took-off. The Guiness Book of World Records website doesn't appear to list the record for loudest human voice. A great many print sources are undoubtedly availible, as Burns was the subject of countless newspaper and magazine articles. He also appeared often on television in North America. Print references will be forthcoming. Seán Pòl Ó Creachmhaoil --Aodhdubh 13:30, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> You should not try to delete articles when you are having a content dispute. That said, I fail to see where the article asserts the notability of the subject. What were his military accomplishments that set him apart from other soldiers who served in WWII and retired with the rank of Major (or are all Majors notable)? Other than that, he is listed in the Guiness Book with the loudest voice. Regardless of whether this is original research, person seems <b>non-notable</b>. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:41, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

In <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Safire_4be1.html" title="William Safire">William Safire</a>'s <i>How Not to Write: The Essential Misrules of Grammar</i> Safire writes that it is "an Americanism combining 'blow-hard' with 'deviation'" which I had never heard before. <i>The Word Detective</i> by Evan Morris found an early printed source for the word. There's also a good example of Harding's bloviation in <i>Presidential Voices: Speaking Styles from George Washington to George W. Bush</i> by Allan Metcalf, where he's also called "The Great Bloviator." <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 20:10, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>stong keep</b> The page can easily be expanded to touch upon the many richs bloviations in American politics. It can not be re-directed to <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Harding_8748.html" title="Warren Harding">Warren Harding</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_9983.html" title="Bill O'Reilly">Bill O'Reilly</a>, because the word has been used in many contexts. While these are relevant uses of 'bloviate,' the word stands on its own. Moreover, Bloviate does not belong in the wiktionary because it is a rich concept and not merely a word. Concepts like <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synergy.html" title="Synergy">synergy</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republicrat.html" title="Republicrat">Republicrat</a> have their own entries, yet can also be given dictionary style definitions. Expand the entry by fleshing out the history and use of the concept.</li>
<li><b>keep</b> While entry should be expanded, bloviate is a word much more rich in cultural value and context than its dicdef would suggest, and so deserves to be in Wikipedia instead of (or possibly in addition to) Wiktionary. Balazs 10:18, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> "Synergy" and "Republicrat" are good comparisons. "Bloviate" deserves a Wikipedia entry in addition to one in Wiktionary as a word that originated and continues to be used in a particular political and cultural context.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Wikipedia is not a dictionary. Wikitionary is the appropriate place for this. A word primarily used on a single TV talk show does not belong in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobLinwood_6cf9.html" title="User:RobLinwood">RobLinwood</a> 22:24, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> But O'Reilly's use of the word taps into widely used concept. What about the wiki entry on <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synergy.html" title="Synergy">synergy</a>? This too is "a word" yet also stands for an idea with a rich history.</li>

<li><b>keep</b> Agree with above, bloviate has cultural context that makes it appropriate for an encylopedia.</li>

<li>Unfortunately this really is hopelessly unverifiable. How can one verify a controversy within a small animated series fandom? That's like two people having an argument behind closed doors, and then asking a random stranger on the street what the argument was about.

<dd>Hence why myself and Malber both believe that the blurb in the Teen Titans article is sufficient.

<dd>At the very least you should try making the blurb a tiny bit more neutral, as it tends to come across as pro-out-of-continuity, rather than it could go either way (given the facts at hand). I don't see the harm in my article, it was designed only to elaborate more on the topic at hand, but do what you gotta' do. --<a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenomaru_a6d0.html" title="User:Venomaru">Venomaru</a> 19:13, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article appears to me to be plagiarized from somewhere, so it needs to be rewritten, not deleted. But as a recipient of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Medal_of_Science_224f.html" title="National Medal of Science">National Medal of Science</a>, which is a pretty major national award, and all the reasons cited above, he was more than just another professor. Also his work on the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torre_Latinoamericana_00c8.html" title="Torre Latinoamericana">Torre Latinoamericana</a>, doing the engineering that made it withstand earthquakes, was notable in that it made the building itself notable.

<p><br />
<b>Withdraw</b> It looks like I might have been mistaken here - the article doesn't actually mention any of these medals, which might well make him notable. Looking closer, I missed one of the medals on the "what links here" page, and the other has his name mispelt (as does the articles reference) as Newark. Google finds hardly any hits for the alternative spelling, so I expect is is the same man as is just a mistake. The article needs serious rewriting, but I guess it's worth keeping.

<li><b>Delete</b> this is what categories are for. The article itself has precisely zero encyclopaedic content. Categories have two massive advantages over lists like this: they are self-maintaining; and the addition of a category to a person who does not self-identify as LGBT will be seen and reverted by editors familiar with the article subject, so there is much less chance of error. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 21:16, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per above. Further <i>have been identified as such by others</i> is an unacceptable criterion - particularly with a totally unreferenced list.

<li><b>Delete</b> per above. If needed categories would be more maintainable (per JzG), though I actually dislike a similiar category as well. My view is somebody's sexual orientation should only be recorded by us, if it's actually something discussed substantially, as something signficant, in reliable sources. That is, more then mere proof the label is true, is needed for it to be encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:28, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. 1) Should be a cat (or multiple cats) 2) Why does everyone that is not strictly heterosexual need to be lumped together? Gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals are all there own things (and I would argue that there are sub-orientations in each group such as butch-fem, lipstick, butch, femme, etc). This list comes off a bit like have one called List of Black, Latino, and Asian actors. I am a strong supporter of equal rights for all of these people in terms of marriage, adoption, etc, and I understand the need to pool resources together in order to gain political capital, but on wikipedia we should be careful about lumping people together based on an assumption that different groups have something in common based soley on being outside of mainstream Judeo-Christian sexual mores. Really this list is a list of actors who have happened to have had sex with people of their own gender. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">talk</a>)</small> 13:16, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<b>Rawbanana's reply</b> I'm not affiliated with this software in any way. However, I feel that it is a unique and revolutionary software that deserves to be recognized in Wikipedia. Please also understand that this is my first article and I do not really understand how to edit articles properly or format it properly for Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I edited my original submission thinking that it had added enough to justify entry into Wikipedia. If that is not enough and you still feel this article is not worthy, please delete it. In the meantime, I will try to learn more about the Wikipedia system and see if I can fulfill the Wikipedia requirements.</p>
<p>Note the information I have used in the article is primarily from the forums <a href="http://www.rejetto.com/forum/index.php?c=6" class="external free" title="http://www.rejetto.com/forum/index.php?c=6" rel="nofollow">http://www.rejetto.com/forum/index.php?c=6</a> or from Sourceforge.net. I have tried to be neutral as much as possible. Again I didn't realize new entries were so hard to be approved for Wikipedia and I will try to read up on what this submission is missing. Should I have left the {{prod}} for someone else to remove? Oh well...</p>
<dl>
<dd>You may remove {{prod}} tags from articles you create, but if you do so you should put something on the talk page justifying why you think it should be included, similar to what you wrote above.

<p><b>Re: Notability</b> I read the Wikipedia Notability article and wikipedia and understand that all a software needs is 1 3rd party award to be notable. HFS has 1 3rd party award from www.snapfiles.com in 2004. A 2minute appearance and recommendation by a popular independent media website such as Hak5.org also seems notable. HFS only appears on these websites due to its unique functionality although its growth is among psp and international users instead of within the professional networking crowd. A quick google for "psp hfs" will also show many results. I've also updated some sources and wording on the main "http file server" page. Rawbanana 09:34, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Addendum</b> (taken from the related TfD): <i><b>According to the article creator</b></i>, <i>"Dominionism is, as the article describes, "a term used to describe a trend in Protestant Christian evangelicalism and fundamentalism [...] that seeks to establish specific political policies based on religious beliefs." These parties and thinkers meet that standard by any fair and NPOV assessment."</i> <i><b>I responded</b></i>, "This definition is both too general to be useful and too specific not to be discriminatory. Is a Catholic party that "seeks to establish specific political policies based on religious beliefs" not a <i>dominionist</i> party? Or isn't it just a <i>Catholic</i> party. Is a Hindu party that "seeks to establish specific political policies based on religious beliefs" not a <i>dominionist</i> party? Or isn't it just a <i>Hindu</i> party. Is an Atheist party that "seeks to establish specific political policies based on religious beliefs" not a <i>dominionist</i> party? Or isn't it just an <i>Atheist</i> party. Etc. Etc. <i><b>ALL</b></i> parties seek to establish specific political policies based on a set of moral beliefs, religious or otherwise. All laws are based on some moral belief. Driving 55 mph was a law based on moral belief. If a person is religious, <i>ALL</i> laws he advocates are "religious" by definition, because everything is filtered through his worldview. If he proposes a 55 mph speed limit, it because he believes that God wants us to value human life, and driving 55 will save more lives than 75. Does this make him a religious fanatic? Does this make him a <i>dominionist</i>? By your definition it does. But, of course, that is absurd. He is not radical in his beliefs. Your definition is flawed. Your list is flawed, and slanderous." &#160;<font style="background: lightblue" color="#000000">&#160;&#160;<b>GUÐSÞEGN</b>&#160;&#160;</font>&#160;–&#160;<small><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_3d46.html" title="User:Guðsþegn">U</a><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User_talk%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_daf2.html" title="User talk:Guðsþegn">T</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Gu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_319a.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Guðsþegn">E</a><a href="../../../x/_/_/WP%7EX_5545.html" title="WP:X">X</a></small>&#160;– 05:18, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>What's the basis for "speedy". Also why is more time needed? If the person adding these parties, was doing so from a reliable source, they could have easily provided the source, when making the list (surely they knew the name of the source they're using). If they were unable to find a reliable source, then they should not have created the list in the first place. How could you possibly know there are reliable sources to add, if you can't name a single source. Or if you can name a source, then please do: in the article. How about just one for starters. I could understand, if we had a huge list of uncontested items, and it was taking a long time to add sources, but in this case, its a short list of contested items.

<li>I have to conur with JJay on this. It's frustrating how, in so many AFDs people refer to sources that do not appear in the article. Please, put the sources in the article. Generally, a well sourced article speaks for itself, and needs little explanation in AFD. In this case, we need to confirm that the term is used by each party itself, or is widely used by reliable sources to refer to party. I find it very disappointing, that people are still making entirely unsourced new articles. Wikipedia seems to be adding unsourced information faster then we can add sources to old stuff. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 05:26, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Change to <b>delete</b> per Rob above and below, and because although I can find some apparent evidence for the term, I can't find any reliable authority for the identification of individual parties as Dominionist, and in any case per my usual preference for categories, a category would be more likely to be picked up by the editor community on a given article and challenged if wrong, whereas lists can and have been used to attribute falsely. So I think on balance the best thing would be to delete this and have a category instead, which would have the benefit of being self-maintaining. This is not connected with the validity of the term, which I still think has at least some evidence of validity. JJay is right: I was being inconsistent, and extending existence of evidence beyond its real applicability. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 19:18, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

This page violates core policy of verifiability and neutrality. Even if this page is 100% true. It seems we have a case, of Wikipedians doing some original research, in applying a definition of a term to each case. That's original research. Even if you come to the correct conclusion, you can't attach a label yourself. You have to go by external reliable sources. Also, readers must not think Wikipedia takes a political position on what to label political parties. They must see who is saying what party has what label, know it's not us personally saying it.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hmmm, an absence of supporting cites in an article is not evidence that an article should be deleted, only that it needs to be better supported. Nor is the difficulty in finding cites. Just zis Guy you know? can attest to the lengths and expense Wikipedians have gone to provide supporting cites for contested content. The first response at Wikipedia is always to fix what is useful and can be fixed, not just delete it. The <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Heritage_Party_of_Canada_d7c7.html" title="Christian Heritage Party of Canada">Christian_Heritage_Party_of_Canada</a> is very poorly supported. In fact, it has no supporting cites at all. Should it be nominated for deletion as well? Of course not. Claiming a lack of supporting cites as justification for deletion is a specious argument. As is whether or not any particular group agrees with how other segements of society view and describe it. And BTW, there's no shortage of credible sources per WP:V that are available as supporting cites that connect Dominionism to various political parties and movements, starting with National Review, Harpers, PBS: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kurtz/kurtz200505020944.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationalreview.com/kurtz/kurtz200505020944.asp" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> <a href="http://www.harpers.org/SoldiersOfChrist.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.harpers.org/SoldiersOfChrist.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> <a href="http://www.harpers.org/FeelingTheHate.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.harpers.org/FeelingTheHate.html" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/hedges05.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/hedges05.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>.

<dd>That first article you cited, from National Review <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kurtz/kurtz200505020944.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationalreview.com/kurtz/kurtz200505020944.asp" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, is absolutely an <i>excellent</i> article. I don't think it does the work you think it does, though. Kurtz points out how overblown the "academic" critique of dominionism is; how its critics (including the one with an article at Wikipedia) <i>want</i> dominionism to be bigger than it really is, for their own political purposes; how the critics are trying to draw connections to larger groups and political parties where none actually exist. You have to read through to the end, past the sarcastic bit at the beginning. &#160;:-) Thanks for that link. &#160;<font style="background: lightblue" color="#000000">&#160;&#160;<b>GUÐSÞEGN</b>&#160;&#160;</font>&#160;–&#160;<small><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_3d46.html" title="User:Guðsþegn">U</a><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User_talk%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_daf2.html" title="User talk:Guðsþegn">T</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Gu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_319a.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Guðsþegn">E</a><a href="../../../x/_/_/WP%7EX_5545.html" title="WP:X">X</a></small>&#160;– 22:55, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And precisely what work do you think he thinks it does? Are you assuming FM didn't read it through? If so, I have little doubt that your assumption is in error, as is what I believe your assumption regarding what work FM "think[s] it does". As a source, it merely supports the fact that Dominionism exists, although any importance of Dominionism would be downplayed in the National Review (editorially conservative publication) in the same way it would be played up in an editorially liberal publication. Nonetheless, the question is this: does Dominionism exist? The answer is yes. Thus, as with any other political or religious movement it rates an article in Wikipedia. It really <i>is</i> that simple. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 08:26, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps it would help to explain the slander this way. Say the article was called "World domination parties", and on that list was the same as this list, plus the US Republican Party (on the theory that since Bush is trying to export a political ideology, democracy, at the point of a gun; and since he's a nutty evangelical Christian). <i>Can you not see how this is slander?</i> Even with starting an unwarranted and foolish war in Iraq, and even given that he originally called it a crusade, he (and we America in general) have no desire to <i>dominate</i> Iraq in any way that doesn't mean letting the Iraqi people govern themselves. The party doesn't desire world domination. This <i>is</i> what this list is saying. So, combined with the fact that any rational human being who did not desire world dominion would not want to be labelled such, it is clear that the the very tag itself is slanderous. &#160;<font style="background: lightblue" color="#000000">&#160;&#160;<b>GUÐSÞEGN</b>&#160;&#160;</font>&#160;–&#160;<small><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_3d46.html" title="User:Guðsþegn">U</a><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User_talk%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_daf2.html" title="User talk:Guðsþegn">T</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Gu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_319a.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Guðsþegn">E</a><a href="../../../x/_/_/WP%7EX_5545.html" title="WP:X">X</a></small>&#160;– 17:49, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The example provided is essentially a misdirection; while domination and dominion have the same etymology they do not inherently have the same meaning.

Also, the dispute with references isn't the existence of the term <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominionism.html" title="Dominionism">Dominionism</a>. It is it's usage when applied to specific parties.

Just try and add the Republican party to the page (and related category). You'll see how fast it's reverted.

<dd>Uh, that's just a link to Google. I know about Google. I used it already. If you have a source that is reliable, that proves *any* of the parties listed is Domionist, then put it in the article.

Every time you argue here, *instead* of fixing the article, you prove you can't fix the article. Incidently, from the beginning, I've been willing to be proved wrong.

Meanwhile, back at wikipedia, the list remains completely unreferenced, although I will say that it is shrinking nicely.

<li><b>Delete</b>. "Dominionism" is, by and large, a straw man created by the American political [far] left that has no bearing on the actual ideology of most of the people labeled as such, and <i>certainly</i> does not play a rôle in the political ideologies of <i>any</i> of the parties listed in this horrific misbegotten excuse for a WP article. While it's true that the article could be cleaned up, there's no reason to do so...it covers a complete non-topic with no bearing in reality (unless you're an American antireligious leftist and honestly fall prey to the ludicrous notion that "dominionism" is a real political ideology with any relevant following, but that sort of delusion is not a strong enough argument in favor of keeping such a silly article)... <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 10:34, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, open to persuasion if proper sourcing is implemented. (Sidenote: <i>Putting a comment after my message doesn't constitute sourcing, sourcing is what happens when <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> get implemented in an article</i>...) Here we have a list of parties that do not seem to claim to hold the ideology in question and are not generally described as characterized by the ideology in question. The main usage of the <i>political term</i> Dominionism seems to be almost exclusively as an "attack phrase" - not an academically-identified distinction and not a "movement" that individuals or groups ascribe to (some seem to call themselves "Reconstructionists" instead). This largely defeats the purpose of having such a list - it's a lot like having a "List of politicians described as idiots by their political opponents and critics, although not generally characterized as such by themselves, or their supporters, or by the media in general, and despite the fact that academic work has identified neither a coherent pan-idiotic movement nor a wider phenomenon of independent movements sharing similar characteristics that can be labelled as idiotic" and then giving the article the name "List of idiotic politicians". In general, if an article is badly referenced, we tend to let is sit there with a "please fix my references!" tag on and just hope it isn't going to be harmful until it gets fixed. Since this list seems unlikely to ever be fixed in this way, and has the potential to be harmful until it is (who can tell which parties should be listed on it?), it ought to be removed, at least for the moment and until better references present themselves. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 03:57, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Definitely <b>keep</b> Jinzo (&gt;.&gt;) since he's been used by three duelists including himself and is generally a very popular card.

Before that, they were somewhat popular amongst players (especially their leader chris walk...I mean Don). <b>Keep</b> them. DMG is only in a slightly better/different situation. You wanna remove them but not her? I wonder why... Perhaps the Amazon and Amazoness cards should merged. The odd name change (seemingly due a writer shift) and multiple rogue/enemy duelists using them justifies an Article. <b>Keep</b> them.

<li>Keeping individual card articles on the basis that they were the feature of one episode is ridiculous, you might as well keep articles on individual episodes then!

<dd>There are plenty of articles that could easily fall into the same category. So the only thing you have on this particular article is that it isn't notable. FINE, but that's still no reason to just delete it. How is it supposed to become known if people like you keep trying to withhold information? You say it looks like a 'marketing report' ... how can you market open source software? Usually you market something to make money but I'm not trying to make any money here, I'm trying to save people some money while at the same time, making them aware that they do have alternatives to common backup software. There's a stub on Veritas Backup Exec listed, so why can't mine be listed? Because it's not notable? Have you used it? Would you even know how? I have this bery same backup system implemented at over 100 of our client sites and it has never failed me. Of course, these are all banking and finance business who aren't known for going online and discussing how they backup their data so it's popularity (notability) is limited to the audience in which it has been exposed to. Your behavior about this is completely out of line, you are 'Biting the newcomer' something that's supposed to be explicitly prohibited here. Are you too good for the rules? My article does not deserve to be deleted, I am willing to hear your suggestions to make it better. <font color="#00FF00" style="background: black;">&#160;Musashi5191645&#160;</font></dd>

<dd>Actually, now that you say it. There may be other articles with exactly the same reasons that should also be here for AfD discussion. I notice above that you talk like a marketer, particularly speaking of course of those who market Open Source software. They have their own particular style (also known as their POV). You are a maintainer of the software? A distributor? Both of these things come under the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Vanity</a> policy. Please note that we are not biting the newcomer. We are not biting anyone, if the article was notable, non POV, and possibly had some reason why as you point out, people would come to wikipedia to get information about it, we would not be going to all the trouble of putting it here and discussing the issue with you. Please dont make personal attacks, It is not your place to tell people they are biting newcomers. If someone else sees this then they may be in a neutral enough position to see that. Interestingly, the fact that you know about the policy reveals your depth of knowledge about wikipedia so far. Interesting how you have a customised signature, something which reveals your depth of experience. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#009000;">e</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User_talk%7EAnsell_90fe.html" title="User talk:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">ll</span></a> 00:36, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> because Wikipedia has an article on <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavaliers.html" title="Cavaliers">Cavaliers</a> which covers at least half this article in more detail and without the errors.

<li>I'd suggest <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalier.html" title="Cavalier">cavalier</a> here. There is some support for the article's assertion that the term Gentleman Cavalier is in use in commonwealth nations to describe civilian horseriders attached to cavalry regiments.<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=akaash+gentlemen-cavaliers&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=akaash+gentlemen-cavaliers&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Here</a> for instance, the Canadian Akaash Maharaj, who rides with the Governor General's Household Cavalry, once referred to gentleman cavaliers in this sense, though since then he has updated the term to "civilian cavaliers" (presumably as the sex requirements have been relaxed by the cavalry) Although this is far from an adequate reference, it is enough to convince me that the information is substantially correct and verifiable. It would therefore be a mistake to remove the entry altogether because someone might see the term gentleman cavalier and want to look it up. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 00:30, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is under heavy doubt. There is no separatist movement in the peloponnese, this area has been the oldest part and heartland of modern greece. Moreover, as far as i know there have been no candidates of this "party" in the municipal elections (the next ones are upcoming in October). Linking to an nonexistant page with just an email adress.Unless the user who created it presents some credible information, I think it should be deleted. The same article, containing the english text and the link, appeared in the greek wikipedia and was speedy - deleted. - <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadseed_c27d.html" title="User:Badseed">Badseed</a> 00:41, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
