<li><b>Comment</b> - I'll definetely vote <i>Keep</i> but only if the article is cleaned up from too much detail from his website and his opponents' sites. We should summarize both his views and his opponents w/o quoting large chunks of comments or writings from both sites! The second point is that refrain from quoting him in all relegious articles as his notability is contested. He's no different than <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Shamir_9e98.html" title="Israel Shamir">Israel Shamir</a> (though Shamir is not a pseudonym but a real person) and the treatment should be no different!

<dd>I wouldn't push that analogy <i>too</i> far. Deap throat was known only to woodward but he still deserved an article. Although, Ali Sina is no Felt.

<dd>Deepthroat was written about by journalists in reputable newspapers. Ali Sina has no credible third-party sources that have written about him, so far as I know.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. As Ali Sina says himself, his credentials are not relevant to the truthfulness of his claims. And these claims are true. And truth should be voiced. When Muslim countries will start to treat religious minorities as it should be, there could be a talk about "Islamophobia". For now, it is only the "Kafirophobia" that is strongly present. If there is an article about Islamophobia here, there should be one about Kafirophobia as well. Also, Mr. Sceptre should know that "best friends" cannot change Quran and Ahadith. And one person does not represent "one fifth" of the world.

<li><b>Keep</b> Ali Sina is notable enough at least for thousands of sites that mention his name and quote him. He has also been interviewed in radios. In no place he has said Ali Sina is a pseudonym. This is something Wikipedians have written about him and he has neither confirmed it nor denied it. <a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/oped/sina51227p2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.faithfreedom.org/oped/sina51227p2.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Despite that encyclopaedias cover totally imaginary personages including mythological figures. The fact that a personage is imaginary is not reason for him not to be reported. There is more evidence that Ali Sina exists as a real person than there is for <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaxagoras.html" title="Anaxagoras">Anaxagoras</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heraclitus.html" title="Heraclitus">Heraclitus</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaximander.html" title="Anaximander">Anaximander</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaximenes.html" title="Anaximenes">Anaximenes</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democritus.html" title="Democritus">Democritus</a>. These ancient philosophers are only mentioned by Plato and there is not even a book left from them. All it takes to dismiss their existence is to doubt Plato and yet no sane person would do such thing.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Let us face the truth. All these vilifications and belittling of Ali Sina are motivated by religious hatred. It is basically the same editors who constantly censored anything I wrote on Islam who are now claiming this Article should be deleted. This is another attempt to censorship and silencing the views contrary to Islam.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia has articles about less notable persons than Ali Sina. There is no pandemonium about deleting them because those people do not criticize Islam. This commotion is about Islam and not about Ali Sina. It just shows the intolerance of Muslims to even acknowledge the existence of apostates and critics of Islam. Sadly these people come here with a religious agenda and not to promote knowledge and impartiality. Denying this fact, because it may offend these people is like hiding our heads in the sand and not willing to see the obvious. <a href="../../../o/c/e/User%7EOceanSplash_1197.html" title="User:OceanSplash">OceanSplash</a> Jan 5, 2006 23:16</dd>

<dd>Firstly, mythical figures are noted as mythical. I really don't think you want us saying Ali Sina is mythical. There is also tons of literature written about Zeus — this is not true about Ali Sina. Also, it's not because he is an ex-Muslim. The Ibn Warraq article is not up for deletion because just about no one thinks he is not notable. So, we shouldn't exactly oversimplify this to being Muslims against non-Muslims. My personal opinion is that a lot of people are voting delete because this article has attracted loads of anons and unfortunately there have been calls on the FFI forums to come here and edit... well, when people come to get into edit wars on an article that is most definitely not necessarily encyclopedic then people will want to delete it. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 05:33, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Neutral</b>. Ali Sina is not nearly notable enough to be a necessary entity for this encyclopedia. However, this is wikipedia and we are not paper. We have pages for minor porn stars, really non-notable albums and I'm sure I could dig out other articles. Ali Sina is about on that level. The only thing that makes him different is that he has an internet following and that makes his article prone to edit wars. So, I'm not going to delete it... and last time I voted keep... it really causes too many problems for its worth so this time I won't taken any initiative to save it. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 11:02, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Rudra, I'm just not very computer-literate, I thought I did sign my comment if not my user name is (م). My intention is not to censor anyone. My objection to this racist's entry are basic. First, I don't know how popular this "guy" is, but the first time I heard about him was on wikipedia. His name was constantly thrown around by someone on the Islam discussion board. That user has since been blocked for his racist/hatefilled/islamphobic comments (Gren I think you know who I am reffering to&#160;;). Hence, I do not want wikipedia to be used as a platform for "his" hatred. The second reason has to do with "his" identity. I know that bios are done on everone, good or evil. But no one knows who this "man" is. He could be one person, he could be an entire hate group. Wikipedia can not rely on this idiot's words for its main source. By the way Kwnl I wonder if the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment realizes that this bigot(s) main, and stated, purpose is to eliminate all muslims from off the face of the Earth.م 06:08, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Red herring. The issue here is not whether this anonymous bigot has a <i>right</i> to say what it says, but whether this <i>particular</i> anonymous bigot is <i>sufficiently important or notable</i> to merit inclusion in a general encyclopaedia, per (for example) the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">guidelines on biographies of living people</a>.

<dd>It's not just <i>my</i> personal opinion, but let that pass. If this was a known, credible person, or if the column were sindicated in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> I'd have no problemwith it.

Since "Ali Sina" is not known to be a real person, this is really covering the website (really more of a blog) not the person. I don't think either the website or the fake "Ali Sina" persona is notable. There is precious little which can be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.
