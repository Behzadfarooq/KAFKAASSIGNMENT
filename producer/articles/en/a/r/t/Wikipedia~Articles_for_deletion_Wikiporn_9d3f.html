<li><b>Comment</b> per Englishgirls. So you are saying we should delete it because "too new site to judge any notability yet". I feel you have missed the point. The article is not about any specific web site it is about "WikiPorn". I find it remarkable that one is excluded from Wikipedia because a concept is "too new" despite the fact the are several sources and web sites dedicated to it. Englishgirls--Englishgirls 09:37, 29 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, please do not vote twice. Second, "Do not delete" is not a vote, it's a Mark of a Newbie - please read the AfD instructions. Third, "per &lt;your own name&gt;" is a <i>highly</i> unorthodox vote to say the least. Fourth, please sign your posts properly (use ~~~~ or use the signature button on the toolbar).<br />
Fifth, yes, we actually <i>do</i> delete sites that are brand new and have not proven to be of bigger consequences. Heck, we delete <i>older</i> sites that have not proven to be of bigger consequences. And if your wiki says it has <i>approximately zero articles</i> and three users, I'd say it's rather damning evidence that the site isn't very notable yet, regardless of what hard criteria we have. We <i>might</i> be inclined to keep an article on a new site if it's made by some respected established party and there's some proof that it will stick around and be notable <i>some day</i> (think of <a href="../../../a/j/a/AjaxWrite_762c.html" title="AjaxWrite">ajaxWrite</a>, which was quickly AfD'd). But this site doesn't appear to have any of these merits yet. Also see our <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">notability criteria for websites</a> - it clearly fails these. They're tough rules, but they do make sure we will see the forest for the trees.<br />
While you undoubtedly have noble efforts to defend other small and new sites, <i>this</i> particular AfD is about <i>this</i> particular site.<br />
Just for rhetorical comparison, I can take a look at my own MediaWiki installation (not a public wiki yet): 109 pages, 851 views, and 476 edits, most of these by myself - and I'd <i>still</i> say my own wiki is too small and too obscure, in <i>epic</i> proportions, to be included. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 11:20, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Okay, so this article is about <i>two</i> wikis.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Does seem to meet criteria to have a Wikipedia article, however so do many other porn sites not considered worthy of Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBeno1000_c5f1.html" title="User:Beno1000">Beno1000</a> 23:41, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I can assure you all that whoever <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ejjj_uk_951b.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:jjj uk">jjj_uk</a> is, it is nothing to do with me. Judging by the initials and the reference to <a href="http://www.wikiporn.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikiporn.org" rel="nofollow">wikiporn.org</a> I would suspect it is Jason Johns from London who hosts that site. We are not involved or in cohesion together in any way. I can understand your suspicions of a newbie (weren't we all at some point) however, i have been honest and open to keep this article going. I am not a dishonest person. Also, let me reiterate a point. The article is not about any particular web site. It is about "WikiPorn" --<i>Englishgirls</i> --Englishgirls 08:47, 29 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, if you say so. Just <i>sounded</i> suspicious, that's all, forgive me if I went a bit overboard too early, but please also understand that sockpuppetry is a real problem in AfDs.<br />
Anyway, if this isn't about a specific site, there's still one thing to be decided: Is this supposed to be an article about the two currently existing wikis titled "WikiPorn", or a generic article about discussing use of wikis in documenting pornography? If latter, the term "WikiPorn" is a <i>neologism</i>, and the article has to be moved to some more descriptive title (and I'm not sure if we need this, as our current list of wikis does include the category, or did when I last checked it). If it is an article about wikis <i>titled</i> "WikiPorn", we have two sites are only marginally notable and are better off merged somewhere else, and I believe wikiindex.com is better for that sort of stuff. And I still stand by either deleting the article, or redirecting without merge, because frankly, the current article is better off completely rewritten in any case. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 13:20, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> On the point of neologisms/"too new", I note that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">Wiki</a> is included in Wikipedia. "Here a wiki (IPA: [ˈwiː.kiː] &lt;wee-kee&gt; or [ˈwɪ.kiː] &lt;wick-ey&gt;[1]) is a type of website that allows users to easily add, remove, or otherwise edit all content, very quickly and easily, sometimes without the need for registration."</li>
</ul>
<p>Surely "wiki" in this context is a mere blip even in terms of modern history. <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">Pornography</a> or "porn" for short is an ancient concept. So is the problem that "<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiporn.html" title="Wikiporn">Wikiporn</a>" is the conjuction of these two words? Even if the article is deleted I would still be interested to know your opinions. "The current article is better off completely rewritten in any case" I totally agree. I was hoping for input from other Wikipedians which is what the ethic of Wikipedia is about. I will take the article on board as my "baby" and improve it over time so that it is more educational than it currently stands. "A generic article about discussing use of wikis in documenting pornography?". I must say that I do like that statement, I couldn't have put it better myself. Yes I am hoping that it is exactly that. Several people have said to me "what's a neologism?" or "what is a wikiporn?". It gives me a great buzz to say "look it up on Wikipedia". --<i>Englishgirls</i> --Englishgirls 08:47, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The problem is two-fold. If the article is assessed on the notability of its websites, it fails: the <i>more heavily trafficked</i> one of the two doesn't break one million on the Alexa meter, which is seriously insignificant (<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>). If on the "concept" of wikiporn, the name is a neologism (<a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>) and the essay original research (<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>). If you are genuinely looking for the input of other Wikipedians on this article, our consensus seems to be that until and unless these websites gain enough traffic and outside notice to become notable, or the concept gains widespread and verifiable (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) media and/or academic attention, this subject does not qualify for an article. I appreciate that you get a kick out of having people see your article on Wikipedia, but I hope you understand that Wikipedia doesn't exist for that purpose. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 10:46, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, well, remember - please don't take AfDs personally. We're debating the merits of <i>articles</i>, not the people who write them. We have near-infinite patience with people, but very little patience with bad articles. =) AfDs happen to best of us. I assure nothing bad will happen to you personally if the article is deleted (though someone may point you toward the newbie documentation and ask you to read it). I suggest reading <i>other</i> articles to see how they're laid out and what kind of information goes to a good article; also read some of the Wikipedia rules and guidelines, to further understand how the stuff works. I hope this AfD has been an educational experience. =) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 12:38, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
