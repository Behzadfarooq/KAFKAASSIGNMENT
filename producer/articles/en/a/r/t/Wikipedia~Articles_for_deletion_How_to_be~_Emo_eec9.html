<li><b>Keep</b> Firstly, not a speedy canidate, sources cited (controversial as they may be). In addition, this does meet the requirements for web content. The sources have been cited, it's clearly been redistrubited well beyond the orginal creators websites. I can't help but think this continual cycle of deletion requests isn't started by the numerous vadnals that keep degrading the article since there is plenty of web content that doesn't cite anything and doesn't even get blinked at, like <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teen_Girl_Squad_4e3c.html" title="Teen Girl Squad">Teen Girl Squad</a> for example.68.63.158.133 19:37, 29 October 2006 (UTC)TIinP

<dd>300,000 unique hits on the orginating site is not 13 million, but still signifigant. The video has spread signifgantly without the creators help.

<li><i>do not delete</i> As someone who was trying to understand more about the concept of "EMO" subculture, I think that this inclusion added a lot to my understanding. I think it was be a shame to delete it as future wiki searchers would be missing out on a better understanding of the meaning. I also think it is one of wikipedia's strengths that you can find something like the google video link from searching for info on there, it is exactly what you would never get from an alternative encyclopedia source.</li>

<dd>I don't think you quite understand the policies we use for notability. Per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, internet content is notable if <i>"The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself."</i> What makes a source non-trivial? For that, we can take a peek at <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, which explain reliable sources. The first cite in the article is a link to a web forum. Per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>:
<blockquote>
<p><i>"Posts to bulletin boards, Usenet, and wikis, or messages left on blogs, should not be used as sources. This is in part because we have no way of knowing who has written or posted them, and in part because there is no editorial oversight or third-party fact-checking. In addition, in the case of wikis, the content of an article could change at any moment.The same reasoning applies to trivia on sites such as IMDb or FunTrivia.com, where the degree of editorial oversight is unknown."</i></p>
</blockquote>
That also eliminates the IMDb link as potential indicator of notability. Your second link goes to Danielle Belton Online, the personal blog of an entertainment reporter for the <i>Bakersfield Californian</i>. While this <i>might be</i> an acceptable source per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, I'm going to argue against it. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> makes exception for self-published sources if "a well-known, professional researcher writing within their field of expertise, or a well-known professional journalist, has produced self-published material." I would not consider Danielle Belton a well-known professional journalist. The fact that she writes for the <i>Bakersfield Californian</i> is somewhat irrelevant, because that newspaper <b>did not</b> give column inches to the movie. To say that she gives the movie notability because she talks about it and she writes for the <i>Californian</i> is an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a>. Her statement was not published by the <i>newspaper</i>, and thus relies only on her authority alone, which isn't exactly that of a national-level entertainment reporter. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 04:11, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The lot of you are willing to pin this on an article that isn't even published yet in a magazine that is barely not a blog? Eh. It would appear the rest of us are outnumbered, but if the entrance exam for questionably notable and unreferenced articles is going to be <i>this easy</i>, the door is wide open for a whole lot of the same. The sum total of this films critical value is expressed on a message board. It has had no theatre run, no published reviews, and no affiliation with a notable producer, director, etc. What on Earth makes it meet the notability requirements, aside from a local scene blogazine? <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 23:06, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
