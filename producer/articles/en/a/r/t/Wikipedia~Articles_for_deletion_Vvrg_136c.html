<li><b>Keep</b> --- Hey, admins of Wikipedia?! Are you online? Listen to me really carefully.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your user (Eclipse-vvrg) is trying to enhance Wikipedia project, to spread the word to the whole planet, that there on the Earth is one non-profit organization called <i>V.V.R.G.</i>. Like they said ... " V.V.R.G. ... devoted in education and aiming the youth to the genuine social, cultural and intelectual values and principles". They are good example for their environment. Someone will see their info at Wikipedia, and maybe this will stoke this viewers/readers to found similiar organization, to activate their young friends, to start some projects for the good of their community. Maybe <i>V.V.R.G.</i> and this new organization will have some together projects from which the whole and the only benefit will see our mother Earth, our global network, your local community Mr. Admin, your children Mr. Carrp (or Mr. Crap, I'm sorry but can't see too clear your name without my glasses),... Or, maybe Wikipedia is oriented to promote bad things, to encourage wars in the future? It must be that I missed that when I became a member of this community.</p>
<p>Try to read between the lines Mr. Admin. Aren't this "DELETE bunch" just a friends of Mr.Carrp? Or,.. maybe Mr. Carrp is an admin itself? God save Wikipedia if this is true! There are lot of intriguers all around. They just want to put their hands in every dish. Get your hands of <i>V.V.R.G.</i>! They are not English people, they are Macedonians, but however they want to spread their ideas to the world. They spread their ideas in English, the language that is not their native one. This is not a plus for them, to their contribution to Wikipedia?! They are not all so English-perfect like Mr. Carrp, but 99% they are. Let me see few sentences from some of this "DELETE buch" to write in Macedonian (the sentences can be no perfect, I will take them as correct). <i>V.V.R.G.</i> want their ideas/projects to be understandable for the bigger part of the earth's citizens, so are you have some problem with that?!</p>
<p>And what about Google? I think this is another project than Google Mr. Whatever! Are you an employee in Google Ltd? Aren't you promoting online search engine of a PROFIT ORGANIZATION here?! Is Wikipedia prohibiting new terms to be presented, other that Mr. Whatever, Mr. Howee Bee, Miss Broke E. knows&#160;?! Greenpeace was BIG/notable organization from the first moments (seconds is better term) of it founding?! Hah! V.V.R.G. is not notable?! So?! From when Google DOT <b>COM</b> is relevant factor to present some new term to Wikipedia?! Say "power to the big companies, smash the new non-profit organizations". That's your silent words "DELETE bunch"! I can smell that, and my respiration tract is clear as summer sky in Vratnica, Macedonia, believe me.</p>
<p>People, take the information (if you want it) and go further. This article about <i>V.V.R.G.</i> is just a plus for Wikipedia, not a minus. However, if my words wasn't enough to convince you to keep the article - then simply delete it. And don't put this kind of "voting pages" in future. Simply push the button (DELETE of course, not the one from the Chemical Brother's song "Galvanize"&#160;:) ). For sure You got the power (not that of "Snap", but however you got it). Another&#160;:) .</p>
<p>I'll monitor this page to see what will be the conclusion of the Wikipedia Crew. Just for info (nothing more, I swear): if <i>V.V.R.G.</i> 's page will be deleted, Wikipedia's links at few of my web sites will be not there anymore. I don't want to support someone who don't want to present earth's "things" to the human kind (V.V.R.G. don't ask to link back, they just point to their own web site to inform the world about their news/realized/and new projects in future - A NON-PROFIT WEB SITE, A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION; I don't ask to link me back neither, I am your user and I am enhancing O-U-R project ... Wikipedia).</p>
<p><i><b>V.V.R.G. (Vratnica Virtual Reality Group)</b></i> will continue to exist whether it is on Wikipedia (DOT ORG?,.. Hmm?) or not.</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b>That's quite the message. I know how I'd like to respond, however I'm a calm and reasonable person that has great respect for the policy of <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">don't bit the newbies</a>:</li>

<dd>I have nothing against the V.V.R.G. organization. When I posted a VfD on the VVRG article, I was only stating my opinion on the article, not the organization. I'm sure it's a wonderful organization, but it does lack notability. When a user believes that an article's subject is non-notable, they may choose to post a Vote for Deletion. This gives other members of the Wikipedia community a chance to express their opinions on whether the article should be included or removed from the encyclopedia. If it turns out that the subject is notable, the article is kept. It's a very common process and as you can see from <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a>, there are many other articles nominated for deletion. From the voting thus far, other users seem to agree that VVRG is not yet notable enough for inclusion. I wish you happy editing, although I do suggest you try to observe the guideline of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>.

<li><b>Comment:</b> --- Yes, Mr. Carrp you just noticed that there are newbies at Wikipedia, so give them support. They'll return to all of us with some new articles/stories for the things we don't even know they exited. And by the way I am not making any personal attack at Wikipedia users, that's my style of writing. No offense word was used in my "Support the V.V.R.G." article. They are all in function of my support to V.V.R.G. (to present better my viewpoint for this "case"). There is present "playing with the words thing", but that doesn't mean that I am attacking someone. Have a nice day/night! <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeJay_8246.html" title="User:DeeJay">DeeJay</a> 20:00, 14 Feb 2005 CET</li>

<dd>I fully support the newbies of Wikipedia, after all, everyone here was once a newbie (except perhaps <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo</a>). This support does not extend to letting newbies add any page they wish. This is an encyclopedia and there's standards that an article must meet. When a user believes an article doesn't meet these standards, procedures such as this VfD come into play.</dd>
<dd>As for the "no personal attacks" comment, I was referring to when you wrote "...Mr. Carrp (or Mr. Crap...". Now, I wasn't very offended, but some people would have been. Insults don't help you to "present better my viewpoint for this 'case'". I do hope you enjoy editing here at Wikipedia and wish you the best. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarrp_aa18.html" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 19:23, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> --- I am not an expert in English language, but in colloquial way (language) 'Crap' means 'whatever thing/things, anyone,...' (besides the bad meanings, that for sure I was not alluding to). In my sentence Mr. Crap means Mr. Whatever, like you can see in the rest of the comment.
