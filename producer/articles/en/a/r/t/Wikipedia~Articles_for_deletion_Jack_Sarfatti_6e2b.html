<dd>Hmm, I ran into you (65.241.103.49) earlier today in another VfD, where you were <i>supporting</i> an article about a patently nonsensical "theory" due to another (?) German engineer. If by "legitimate physicist", you mean that Sarfatti did earn a Ph.D./ in physics, as a matter of fact, you are right about that. If you mean he is worth paying attention to, I disagree. (I know noone who actually <i>reads</i> his incomprehensible Usenet posts. As someone who knows the jargon, I claim they are incomprehensible because JS doesn't make sense, not because physics is hard.)---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 19:28, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I note that several of the people above who vote for deletion have done so making personal attacks on Sarfatti as a "troll", a "hoaxter", a "kook" a "quack" etc. Does this not violate Wikepedia rules? Why the obvious double standard.</dd>

<dd>Sarfatti wrote: "Caveat: This glimmer of "RV" advanced action-at-a-distance FROM the future from Dick Bierman's "presponse" signal nonlocality violating linear entangled unitary quantum non-mechanics of lifeless closed systems is still half-baked "speculative" with low decoding signal-to-noise ratio and is in danger of being not even wrong. Proceed at your own risk. Nevertheless we must oppose the Victorian Station Masters who prematurely censor what may prove to be ideas of vast importance. Talking about an idea does not mean that one professes that the idea is true - only that it might be of some utility as it matures." <i>woodymarble@mac.com</i></dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. Jack Sarfatti is not a physicist (at least not a notable/significant one as claimed by the article). A quick search in <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cs" class="external text" title="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cs" rel="nofollow">Citeseer</a> shows that Jack Sarfatti did not produce / coauthor in any scientific publication.

<dl>
<dd>Indeed whoever wrote that Sarfatti never published is wrong, whether deliberate misinformation or not I don't know. Sarfatti has been involved in deep cover intelligence operations since 1973 or so when he virtually disappeared from conventional academia. For the record Sarfatti wrote an important paper with A.M. Stoneham "The Goldstone Theorem and the Jahn-Teller Effect" (1967) that is cited in the American Institute of Physics "Resource Letter on Symmetry in Physics". Ray Chiao credits Sarfatti's Phys Lett A paper on self-trapped laser filaments as analog to Type II superconductor magnetic vortices as stimulating his experimental work on the phenomenon. Sarfatti predicted the recently observed "supersolid" in a paper published before Antony Leggett's. This will be confirmed by George Chapline, Jr at LLL. Leonard Susskind of Stanford will confirm Sarfatti's essential role in Susskind's first published paper on quantum phase operators at Cornell in 1963-4. Sarfatti is in several TV shows and is in Paramount's Star Trek IV DVD on "Time Travel: The Art of the Possible." Sarfatti is an informal consultant to the new National Intelligence Directorate MASINT. [Comment by anonymous user, possibly woodymarble@mac.com]</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Abstain</b></s>. I agree with several comments above:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>DS is correct: Sarfatti is well known in some UseNet physics.* newsgroups as a frequent poster, who rarely if ever replies to criticism in the groups (except by email threats to file suit for defamation of character-- in the interests of full disclosure I should say that I have been the recipient of at least one such threat). Most would call his behavior <i>cranky</i>, but he is not a "troll", since his aim is apparently to promote his "ideas", rather than to foment flame wars and such like. Anyway, on this basis, he is perhaps notable, although not in a very laudable fashion.</li>
<li>OTH, I agree with JIP that the present version of the article is patent nonsense. (Lumidek, you can't be serious--- this article "contains what everyone wants to know"?!) The problem seems to be that JS reacts very badly to what most would consider an NPOV characterization of his writings as incoherent and highly dubious. Is there any way to rewrite the article to remove the nonsense and express what I just said as nicely as possible, cite a few of Sarfatti's published papers and link to his website, and then <i>lock the content</i>? If not, I'd have to change my vote to <b>delete</b>.</li>
<li>Let me call attention to the possibility that several anonymous commentators are socks of the same user (perhaps JS himself). Jack, if that is indeed you, we appreciate your financial support of Wipedia, but you <i>do</i> tend to be very excitable and sometimes your behavior is <i>in my opinion</i> inappropriate. If you attempted to delete someone else's "delete" vote above, or if you are trying to vote here under multiple names, these would be examples of clearly inappropriate behavior. I think you recognize that your ideas are not mainstream, so in my opinion the place to try to sell them is in published papers, or barring that on your website, not here. Also, contrary to what one anon said above, it appears to me that the non-anons are pretty much of one mind about the dubious stature of Sarfatti's "ideas".---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 19:50, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>As per several user's suggestions above, I just rewrote the article to be more NPOV. Sarfatti fans, please keep your cool! I think a good compromise is to say right away that most who have encountered JS's writings consider them cranky, but I balance that by stating second that he <i>does</i> have a genuine background in physics. I took some basic biographical infro from his own website, made a list of claims from the previous version of the biography, (plus one from one of his books), and cited his entry in crank.dot.net but also some of his own websites. I think that's NPOV and I propose that an admin now lock the contents, at least until this VfD is over.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 20:43, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Keep</b> After completely rewriting the article myself, and reading some minor improvements by Chan Ho and Apyule (thanks!), I am changing my vote, since the current version of the biography appears to be sufficiently NPOV and we three seem to agree that a sufficiently prolific UseNet poster is perhaps notable simply on the grounds of being so prolific that many newsgroup readers will have encountered his posts.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One comment: I am suspicious of Chan Ho's claim that Wikipedia's coverage should be different from that of a paper encyclopedia (at least without knowing more about what kind of differences he has in mind), but I have to agree that I can envision the possibility that some newbie might encounter a Sarfatti posting, notice all the impressive buzzwords combined in apparent gibberish, wonder "is it just me?", and search Wikipedia to find out something about Sarfatti.</dd>

<dd>We'll need to monitor this page for incoherent, non-NPOV, and unwikified additions by our anon (which greatly marred the version which I revised). And anon, if you're reading this, please keep your shirt on!

So if you want to modify the article again, please research Wikipedia policies first, read some other biographies here, and think hard about how to keep your contributions NPOV.

<dd><b>Keep</b>. Just because one doesn't agree with him or regards him as "unworthy" somehow of a Wikipedia article does not negate the fact that he is well known in certain Internet communities, such as Usenet. Brittanica would not have an article on him, but I thought Wikipedia took a different slant than a standard encyclopedia.
