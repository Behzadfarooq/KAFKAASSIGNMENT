	    <p>Hi! I think all of Jason's sights are informative and up-lifting- It does seem that some may not understand christianity in its fullness. So in turn are mocking and slandering what they haven't researched or haven't prayed about.We Do read the Holy Bible and no matter what title your denomination is-There are some of the same very important principles and ways to share and live a Life in Christ- I think his site should stay-"Freedom OF Speech" Is for all of us! Jason has proven himself time and time again to be a person of true faith and one who gives to so many "TRUE KNOWLEDGE IS POWER" and thats what he has given to so many people and has helped to change -For the better so many lives- Thank You! <a href="http://TheHelpMeets.com" class="external free" title="http://TheHelpMeets.com" rel="nofollow">http://TheHelpMeets.com</a></p>
<p>LEAVE IT,,, we live in a world where everyone has a right to freedom of speech. Nothing he has done is vulgar or should not be heard. Protect the right of everyone to be heard. Just because you don't agree with him you shouldn't make him take it down.</p>

<p>Since when in our world can we not share both sides of the story? If we listened to the masses and removed everything we did not like where would we learn from? The act of removing this would define your organization as one sided.</p>

<p>OK why exactly is this up for deletion? I don't see anything wrong with it. -Randy N.C.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Jason Gastrich article should not be deleted. He speaks the truth and it is his right to speak of Jesus Christ our Savior.</p>
<p>AH</p>
<p><br />
Everyone should have the freedom to post anything positive about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Johnny L</p>
<p>Why should this page be deleted just because of the complaints of a few? Where is the freedom of speach and religion gone in the USA? All should have the right to voice their opinion whether others agree with him or not.</p>

<p>It looks like the athiets are at it again trying to censor the truth. You cannot prohibit the freedom of speech. If you are going to remove Jasons articles then you better remove the opposing articles. Atheists had nothing to do with finding this country. God fearing people are responsible for creating the greatest country in the world. Ahteists did not give us freedom of speeh now they want to take it away. Anyone who would remove Jasons articles should be ashamed of themselves. Thats a fact, period. <a href="http://www.davidandgoliathministries.com" class="external free" title="http://www.davidandgoliathministries.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidandgoliathministries.com</a></p>
<p>It is ridiculous to the point of lunacy to even consider deletion of articles by Jason Gastrich. Atheists are a miniscule group in our country, thank God, and yet they are trying to censor the huge numbers of Americans who are Christians, and the other very large numbers who though not necessarily "christian" in the full meaning of the word, yet they support generally the Christian values and morals on which this country was founded.</p>
<p>The Liberals and Atheists who claim this country was not founded by Christians, on Christian principles, are either ignoramuses or deliberate liars. Our nation was clearly founded by Christians, not atheists, nor Deists.</p>

Freedom of Speech - I believe this page should remain in Wikipedia - The Free Encylopedia. For Wikipedia to remain FREE (free of cost and more importantly - free speech) it must allow content that speaks about religious beliefs. We must allow content about faith, and specifically about Christ Jesus. Jason's page brings information invaluable for others to learn more about Christ Jesus and faith in God.</p>

<p>I see no reson for this page to be deleted. Please leave in place Kevin Corbin <a href="http://gleaningsfromtheword.com" class="external free" title="http://gleaningsfromtheword.com" rel="nofollow">http://gleaningsfromtheword.com</a></p>

The Atheists should have nothing to fear from the article, since they don't believe in the God Mr. Gastrich supports. Why are they so frightened of something they claim doesn't exist? Leave the article up. It slams nobody, and all seems factual. Are the Atheist-supporting articles being deleted as well?</p>

<p>Are Atheists so scared of Jesus that ehy have to edit/delete/mutulate pages? I thought you guys thought God doesn't exist? 1st Amendment is freedom of speech. We have the right to say we want and so do you! Geoff -<a href="http://teenz4christ.com" class="external free" title="http://teenz4christ.com" rel="nofollow">http://teenz4christ.com</a></p>
<p>Why are you people so threatened by this page. If you don't believe what is says go to an athiest supported page. Those of us trying to raise children without the onslaught of continued liberal junk that floods our media are told to "change the channel". I believe the same thing applies here. If you don't like what the page says go to another one. Mr. Gastrich has a right to his beliefs. This page should not be deleted.

<p>I see no reason for the Jason Gastrich article to be deleted. SDP</p>
<p><br />
While it is true that Jason is still at a fairly early stage in his life and career for God, he already has managed to stir up so much discussion and debate about the Christian faith in the net, running one of the most visited Christian resources, and facilitating online work for many other Christians, as well as actively debating the most zealous and high profile atheists of America in Usenet and Bulletin Board discussions, so that he has actually become very high profile among them.</p>
<p>There exists a sizeable campaign among them to shut his mouth and make him look bad, and they usually use their overwhelming number on their forums to flood out his posts with bad posts about him, which actually in my view have no serious substance other than to serve as an excuse not to listen to the Message.</p>
<p>The existence of a few regrettable frauds in the tele-evangelists have enabled people to paint even sincere people in the worst possible colours, and they have been leveraging this to the hilt in defaming Gastrich, who is innocent of the matters they alledge and insinuate against him.</p>
<p>The existence of an officially sanctioned by Jason article about him on a resource of authority like Wikipedia would be a useful way to offer a balanced view about him, and would not detract from the quality and authority of this online encyclopedia. On the contrary, it would enhance it.</p>
