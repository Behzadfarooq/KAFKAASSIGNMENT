It's a middle school less than 50 years old with no implied notability, no listed notable alumni (which, in and of itself, does not confirm a school's notability, anyway)... how can you&#160;!vote to keep based on that criteria?

<ul>
<li>How in the hell? I suggested nominator read WP:POINT to understand why nominating this might be a bad idea. Once aware of the fight that is likely to ensue, perhaps an attempt to either improve the article himself, or a try to bring it to the attention of the Wikiproject Schools is a better first course of action. This argument has been burning steadily for over two years that I've been here, and I see no reason to throw gasoline at the other side's campfire when you know for a fact that there are dozens of good faith contributors willing to address shortcomings in this particular class of articles. Nominating one article is not WP:POINT, but a streak of four, if continued much beyond that, certainly is, and looks like the start of a certain "war of attrition" tactic tried (unsuccessfully) about two years ago that many WP editors still have bitter memories of. I have no desire for anyone else to go through that type of experience here. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 03:57, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It has been well established that high schools will never be deleted. In my experience, middle schools and lower have been deleted more often than kept. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 04:48, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Do you remember when junior colleges were deleted far more often than kept, and high schools almost always deleted? I do. Do you remember when high schools were deleted far more often than kept, and primary schools always deleted? I do. It's been my observation that currently these are more often merged or kept, and I don't see good reason to think that's a bad thing. However, constantly arguing about it is definitely a bad thing. The simplest solution is laissez-faire wikipedia editing. Don't start wars and we won't be warring.<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 06:02, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Except for the fact that your solution destroys content and alienates good faith editors simply because they have different interests than you, you could be right. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 01:29, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh please. We all have areas of interest that aren't notable. I happen to enjoy palindromes for example. That doesn't mean I make biographies on palindromists who aren't otherwise notable or anything similar. Similarly, there are number theory topics which I find interesting but would clearly not deserve articles. "I am interested in X" is not an inclusion criterion, and no one should be "alienated" from it. Saying that the removal of unencyclopedic not-notable material "destroys content" misses the point. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:34, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, please, indeed. How about searching Amazon for encyclopedia. You'll find 121,736 books there, some serious, some scholarly, because it's more than just Britannica. Some of us want Wikipedia to be inclusive of "encyclopedia of educational institutions", a perfectly fine and legitimate topic for encyclopedic coverage. Quite frankly, if you can create neutral, verifiable biographies of palindromists, I'd be happy to read them here. They've made a unique contribution to the English language. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 05:28, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Worthwhile? Debatable. Notable? Only if you hold as an article of faith that "all schools are notable". I went to at least one school which is not only not notable, it is pretty much unverifiable. Removing it harms the project? Proof by assertion; there is no demonstrable harm from not having somehting which is trivially easy to obtain on the internet from the original source. Precedent? Yes, utter intransigence from the Church of the Inherently Notable School has made it impossible to remove any school article, but that is not a <i>good</i> thing, it's a triumph of sheer blood-mindedness over numerous offered compromises. Clusters of non-editors? Nice ad-hominem, but baseless. Given that the article is going to be kept anyway, Rob, I really can't imagine why you bothered writing the above since it appears calculated solely to add fuel to the flames. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 20:21, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you want to use the analogy of a body, those who insist on deleting items in face of known and certain opposition are the "blood-minded" cutters. You already have the ability and community support to merge ALL of these articles into their parent school districts and localities until they become large enough to warrant breaking out. Just copy the whole article as written, paste it into the district article, then delete the stuff you don't like. That way the detail remains in the edit history of the district. Finally, go back and change the source article to a redirect. It's really quite simple. Yet you insist that deletion is the only solution you're willing to live with. From my side, it appears you're the one unwilling to compromise. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 20:57, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A request for calm please. That said, I take some issue with the claim that the deletions are caused by "clusters of non-editors" since some people (such as myself) who often argue for deletion of schools do so while helping to improve the school articles in question and have helped improve schools that we think should be kept. Furthermore, Rob's comment isn't very relevant in that this isn't a K-12 school but a middle school. As to Unfocused's comments, we don't have a strong consensus for that, and the merging of many school articles would create essentially directories in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and would simply duplicate information that can be generally found on the district website. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:39, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>FYI, "K-12 schools" is short for "elementary, middle, and/or high schools". It makes clear the reference to "school" doesn't include pre-school, after-school, home-school, grad school, night school or some other "school". It doesn't mean a school necessarily teaches every grade from K to 12, inclusive (it may just teach some). Some people use the term "grade school", but often that's used in a less inclusive manner. If there's a better/clearer term, you wish me to use, let me know. But AFAIK, middle schools are a subset of K-12 schools. And that was what that component of my comments, was referring to. There is the precedent I indicated. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 22:58, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's no precedent for K-only inclusion, and I expect such an article to be deleted normally. I'm not aware of a single perfect commonly used term that precisely identify those schools, which we have precedent for keeping. "K-12 school" is close, but not perfect. I suppose "1-12" would be more accurate, but I've never seen anybody use the term "1-12". For any term, there's probably extra qualifications needed. For instance, when I say "school", I normally mean "real, full-time, accredited, and verifiable", even if I don't say so. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 23:45, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Wikipedia is not a directory. Nor is Wikipedia a collection of random information. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:00, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You make reference to two sections of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, that A) Wikipedia is not a directory, and B) Wikipedia is not a collection of random information. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> defines these terms as follows: A) Wikipedia is not a directory of everything that exists or has existed. Wikipedia articles are not: 1. Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as quotations, aphorisms, or persons (real or fictional). <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 2. Genealogical entries or phonebook entries. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>, and <b>3. Directories, directory entries, TV/Radio Guides, or a resource for conducting business</b> Now this what is raised as an issue, but WP:NOT defines this as <b>For example, an article on a radio station generally should not list upcoming events, current promotions, phone numbers, schedules etc., although mention of major events or promotions may be acceptable.</b> There is just nothing in this clause of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> that seems relevant to making this particular article improper. B) Next we have <b>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</b>, which is defined as 1. Lists of Frequently Asked Questions. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 2. Travel guides. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 3. Memorials. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 4. Instruction manuals. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 5. Internet guides.<b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 6. Textbooks and annotated texts. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 7. Plot summaries. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>, Again, there is no aspect of this clause of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> that seems applicable in any way to this article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is often thrown out as a justification to delete articles, but I agree completely with <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> that it simply doesn't apply in this case. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 05:30, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As to the first point, this entry is little more than an address easily in the "phonebook entries" category. As for the second setting, it should be apparent that the list there is not intended to be exhaustive. In fact, almost daily, articles are deleted per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>'s "random collection" criterion even if they don't fall into exactly one of those categories. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:36, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know what's printed in your phone book, but in mine, phonebook entries look like <b>Haverford Middle School 123 Main Street 123-456-7890.</b> This article far exceeds what a phonebook entry is, by any reasonable definition of the term. The fact that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>'s "indiscriminate collection" clause is used to mean "anything I think doesn't belong on Wikipedia", and the fact that there are many people who misuse it and get articles deleted, does not make it a valid argument. The examples provided are intended to serve as cardinal prototypes of "indiscriminate collections", and none of them are within miles of this article. How can we meaningfully apply Wikipedia criteria if their clearcut meaning can be changed to mean anything anyone wants it to mean. You yourself don't excuse bad arguments to keep (e.g. "Do you have some reasoning or basis behind that claim?"), why should a bad argument re <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (e.g., other people use it to mean something other than what it says and they delete articles anyway) be acceptable? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 06:03, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment: If merged, the place to put the school would be in <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Spring%2C_Maryland_a93a.html#Education" title="Silver Spring, Maryland">Silver Spring, Maryland#Education</a> where the current sentence on private schools reads: <i>"Notable private schools in the region include Yeshiva of Greater Washington, Torah School of Greater Washington, <a href="../../../o/u/r/Our_Lady_of_Good_Counsel_High_School_%28Montgomery_County%2C_Maryland%29_6408.html" title="Our Lady of Good Counsel High School (Montgomery County, Maryland)">Our Lady of Good Counsel High School</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Barrie_School_9e96.html" title="The Barrie School">The Barrie School</a>."</i> I noticed two things about the sentence: red links and the word "notable". Will we have a similar conversation about those red-linked schools? And how do we merge in this school if that word "notable" is in there? If you delete the "notable" word and merge this school in, will someone later revert, re-inserting "notable" and dropping out this school? My suggestion is that if the decision is "merge", then put a note on the Silver Spring talk page. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.

<li><b>Speedy close</b> This has the S word in the title so will never get consensus delete. It can go one of two ways: merge, or expand. Neither requires admin powers. And no, I do not think we should have articles on elementary schools, but there will always be holdouts who assert that "all schools are notable" and frankly we have better things to do with our time than continually documenting the existence of a group of users who will never allow any article with "school" in the title to be deleted.

<li><b>Delete</b> (would not object to merging in principal). The awards the school has are by and large minor. The "National Achieving Schools Award" and the "California Achieving Schools Award" don't return any google hits aside from schools that say they have them and Wikipedia mirrors. I can't even find a single newspaper article mentioning that a school was given one. The only award which therefore is arguably at all noteworthy is the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Distinguished_School_d7bc.html" title="California Distinguished School">California Distinguished School</a> award. However, as far as I can tell the number of schools which get this award is immense. There are so many schools award that the award's webpage breaks them out by county <a href="http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/sr/cs/ap/distinguished.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/sr/cs/ap/distinguished.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Picking a county at random, Los Angeles county has over two pages worth of schools with the award <a href="http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/sr/cs/ap/distingcounty.asp?county=19&amp;submit1=Submit" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/sr/cs/ap/distingcounty.asp?county=19&amp;submit1=Submit" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Minor clarification</b> Looking in more detail, Los Angeles county may not have been a representative sample. Some counties such as <a href="http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/sr/cs/ap/distingcounty.asp?county=02&amp;submit1=Submit" class="external text" title="http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/sr/cs/ap/distingcounty.asp?county=02&amp;submit1=Submit" rel="nofollow">this one</a> have very few schools with the award.

<p>Wikipedia is not Wikinews. Gnews results limited a PR release and a very few reports regurgitating it, which doesn't rise above trivial reporting.

<li><b>Keep</b> - to use McLellan's argument, this is not Wikinews, I would say that, if the press coverage is somewhat lacking, his claims is still disturbing. As the conspiracy-loving guy I am, I think that there is substance to his claims, and that the media coverage signals that his story is hush-hush for someone. I understand the guidelines very well, and if you are to use them literally it would be a vote for delete for me too.

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually in terms of the number of people whose lives are affected the pokemon easily wins.

<ul>
<li>Lives affected? By 'individual' Pokemon characters? <a href="../../../o/_/r/O_RLY_cbc4.html" title="O RLY">O RLY</a>? How many people do you think are significantly affected by the <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shuckle.html" title="Shuckle">Shuckle</a> Pokemon character, individually? Pokemon characters are included because they're harmless to those who don't care, and useful to those who do. See the logic? Find any parallels to our current argument? <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 05:21, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh don't get me wrong. I'm not asserting that the pokemon have in any meaningful way affected the people that would be at all distinct from almost any other cartoon characters or what not. I was simply making an assertion about the number of people. And again, note that the main point still holds, even if we have bad standards for Pokemon doesn't mean we should have bad standards for other things. And if we followed the "harmless" standard with your defintion of harmless why do we have any notability criteria at all? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 06:23, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, to briefly answer, verifiability itself implies a certain degree of notability, as independent sources must find something notable enough to report about it. In some cases, that's more than enough, for example, in my opinion, schools. In others we can discuss as required. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 19:32, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And why would that be enough for schools but not for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">people</a> or countries even? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 08:01, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please show me a single country that isn't in "notable" enough to be in Wikipedia simply by being verifiable. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 13:44, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not going to bother any further here because I think you're just arguing for arguments' sake. Congratulations on successfully setting, trolling, and springing your trap. It doesn't make a difference because, unlike schools, I'm pretty sure your favorite little troll-berg was the creation of an individual, for himself, and unsanctioned by any government but the one in his mind. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 19:59, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, I didn't have a "trap" set. In fact, when you asked me for it I had to go look for an example. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ADeletion_review&amp;diff=86519628&amp;oldid=85719247" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ADeletion_review&amp;diff=86519628&amp;oldid=85719247" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Are you now asserting that schools must be sanctioned by a government in order to be notable? I (and I suspect most editors) would see accredition/recognition as not the be-all and end-all factor to whether a school should be kept. Obvious unaccredited but notable schools would be for example <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones_University_ab2f.html" title="Bob Jones University">Bob Jones University</a>. And now, I'm not just "arguing for argument's sake" - I do that quite often in real life but generally don't do it on Wiki since the point of Wikipedia is not have fun debating but to write an encyclopedia. I am arguing because I don't think schools have inherent notability and given that neither people nor countries have inherent notability per long-standing precedent I have a lot of trouble with the idea that schools somehow have some form of inherent notability that countries lack. If micronations with a handful of people aren't necessarily notable then it isn't clear why schools with a handful of people should be notable. Given that, all schools are not notable. So the basic argument fails. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 20:44, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And this one imposes greater requirements for citation: nearly every item included is referenced, or has the particular source within the entry. This is rightly called a "list of references" until some diligent editor takes the initiative and starts the conversion process into prose. Many similar articles have started their life in this fashion; being a long list is no reason for deletion-- it is nowhere near the length of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cultural_references_to_Star_Wars_1f00.html" title="List of cultural references to Star Wars">List_of_cultural_references_to_Star_Wars</a>-- but for editing and pruning. This should not be re-merged, as it was moved precisely because it had grown to such content; removing it entirely would make the section <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html#Fandom_and_popular_culture" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost_(TV_series)#Fandom_and_popular_culture</a> balloon.

<li><b>Keep but Merge</b>: I think that this article should be cleaned up (as per other comments) and merged with Lost main page - another show article that incorporates references in pop culture is the Buffy the Vampire Slayer main site, if anyone wants to check it out (just got featured article status recently!). <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiverbend_1f41.html" title="User:Riverbend">Riverbend</a> 20:47, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's a long list, and it is not unusual to spin off a long list from the main article. Plenty of other lists just like this one too, and frankly, while I might not find it useful, someone else might. We don't have to emulate Britannica here. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 00:34, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete or merge</b>. Wikipedia doesn't need original research list pages of pop culture references. It's bad enough that many episode articles of shows have insanely huge lists of pop culture references. Yes, shows and films have pop culture references: but it's not completely necessary to have a huge list of them. Keep the important ones only. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 19:28, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Temple supposedly exists in the town of Lacey, although its presence there is doubtful (Guinn, 1996: 50-55). Given that the Temple is largely a mail-order organization like The Church of Satan, the lack of an official establishment is hardly a surprise; Lucas Martel, the founder of the Temple of the Vampire, was a member of LaVey's organization. Many contemporary vampires become involved with the Temple for a time, but few continue because they disagree with its brutal world-view and come to believe that it is little more than a money-making scam.</dd>

Some will argue that the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Lisa_f49d.html" title="Apple Lisa">Apple Lisa</a> was supposedly named after her, but as far as I can tell neither <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Computer_f26c.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a> nor Jobs have ever confirmed that theory, always officially stating that the name is an acronym for "Local Integrated Software Architecture". Therefore, the only "notable" information about her can't actually be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>. It could be argued that the industry speculation about the origin of the name is itself somewhat notable, but that is already mentioned in the Apple Lisa article and doesn't merit a separate article for Lisa Brennan-Jobs. -<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Smooth_ae06.html" title="User:Big Smooth">Big</a> <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBig_Smooth_1480.html" title="User talk:Big Smooth">Smooth</a></i> 21:47, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>can we agree to leave this article up deleting the readership numbers...i thought it would be useful to add under the <b>Canada</b> Jews section as a link to other Jewish publications. That's it, that's all....no alterior motive. The bottom line is that it is a successful cool ethnic magazine in the Jewish community...there is no advertising motive...it's a free magazine. I made haste when adding it to wikipedia as an article. I use wikipedia as a resource often...I was not aware that regular folks like us could add info to the site, so I took the opportunity.

<dd>Joshuaz, I simply use the criteria that I would expect to find the entry. All schools appear in numerous official guides, they appear on local information sites, they have a huge local audience, and they contain probably the biggest user group for Wikipedia. The only reason I can see for not having schools, is their huge number, but there is a clear policy (WP:?) that says this is not a reason to prevent entries. --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 20:37, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>This is a sub-article about a religious organization, which does not have any reliable sources, and does not have any assertion of notability. Multiple attempts to merge/redirect the subject to a more appropriate location have been reverted by someone with a conflict of interest, so I am proceeding to AfD. Recommend speedy deletion, otherwise they're just going to trot in another herd of sockpuppets, like they did at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sahaja_Yoga_International_ebd8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sahaja Yoga International">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sahaja Yoga International</a>. --<a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENovaSTL_cc89.html" title="User:NovaSTL">NovaSTL</a> 06:06, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> I don't really see how an article about a mountain can be vanity, since mountains don't write articles. I know the "other things like this have an article so this should have an article" argument often doesn't go over well in Afd, but in this case I think it applies, as there isn't a guideline. If you check the categories related to mountains there are <i>tons</i> of individual US mountains with article (9 in Massachusetts alone, and we're not really famous for our mountains.) <i>Most</i> mountains are part of a mountain range, so that argument doesn't really fly with me. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 18:36, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> All these people who are saying "Delete per WP:SOFTWARE" need to clarify what they mean. Are they saying that they agree with the rationale on WP:SOFTWARE as to why articles not meeting the criteria listed there need to be deleted, or are they simply saying that it needs to be deleted since it violates WP:SOFTWARE, regardless of whether or not they agree with it. If it's the latter, then that argument is completely bogus as WP:SOFTWARE <i>is not policy!</i>. The former is somewhat more reasonable, but still, the fact that it's not policy but only a <i>proposed</i> policy which may or may not pass should give one pause when invoking it. Why not wait and see if it becomes policy, and act then, rather than delete an article which under current policy is perfectly acceptable? Why remove perfectly good content (and risk pissing off a potentially valuable contributor) because of something that's not even policy yet? It's ridiculous. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 20:07, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>I would say KEEP.</b> This simply an informational page about a company that is large enough and has created enough notable products to be featured in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> as spam. This is one of the better written advertisements I've seen, but it remains nothing more than an advertisement none the less. Few of the links under "recognition" actually talk about the company itself. The rest are included because an employee of the company got a one line question/answer in an unrelated article. The entire section is basically nothing more than name dropping in an attempt to add legitimacy. The blatant linkspamming does not help their cause at all. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 00:17, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

"Ranked by" doesn't mean squat if you're not ranked #1 in a basket of important criteria, judged againts solid competition: so what if it's ranked by Netcraft? What is more, the Tier 1 Research ranking is unimpressive.

<p>Deletion is requested under <a href="../../../c/f/s/WP%7ECFSD_cc8f.html#G7" title="WP:CFSD">CSD G7</a>. The cited rule has two conditions: both are met.

The fulfillment of the first condition is borne out by investigation of the article’s history. Some users, including <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">User:Charles Matthews</a>, and others, made objections to the proposed deletion on grounds extraneous to the rule.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a page with a long history. To assert now, after half a year, that the original page was mistakenly created, beggars belief. We do not allow wikilawyering about speedy deletion to trump the basic principle that content once submitted should not be 'revoked' by an author, who finds that editing here is collective. CSD G7 should not be a loaded gun that any page's original author can point at the community, as a threat, in order to get leverage on the page's content. <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> applies here. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 09:28, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The nominator's amusing reasoning doesn't help his case, and has been amply answered by Charles Matthews on the talk page of the article and on this page. So that leaves us with only this professor's notability according to <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">our academic biography guidelines</a> to consider. However, any doubts that this person is notable are soundly demolished by pages like <a href="http://www.gymnasium-blankenese.de/Haupt-Frame/Besondere_Aktivitaeten/Heller-Spann-Preis/heller_obituary_nyt.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.gymnasium-blankenese.de/Haupt-Frame/Besondere_Aktivitaeten/Heller-Spann-Preis/heller_obituary_nyt.htm" rel="nofollow">this obituary from the <i>New York Times</i></a>, <a href="http://www.library.northwestern.edu/archives/findingaids/erich_heller.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.library.northwestern.edu/archives/findingaids/erich_heller.pdf" rel="nofollow">the 13 boxes of papers he wrote</a>, and the many other books he wrote which is surely more than the output of many academics.

<li><b>Keep</b> per the above, it seems completely untenable to suggest an article created a long time ago with over 500 edits by the nominator was done "in error". The actual history of the article appears revealing edit summary such as "(art split off and moved from userpage without user's approval or consent, in an act of hidden vandalism)" and it's original userfication do support the suggestion that the nominator is actually complaining about their lack of ability to have long term exclusive control on the article, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a free webhost</a>.

<li>Oh, dear. Still thinking that I had some misunderstanding there, are you? That's fine, if you think it. Others can form their own opinions. Since your talk page has no official capacity and you were engaged in a Mad Hatter's tea party in your own mind, I really didn't feel there was any profit to being there. Unfortunately, your talk page is not your blog, and, if you cannot contribute and do not want to have your words edited, you shouldn't be trying to use it that way. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:29, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It has been pointed out above that the official policy you are quoting has specific sections that apply here, and which make clear that CSD G7 is not appropriate here. In case it is not yet clear, you will find that people here will greatly respect 30 years of scholarly work, but if you don't want to put this work on Wikipedia to be collaboratively edited by others, then you should publish it elsewhere instead (you still retain copyright on what you originally wrote, but cannot copy current versions without attributing Wikipedia). For example, you could publish your work on a website of your own. If you did that, the article on Wikipedia could be rewritten from scratch and include a reference to your website as an external link. Since most of the content at the moment is undoubtedly contributed by you, the ethical course for Wikipedia would most likely to agree to this (though technically I don't think we have to, as you 'released' your material under the GFDL by pressing 'save' in the editing window). Anyway, if this hypothetical website of yours ever died, Wikipedia could just revert back to the most informative version of the article (which would still exist in the page history). The ethical course for you would be to acknowledge on this hypothetical website that the material was first published at Wikipedia. For most people's contributions, which are tangled up in amongst other's, this doesn't work. Your contributions are still relatively easy to distinguish from others, so this course of action is probably possible. Others may have differing opinions though, as the possibility of someone later republishing what they have contributed to Wikipedia might be discussed elsewhere and rejected (ie. I might just be wrong here). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 17:39, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>As you say he has copyright ownership over his own work, releasing it under the GFDL doesn' restrain him in any way on that, he can release his own work under an alternative license quite freely without any need to mention wikipedia or anyone else (The GFDL as a license is him as the copyright holder agreeing to license his works to others under certain conditions, not a license to himself...). Only if he makes use of other peoples work would he need to license their work under the GFDL and thus be subject to it's conditions. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 00:59, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is in addition to the fact that he has not contributed as a signatory. I.e. his name is not "Prof02" at birth, and, since Wikipedia does not require the real name, we <i>cannot</i> "give" the rights to "him." I cannot call back all my contributions, for example, because no one at Wikipedia or in the software knows my legal name. We ran into this problem when we had reports of a contributor "dying" and then having "him" try to reclaim his account. We couldn't know if the "him" asking for rights back was the "him" who "died." Basically, Wikipedia is in a position of neither claiming nor granting rights other than the GFDL. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:33, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi, WikiPedant. Your keep&#160;!vote is very logical, and it's clear enough that the article will in fact be kept. I don't really object. I guess I was most of all expressing my feeling of how nice it would be to get the whole thing off of Wikipedia. I do have some logic of my own, though: as soon anybody but Prof02 tries to edit it, it is <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incandescence.html" title="Incandescence">incandescently</a> clear from <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProf02_e300.html" title="User talk:Prof02">User talk:Prof02</a> and <a href="../../../e/r/i/Talk%7EErich_Heller_9a39.html" title="Talk:Erich Heller">Talk:Erich Heller</a> that he will defend its present state to the death, then quickly be blocked for edit warring, then quickly be indefinitely blocked. Honestly, Wikipedia <i>is</i> a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">chrystal ball</a> sometimes. What's the point? As for ways of "dealing" with the user's civility issues, I've been trying to do that since May or whenever it was, and I really doubt it. Never mind, though. I just wanted to explain my angle. Oh, and I was indeed thinking of putting the user subpages on <a href="../../../m/f/d/WP%7EMFD_9ce3.html" title="WP:MFD">WP:MFD</a>, I quite agree that deleting them can't be decided on AFD. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 05:31, 8 November 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li>Yes, <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a>, I think your prediction is quite likely to prove accurate. Perhaps there is a way out for all concerned. If the finding of this AfD process is that G7 has not been satisfied and the article stays, Wikipedia functionaries could make Prof02 an exceptional offer -- to delete the article and Prof02's userpages if Prof02 withdraws voluntarily and permanently from the Wikipedia project. He may well be as fed up with the contributors to this project as some of them are with him, and be quite agreeable to a mutual parting of the ways. But I don't have a clue who has the authority to make or implement such an offer. - <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiPedant_c1b0.html" title="User:WikiPedant">WikiPedant</a> 06:11, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b>. Obviously Erich Heller is worthy of an article here, but is this article worthy of Erich Heller? That a man described as an essayist can have a page of this calibre devoted to him tells the world more about Wikipedia's standards than about Erich Heller. It cannot under any stretch of the imagination be described as objective or encyclopedic. If an editor is prepared to take it into userspace, and heavily edit it until it conforms to the standards expected of a Wikipedia article then perhaps it could be given a limited trial life in order to conform. I could prune this by a third and make an encyclopedic page within twenty minutes - but it's not my subject - I would probably remove something important, and this is the danger, editing this page cannot be tackled by just anyone, we could have something of even less use than the present article, if not downright misleading and dangerous to Wikipedia's reputation. - So for Erich Heller's and Wikipedia's sake this has to go - and then if necessary be re-created in a more encyclopedic fashion by a new editor at sometime in the future. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 09:04, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not know whether or not <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">User:Giano II</a> is aware that the <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_Heller_5fde.html" title="Erich Heller">Erich Heller</a> article he is looking at is not an article that its contributor, the undersigned, intended for Wikipedia. <i>That</i> article is still in the process of being prepared <u>here</u>, and at the present stage is still <i>not</i> ready to be released to the main article space. The article on Heller which Giano is looking at, and which constitutes the subject of the present debate, has been forcibly wrenched — in violation of Wikipedia guidelines — without the user’s knowledge or consent, from that work-in-progess on the user’s subpage (I use the Saxon genitive judiciously here). When I asked that the article be re-merged with the body from which it was truncated, the administrators involved refused point-blank, without stating valid (or indeed <i>any</i>) reasons. The matter, as a result, is a subject of a very, very serious <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProf02_e300.html#Conflict_in_need_of_resolution.2Frequest_for_comment" title="User talk:Prof02"><u>dispute</u></a>, involving pre-eminently <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">User:Charles Matthews</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">User:Bishonen</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiPedant_c1b0.html" title="User:WikiPedant">User:WikiPedant</a>, but also others, who are now locked in a battle of their administrative lives on Wikipedia. Let’s therefore keep the proceedings on this page simple, and constrain ourselves solely to the subject-matter at hand, which is the <a href="../../../c/f/s/WP%7ECFSD_cc8f.html#G7" title="WP:CFSD">CSD G7</a> rule.

<dd>Parenthetically speaking, the reason why works-in-progress <i>cannot</i> be edited by others, even if they show the compulsive eagerness to do so exhibited by <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">User:Charles Matthews</a>, is the circumstance that the ‘progress’, as in ‘work-in-progress’, is arrested in such conditions. I have never had anything close to the unreasonable problems created artificially by a single user, with the support of a group of others who benefit from the protective umbrella that his membership of the ArbCom in their eyes bestows, with the ten or so other articles I have contributed so far. And this situation I do mean to change, permanently, even if I have to suffer mud being thrown in my face as I methodically pursue this. — Prof02 07:11, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> — Read the prod instructions. It only says to note the removal in the edit summary; not to give a reason why.

<li>Given that I believe every school I've ever seen or read of serve their communities with an importance that far exceeds the societal impact of the average music CD, yet we keep those CDs, is not "keep all schools for no reason", it's "keep all schools for very good reasons that <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> doesn't agree with". In my experience, a school that serves only one grade is unique and interesting. I'd never even heard of such a thing, and I've been editing schools here for over two years, logged in and anon. That you find them common suggests that more of them should have articles here on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 01:40, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The smallest level at which I would expect Wikipedia to have entries is the local area equivalent to a small village. In a modern village the school is often the main if not sole focue to the community. It therefore follows that it would be impossible to write an article on each geographical area without mentioning the school. So, much better is to turn it around and have an entry for each school and tag onto it a bit of information on the local area. By tagging it to the school it also ensures that sub-areas with less population than a school are not included. But most of all, I've often had to resort to school web sites to research local areas because the school web site is the <u>only</u> source of local information. If I have found information on schools of invaluable use, then I see no reason why numerous other people would not, and to my mind that warrants an entry on most schools (although I might merge infant schools by area). I hope that answers your question! TO recap: I use WIkipedia, I have need of information on most schools, and therefore as a user i wish Wikipedia to have entries on most schools QED -<b>keeep</b> --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 21:22, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>The school is the <i>main</i> or <i>sole</i> focus of a whole community? You cannot possibly be serious. This is true in a number of college towns, but it's beyond ludicrous to suggest that this elementary school is the sole focus of the community in which it resides. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 22:12, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Of course I am serious. There are many places where the only information on the locale is the school. WIkipedia does not pay its contributors, it can't force a comprehensive coverage of all areas, but if it has a positive attitude to school then it will achieve this. I'm amazed that I have to explain this! Of course schools are the centre of whole communities. Within our local, the <u>only</u> is the only social facility - there are no shops, no pubs, no hotels, no factories, no square, there's a garage, and around 5000 people. In fact, the only reason most people live here is because the secondary school (there isn't any other reason to live here!). I am much more a user of wikipedia than a contributor. I know what kind of articles that I find useful - and by far the most useful articles are the ones that cover micro-geographical details as contained in most good school articles. I explained that Wikipedia needs to work with schools rather than trying to piss them off! There is no good reason to delete this article except prejudice by those that don't live in the area (and I don't!) --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 23:06, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>First, let me state that you are welcome to delete articles about schools in my area. I really don't mind. Now as to the more substantial points, while we are concered with users of Wikipedia that isn't the be-all and end-all. As a user, I'd like to have all mathematical knowledge on the planet in Wikipedia. It would be quite convenient. And I'd like to have individual articles on each stamp ever issued by the US government, and each coin as well. That doesn't mean we should have that. Furthermore, we have no evidence that this school is the sort of hub that you are claiming it is. While colleges (and occasionally highschools) sometimes seem to be such hubs, the claim that an elementary school is such a hub is very hard to believe. If you had a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> that claimed that this school functioned as a hub or some similar comment, that would be worth something. It is however, very hard to credit things with the notion that because it might function as a hub we should keep it. (And there is always Wikitravel). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 08:11, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's the point, the sources cited in the article are <i>duty bound</i> to report on the existence of the school. One of them is the school's own website, and the others are simply organisations (School Boards and the like) which mention a series of schools, much like the website of a club or society having a membership list. The existence of the school isn't in doubt, in other words. Neither is my existence in doubt, but it's not proven by anything that establishes my notability (just the standard birth certificate, passport, bank account etc). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 07:19, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Many people at this point comes with multiple indepenent sources. For example, in many areas, birth certificates and marriage certificates are open to the public, thus giving many people automatically two independent sources.

<li><b>Do not delete:</b> I disagree, if you type gfp and “personal finance” on google you will see that the first 10 result pages are about the software, some of then not in English (Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Chinese, French), indeed the software is more used for people that does not speak English natively. Even if you type only GFP on google you will see that that 7th result is about GFP, but it isn’t in Enlgish. It was published in an article on Italian Magazine named “PC Professional” (It’s obviously written in Italian) as you can see clicking on the link in this article: <a href="http://gfd.sourceforge.net/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=12" class="external free" title="http://gfd.sourceforge.net/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=12" rel="nofollow">http://gfd.sourceforge.net/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=12</a>. There are articles about GFP on <a href="http://opensourceinstall.org/" class="external free" title="http://opensourceinstall.org/" rel="nofollow">http://opensourceinstall.org/</a> (In Chinese), and <a href="http://www.clubedohardware.com.br/" class="external free" title="http://www.clubedohardware.com.br/" rel="nofollow">http://www.clubedohardware.com.br/</a> (In Brazilian Portuguese). In any of these articles it is indicated as a good Open source and multi platform alternative to MS Money. Just because its popularity in other languages is grater them in English, isn’t a reason to remove it from English idiom articles (the idea is that with the English article on wikipedia users that speak others languages in witch GFP is more used can write their idiom translation).</li>

<p>Augh... where to start? All 150 kB of this article were pasted in at once by a user who has made no contributions outside this article, and the article has barely changed since then - not because it's perfect, though, but because it's impossible to know where to start. The article starts out like a biography of Syed Aley Rasool Hasnain Miyan Nazmi (now that's a mouthful), but goes off on a series of mini-biographies on various other persons and anecdotes, then - around halfway through - launches into a treatise on Islam.</p>
<p>There isn't a single reference, and almost no wikilinks, in the entire thing. Almost none of the names show up on Google. If this isn't patent nonsense, it's unverifiable and unmaintainable. <a href="../../../t/k/t/User%7ETktech_2b91.html" title="User:Tktech">Tktech</a> put a tag on the talk page noting that he was working on it, but that was over a month ago and nothing has changed since. <b>Delete</b> without prejudice to a well-written, well-referenced article if one can be created. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 11:12, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> I would also think this is copyright violation.

<p>Content is " Fancey is the solo project of Todd Fancey who is a member of Canadian indie rock group The New Pornographers. Fancey released his first album in 2004." No assertion of notability whatsoever. It's a <i>project</i>, not a band and thus can't be speedied.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> still. What this "project" sounds like to me is a one-man band. Therefore, still a band. The article says nothing to make me think that this is anything but an artiste going solo under a (not very imaginative) name.

However, one must take into consideration of the <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">verifiability</a> of the content. It is indeed possible to verify the content based on a google search. <a href="http://www.rss.org/New_RSS/History/RSS_Story.jsp" class="external text" title="http://www.rss.org/New_RSS/History/RSS_Story.jsp" rel="nofollow">This article</a> also gives us a detailed explanation of this yoga. Considering the amount of subjects based on Western knowledge on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> currently, I feel that keeping this article with the addition of proper references would somewhat, albeit in a micro manner, balance the scope of this project. One must also remember that yoga in general is very popular in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> and there are thousands of different types of yoga being practiced at a national level in this hoary nation. --<font style="background:gold"><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/v/User%7ESiva1979_25a6.html" title="User:Siva1979">iva1979</a></font><sup><a href="../../../s/i/v/User_talk%7ESiva1979_3c9b.html" title="User talk:Siva1979"><font style="background:yellow">Talk to me</font></a></sup> 13:07, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Inadequatedly Caffeinated Delete</b> oh my god my head hurts argh. *great big coffee sip* Uh, we're talking about a rather <i>obvious</i> content here. "Drunk blogging is when you blog while drunk" kind of obvious. Look, it's probably notable if you patent thing "X" and some other company patents "X over the Internet". Especially if there's bazillion lawsuits. But this isn't necessarily notable. We don't have article on Drunken Counter-Strike Tournaments, Drunken Astrophysics Exams, or <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Comment Moderation on Crack</a>. We don't need to cover every obvious syllogistic expansion of articles (as in "it's possible to do X while drunk, therefore we can make an article 'doing X while drunk'"). Cover it in main article, though I don't really think this is widespread enough to be considered a notable phenomenon. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 12:59, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

As for "POV", there has been a revision of Spanish Inquisition history with recent new evidence that has come to light starting in the 1970's - if you agree with it or not, if you think it is good history or bad history, doesn't matter - it's a lengthy enough subject to warrant an article. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 20:47, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

<li><s>Not sure yet, doing more research; you may all be right. Looks like the book came out back in 2003. There are a lot of ways a book can be a best seller, or so it would appear based on what I read. Sometimes it is based on numbers, but that is not always the case; it often based on category. I don't want to be so quick to rush to judgement just to delete this, but, like I said, you may be right. I added the quotes for the names and found it pulled over 14,000 on his name. I went through about 200 before I got tired of it and most looked to be this guy. Honestly, I am not sure what test works for an author and what does not. But it also seems there is more to the guy than this. I am not sure I would be so quick to remark that the lack of coverage online as "astonishing." I consider it remarkable that he (or anyone) has writen a book in the first place; I have never done so, have you? It is easy for us to debate this on Wikipedia, and who knows, he may not even want it here. Went to his site but saw no way to contact him. But also, people these days seem way to fast to want to get rid of pages and the tone concerns me. Has anyone else checked, because I do not see it the same way as Kavadi carrier who seems heck bent on getting rid of this entry and, at that, using "verifiable" when even that standard is in dispute right now - just my two cents.

<p>Not notable. The actual term means body work and has a separate wikipedia entry see <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taijutsu.html" title="Taijutsu">Taijutsu</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. First, the article is not an advertisment for some school, several months ago, I saw that the article had no external links (and was tagged with a "references" tag), so I did a quick google search and added the links to 2 websites that described this martial art. This was before I had a username. If you think this article is an advertisment for the external links, then you are mistaken, becuase that was not my intention when I added them (I added them to provide sources for the article). Second, a google search seems to incicate that Tae Jitsu is, in fact an actual, indepentant martial art, even the articles talk page has someone who says they hold a black belt in it, and the two external links belong to two completly different websites, both saying that Tae Jitsu is an authenic art. as far as notability, what makes this any less notable than any other martial arts article? If it's an authenic art, then it should be kept. Furthermore, "Taijutsu" is a martial arts term while Tae Jitsu is a martial art. I really don't see how a martal arts term can be compared with a martial art (the two may sound similar but theres a difference between a term and an actual art) MasterGreenLantern 14:47, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There are many websites that describe Tae Jitsu as a hybrid martial art that combines Tae Kwon Do with other arts, making it a new, seperate (but still hybrid) martial art.

If Tae Jitsu is an authenic martial art (A hybrid, but still a seperate, indepentiant art, as I think I have shown in my orginal comments) than it should be kept. I don't understand why anyone would want to merge or redirect to TaiJustsu, when Taisutsu and Tai Jitsu are <b>completely</b> diferent.

An article should stand on its own merits, not because it's similar to another article on Wikipedia. Also read <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle G/On notability</a> which is an essay that describes the notability guideline in an objective way. However, I'm going to go ask the Martial Arts Wikiproject what they think about this, because it's a fairly specialist area (however, this article specifically is about a modern martial art and there should be verifiable reliable sources, see if you can find books on the subject) Again, the main question to ask is, how do we know if the WIF and the ICMAUA are really experts in the field of martial arts? (You can ask the question about the other three articles, and if they don't pass either, they should be listed for deletion.) <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 21:46, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete or Merge</b> for non-notability and lack of authoritative sources. There is no evidence suggesting that the fictional depiction of "Tae Jitsu" in Family Guy is linked to an authentic school, rather than using a Japanese-sounding term. It looks like the art is taught out of a single school as a hybrid art, but there is no notable presence of it elsewhere. --<a href="../../../s/c/b/User%7EScb_steve_9822.html" title="User:Scb steve">Scb steve</a> 22:42, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think User:MasterGreenLantern really feels strongly about this so I propose we hold off for a week to give him a chance to address the concerns in the article rather than here and elsewhere. The article itself (not the links) has to make the case for notability, it does not. I suggest using <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakko_Ryu_6d12.html" title="Hakko Ryu">Hakko Ryu</a> as an example of a minimal article. Who founded the art, when was it founded, where is it practiced, who's in charge? Of course if it is expaned beyond that great. I put a few tags into the article itself.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 09:59, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm trying to do some research and gather information right now. I'll see if I can expand the article in a few days. I honestly know almost nothing about Tae Jitsu (personally, my favorite martial arts are Jeet Kune Do and Systema, and I don't know much about martial arts beyond those two). But I'll see what I can do about expanding the article (unless someone more knowledgeable shows up). MasterGreenLantern 22:35, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I have spent the past week trying to get information about the history and background of Tae Jitsu, but unfortunatly, the only sources of information I can find are the two websites in the external links section (the two Tae Jitsu schools), and the websites I already mentioned above. So I can't find any independant sources, and everyone here seems to think that the school websites are not acceptable sources, so I am unsure how to procede. I sent Emails to both schools 5 days ago requesting additional information, but they have not responded. I thought about expanding the article using information from both Tae Jitsu schools websites, but as I just said, it seems they are not acceptable sources. So I am unsure of about what to do next.

<dd>Delete (or Merge): I have not been involved in those discussions and just came across this page today, so I don't know what has already been decided. The information on it seems to have been carefully gathered and it is interesting to look through, but there is already sort of an entry for the Numbers that other pages refer to, only much smaller and without details like this. I think that this page, as is, isn't really right for Wiki, but I think that the other Numbers article could certainly be fleshed out a lot more on its own. If this page gets deleted, perhaps some mention could be made on that article about the extent to which these numbers are interconnected to the characters and what happens on the island. I like that someone put the work into gathering this info, I just don't know that this is the right forum for it (but I will print it out and show to my Lostfriends!!) <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiverbend_1f41.html" title="User:Riverbend">Riverbend</a> 19:13, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> (and cleanup). By no means is this featured list material, nor is it necessarily any <i>good</i>. However, it has the potential to be useful. Many of these items have their own articles, and if someone were looking for an item the name of which they didn't know, this list would be a place to start. It is not an indiscriminate collection of information because there are criteria for an item's inclusion, namely being in the Mario series. It is not an instruction manual either. Furthermore, it seems to me such a list would be more useful to someone who has never played a Mario game and is looking up a reference they saw outside a video game context (where these items do appear). It could be a very useful list, especially as it is annotated as well. --<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeitei_af28.html" title="User:Keitei">Keitei</a> <span style="font-size:75%">(<a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeitei_ced4.html" title="User talk:Keitei">talk</a>)</span> 09:56, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I googled your name glen and came up with nothing. r u bogus??? Anykind of historian would know that people in ww1 and ww11 weren't automaticlly given there own link. I have the metals, Legel papers, Honorable discharge papers and diary of a man who was truley a war hero. just because he has been put on the internet doesn't mean a thing. Like i said, anyone can make a internet site and say whatever. Thats why it better to have papers from the US government than unclebobs candy site.com. The man was one of the most decorated ww11 vets. i'm part irish but i don't have my own link, does this mean i'm not even though my birth cert says i am???? <b>Keep the page</b> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tedfordc (<a href="../../../t/e/d/User_talk%7ETedfordc_4c65.html" title="User talk:Tedfordc">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tedfordc_8606.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tedfordc">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<p>Non-notable book per <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a>. The book has already survived an AfD debate which <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ninth_Day_of_Creation_aefa.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ninth Day of Creation">ended in no consensus</a> a year ago, with what seemed to be a couple of single purpose accounts and some particularly odd rationale<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ninth_Day_of_Creation&amp;diff=24921035&amp;oldid=24865805" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ninth_Day_of_Creation&amp;diff=24921035&amp;oldid=24865805" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. The book's publisher admits to having created the article. Also nominating Immunological Technologies which was created to support this article. The article about the book's author Leonard Crane currently is tagged with a prod but I suppose that if it's deproded, it should be added to the current debate.<a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 16:05, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I disagree with some of Wikipedia's notable policies. The book was published, which I believe makes it inherently worthy of an article. However, by the strict Wikipedia guidelines, this book is non-notable.

<li>keep. Obviously verifiable. Guidelines are NOT policy, and the one referenced is particularly bad.

<li><del><b>Keep</b> the main Ninth Day article but <b>delete</b> the Immunological Technologies one</del>. The net change in the main article between this AfD and the last <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ninth_Day_of_Creation&amp;diff=85675425&amp;oldid=25799738" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ninth_Day_of_Creation&amp;diff=85675425&amp;oldid=25799738" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> has only been to remove the entire plot synopsis and insert an infobox. I suppose that the two reviews cited do come from third-party independent sources which choose books to review based on notability, and can hence be considered assertion of this book's notability. As for Immunological Technologies, I do not believe it is major enough to deserve its own article. <a href="../../../k/a/v/User%7EKavadi_carrier_b65d.html" title="User:Kavadi carrier">Kavadi carrier</a> 17:15, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'd like to add that the book's publisher had published nothing else than this single book. According to Worldcat, the book itself is not in any public library in Canada or the UK, in only one in Australia, and in 37 in the US which is very very low. It's also a fact that the creation of this article was part of the publisher's effort to make this book more well-known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Randommouse" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Randommouse" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>. Yes there are two reviews but the idea that they choose to review this book <i>because</i> it is notable does not make any sense. Anyone can send their book for review to the SF site <a href="http://www.sfsite.com/us.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sfsite.com/us.htm" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>: ok so someone there liked the book and wrote about it but they most certainly did not choose to do so based on the notability of the book. The book gets <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22ninth+day+of+creation%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22ninth+day+of+creation%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">82 unique Ghits</a>. If you go through these, you will get a definite sense that this book has completely flown under the radar. I just don't see how this article can be viewed as anything but spam. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 17:56, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Additional information:</p>
<p>Wikipedia is not a dictionary. This is not a neologism, because it is not in common use outside of certain anti-semetic groups, and fails to cite any reliable secondary sources that meet the standards of Wikipedia's "Reliable sources for neologisms." At best, the subject appears to be a protoneologism, in which case it should be deleted because this article appears to exist only to promote the use of the term (despite that the article mostly contains critical discussion of the term, and many Wikipedians have attempted to correctly portray it as a fringe-term, they are merely playing into the hands of the individuals who wish to promote its usage.) In fact, the article has existed for several years and has neverbeen edited to include any references of sources.</p>
<p>If one considers the subject to refer to an actual organization, it should be deleted because it does not meet the criteria for the notability of organizations. Unlike significant items of historical interest, such as the Elders of Zion conspiracy-hoax, this "organization" is not notable; again, its presence as an article merely acts to ascribe notability to something nonexistant and invented by certain groups with ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Redundant: this subject is adequately dealt with as part of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_conspiracy_theories.html" title="List of conspiracy theories">List_of_conspiracy_theories</a> and therefore does not require more extensive coverage (and debate) here. If there is any content in the article that is additive to the subject of Jewish world domination conspiracy theories, it should be dealt with there. If it is determined that there should in fact be a separate page on Jewish conspiracy theories, it should be relocated to there.</p>

<li>I remember this book. They sold it in comic book stores. They also talked about it in a course I had in college called "Ethics and Laws of Mass Communication". The content apparently caused some kind of furor throughout New Jersey.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep this article. It is sourced well enough, and the author has demonstrated his willingness to continue his contributions to this entry. Anything But Monday must have had enough of an impact on Americana if a "soon to be famous" pop band has assumed the publication's name over 20 years later.</p>
<p><br />
Not sure what the objection to this article is. The author HAS established notability with the links that point to the magazine’s inclusion in various comic book guides and databases. This makes it at least as notable as other lesser-known comics (of which there are many that have articles in Wikipedia.) As to sourcing, besides the comic itself, the author has included an audio news report as well as links to podcasts that discuss the publication. That being said, I do see a few instances where citations are needed. (The reference to the creators of Anything But Monday having worked for MTV, for example.) But those parts should be flagged "citation needed" or edited out of the article rather than deleting the whole article itself.12.193.56.130 20:39, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> and tag re-added.

<li>As the writer of this article I can say that STABLE are in fact influential within the Yorkshire area of England. This surely means that they should be able to remain in the encyclopedia.

<dd>Amazon reviews can be made by anyone. It's like quoting a MySpace page. What I'm getting at is that there have been no critical reviews. It has made, AFAIK, zero impact on any culture. Just cause something appeared once on TV (even if it gets reissued by someone looking to turn a quick buck) doesn't make it notable.

<dd>(to IronDuke) There is a difference between citing a source to support a statement and citing a source to backup the notability of a subject. The latter only shows that someone who is independent on the subject has considered the subject interesting/important enough to talk about it. I myself would not made an article out of Amazon reviews; the Amazon reviews only show that someone was interested in the series enough to write something about it.</dd>
<dd>Of course, if your idea of notability is "having a lasting impact on a culture", what I said makes no sense to you. Good luck on trying to enforce such definition of notability on Wikipedia, then. <a href="../../../t/i/z/User_talk%7ETizio_6b5c.html" title="User talk:Tizio">Tizio</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tizio_ea31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tizio">Caio</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/z/User%7ETizio_edab.html" title="User:Tizio">Sempronio</a> 21:21, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>There is no way to <b>prove</b> something is non-notable. Is that so hard to grasp? If someone puts an article up about their dog Fluffy, and I wanted to delete it, how would I <b>prove</b> Fluffy wasn't notable? It would be up to the article's editor to, when challenged, come back and say "Oh, Fluffy saved a schoolbus full of kids from drowning." If somebody wanted to come up with a reference saying that this production was somehow notable, as opposed to all the many, many adaptations there have been before and since, please do so. Happy to be proven wrong. And no, no notability whatever "follows" from the trivial reproduction of a non-trivial work. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke"><font color="green">IronDuke</font></a></li>

<li>This just seems a little obvious. A BBC serial of one of the best known novels in the English language.

<li>But that's nothing more than argument by assertion. If it is so notable, surely someone must have noted it, e.g., "This is the finest adaptation of any novel there has ever been."

It may change though, because, <b>all</b> of these types of articles are based upon speculation that may or may not be true. The people who read the article, take the risk of having the information in the article being false, by viewing the notice at the top.

<p>This article has been nominated before in September. (Prior AfD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Route_309A_%28Florida%29_67e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Route 309A (Florida)">here</a>.) Since September, the article has not been touched. The article is still a one-sentence stub about a road claiming to be a Florida State Road when in actuality it isn't. (According to SPUI's comments in the prior AfD it's now County Road 308B.) It is a non-notable former state highway that doesn't fall under the precedent (which I agree with) of keeping all state highways. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 21:01, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s>This will contradict the "keep all roads" policy that I have admittedly adopted, but <b>delete</b> unless the article is significantly expanded and the importance of the road is made clear. Optionally, the road could also be moved to represent its current status as CR 308B and expanded upon, including a mention of "Route" (whatever type of route it was, as this fact is not clear either) 309A in the history.

<p>Non-notable middle school. Nominated on Prod but was removed only on grounds that the information is "verifiable" - it is, and in fact that's about the only information on the school's official "About Us" page (which could be seen as violation of copyright if it hadn't been rewritten with so many typos). Only claims to fame are known locally, if at all (and I doubt the fact that the school being its district's first middle school is widely known by residents of Naperville and Aurora, Illinois). Article doesn't even seem to meet any notability requirements of WP:SCHOOLS. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 20:56, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Which comes down to an assertion by fiat. I could make nearly identical arguments for hospitals (people are born there) graveyards (after death you spend eternity there (in some sense at least)) and many other institutions. Furthermore, schools are largely interchangeable and have little actual impact on many people for whom schools are holding pens until they got jobs or for whom there are benefit from schools but they in no way benefit much based on anything unique about that school. There is nothing which distinguishes this school from any others in that regard. Nothing in the article indicates that students here are having a terribly unique experience they wouldn't get at any other school. Schools as a whole are notable, that doesn't make each individual school notable. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:31, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's unlikely Wikipedia will ever be much better for a simple reason - public schools keep a LOT of information, especially negative information, out of the hands of the press.

<dd>Well, I would say that the same thing is true of self-published and vanity press books. i.e. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Joy_of_Cooking_29e4.html" title="The Joy of Cooking">The Joy of Cooking</a> was a self-published book. Dojin may become notable, but individual titles are inherently non-notable.

<li><b>Delete</b> Dojin collectively are noteworthy, and individual titles may be, but this list is far too broad -- there are indeed thousands upon thousands of titles. Even restricted to non-pornographic titles, this list is unmaintainable. I'd think at the very least it would need to be 'List of dojin works based on X,' and even that could be hundreds or thousands of titles if X is a popular series. And since there's already a category for it, there's no need for such a list. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 01:17, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Paul is notable within the world of web design, because of his podcasts, public speaking and articles. The article was started by me, and I'm nothing to do with Headscape or Paul, never having met him. I'm just somebody who listens to his podcast and reads his articles. If you look at the page history, you'll notice that I didn't originally add any links, in case that were misconstrued as wikispam. The links were added later by other users, who found the post independently. The fact that other people searched for Paul Boag on wikipedia indicates that he is a well-known person within the field.Rixo</li>
