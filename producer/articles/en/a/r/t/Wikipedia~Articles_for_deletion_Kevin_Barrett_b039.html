<li><b>Delete</b> I have made my case for deletion already on the Talk page devoted to this biographical article. Kevin Barrett is a proponent of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theories</a> about 9/11 who makes unsubstatiated claims and seeks media attention and publicity. He has no publications other than letters to the editor. He makes public appearances and appears on radio talk shows, making inflamatory claims about 9/11. The sources he cites are always within a small number of like-minded individuals who make similar claims, or write pseudo academic papers that purport to support the claims. There is nothing noteworthy about Kevin Barrett other than that he generates publicityabout himself. The Wikipedia project does not have the editorial resources to maintain articles on people like this, or to verify the accuracy of the information about them. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 00:00, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. His claims are outrageous enough to gain media attention, and indeed they have<a href="http://www.duluthsuperior.com/mld/duluthsuperior/news/politics/14933300.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.duluthsuperior.com/mld/duluthsuperior/news/politics/14933300.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/10/AR2006071001444.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/10/AR2006071001444.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://www.gmtoday.com/milwaukeetoday/editorials/wigderson.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gmtoday.com/milwaukeetoday/editorials/wigderson.asp" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Whew. There is alot of crazy random IP and a possible sockpuppet or two dropping in around here.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Unfortunately, I never fail to be amazed by the people who can't seem to differentiate between <i>notability</i> and <i>political disagreement</i>. <b>Kevin Barrett</b> is definitely notable; he has been significantly covered in recent news. Or maybe it's the case that these Orwellian thought-police do understand the difference, but hide under the notability cloak. In any case, if Wikipedia marches down the road of censored thinking, then it has outlived its usefulness. Perhaps its time for a new Wiki-based compendium of knowledge where the hurdle for deletion is much higher. <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarpol_de4c.html" title="User:Earpol">Earpol</a> 10:07, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree with this as being appropriate for deletion. Kevin Barrett is becoming more and more like the "<a href="../../../c/i/n/Cindy_Sheehan_da7a.html" title="Cindy Sheehan">Cindy Sheehan</a>" of the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_Truth_Movement_a967.html" title="9/11 Truth Movement">9/11 Truth Movement</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> He is an educator trying to teach critical thinking at a time when it seems to be a lost art and his class actually has very little to do with 9/11. The vast majority of "unsubstantiated claims" regarding 9/11 and the War on Terror come from the U.S. government. Go watch the videos of the towers collapse at virtual freefall speed onto their own footprints and explain to me how that is possible. Listen to and read the testimony of hundeds of New Yorkers who heard multiple explosions before and after the planes hitting and explain to me how it wasn't an inside job.

<li><b>KEEP</b>What is the point of being a free encyclopedia if you are not encyclopedic? That is, you take in all viewpoints, and you engage in the free marketplace of ideas. As I read the piece, it seems quite innocuous -- you are simply reporting that he holds "conspiracy theories" and telling who he is. The problem is always, of course, that what one person calls "unsubstantiated" and "inflammatory" (see below), the next person calls "thoughtful" and "substantial." And what the mainstream calls "false" today, it might well call "true" tomorrow. Therefore, simply explaining who this man is and what he claims is definitely adding to a body of knowledge, harms no one, and gives information when someone wants to know. And THAT's a free encyclopedia.--69.85.11.68 02:22, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Before voting, read all the nominator's comments on the discussion page. In my opinion he is unable to objectively argue his nomination. His arguments are fraught with opinion and insults. Kevin Barrett may be a flash-in-the-pan story, but I strongly believe Wikipedia should not fall victim to subjective editing. If this article should be deleted, let someone who can separate their beliefs from the subject matter re-nominate, backed-up with a NPOV. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.122.56.150 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.122.56.150_63fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.122.56.150">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Wikipedia is proving again to be nothing but a Zionist propaganda tool.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> He is not a "Coincidence Theorist", and thus deserves an entry. There are many intelligent, patriotic people , both Democrat, Republican, and Independent, who believe there are other "theories" other than what the US government has purported. I will not give my opinion on whether Wikipedia is Zionist/Neo-Con controlled, but if anything that critisizes the Us or Lsrael government is put into the eletion bin....wellll--Swamp Gas</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Wikipedia should not be used to censor "unpopular" opinion. I note also that 60% of New Yorkers surveyed do not accept the official version of the 9/11 Commission, so this hardly qualifies as unpopular, or crazy. The article is reasonable and does not attempt to make judgements on the merit of his claims, only to acknowledge the fact of it. Let's get rid of the thought police. We have enough of that in Washington and the MSM. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.77.137.6 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.77.137.6_7d71.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.77.137.6">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Contrary to the utterly unsubstantiated opinion of your editor urging deletion, Barrett’s claims are substantiated by voluminous evidentiary facts adduced and/or summarized by Scholars For 9/11 Truth. He raises crucially important issues which need to be rationally considered by citizens of the world, particularly those in the USA where this information has been politically taboo and censored by corporate media.

<li><b>Keep it</b>. I haven't read the guy's work, but it seems like he'll become a very small footnote in history, the 21st century incarnation of a long line of American conspiracy theorists.

<p>Who cares. No one with any understanding of the way in which Wackypedia is edited and censored would consider it a serious source of information, particularly on a politically sensitive topic. Until Wikipedia names its contributors and editors and published a statement of its accounts with explicit information on all funding sources, it must be taken as a mere propaganda tool. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.69.227.181 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.69.227.181_ba2e.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.69.227.181">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think those of you who see a conspiracy of "censorship" in this AfD nomination should note that almost all established editors here at Wikipedia have supported keeping this article. Even those of us who think very little indeed of this man and his theories believe it should stay. With that in mind, please be less quick to throw around words like "propaganda tool" and "censorship" in reference to this discussion. It doesn't help your position here. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 05:31, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with everyone that this subject appears to meet our notability guidelines quite well and is most certainly deserving of inculsion. The only reason for the formatting was to help organize the discussion since a good deal of anon participants were altering other comments and accidently malforming the AfD. I'm glad to see people that are willing to defend the article, now I hope that they can contribute positively to the article. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 10:49, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
