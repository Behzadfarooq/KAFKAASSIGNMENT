<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I will not bother to be anything but blunt here: these accusations are ridiculous and reflect nothing more than a personal resentment certain users have against me following previous disagreements. This article was <b>not created in response to the article Serbophobia</b>: An original link to it had been created in mid-January, long before I had gotten involved in the matter. It is <b>not a neologism</b>: it does not refer to any newly created word but is a simple NPOV title that adequately describes a social phenomenon that is very much alive and real in the Balkans today. Futhermore, it is definitely <b>not original research</b>: it does not create primary sources, but is a case of "research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources", which, according to wikipeda guidelines, is "strongly encouraged." All the key information in the article is referenced with credible sources (BBC, Human Rights Watch, etc.), and the evidence I have presented and the quality of the work I have done are, I believe, this article's best defense. I resent the allegations made about my supposedly "ad hominem" intent (I had honestly requested User:Dado's assistance because of his calm and rational approach to constructing quality articles on similar subjects, and he has responded positively) as well as accusations that I have engaged in an edit war (On the article in question, I have repeatedly asked the opposing side to discuss matters on the talk page and cite their sources, to no avail). This is a subject that any objective observer will agree has a place on Wikipedia (see precedent of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Japanese_sentiment_ca49.html" title="Anti-Japanese sentiment">Anti-Japanese sentiment</a>) and shows promise of one day becoming a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_article_3e1a.html" title="Wikipedia:Good article">good article</a>. Should this article be deleted from Wikipedia? With all that I have just said in mind, I think the answer is crystal clear: <b>NO</b>. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 20:23, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I apology for describing the creation of the article as an ad hominem. I now doubt this was your intention indeed.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Anti-Bosniak sentiment is definately a real phenomenon in the Balkans. It is not invented original research, and certainly has documentation in a wide variety of sources spanning not only Bosniak publications, but also the works of neighbouring nations. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewanderer_2fd1.html" title="User:Thewanderer">Thewanderer</a> 04:33, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Whether or not the phenomenon exists is not under scrutiny. The encyclopedic value is. There are many things which exist which are not encyclopedic (Anti-Belgian sentiment).

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Irrelevent, because the title of the article in question is not a term (like "Polonoophobia") but a neutral title to describe a notable phenomenon.

This will probably be kept, of course, but at least we can be assured that the content will devolve to such an unencyclopedic level (as with the ridiculously juvenile article at <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbophobia.html" title="Serbophobia">Serbophobia</a> referenced above which should also be expunged) so as to be mystifying to anyone who is not part of the extremely tiny, internecine debate. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 23:06, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Why do you feel <i>"assured that the content will desolve to such an unenyclopedic level so as to be mystifying to anyone who is not part of the extremely tiny, internecine debate,"</i> when I see absolutely no evidence for this in the time that the article has been up (There hasn't even been a debate yet!). You are ignoring the tentative cooperation already being exhibited between users of various ethnic backgrounds, as well as the fact that the article is even now in its embryonic stages of higher quality than Serbophobia. Absolutely nothing bad has happened to this article so far, and I feel like you're shooting it down without even giving it a proper chance. I'd urge you, and others of the same mind, to change your notes to neutral and give this article the opportunity it deserves. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 01:33, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> how can there be anti-Bosniak sentiment when hardly anyone in the world even knows what "Bosniaks" are? Serbophobia is entirely different because it can be argued that it exists due to many people having a negative view of Serbs after the Serbs made international news throughout much of the 90's because of the Balkan wars. Furthermore, "anti-Bosniak sentiment" returns 2 (two) hits in google, and one of them is from Wikipedia. A paragraph about it in "Bosnian nationalism" might be acceptable, but I don't really see the point of a separate article about it. Besides, the examples of "anti-Bosniak sentiment" given in the article (ie vandalism of mosques, grafiti saying "death to Islam", etc) seem more like examples of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> than Bosniakophobia. Btw <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> is also being nominated for deletion. <a href="../../../e/d/r/User%7EEdrigu_1cf2.html" title="User:Edrigu">Edrigu</a> 15:20, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Yet again, the google search is irrelevent because the name of the article is not a specific term (as is "Serbophobia") but a NPOV title to describe a social phenomenon of encyclopedic value. Also: why does a phenomenon have to be internationally notable to warrant an article on wikipedia? Thousands of perfectly fine topics exist on various subjects that are relatively unknown outside of certain parts of the world. Anti-Bosniak sentiment exists and is quite visible in the West Balkans, and thus deserves a place on wikipedia. Furthermore, your analysis of the examples cited in the article completely misses the point. Religion and ethnicity are closely interwined in the Balkans, and Islamophobic expressions are simply compounded on top of existing ethnic prejudices (as noted in the report for the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia). This is why there are many instances of "Islamophobic" expression towards Turks and Albanians in Greece, while the country is simultaneously supportive of Palestine in the middle-eastern conflict. Is it fair to describe such things as mere Islamophobia when they are specifically targeted at one ethnicity? I don't think so. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELive_Forever_9162.html" title="User:Live Forever">Live Forever</a> 17:52, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I hate to get involved in a side-argument, but I have to point out that there is a <b>BIG</b> difference between "Anti-Serb Sentiment" and "Serbophobia".

<li>I have to say, I disagree. I still remember, here in the UK, how when Jill Dando was killed, all the papers were going on about it was "the evil Serbs who did it". There are many other examples in the press. Even today, I still get nasty faces if I say I'm going on holiday to Serbia. In the case of Britain, the so-called Journalism of Attachment, is very much to blame for this "phobia" (not in the clinical sense, of course...)

<li><b>Keep</b> These sort of attitudes do exist, and the events described in the article certainly did occur. One more thing- where's the <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a> in the article&#160;? <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETeccen_d4f6.html" title="User:Teccen">Teccen</a> 00:40, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

The <i>only</i> thing that I object is that a total of <i><b><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;q=%22Anti-Bosniak+sentiment%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;q=%22Anti-Bosniak+sentiment%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">only 15 Google Search results</a></b></i> are presented.</li>
