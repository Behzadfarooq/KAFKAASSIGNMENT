<li><b>Comment</b> I pulled the "merge" recommendation upon checking the articles; there's nothing new in the article in question aside from the paragraphs promoting renaming SJSU (which have no place in Wiki). Still up for deletion or redirect, though. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> 08:48, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This article SHOULD NOT BE DELETED. It is not just about "SJSU" or the CSU, it is about the entire California State Normal School system. It contains information and images that are not included in either the SJSU or CSU articles. One of the reasons for creating and maintaining this article is to combat the "San Jose State" historical revisionism that has attempted to wipe the California State Normal School from the pages of history. This article is also being expanded upon on a weekly basis. The main proponent of deleting this article, "NeoChaosX" is a self-avowed "hacker" and recognized Wikipedia vandal who have repeatedly vandalized this article and others, to advance his own anti-CSU political agenda. He deleted this article, and now that that has failed, is attempting to have the article deleted to help suppress accurate California, CSU, SJSU history. Michaelch7 08:48, 13 July 2006 (UTC).
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> All I did previously was try and have the article redirect to <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Jose_State_University_8d9a.html" title="San Jose State University">San Jose State University</a>, not delete it. The article has redundant information and has nothing notable that would warrant a seperate article. I have nominated the article for those reasons, as well as being advertisement and promotion for your agenda, which is something <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a>. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> 04:24, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It is interesting to note that the so-called "promotion" in this article, an inaccurate reference to an inaccurate article, was included in this article by someone other than the author (but has now been corrected). Also, a part of the discussion regarding this article, in which NeoChaosX admitted to vandalizing this article, and apologized for it, has now been deleted. This fits the pattern of NeoChaosX's deletion and vandalism of historically accurate entries and articles, simply because they do not comport with his preferred (but historically inaccurate) views. This is exactly the type of "San Jose State" historical inaccuracy and revisionism this California State Normal School article is meant to combat. The stakes are high: historical accuracy and preservation of California State University history in the face of brute "San Jose State" revisionism. Moreover, NeoChaosX spurious claims that this article simply repeats content in the SJSU and CSU articles is self-serving nonsense, as NeoChaosX himself has repeatedly vandalized and removed many accurate references to California State Normal School and California State University history in those articles. Michaelch7 10:48, 13 July 2006 (UTC).

<li><b>Comment</b> First, all I did was remove links that promote the renaming campaign, since they were off-topic links in those articles. Second, if you checked the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_June_27&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_June_27&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history of article</a> where I admitted to "vandalizing" the page, you would find it was not deleted by me, and in fact was recommended by another user to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_June_27&amp;oldid=60982108#California_State_Normal_School" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_June_27&amp;oldid=60982108#California_State_Normal_School" rel="nofollow">keep the redirect</a> and to make further additions in the article it was redirected to. I do not know where you get this idea that I am repressing your views; I am simply making changes that I feel (and other agree) that improve the quality of Wikipedia, and to undo changes that do not fit Wikipedia guidelines. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> 06:08, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> NeoChaosX, you admitted in writing that you deleted the text of this article and redirected it to the SJSU article, which is tantamount to deleting the article. The issue is not whether you are repressing my views, but whether "San Jose State" has and is revising and repressing authentic and accurate California history for its own political purposes, and whether you are helping promote that effort by repeatedly attacking this article, and other contributions to other articles. The record of your actions makes it clear that you are guilty of this. Michaelch7 08:10, 15 July 2006 (UTC).
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Look, it doesn't matter what you think the purpose of my edits are. We're here to discuss if the content of the article merits being included in Wikipedia, not what the reasons are that I've nominated the article. You've given no reason to keep the article other than your unsubstantiated claims that San Jose State is "repressing history" and repeated personal attacks on me. Furthermore, you have admitted that the article is meant to "<i>combat the "San Jose State" historical revisionism</i>" in your words, which makes it a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">POV fork</a>, which is not supposed to be on Wikipedia. If you can't come up with a reason to keep the article other than claiming how you're protecting what you believe to be "accurate history", then my argument with you is done. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> 03:37, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect</b> to SJSU. The institution changed names (several times, as noted in the article). The official and most common name is San Jose State (or San José State). <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGentgeen_2e43.html" title="User:Gentgeen">Gentgeen</a> 05:27, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b> Its a nice article about something in history. Irreguardless of the censorship conversation above, could it be better served as a more expanded history section of <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Jos%C3%A9_State_University_b934.html" title="San José State University">San José State University</a>? I saved the article for merging into the university article if this doesn't result in keep. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 06:33, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I am still uncertain how or why this small advocacy group keeps coming back to this subject. This does not belong in an encyclopedia, but rather on GoState's own seperate webpage that they can finance themselves. Please delete this so that we can keep a neutral point of view as to subjects that are worthy of an encyclopedia, and not be bothered by articles and comments which simply express one small group's hope for a name change to their own instutition? <b>PLEASE DELETE</b>. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreltzer_2ab2.html" title="User:Streltzer">Streltzer</a> 23:41, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
