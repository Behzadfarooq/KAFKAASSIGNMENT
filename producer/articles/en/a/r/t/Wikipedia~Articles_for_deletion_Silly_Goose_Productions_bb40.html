<p><i>Silly Goose Productions is an independant</i> [sic] <i>movie studio founded in Spokane, Washington in 2004 by Neil Vanos, Mark Soissons, and Adam Van Hoy. The company has produced several popular comedy films...</i> Google hints that something called "Silly Goose Productions" exists, but there's no hint that it makes movies. Googling for "silly goose" plus any one of "vanos", "soissons" and "hoy" is equally uninformative. This is either a hoax, or unnotable. (You may also be interested in Bryan Schwor, an article about a no-budget movie that it has allegedly created.) -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 08:15, 2005 Apr 13 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia:Vanity page</a> describes vanity as an article which describes a person, but says "Articles about start-up businesses or musicians are not vanity pages and are considered acceptable, but it's preferable that the initial author not be someone affiliated with the project." This may be a small film companies movie, but by wikipedia's standards is not vanity. It should also be noted that "A page should not be cast away as 'vanity' simply because the subject is not famous. There is presently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required for a page to be included in Wikipedia, and therefore, lack of fame should be completely ignored in deletion debates." Therefore, does not deserve deletion.-<a href="../../../z/e/c/User%7EZechenia_0035.html" title="User:Zechenia">Zechenia</a> 11:51, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: that wasn't posted by <a href="../../../z/e/c/User%7EZechenia_0035.html" title="User:Zechenia">Zechenia</a> but by an IP number. <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia:Vanity page</a> isn't fixed policy -- which is good, because the last part that was quoted is very bizarre. (If there is indeed no consensus about the necessary value of X, this implies that the value of X is debatable. If the value of X is debatable, why should we unquestioningly follow the author when he/she tells us that it's zero?) As for <i>This may be a small film companies movie</i>, I thought it was claimed to be a company, not a movie. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:54, 2005 Apr 16 (UTC)</li>
<li>I believe the debate over Bryan Schwor has spilled into this. Calm down. Actually, upon reading that, It looks as if someone went to the comment in Bryan Schwor felt it was important to be seen here, and pasted the code here(including my username). All though it isn't fixed policy it was posted because it <i>is</i> policy, and should be known by those who vote--<a href="../../../z/e/c/User%7EZechenia_0035.html" title="User:Zechenia">Zechenia</a> 18:06, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>"Calm down" -- who, me? I've calmly pointed out that that the policy isn't fixed (as you concede), that it's confused, and that this company appears to be of negligible notability. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 08:41, 2005 Apr 18 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. No harm in keeping something that is real, even if it is sort of small. The point of Wikipedia is that you find articles on hear that you wouldn't normally find anywhere else.

<li><b>Keep</b> The Vanity Page does specifically say that pages about small companies or musicians are not considered vanity. This page definitely falls under the category of a small company.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Obviously there is interest in this and strong support for it. Though it appears small and hardly notable, I'll error on the side of preservation rather than destruction of something that appears to be so beloved that it has drawn such sockpuppetry. Furthermore, after continued examination into this site, I find they claim to have "financial difficulties" which have caused them to seek a "temporary" geocities site. For some reason, I doubt the "temporary" status of this site. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritz9000_f8e0.html" title="User:Fritz9000">Fritz9000</a> 07:45, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> Mocking someone for an error in the completing of their signature is inappropriate and unnecessarily mean-spirited. Don't ostracize someone like that again. If you notice they're having problems, message them privately. Commenting on it in a public forum with such sarcasm is not constructive; what you're doing is being a <i><b>jerk</b></i>. Don't take too much pride in being an expert at Wikipedia formatting. There are greater endeavors in life. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritz9000_f8e0.html" title="User:Fritz9000">Fritz9000</a> 07:45, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
