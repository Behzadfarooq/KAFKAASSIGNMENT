<p><s>Incoherent, no scientific content.

No refereed journal articles; no published journal articles; no online articles of any sort (the web page invites you to "order the academic manuscript" for $2.95+S&amp;H). Still <b>delete</b>. ( The mainstream theory of the photon, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_electrodynamics.html" title="Quantum electrodynamics">quantum electrodynamics</a>, accounts for pair production and annihilation perfectly well, and has passed every experimental test.) <a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBm_gub_59c9.html" title="User:Bm gub">Bm gub</a> 16:18, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, this is a deterministic representation but is in line with QED rather than QCD.</p>

<li>All physical descriptions in this article are verifiable physical characteristics of the photon and any hypotheses referred to on the PhotonStructure.com website were omitted for this reason. I would suggest the so-called experts go back to the standard texts. Next entry: I had deleted the link to the website in response to the accusation of "advertising" it, but after reading SupaSoldier's comments, have decided to reinsert it. This work was first published in Los Alamos in 1979 and encouraged by Carlo Rubbia of CERN at that time (before he got his Nobel Prize). Documentation for this is available. As to refereed articles, the masters thesis describing this concept was an interdepartmental (Philosophy of Science &amp; Physics) research project at the University of New Mexico. George Gamow was instrumental in providing the interaction of the charged sub-quantal components which, incidentally, rotate 360 degrees per cycle providing a resultant charge of zero. (The annihilation process is also used in Positron Emission Tomography.) <i>(unsigned comment was by TimLong2001 Moved to below header by bmonreal.

<dd>I'm giving this advice so that you can try to rework it (quickly!) and we can all see if it's salvageable. I think a major problem with the article is that it doesn't make it clear to non-scientists exactly what it's all about. Quite honestly, the article is pretty incoherent at this stage. I've had some courses in physics years ago, so some of the concepts are vaguely familiar. Other concepts are over my head. Here I am trying to reword what I understand of the article. Feel free to use this in the rewriting, and to correct me if I'm wrong.</dd>
<dd>From what I gather, <i>photon structure</i> is an attempt to explain <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wave-particle_duality.html" title="Wave-particle duality">wave-particle duality</a>, or how <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light.html" title="Light">light</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matter.html" title="Matter">matter</a> can show properties of both <a href="../../../w/a/v/Waves.html" title="Waves">waves</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Particles.html" title="Particles">particles</a>, depending on what is being looked at. The article seems to use the word "light" in the broader sense of anything in the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electromagnetic_spectrum.html" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a>, from gamma rays to ultraviolet to visible light to infrared to radio waves. If this is the case, then the photons here must refer to gamma rays.</dd>
<dd>Two observations that form the basis of this theory are:
<dl>
<dd>1. A <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamma_ray.html" title="Gamma ray">gamma rays</a> with an energy level of 1.0216 <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronvolt.html" title="Electronvolt">MeV</a> (so-called "pair formation threshold") will spontaneously split into an <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electron.html" title="Electron">electron</a> and a <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positron.html" title="Positron">positron</a>. (energy or waves becoming particles)</dd>
<dd>2. When an electron and a positron collide, they produce two gamma rays of 0.5108 MeV, each one exactly half of the "pair formation threshold". (particles becoming energy or waves)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>At this point, I can't follow the rest. Am I even close?</dd>
<dd>The article also needs external references that postdate the theory. It sounds as if the theory was published in 1979, right? There should be third-party references to it that are more recent.</dd>
<dd>If these concerns are addressed, and addressed quickly, I may be persuaded to switch back to keeping the article. --<a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETachikoma_4c40.html" title="User:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#8652B9"><i>Kyok</i></font></a><a href="../../../t/a/c/User_talk%7ETachikoma_1ad2.html" title="User talk:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#BA55D3"><i>o</i></font></a> 14:07, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Upon rereading the references, it seems as if the most recent references are by the same person who wrote the Wikipedia article. While I'm not disputing his authority in the matter, I think that Wikipedia requires <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">some sort of third-party published review or mention of scientific theories</a> in order to ensure notability. --<a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETachikoma_4c40.html" title="User:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#8652B9"><i>Kyok</i></font></a><a href="../../../t/a/c/User_talk%7ETachikoma_1ad2.html" title="User talk:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#BA55D3"><i>o</i></font></a> 05:56, 2 March 2007 (UTC) <s><b>Weak keep</b>. I've read over the article, and it doesn't make it clear whether or not <i>Photon structure</i> is a theory or not. I assume that it <i>is</i> a theory meant to address the paradox of <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wave-particle_duality.html" title="Wave-particle duality">wave-particle duality</a>. The article needs extensive rewriting, and more explicit (and better formatted) references to make it understood that <i>Photon structure</i> has been discussed throughout the scientific community, and that it isn't just <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research that hasn't been reviewed by outside analysts</a>. I'm saying "Week keep" for now, in the hope that the article will better explain just what it is talking about, though if these concerns aren't addressed, I will likely choose to merge it with either <i>wave-particle duality</i> or <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photon.html" title="Photon">Photon</a> in the future. --<a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETachikoma_4c40.html" title="User:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#8652B9"><i>Kyok</i></font></a><a href="../../../t/a/c/User_talk%7ETachikoma_1ad2.html" title="User talk:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#BA55D3"><i>o</i></font></a> 05:05, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</s></li>

<dd>Yes, that was my concern as well, which is why I've been trying to point out that proof of outside scientific review is needed, not just what appears to be self-published sources.

<li>I just studied the article, and chased down some references. I concluded that most of the content was unverified assertion or gibberish, and I cleaned it accordingly. However, the concept of "photon structure" is clearly serious. The article should not be deleted for not being notable. Due to lack of content, a redirect is a good idea. Given the image, and the method for study, perhaps the appropriate target is <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electron-positron_annihilation.html" title="Electron-positron annihilation">Electron-positron annihilation</a>. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokeyJoe_6cd1.html" title="User:SmokeyJoe">SmokeyJoe</a> 03:18, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Electron-positron annihilation is not an approprite redirect; photon structure happens to be studied in e-p colliders, but not in annihilations---you'd do equally well looking at it in non-annihilating e-e colliders, if such existed.

Thanks. --<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreatwalk_4ed3.html" title="User:Greatwalk">Greatwalk</a> 09:34, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The reason you don't "get it" is that it is an <b>incorrect</b> crackpot model of the photon. The author thinks that the photon is made up of a bound electron-positron pair, that this explains e+e- pair production and annihilation, and that it photon wavelength relates somehow to some sort of magnetohydrodynamic waves in plasma. Please stop thinking of this as a badly-written article about photons. It's actually a reasonably clear article about a work of pseudophysics. <a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBm_gub_59c9.html" title="User:Bm gub">Bm gub</a> 15:10, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>“incorrect crackpot model” and “pseudophysics” are not reasons for deletion. Wikipedia covers pseudoscience, discredited or obscure theories, as long as they are attributable. It is unfortunate that the article appears to describe what the “author thinks” as opposed to what the secondary sources describe, but we can try to encourage him to change his style. There are sources corresponding to the title, although its not clear how the article content connects to the title. A second new contributor has now expressed an intention to improve the article. We should give them time to do this, and failing the emergence of attributable and sensible content, merge the article with photon. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokeyJoe_6cd1.html" title="User:SmokeyJoe">SmokeyJoe</a> 00:10, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

My objection to this article is that it does not state anything clearly, and have asked for a <b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photon.html" title="Photon">Photon</a> so that the history is saved.

<li><b>Delete.</b> <a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBm_gub_59c9.html" title="User:Bm gub">Bm gub</a> just summarized it pretty well. The "references" cited don't actually demonstrate that this is a way to "resolve particle/wave duality". It's a bit like writing an article saying that UFOs come from <a href="../../../j/u/p/Jupiter_%28planet%29.html" title="Jupiter (planet)">Jupiter</a>'s moon <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europa_%28moon%29.html" title="Europa (moon)">Europa</a>, and then citing astronomical journal articles which give Europa's mass, composition and distance from Earth while crowing, "See, my article has sources!" <a href="../../../a/n/v/User%7EAnville_a648.html" title="User:Anville">Anville</a> 23:44, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Im going to re-write it so that its about the internal structure of photons (as one would expect). I dont know what its supposed to be about (the process of turning a photon into 2 pair particles maybe??). Ive expanded on this on the articles talk page.
