<p>This article is mainly a long, highly subjective list of cities that the creator of the article thought were intellectual centers. There are no clear criteria for inclusion on the list, and it's highly biased toward the modern U.S. (e.g., both Cambridge, MA and Boston, MA are listed, and both Berkeley and San Francisco). I think it should be deleted. <a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 15:25, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep, but modify</b>--I agree that there should be some criteria. For example, list could become a table with Place, When, Why. I think that the concept "intellectual center" is worthy of an article, and there are several pages that show up in What links here. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 16:58, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There are several pages that link there, but I think they were all links put in by the anon who created the article. The reason I came across the article in the first place was that the anon added a link from <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freethought.html" title="Freethought">Freethought</a>, which wasn't even appropriate, IMO. I also don't think it's realistic to hope for the article to be improved. If you look at the edit history for Intellectual center, it was created today by an anon, and since then, the only edits have been by me and <a href="../../../z/e/i/User%7EZeimusu_cf6b.html" title="User:Zeimusu">User:Zeimusu</a>, both of us pointing out that there were problems with the concept. I don't see any evidence that there are people who are willing to improve it, and I also disagree that the concept is worth salvaging. I don't see how adding "why" information would help, since there are no agreed-upon, objective criteria for deciding what qualifies for the list.--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 17:40, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I should also explain that after I noticed the bogus link from <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freethought.html" title="Freethought">Freethought</a>, I also went through and deleted some of the more spammish links to Intellectual center, from the following articles: <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_World_88d7.html" title="History of the World">History of the World</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_academic_disciplines.html" title="List of academic disciplines">List of academic disciplines</a>, <a href="../../../u/t/o/Utopia.html" title="Utopia">Utopia</a>.--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 17:57, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- I agree. By the way, this vote came to my attention because I noticed in Recent Changes that the article's author stripped the Vfd tag from the article. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 02:25, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The description of the list is all-inclusive, and the criteria seem too subjective and not well known (it smells of original research). I would dispute that <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkeley%2C_California_6eb4.html" title="Berkeley, California">Berkeley, California</a> or <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantis.html" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a> are intellectual centers, <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens%2C_Greece_0172.html" title="Athens, Greece">Athens, Greece</a> seems more reasonable to describe that way. The criteria are so weak and therefore the quality of the list that just about any notable university, school, library, forum, or meeting place that ever existed in the world is an intellectual center. I say those should go into separate, independent lists. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 12:09, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Tentative keep</b>, but needs clear criteria. It could be a very informative list, if we established useful criteria. I can't think of anything like this we've got, and it could be a very useful source of information if done well. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:40, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP!</b> -- why would anyone want to delete this list? I agree that it does need MUCH WORK, but if you all delete this you page are crazy. This is what Wikipedia is all about -- pounding out a compromise instead of getting all delete happy. As for the bias someone mentioned, that's not true because in the US there are quite a few MAJOR intellectual centres so it makes sense that they should be on the list. &lt;&lt; since there are no agreed-upon, objective criteria for deciding what qualifies for the list. &gt;&gt; Uhhh, read the heading and that tells you the criteria -- it must be or have been an intellectual centre sometime in the course of history. That's not a muddled criteria at all! --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerlin_Stark_0278.html" title="User:Berlin Stark">Berlin Stark</a> 07:29, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>(Invalid vote)</b> keep -- You said &lt;&lt; I don't see any evidence that there are people who are willing to improve it, ... &gt;&gt; Well, I just did. Do you by any chance realize that this article has only been alive for ONE DAY, and when you said this moronic statement it was on the SAME DAY THAT IT WAS MADE! DUH! No one on Wikipedia has even had a chance to read it much less improve upon it and you already want to delete it...quite fascist if you ask me. -- <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.7.html" title="User:205.188.116.7">205.188.116.7</a> 08:19, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
