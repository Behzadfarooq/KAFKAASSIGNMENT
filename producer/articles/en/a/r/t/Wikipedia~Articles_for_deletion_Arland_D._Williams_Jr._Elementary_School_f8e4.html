<li>Until there is enough to say about an individual school for it to merit its own article (which is NOT the case here) <b>MERGE</b> into an article on its parent school district. Dogmatically voting to keep as an independent article based on the generic subject without regard to the state of the actual content is really revolting. If all those who claim to care so much about schools would actually spend time structuring these bland posts into useful content, none of these would be placed on VfD in the first place. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 06:06, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Did you check to see whether those voting keep had done any school editing? I don't think you did. I have just looked at every keep voter on this discussion, and failed to find a single one who does not engage in school article cleanup. You're putting the cart before the horse in any case; <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> recommends merge as an alternative to listing deletion, and this is likely to be far, far more effective because no discussion is involved, you just do it and move on. If all those listing for deletion would just carry out that minimal act of maintenance we wouldn't need to have *any* schools listed on VfD. And that would be a good thing. It seems that May VfD closings are heading for 100% keep, and I really don't expect June VfD closings to be any different. Wikipedia doesn't like to delete school articles. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 09:19, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with your last comment—I wish people would just merge these useless stubs rather than listing them for deletion. As to your first comment, my apologies to those who have actually cleaned up school articles, but I so very rarely see it happen <i>during</i> a VfD discussion (if ever). The typical story is that the "article," containing little more than an address, is listed for deletion and a parade of generic "keep" votes appear that bear no specific relationship to the content of the "article," which remains just as pathetic at the close of the discussion. More people would vote "keep" if there was actually something worth keeping when they're considering their votes. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 16:11, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To a large extent, the specific content of the article is not relevant to the deletion. The article is being put up for deletion due to a "lack of notability." This is inherant in the topic, not the content of the article. Either the topic is notable or it is not, regardless of the article's content, or so it seems to me. If nominators are here to contest the notability of schools, they can expect repetative keep votes as well as repetative delete votes, because most every nomination is the same debate. If nominators want articles improved, merge them or send them to cleanup. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 21:41, 2005 Jun 9 (UTC)

<li>Yes. It's all in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>. If only people would read and act on it, we'd see fewer VfD listings that end in "keep" or "no consensus" or "merge" as schools seem to do 98% of the time (and I really *mean* 98%!) --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 21:58, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you're being unfair. I think so many people are voting keep (and there do seem to be a lot of them) precisely because the school articles are often cleaned up. You mean you really think <i>more</i> people would vote keep? I'm surprised at the idea! --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:17, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattoon%2C_Illinois_55ed.html" title="Mattoon, Illinois">Mattoon, Illinois</a> unless expanded. If the school is notable it is only on a local level. I will bite both the deletionist and inclusionist camp here.
<ol>
<li>Biting the deletionists: You <i>know</i> (or should know) that articles about schools will <i>always</i> be kept. So there is not much point in nominating them just so you can make your delete votes. Being bold and merging this immediatetely requires only <i>two</i> edits, as opposed to the <i>three</i> required for nominating this for deletion.</li>
<li>Biting the inclusionists: Er... Postdlf has already done this, I concur with a lot of what he says here. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 06:24, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, fine. See my reply. I do resent the implication that someone who doesn't agree with deletion of an article should do cleanup on it (VfD is not, or should not be, cleanup) but as it happens those whom you castigate here do not deserve it because <i>they have all cleaned up school articles.</i> --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 09:24, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not trying to bite very <i>hard</i>. Sorry if you were offended, and I have think your efforts with school articles are admirable.&#160;:-) But I think that very short two-liners might as well be merged, and then unmerged later if someone wants to expand it, and my agreement with Postdlf was that it was not neccesary to vote an outright "keep" on twoliners. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 11:58, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
