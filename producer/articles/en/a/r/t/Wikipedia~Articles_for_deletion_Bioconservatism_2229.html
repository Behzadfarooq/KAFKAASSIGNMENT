<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. The nomination summed up exactly what was needed to justify this article's retention; it has not been supplied here. Before I am accused of ignoring the majority among the bolded words, AfD is not a vote. Three out of four keep arguments don't even try to argue the case; the other was adequately addressed by Trevyn. The most important bolded words here are not the ones saying 'keep' or 'delete', but the quote in the nomination. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:54, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep but rewrite</b>.

Other than that, all I really have to say is that as long as the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transhumanism.html" title="Transhumanism">Transhumanism</a> article exists without question, it's hard to argue against the article for its antonym, and <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> if you're otherwise going to get that hung up on <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>.

<ul>
<li>1) That "paper" is a blog post on a distinctly non-neutral site, and claiming it is "about" the word is tenuous. 2) The existence of one article is not justification for what may be (or may not be) its antonym. 3) Regarding <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, I believe that <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> is a considered guideline whose intent is to increase clarity and prevent Wikipedia from being used as a launching pad for politically-loaded words which are not in the common vocabulary.

<p><b>Delete.</b> Bioconservatism is not a coherent position or philosophy. Almost no one has identified him- or herself as a bioconservative. Rather than serving to characterize people who agree with a given viewpoint, the article provides a catch-all term for people whose only similarity is skepticism about implementing one or another technology. Its use has invariably been by a very few writers who contrast their favored position with "bioconservatism."--<a href="../../../s/t/n/User%7EStN_acd1.html" title="User:StN">StN</a> 05:05, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>We could debate for hours about whether or not bioconservatism is a coherent position or a vague catch-all term (a debate which could be summarized and added to the article if it survives!). However, the fact that almost no one identifies himself as a bioconservative or that the term has invariably been used by writers who contrast their favored position with bioconservatism is NOT reason enough to delete this article. Otherwise, according to this logic, since almost no one describes himself as a reactionary, we should delete the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reactionary.html" title="Reactionary">Reactionary</a> article. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELoremaster_a9d3.html" title="User:Loremaster">Loremaster</a> 19:53, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see your point about the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reactionary.html" title="Reactionary">Reactionary</a> article. But there the fact that no one describes himself as a reactionary is reflected in the statement up front that it is "a political epithet, generally used as a pejorative."--<a href="../../../s/t/n/User%7EStN_acd1.html" title="User:StN">StN</a> 20:18, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, and I have no problem with the Bioconservatism article having a similar statement as long as it acknowledges that the political epithet "bioconservative" is meant to be used as a non-pejorative alternative to "<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioluddite.html" title="Bioluddite">bioluddite</a>". --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELoremaster_a9d3.html" title="User:Loremaster">Loremaster</a> 22:21, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That "bioconservatism" is not a coherent position is, of course, not a major reason for it being inappropriate for inclusion in an encyclopedia. The primary reason is that it is not in widespread use—possibly because of a lack of coherency. If, in a couple years, the term catches on, it may then be able to justify its own article. <b>I am most concerned about the misuse of Wikipedia as the primary authoritative source for a definition of "bioconservatism".</b> The top two Google hits, and four of the top seven, are Wikipedia and its clones. Wikipedia is intended to reflect human knowledge, not create it. -- <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrevyn_1951.html" title="User:Trevyn">Trevyn</a> 20:12, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Merge.</b> This could totally be a section of the transhumanism page, with some citations. Especially since, once you remove the list of people who may or may not follow this reasoning, most of what's left is links to that page. That pages is starting to get long, though.--<a href="../../../g/u/m/User%7EGumbyProf_552c.html" title="User:GumbyProf">GumbyProf: "I'm about ideas, but I'm not always about good ideas."</a> 05:13, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
