<li><b>Keep</b>. Encyclopedic. Also, Nihilus is a major character in the game and arguably, a notable figure in fictional Star Wars universe. --<a href="../../../k/r/o/User%7EKross_94e2.html" title="User:Kross">Kross</a> 08:13, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The person who started this vfd's IP is strangely similar to that of the IPs that I listed on vandalism in progress, who repeatedly ressurected the Kae article after several deletes, among other things. And, as we can see from this person's edit history, they've messed with the archived vfd for <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Traya_07be.html" title="Darth Traya">Darth Traya</a> several times. This is, simply put, a case of someone continuing to be a nuisance. --<a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 14:58, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Star Wars characters are notable, but that doesn't tell us whether it should be described in detail or just merged elsewhere. The article doesn't help because it reads like an article from a fictional encyclopedia about a real subject rather than an article from a real encyclopedia about a fictional subject. Yeah, it says it's a fictional character up front but then it immediately ignores that context. Where and how was all the detailed information about this character revealed? In game dialogue? In a text-scroll prologue before play starts? In a little printed insert included with the game cartridge? Does this character only exist in this game, or has he been used in other media? If he only exists as a figure in the game with some expository details thrown in here and there, the character really should be merged into the game article because he has no independent existence. Considering how the game article just makes a reference to him under the header "Other characters met along the way," he can't even be all that important to the game no matter how many details the game creators decided to flesh him out with. I'm struggling to see why we should give it such in-depth coverage. --<a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 03:59, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If a major character in a piece of Star Wars media that nearly wipes out something as important to the Star Wars universe as Jedi is non notable, then we have a boatload of articles that need deleting. --<a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 21:22, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Darth Traya was actually the one who wanted the jedi destroyed and aided this assult the most. Nihilus hardly ever appears in the game, and when he does, it is rather briefly. And also, he was never actually against the 'jedi' so to speak. He hated everything and anything that had life.
<ul>
<li>And in hating all life, he managed to nearly destroy every Jedi. Traya may have wanted to destroy the Jedi as well, which serves her own notability, but Nihilus was more instrumental in taking action against them. <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 17:53, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. This 'Darth Nihilus' seems to be rather unimportant in the story, and should be deleted. He is not that important in the storyline, and plays about in total maybe 7 minutes in the game. That is why i vote for strong delete.<small>Both this unsigned vote and above comment were made by User:138.130.213.165</small></li>
<li>Absent further showing that this character is more important, trim down the content to the essentials, <b>merge</b> content to both the article on the game and also <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Sith_characters_c6e5.html" title="List of minor Sith characters">List of minor Sith characters</a>, and then redirect to the latter. That list article already includes other characters only found in this game or others; why not this one too? <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 03:05, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Unprovoked Attack on User 138.130.213.165</b>. I would just like to say to 'Nufy8' that although i did in fact want the Master Kae article to stay, and did not realize there was a deletion policy in place which stopped repeated votes for deletion, i would like everyone who visits this page to hear this. I categorically deny that this is an act of vandalism. How dare you critisize me! This is a legitimate vote for deletion, so don't assume i am causing trouble. you are the one doing that! and your preliminary assumptions are unwarranted and do not justify your saying 'strong keep'!. you only say that (according to wikipedia policy) if you want to keep something! Now i would like this page to continue with genuine people posting their opinions, like i did just above. not personal degradation.</li>

<li><b><s>Strong</s> Keep</b> Major player in the universe, even though he doesn't appear in the game too much. He did come kind of close to annihilating life in the SW galaxy. Oh, and 138.130.213.165, if you consider the vandalism to be behind you, what is with making unsigned votes and comments on a VfD page you started? Seems pretty underhanded to me. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperiority_ab05.html" title="User:Superiority">Superiority</a> 13:17, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think you're judging importance by the wrong standards here. A fictional subject is not important simply because he's depicted doing important or dramatic things within the fiction. If a book merely happens to mention that within its story, that the President is William Smith, that doesn't make William Smith an important character by <i>encyclopedic</i> standards even though that's an important role within the fictional world. On the other hand, if numerous films and books all portray the same janitor with whom the protagonist has hearty conversations every day he leaves from work, that character may be important for our considerations even though he isn't important except as an acquaintance within the fictional world itself. Here we're talking about a character that "doesn't appear...too much" in the <i>only game</i> in which he is portrayed. That <i>all</i> <i>Star Wars</i> characters have some minimal level of notability due to the fanbase and pervasiveness of the media is why all reference to the character shouldn't just be outright deleted. But that the character only appears in one work (one <i>video game</i>, at that, not a major motion picture), and doesn't even sound very central to that work, is a strong argument for summary treatment rather than a lengthy, independent article. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 01:19, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Point taken. However, within the game, although Nihilus himself does not feature so much, his actions are quite important, he did almost destroy the planet that the Exile (player character) was on at the time, and so is rather important in that respect. My main point was basically the "<b>Comment</b> If a major character" posted by Nufy8 above. He is central to the plot though, though it does not revolve around him, and he <i>is</i> mentioned in the very title of the game. I wouldn't oppose a merge and redirect though. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperiority_ab05.html" title="User:Superiority">Superiority</a> 09:52, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Just to Clarify</b>. If you think that was an act of vandalsism it wasn't. I realise, as you do, that there is a system which displays the fact that i wrote a post. That is why i don't think it is vandalsim. you know when i am writing, so there is no deception! i have a right to post comments as well. and i only entered one strong delete because i get to express my opionion once as well. and even though it wont be counted, at least i got to write what was on my mind.
<ul>
<li>I would imagine people would think more highly of you if you put for reasons for putting it on VfD at the top, rather than making such unsigned comments. And I didn't say it was vandalism, I jsut said it seemed rather underhanded. It's not too hard to sign it, just add ~~~~ at the end, or press the signature button at the top (alt text is "Your signature with timestamp"). --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperiority_ab05.html" title="User:Superiority">Superiority</a> 09:52, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Why should this article be deleted? Because some fool has a grudge against charcters not from the movie. You people who claim he has a limited amount of time on screen in the game are totally correct, but so did boba fett in the trilogy, so why isn't he being considered for deletion? Nihilus is an interesting figure, who deserves to be kept. Deleting him isn't going to solve the problem, because avid fans will just rewrite the article again. This is a free informational website, if people want to come here and read an article about Darth Nihilus, that is their privilege, and that is what makes this website so great. So to make a long story short, who the hell do you people who vote for delete think you are, you are not the gods of computer-land, don't ruin good things for everyone else, because you have hairs accross your asses about something as harmless as a character from a popular game. I mean honestly, why do you care, let the Damn article stay in place. I vote <b>STRONG KEEP</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite a short amount of screen time and little dialogue in the original trilogy, Boba Fett obviously became an extremely well known and popular character (even well outside the bounds of the dedicated <i>Star Wars</i> canon followers), as is reflected in the numerous non-<i>Star Wars</i> references to the character in other media (some of which are described in the article). His action figure was one of the most popular, he has been substantially portrayed in other <i>Star Wars</i> media outside the movies, and Lucas gave him and his father a very prominent role in the second prequel. There's simply no comparison to the obscurity of Nihilus. The <a href="../../../b/o/b/Boba_Fett_68c2.html" title="Boba Fett">Boba Fett</a> article is actually pretty good, btw, because it sources character information to specific works of fiction and describes it in terms of those. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 18:35, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Just as a point of curiosity, why hasn't <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Traya_07be.html" title="Darth Traya">Darth Traya</a> been nominated for deletion while Nihilus and Sion have? - <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Hart_0932.html" title="User:Jon Hart">Jon Hart</a>
<ul>
<li>I agree why hasnt it? It was marked for deletion earlier but for a different reason.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Although Darth Nihilus may not appear in KOTOR 2:The Sith Lords until closer to the end, the player (it is a RPG!!!) is consumed with the impending meeting throughout gameplay. Nihilus is a major character in the Expanded Universe and as such, deserves a unique entry. <a href="../../../e/x/i/User%7EExile_1138_196f.html" title="User:Exile 1138">Exile 1138</a></li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> There needs to be an article about Darth Nihilus. Though I believe some of the content needs to be updated to provide a better round out description and happenings of this character, but to delete this article would be foolish. Someone would create another one and go through the whole process again. I say keep this article and perform the necessary changes as needed. -<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeStar_2a7c.html" title="User:LifeStar">LifeStar</a></li>
