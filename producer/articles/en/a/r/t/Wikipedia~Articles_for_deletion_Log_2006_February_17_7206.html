<li>I have speeded this. I'm probably <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> here, but I'm concerned that with a high-traffic site focusing attention here, there will be enough obstructive activity from folks coming in that this page will stick around too long and change the fact that there are presently on five Google hits. That would cause Wikipedia to be responsible (partially) for creating a new term, which in my opinion is a very damaging thing. (This is my answer to all of you folks who say things like "it's not doing any harm," which is a comment completely irrelevant to the purpose and rules of Wikipedia.) The article itself documents that the Daily Show <i>created</i> this word just <b>this week</b>. In my opinion, there is no way in the world that a "new term" created this week is presently notable. It should not be listed here until society is using it (and even then, we are not a dictionary). And we should be very, very careful to make sure we do not <i>cause</i> society to begin using it.

<dd>Good. Considering this on deletion review is the right way to handle it. As I said, if you convince a single admin to recreate it, I'm cool with that and will let the community sort it out. Check out <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> some time. It means we don't let the encylopedic quality of the project become a casuality to process.

<dd>Yes, that's cool. I agree that you are well within your rights to express your disagreement, to request review, etc. If you can convince any admin to give this a shot at AfD, I won't protest if they undo my actions.

I'm not sure that James Crotty can be considered more notable than average, either: on what basis are we making that comparison? I'm a prof myself, but definitely less notable than average, and I get more hits on Google Scholar than this guy, and more hits on Google than ""James Crotty" +economics": loose evidence to be sure, but I figure he should have passed that test easily if he really deserves a WP entry. The article needs to establish that he is, in fact, a more-notable-than-average professor, and it doesn't, and I doubt he is. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 19:28, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. In tying in with my 'keep' above I'll provide some evidence. I think we are here to descide if the <i>person</i> is notable enough to be included in Wikipedia.

I found these pieces of evidence using the subcription base <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a>. I think if a person is quoted in the general media (newspapers in this case) then that is some sort of notability. Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, can we afford to keep this guy?

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't have access to MathSciNet -- however, although 81 publications is an <i>indication</i> of notability, not all publications indexed in MathSciNet are actually referreed, nor does a publication in a referreed journal necessarily have a new theorem.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: For someone as old as he is, it's not surprising that he has that many publications, especially when one considers that there is some duplication of work and additional expository articles on that work. I find that looking through his publication list, it doesn't seem particularly noteworthy although the fact that he has kept up production is a testament to his work ethic. On the other hand, he has published in some respectable journals (although not so prestigious to make it an automatic keep). I will abstain, but my inclination is that unless the results cited in the nom are of such significance and/or his other activities (perhaps as educator, influential figure, etc.) are significant, I don't particularly feel compelled to vote keep. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 12:36, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b>. I am the one who AfD'd this. Last time that this experiment was tried, it devolved into an article called "Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse (no pictures)" that ironically had several pictures of abuse, just the ones that a single editor decided were not "offensive."

<dd>In this case, I consider the topic "notable" because I hear the word in this sense in common use, and I consider the article "useful" because if I were researching the anime/manga subculture in the US, this article would be a helpful source (along with the other articles in its categories). Your opinion, it would seem, differs. My vote remains keep, however. If you believe the article has problems, you can certainly improve it. Given your list of concerns below, perhaps it would be beneficial to alter the article to recast the term as something used by Americans, where the usage is apparently not the same as it is in Japan; better yet, one could make a comparison out of it. I can't comment on that, not being knowlegeable on Japanese culture.

<dd>This is the same conclusion I've come to after hours spent banging my head against the brick wall that is certain users on the article's discussion page. While the word has been adopted by a specialist interest group, (which doesn't mean it's becoming a loanword) it's meaning has been altered in the process. The current article doesn't address this and operates under the mistaken idea that <i>kawaii</i> is some specific, defined style of anime / drawing / fashion. If this can be rectified then there may be a place for the article to define what the word has come to mean when used in manga and anime fan circles and then this can be contrasted with the meaning in Japanese. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarryvalder_f05c.html" title="User:Barryvalder">Barryvalder</a> 13:24, 17 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would like to remind you that etymologies that are limited to small fan circles are not presently considered worthy of Wikipedia articles, although they may be in the future. Do not correct me on my word choice with "small fan circles". While there is a considerable following in the US, there is no "altered meaning" for the word for the majority of these people, who merely use the word as-is, along with other "trendy" Japanese words that they have pulled from anime, such as "genki", "kakkoii", "ohayo" etc. If you can find some kind of proof that the word is being used in a non-Japanese fashion (that would be a loanword by the way) then it may be advisable to rewrite the article, but as you just stated the article doesn't address this issue and thus contains no valid information. As per the previous comment, if you were a researcher looking for information on Anime/manga culture ... wouldn't you rather check out <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a> (which explains the word <i>kawaii</i>) and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>? <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshgavin_9ad7.html" title="User:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="white" style="background:blue">&#160;freshgavin</font></a><a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreshgavin_46e9.html" title="User talk:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="blue">ΓΛĿЌ&#160;</font></a> 13:53, 17 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My initial conclusion was that which I could make from the views of those who pushed the article for all they could. I was assuming, probably naively, that those people spoke for fans of anime and manga. Anime / manga fan culture is not my area. The everyday use and meaning of Japanese words is. If it's the case that fans of Japanese culture use the word with the same meaning as it holds in Japanese, and not as the name of a specific style etc, then the article is entirely without value beyond it's initial dictionary definition. As you note below, the vast majority of the article should either be employed elsewhere, or deleted outright. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarryvalder_f05c.html" title="User:Barryvalder">Barryvalder</a> 14:08, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To answer your question, Freshgavin, I'd check out <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>, and anything else that looked interesting or relevant in the related topics or category sections. A good researcher doesn't just read one article and stop, especially when using a source of possibly dubious validity. By the way, I'm with <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarryvalder_f05c.html" title="User:Barryvalder">Barryvalder</a> and others on this; it should be kept, IMHO, but it should also be cleaned up. So, I'm altering my vote somewhat to <b>keep and tag for cleanup.</b> I really don't believe a strong case for deletion has been made, though there might be a case here for merging what may be useful from the article (which, again, is speaking more to US anime/manga subculture as far as I can tell) into another article and changing this into a redirect. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 22:59, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see why you're being sarcastic. If it was considered fashionable to be "cute" in hollywood, and the London Times posted an article that said so, would you consider that a reason to make "cute" a valid Wikipedia article? Also, the whole "Anomalous Female Teenage Handwriting" section doesn't belong here anyways. It has nothing to do with the word "kawaii" except for the fact that girls like to write in a "cute" or "pretty" style. I would have thought the fact that the research was called "Female Teenage Writing" and not "Kawaii writing" would stand for that. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshgavin_9ad7.html" title="User:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="white" style="background:blue">&#160;freshgavin</font></a><a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreshgavin_46e9.html" title="User talk:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="blue">ΓΛĿЌ&#160;</font></a> 06:33, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The one place that "the merchandising, fashion, and pop-culture media" <i>isn't</i> marketed and referred to by this term is in Japan itself. My conclusion from the endless war-of-words on the article's discussion page is that the fundamental misunderstanding over the words's use in it's native country is a huge factor in the unreliability of this article. <i>"Animals are often drawn in excessively Kawaii style"</i> one user insists on writing. What I've attempted to get across is that in Japan there is no such thing as <i>Kawaii style</i>, making the statement meaningless OR. If any article is to exist on this topic, it has to address the Japanese meaning and the meaning being given when used in English. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarryvalder_f05c.html" title="User:Barryvalder">Barryvalder</a> 10:22, 17 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Explained above. Also, the misunderstanding with "kawaii style" comes from the fact that it is common in Japanese to suffix "-kei" onto some adjectives which may be translated as "kawaii type" or "style", but there is no implication of a specific <i>style of kawaii</i>, simply that X is of a "cute"/"pretty" persuasion, as opposed to a "sexy"/"ugly"/"glamorous"/etc. one. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshgavin_9ad7.html" title="User:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="white" style="background:blue">&#160;freshgavin</font></a><a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreshgavin_46e9.html" title="User talk:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="blue">ΓΛĿЌ&#160;</font></a> 14:06, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't really want to classify it as "original research", though there is obviously quite a bit of that. I'm just more concerned about the collections of material that has no relation to the actual word, many of them POV.
<ul>
<li>Kawaii characters typically (but not exclusively) are drawn with large eyes and small noses and mouths (<i>this comment refers to anime style, which has no relation to the word kawaii</i>)</li>
<li>Pets are often drawn in a kawaii style (<i>this statement means nothing more than "pets are drawn cutely"</i>)</li>
<li>Kawaii characters generally have angelic personalities (<i>original research, I see no reason why the author would want to say this if not just to get a picture of his favourite anime character added to the page</i>)</li>
<li>Kawai is a Japanese term (<i>it's not a term, its a word. by saying "term" the author is trying to bloat its importance</i>)</li>
<li>Kawaii should not to be confused with "kowai" (<i>Japanese speakers have very little trouble distinguishing the two words, this is a statement fit for an introduction to Japanese textbook</i>)</li>
<li>The term can be subjective as Kawaii can be used to describe anything an individual considers cute which can include attractive women. (<i>a completely worthless statement. Saying an adjective is "subjective" is no more useful than saying that "good" is POV</i>)</li>
<li>Kawaii merchandise is extremely popular in Japan (<i>should say "cute/pretty things are popular [to certain groups] in Japan" and be moved to "Japanese culture"</i>)</li>
<li>The two largest manufacturers of such merchandise are <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanrio.html" title="Sanrio">Sanrio</a> (manufacturers of "<a href="../../../h/e/l/Hello_Kitty_61f0.html" title="Hello Kitty">Hello Kitty</a>") and San-X. (<i>original research, sourceless, and POV</i>)</li>
<li>The proliferation of mechandise regarded as kawaii is considered by some to be an expression of a female-led youth movement (<i>equals: girls like cute things. Useless information.</i>)</li>
<li>Kawaii can be also used to describe fashions. (<i>another useless statement. It is a widely used adjective and can be used to describe almost anything you like, much like "cute" or "pretty" can. The author then goes on to describe fashions that are considered cute in Japan, which should be part of "Japanese culture"</i>)</li>
<li>When the kawaii 'craze' began to develop in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> during the 1970s (<i>sourceless OR. A correct statement would refer to the "boom" that Japan experienced in the early 1980s, thus allowing women greater freedom of choice in fashion, another tidbit for the "Japanese culture" article, or possibly one on the boom itself</i>)</li>
<li>Previously Japanese writing had been written vertically using strokes that vary in thickness along their length. The new style was written laterally, preferably using a <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanical_pencil.html" title="Mechanical pencil">mechanical pencil</a> to produce very fine, even lines. (<i>absolutely rediculous OR statements. Japanese has been written horizontally as well as vertically for more than a hundred years, nothing to do with "cuteness". Mechanical pencils are just another example of influence from western cultures, again nothing to do with "cuteness".</i></li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> now <b>Rewrite needed</b> This article, as it stands, is horrendously inacurate. The article is full of OR, pointless information and misunderstandings as shown by <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshgavin_9ad7.html" title="User:Freshgavin">User:Freshgavin</a> who expertly picked the article to pieces above. My main objection with the article is the fundamental misunderstanding of the word's use in Japan. It means cute, adorable, darling etc and that's it. What is put forward by some authors of this article is that <i>kawaii</i> is a specific style or writing (it isn't), a specific type of animation (it isn't), a specific type of fashion (it isn't) etc. I've been attempting for a few days to correct this misunderstanding, but some users are insistent on the existence of a specific, definable <i>kawaii</i> style. My conclusion is that the word has gained a different, distinct meaning when used in English. The Japanese meaning and meaning when used by fans of Japanese culture are two different things. If this is the case any article on the topic has to make this clear from the start. A large percentage of the article is also given over to the idea that the word is becoming a loanword in English. This has stood with essentially zero evidence save for Gwen Stafani saying it in a video (while in Japan, it's worth noting), and more recently, a list of words created by past and present students at some university in America. The article needs to be torn down and started from scratch (if at all). <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarryvalder_f05c.html" title="User:Barryvalder">Barryvalder</a> 09:44, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and Rewrite</b> per Barryvalder.

<dd>I agree with you on that, but where <i>moe</i> (I actually prefer the Hepburn, I just copied from the article's redirect) is the slang term there, <i>kawaii</i> seems to be gaining currency as the slang term <b>here</b>. As I said before, the article needs better justification than it's got right now, but that doesn't mean it's not notable. In any case, if we cannot save the article, that is why I recommended a redirect as a fallback. I don't think outright deletion is going to do any good in this case, but if no one can come up with a good reason for the existence of it as a seperate entity, then there are other ways of dealing with the issue.--<font color="#4B0082"><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">み使い</a></b></font> <i><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitsukai_5376.html" title="User talk:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a></b></i> 17:32, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just one more note. A "delete and rewrite" vote would make more sense than a "keep and rewrite" vote because it would actually force a rewrite, whereas keeping it almost guarantees that it won't be "completely" rewritten at all.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and <b>Rewrite</b>. Having lived in Japan for several years, I can tell you that "kawaii" (or "cute", since many young people there use the words interchangeably) is definitely a cultural aspect of Japan. Even big tough guys can be very frequently seen with cutesy character goods (such as Hello Hitty). "Kawaii" permeates the culture in Japan. The post office has cute mascot characters; almost every corporation has cute mascots; it really is everywhere.

<dd>Nobody is disputing that cuteness is very popular in Japan. That information should be represented within the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Japan_02eb.html" title="Culture of Japan">culture of Japan</a> article. A huge problem with this article is the fundamantal misunderstanding that the word <i>kawaii</i> represents a definable, distinct style or movement (wether it be anime/clothing/writing/etc). Living in Japan, you'll be aware that if you went into a manga shop and asked for the <i>kawaii comics</i> you'd get met with blank expressions. There's no such thing, just subjective judgement. This article, if it's to exist at all, can be made up of two or three sentences.

As for walking into a comic shop and asking for "kawaii comics", you would be met with blank stares because they would assume you were a stupid gaijin, not because they wouldn't know what you're talking about. No, there is no specific genre of "kawaii comics", but that's because "kawaii" is so ingrained in the culture. --<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">nihon</a> 19:10, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The culture of Japan can be any length it needs to be. With regards your startement as to how Japanese people will react to a question based on the race of the person asking it, well that is a very daft arguement Nihon. Would Japanese shop staff regard Africans as "stupid blacks" for asking the same question? Best to keep your sweeping generalisations and borderline racism to yourself.

<dd>Where do you get off calling me racist? If you can't form a coherent argument without calling someone racist, then I suggest you find someplace else to play.

It lacks any kind of basis and then you go on to give a sweeping anthropological statement covering ever member of the human race. This is even more rediculous. With such a comment you are treading a very thin line between generalisation and just plain ignorance, but I'm fairly certain you didn't understand the implications of what you wrote, so I can only ask you be more careful with your sweeping generalisations in future.

<li>Kawaii Craze is similar to the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic.html" title="Comic">Comic</a> craze of the US in thelate 30s to early 50ies. During the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Age_of_Comic_Books_1c51.html" title="Golden Age of Comic Books">Golden Age of Comic Books</a> superman merchendice etc sold at ridiclous levels. In the US more people are likely to know who superman is rather than who the president is. Any native english speaker may/should thake comic craze for granted. It is perfectly casual for people to wear superman outfits in haloween. You do not reference people wearing superman outfits as a product of "comic craze" even though thats what it is.</li>
<li>Of course comic-craze and kawaii-craze are poor comparasions. After all Kawaii was never restricted to paper and has been an <i>ongoing</i> craze spreading overseas.</li>

People are trying to portray it as an intrinsic aesthetic or Deeper Thing like (for example) <a href="../../../w/a/b/Wabi-sabi.html" title="Wabi-sabi">Wabi-sabi</a> but it simply isn't so. You do not improve or clean up dicdefs, they simply don't belong here. To those pointing at the length of the article as its validation, I point out that a dicdef can be inflated to whatever size serves the author's agenda, as has happened here. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hokkaido_Crow_7bd1.html" title="User:The Hokkaido Crow">The Crow</a> 23:28, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Using your argument, the same could be said for "Cuteness": it's just a word, a common adjective, always used subjectively. Unless you've lived in Japan, you won't likely know how much "kawaii" is ingrained in the culture there. "Kawaii" is everywhere in Japan. --<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">nihon</a> 19:10, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, if we're pulling out the "who knows Japan" card, I <i>have</i> lived in Japan, I <i>do</i> speak Japanese, in fact I <i>am</i> married to a Japanese. I understand this may not be as sterling a credential as having memorized a dozen comic books, but believe me, I do know what kawaii is and what it is not. It's an adjective. It is not a concept. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hokkaido_Crow_7bd1.html" title="User:The Hokkaido Crow">The Crow</a> 00:22, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Kawaii is integrated into japanese culture and "kawaii kraze" in japan is like nowhere else. You didn't notice something everyone takes for granted (only happens if you are either "assimilated" into a culture (and hence ignore lots of obvious aspects) or if you are not a good observer and I do not believe it is the latter). The Kawaii-kraze is cited to exist by universities as well as various other notable works. Just because you havent noticed doesnt mean it doesnt exist. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cool Cat</a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Cool_Cat_9377.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Cool Cat">@</a></sup></small> 14:04, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm getting a bit weary of being misrepresented on this subject. Yes, cute things permeate Japanese culture up and down, top to bottom, in and out and I've seen it firsthand. I have seen 50 year old men with Hello Kitty seatcovers on their cars. I'm not disputing that cute things are popular in Japan, mmkay? Nobody is disputing that. I'm disputing that "kawaii" is anything other than an adjective used to describe what someone's vision of cute is. It's always subjective. The Hello Hitty industry is not classified as "the kawaii industry" in Japan. Retailers do not order another lorry of "kawaii merchandise". There's no "kawaii" section of idol mags or manga shops or video rental places or clothing retailers or food or absolutely anything at all. There is no central authoritative body of work that can rule out something -not- being kawaii. Reading more than this into it is a common error of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orientalism.html" title="Orientalism">orientalism</a>, the tendency of uninitiated Westerners to project novelty and significance onto elements of Asian culture beyond their true significance. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hokkaido_Crow_7bd1.html" title="User:The Hokkaido Crow">The Crow</a> 16:09, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Rewrite</b>. Yes, I'm flip-flopping. Nihonjoe's comments regarding the length of Japanese culture is a good one. Also, the lack of non-OR in the current article is a better argument for rewrite than merge, anyway. I know that Kawaii is ingrained in the country. Pictures of the Hello Kitty festooned dump trucks working construction sites, or of the cartoon characters on the salaryman's bank book would help convey that point. There is encylcopedic material for Kawaii – unfortunately, the current article doesn't do a very good job at presenting it. And, it seems that attempts to fix the article are getting caught in some minor revert wars by a couple of users, so it may take some time to fix it. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 22:30, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This simply isn't the case. There is no <i>kawaii movement</i>. This implies there is a specific, definable <i>kawaii style</i>, which there isn't.

<li><b>Redirect, don't merge</b> Oxyacetylene (or oxyacetylene set) is a term commonly used in industry. Also agree that the existing content is more suitable for wikibooks, there is a lot of good content there but it is more a HowTo. — <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraibeard_f9d8.html" title="User:Graibeard">Graibeard</a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraibeard_aa68.html" title="User talk:Graibeard">&#160;(talk)</a></sup> 00:29, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b>; the information doesn't seem to be too encyclopedic. No need to merge; perhaps a paragraph or two could be excised, but then, there's no source given for all this info. IMO, the oxyfuel welding/cutting article is in worse shape now than it was before ("Setting up the equipment"? What is that doing there?). Anyone who wants to write a good oxyfuel welding article will be able to do it without this content, and this content, being unsourced and largely unuseful, isn't what the article needs. Also, question—does wikibooks require references? I would imagine so, but if it didn't, this couldn't potentially go there. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer"><font color="brown">(háblame)</font></a></small> 01:08, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The term "Thermal protection system (TPS)" is normally used in the aerospace industry for both ablative and reusable TPS. Aeronautical engineers and informed laymen linking into Wikipedia through Google would need to see a disambiguation and redirect link to <a href="../../../a/t/m/Atmospheric_reentry.html" title="Atmospheric reentry">Atmospheric reentry</a> where ablative TPS is described. Reusable TPS as "thermal soak" and "passively cooled" TPS is already described under the "Thermal Protection Systems" section of <a href="../../../a/t/m/Atmospheric_reentry.html" title="Atmospheric reentry">Atmospheric reentry</a>. The term "ablation" is already redirected to <a href="../../../a/t/m/Atmospheric_reentry.html" title="Atmospheric reentry">Atmospheric reentry</a> through a disambiguation. The significance of ablative versus reusable TPS is not provided in the current <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermal_Protection_System_ac7b.html" title="Thermal Protection System">Thermal Protection System</a> article and would be inappropriate if the article was renamed to <b>Space Shuttle Thermal Protection System</b>. The best course of action remains to delete <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermal_Protection_System_ac7b.html" title="Thermal Protection System">Thermal Protection System</a> with a redirect to <a href="../../../a/t/m/Atmospheric_reentry.html" title="Atmospheric reentry">Atmospheric reentry</a>. The new content recently added to <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermal_Protection_System_ac7b.html" title="Thermal Protection System">Thermal Protection System</a> should be transferred to <a href="../../../a/t/m/Atmospheric_reentry.html" title="Atmospheric reentry">Atmospheric reentry</a>. <a href="../../../e/g/g/User%7EEgg_plant_7adb.html" title="User:Egg plant">Egg plant</a> 04:17, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: First, the <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reentry.html" title="Reentry">Reentry</a> article at 66kb is already over the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">recommended size limit</a>. Adding the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermal_Protection_System_ac7b.html" title="Thermal Protection System">Thermal Protection System</a> content will make it even bigger. Secondly, there needs to be a dedicated article on shuttle TPS, just like there's a dedicated article on <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Shuttle_Solid_Rocket_Booster_6b24.html" title="Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster">Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster</a>. The shuttle TPS is unique, not used by any other current spacecraft, and is a prominent and well-known part of the shuttle system. The article content is already 100% shuttle TPS, not general TPS, so it should be renamed <b>Space Shuttle Thermal Protection System</b>. If you're concerned about people querying on just "Thermal Protection System", let's do a disambiguation page for that. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoema_807b.html" title="User:Joema">Joema</a> 05:03, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's the answer!

Have a disambiguation page named <b>Thermal Protection System</b> that redirects to a renamed <b>Space Shuttle Thermal Protection System</b> or <a href="../../../a/t/m/Atmospheric_reentry.html" title="Atmospheric reentry">Atmospheric reentry</a>. Concerning the <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reentry.html" title="Reentry">Reentry</a> article going over the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">recommended size limit</a>, I'd like to reduce the size of <a href="../../../a/t/m/Atmospheric_reentry.html" title="Atmospheric reentry">Atmospheric reentry</a> by tossing out "Feathered reentry" but I know people would get worked up over that so I've taken the easy path of ignoring it. <a href="../../../e/g/g/User%7EEgg_plant_7adb.html" title="User:Egg plant">Egg plant</a> 05:23, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why not do a disambiguation page? Google shows about 98% of TPS references are either (a) shuttle TPS, or (b) other aerospace TPS. If three or more separate TPS articles are needed, maybe then do a disambig page.

<p>this seems to be a neologism of little likely longevity; it's simply a descriptive phrase, in fact. It was put up for deletion by <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> in the new "deletion review" system, and the tag was removed by <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> without explanation. When I replaced the tag, asking for an explanation , Kappa reverted me, saying that I couldn't win an edit war... I've therefore opened an AfD, which I suggest all editors should do when they see a "deletion review" tag. Unless it can be shown that this is an encyclopædic topic, it should be <b>delete</b>d. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 09:32, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Reading the discussion, I concur that this term as defined in the article is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. The closest sourced topic is "Newly Independent States of the Former Soviet Union" which currently redirects to <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-Soviet_states_eabb.html" title="Post-Soviet states">Post-Soviet states</a>. I am going to carry out the redirect. I decline to merge anything because the former Soviet states are already included and the non-Soviet states are irrelevant. However, if I missed anything, please pull it out of the page history. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 05:48, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Rename</b> The links cited below by <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> show that the title <i>Newly Independent States</i> is used by the US government to refer to states of the former Russian Republic, not independent states that are new. This explains <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka">Grandmasterka</a>'s observation below. If that is to what the article is intended to refer, then it should be renamed to indicate that and make it clear that it is not a list of independent states that are new. I suggest <i>Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union</i> since that seems to be what the US government use.

<li>While Wikipedia <i>is</i> about sharing information, there are still guidelines as to what subjects are considered important enough for inclusion. You might like to have a look at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> to see what is generally considered appropriate for bands and musicians, and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> for an outline of what Wikipedia is <i>not</i> about.

Subject claims to have invented a major system of computerised ontology, but only gates 47 unique Google hits. One verifiable published book, published by F.I.S.

Smells strongly of vanity, even after some claims have been toned down. Also rolling in USECS, his ontological database, which scores exactly nine Googles under its full name (the initialism is ambiguous, although googling the initialism also returns a fair bit of spam pushing the autor of the article).

<li>It's quite disturbing to see this commented as 'non notable'. If someone is not well represented on web, it doesn't mean that he was un-worthy. I ask for immediate removal of this hold.</li>
<li>Similarly, It's quite interesting to see how people try to ruin others contribution just to exercise there pseudo-intellectuallism and wild freedoms.</li>
<li>I created this page to motivate his pupil so that they come forward and represent their mentor.</li>
<li>I liked the vision of wikipedia in which people would contribute towards a better understanding of the world and any miss-doing would eventually phased out by regular contributers, but didn't know that some would kill it in the very start and destroy the very essence of wikipedia.</li>

<p>If the goal of Wikipedia is to be as detailed as possible, then isn't it better that this be turned into a stub and be as detailed as possible? It could elaborate on how the application works, and therefore inspire more homebrews. The topic of how the Cheat Device works (through binary and commands) is in it's own a topic that could be better fleshed out. While I agree that this could be merged with the Liberty City Stories topic, I believe that many details are important and could only be fleshed out if given their own space. These details include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each version, and the changes made</li>

<li>The features

<p><b>Comment</b>: This page was listed for speedy deletion as nn-bio. First pass, it would appear that would be the case. However, I found a reference to this individual at <a href="http://www.southsidebusinessmensclub.com/awards.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.southsidebusinessmensclub.com/awards.htm" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> (search for name). Again, at first glance it would be easy to think this person is non-notable. Afterall, he's just a grocery store owner. But, take this in the context of a series of events from 30 years ago. As a leader of opposition against a major project, he may have been frequently in the news at the time, and certainly to the region he was probably quite notable. This is difficult to verify today, since those news items would not be on the web. So, I'm bringing this to AfD rather than speedy delete, to allow for comment. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 15:46, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>NEUTRAL</b>. I am afraid the current votes are not sufficiently founded. This article is not, like, a hoax, or vanity page.

You cannot redirect to an article that does not address the current content.

<p>The events clearly took place. If there is a problem with spelling, fix it. In 1900, Dalmatia had approximately equal number of Serbs, Croats and Italians. Now it is 85% Croat. Serbs were expelled (and killed in a genocide) in WWII and from 1991-1995. Italians in WWII, and expelled after it (it is an issue in Italy nowadays, Berlusconi asks Croatia to give back the property of expelled Italians, called enui). So, there is a lot of substance here, and the article has its place. If you think it is POV or has language errors, you can fix that as per Wikipedia policies. It is not wikipedia policy to remove the content because of language error (or even POV) as far as it is written on wiki policy pages. Mikiolo 08:31, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Austria-Hungary in 1911</div>
</div>
</div>
The article contains no useful information and is redundant with the very detailed <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Croatia_50e5.html" title="History of Croatia">History of Croatia</a> series and with <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_cleansing.html" title="Ethnic cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a>. It is written with POV content that borders on propaganda and cites no sources; its very title and introduction seem written to picture Croats as murderers ("Ethnical cleansing in Croatia is a method which was used by Croats several times to change the balance in national composition of Croatia in twentieth century"). Even if it were a good article, it would be in the wrong place, since there are tons of article on the history and wars of Croatia. When it comes to Italian presence in Istria and Dalmatia, this map of the ethnicity of Austria-Hungary comes in handy: it is from an English source in 1911 (times and authors are not immediately under suspicion of POV). Italians are a majority only in coastal areas of Istria, claiming that "Istria was always a part of Italy" (which did not even exist before 1861) does not look likely. --<a href="../../../o/r/z/User%7EOrzetto_6421.html" title="User:Orzetto">Orzetto</a> 12:01, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>the map you have produced is completely consistent with the article. It says that majority in Dalmatia were Slavs (Serbs + Croats). But Croats were a minority, i.e. Serbs and Italians were also a majority. Both were purged in ethnical cleansing, in several waves and that is the point of the article. from around a third croats are now 85% majority in dalmatia!!! Also, being part of a country (like Venice, Ragusa which had Latin, Italian and Dalmatian as major and official languages) is something not shown on this map. I discuss it below Mikiolo 16:46, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Italy might have not existed, but Venice clearly did. Until Napoleon Conquest, Istria and Dalmatia were part of Republic of Venice. After that Ragusa and part of Venice were given to Austria, not to Croatia (which was in personal union with Hungary). So it should be changed to never been part of Croatia, since that is clearly true.</p>

<p>Istria, Fiume and Zara were never part of Croatia until 1945, and Dalmatia was never part of Croatia until 1939. Also, if information does appear on some other places, this aspect of Croatian policies ought to be separately discussed. Just because some things are discussed in various other articles are not a good reason to remove an article from wikipedia. Would you remove Holocaust article because of the overlaps with final solution, WWII, SS and Himmler articles?? Mikiolo 16:29, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I do not think that POV is a reason to delete an article. The article in its current state is clearly POV, but if it can be sourced, with citations etc., edited to a NPOV, it could be a good article. If it cannot be sourced -- even by its POV authors -- that fact alone may convince the community that the allegations made in the article are false. And by the way, after reviewing enough articles, citations to population changes over time prove nothing in and of themselves -- demographics may change for any number of reasons and genocide is merely one of many possible interpretations (POVs). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 01:16, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b>. I have sources for every claim in the article if people want them.

<dd><b>comment</b>: In response to the above comment-- if there are verifiable sources, then they should have been in the article. Gothic "themed", by the way, is different from actually being a certain genre of music...Gothic themes can be found in a very wide range of music, but having a particular "theme" does not mean that it belongs in a particular genre; or even a particular group of genres. If we are simply talking about having an article for music with a certain theme, then in my opinion, it would be as pointless as having articles devoted to the explanation of "Happy-themed" music, or "Agrarian-themed" music. It makes much more sense to have an article devoted to a particle genre or group of genres and styles, and the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_rock.html" title="Gothic rock">gothic rock</a> article serves this purpose. Essentially, though, this article is up for deletion simply because it does not follow the three core policies of wikipedia. If you do feel that this article does meet the policies, then go ahead and vote against deletion. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatZilla_2e6a.html" title="User:CatZilla">CatZilla</a> 20:12, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The only source of information on this weapon system comes from "Defence Review" (see link in article) which in practice is a one-man webzine run by David Crane. The information is thus unverifiable at best. Further more the information is refutable. The "no recoil" claim for instance is - as any high school physics student knows - false. In the comments on the article on the article I have written the result of feasability checks I made using fairly simple physics calculations (see message by "J-Star on Monday, January 24 @ 09:28:14 PST") and the claims just don't hold water. This I wrote over a year ago and the editor has not responded.</li>

The promotional for the DREAD video does not show the supposed prototype firing (go watch the video though... it's hilarious). You see the prototype, then a series of shots into a wall. The weapon was supposedly created by Trinamic Technologies LLC of Connecticut, but I can't verify the company even exists. There are U.S. Patents pending for one Charles W. St. George that seem to cover this technology, but getting a patent and actually building a working prototype are 2 different things.

<li>I have been contacted by Waya sahoni concerning this article and his desire to either 1) improve the article or 2) transwiki the article elsewhere.

<li><b>Transwiki</b>, but <b>Merge</b> some mention into the main Cherokee language article. I think it's important for us to say that <i><b>yes</b></i>, we do strongly feel that knowledge of these languages is important to the posterity of all humanity, and their details matter. I think much of this information has value and see no reason to delete it outright. I would also be willing to use my knowlege of the workings of Wikipedia to assist in any effort to counter criticisms about the article and help improve it. <b>Also</b>, I propose that all votes that simply give a "per nom" basis for their vote default to the end view of the nominator. If they don't care enough to return and counteract this proposal, they the likely don't care anyway. Keep in mind these are discussions, not outright votes, so a "vote:per nom", while valid, doesn't carry a lot of weight. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 17:37, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Transwiki</b> as was done with many examples of <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockney_rhyming_slang.html" title="Cockney rhyming slang">Cockney rhyming slang</a>, and keep a few examples perhaps in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherokee_language.html" title="Cherokee language">Cherokee language</a> if appropriate. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 01:20, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki</b> seems the best place for this. I can verify that the content is pretty much one of a kind, and I doubt Wikipedia would ever get access to this type of content. The language constructs are also correct. Waya sahoni 03:27, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>NN, advertisement. Additionally, was tagged with a {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} but was removed by the author, as per this conversation from the article's talk page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. I submitted a request to move the page from "Everyonesacritic.net" to "Everyone's a Critc" taking the URL out of the title. 2. I reworded the content so it is a description of the community and not an advertisement for the website. 3. Other similar movie websites have entries in Wikipedia that are not submitted for deletion. If the person who submitted this entry for deletion, continues to do so, I respectfully request that specific reasons are stated in this discussion, so I may know how to continue to change the content to fall within Wikipedia's guidelines.</p>

<dd>Don't take this personally, but this article is not encyclopaedic. What you can do to prevent this from being deleted is to edit the article in a way that shows what the site is, who founded it, some history, etc. Example: sentences like "Everyone's a Critic, find yours..." sounds actually as a <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slogan.html" title="Slogan">slogan</a> rather than something you can find on an encyclopaedia, or "Dan, being the receptive webmaster that he is, has been applying many of these new features in a very timely manner." is a direct compliment (thus, completely subjecive)to someone that is not even notable. Any questions?</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>; Everyone's a Critic is a relevant and important film discussion website that deserves mention along with the Internet Movie Database. It may currently lack the enormous membership of the imdb, but it is a far more literate and inclusive site that is a central gathering for serious cineastes as well as casual moviegoers. I think this important site deserves inclusion in an encyclopedia strictly because of the lack of similar entries. People will find it relevant, interesting &amp; of more interest than generic and impersonal sites like imdb or rotten tomatoes. TC Candler</li>
<li><s><b>Delete.</b></s> Close call, though. I looked at the other movie wiki sites mentioned above, and the one thing they have in common is that they contain much fewer POV phrases than everyonesacritic.

<li><b>!!!!KEEP!!!!</b> Everyone's A Critic is a relevant and innovative web-based community that fosters the development of its writers' critical thought processes, writing skills, communication skills and knowledge of everything related to the history and development of cinema. The discussion regarding its lacking of notability disregards both the documented three cases media coverage (meeting the requirement quoted by Wikipedia of "multiple" media representations. In fact, its notability is clearly greater than that cited for other websites in the same category such as "Four Word Film Reviews," a cite which lists only one such example in a "nomination" for a "Webby" Award. Thus, I believe that Everyone's A Critic falls clearly within the realm of notability required for inclusion. I do understand and appreciate the discussions being presented for deletion, however, I believe the discussions point more towards the need, which is being addressed, to edit the article in a way that educates rather than promotes. "Everyones a Critic" has gone considerably above and beyond the typical film website by: 1) Providing an active forum for participating writers to share their voices, become better writers and receive feedback on their opinions, writings and critical thoughts, 2) Empowering participating individuals to expand and explore their writings by taking the lessons learned on EAC and applying them as writers (Several of the active participants are either freelance or active film critics after first finding their voice on EAC), 3) Offering a benefit to the community by working in partnership with Indianapolis based 501c3 non-profit organization Tenderness Tour, Inc. (Yes, I am its Executive Director) in doing a year-long fund-raiser for Prevent Child Abuse America and National Coalition Against Domestic Violence AND raised hundreds of dollars through sponsorships of every review written in 2005, and 4) Creating a worldwide network of amateur and professional film critics who work, write, discuss and educate on all subjects related to film. Clearly, I believe very clearly, "Everyone's a Critic" is not only appropriate for inclusion but a fine addition to Wikipedia.</li>

<li><b>KEEP:</b> Part of what makes Wikipedia notable is community input over content. The same can be said for Everyone's a Critic. The community has been submitting and building its database as well as initiating content and function changes since inception. To deny that noteworthy trait is to deny the same for Wikipedia. EAC is also noteworthy for collecting an international community who continue to visit, some daily, for multiples of years. It is unique from other film sites in that the personal recommendations formula actually achieves its goal. I have been effectively matched with both professional and amateur critics whose recommendations have surprised and pleased for three years. I continue to receive obscure international and made-for-cable titles suited especially for me. These are titles that would not have been brought to my attention without this formula. The achievement of this goal will continue to foster the growth of this site. I expect Everyone’s a Critic to become to film sites what eBay became to auction sites. Imagine yourselves being the people responsible for deleting Auctionweb in 1995 (a.k.a. eBay in 1997)? All the great ones started just like this! --Nycsmile</li>

<s>*<b>Comment</b>. Frankly, when I look at the page, I still see what looks like not only POV, but outright advertising. "Words of Hope" as a section header? That's <b>ad copy</b>, not a section header. Links to awards vice simple mentions within the article? That's leading someone to go look and increase the <i>validation</i> of the article vice letting it speak for itself. I initially AFD'd it, because as the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} was removed makes it somewhat controversial and highly suggests that it needs to go to an AFD for further validation; I didn't have a vote on it one way or another. But based on what I see now, if I had to vote, I would vote <b>Speedy delete</b> based on what I consider to be <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">WP:VSCA</a>. Furthermore, by the increasing appearance of EaC members to come here and "protect their turf" is usually indicative of and done by minor sites that do not meet the notability requirements of WP. Lastly, by your nitpicking every bit of the rules, you are not ensuring that the article will survive; however, you are finding the flaws in the rules that will likely be tightened up after this AFD regardless of the outcome.

<strike>*<b>Comment</b> I completely object to Stifle's attempt to <b>stifle</b> me. Stifle claims the reason he moved the meat and bones of this AfD over to the talk page is because it's <i><b>too long</b></i> and therefore <i><b>too much to read</b></i> (Waaaaaaaahhhhh!!!). Yet, everything he's moved has been the author's comments (except one response to one of the author's comments). Many of the author's comments Stifle moved are a lot shorter than other people's comments he left on the AfD page. So why move the author's short comments and keep other's longer comments and claim it's because the AfD is too long? Then, after all that time Stifle took figuring out what to move over to the talk page be cause it's <i>too much to read all those words</i>; it's blatantly obvious Stifle didn't even read any of it, he just moved it. Why? Because he votes to <b>Delete</b> with the Alexa ranking as his reason when the author already pointed out that according to Wikipedia's rules and guidelines, <b>Alexa rankings are not used to determine notability</b>. Folks here keep telling me to <i>not take this personally</i>, or <i>no offense, but...</i> and I'll tell you that I haven't been taking this personally. I do understand the need to edit and delete within Wikipedia. But, over time I'm beginning to take it a bit personally. When rules and guidelines are blatantly ignored, when Wikipedians justify the ignoring of the guidelines by saying "Well, they're going to be changed soon anyway." then how is a newbie supposed to take all of this?

<li><b>Comment (no vote yet)</b>: I have cleaned up the article by deleting some headers and a paragraph, but also adding the {{web-stub}} template. I would like to tell thse participating on this vote that they should be aware that this article is a stub. I say this because many people may have voted for deleting the article only because it is incomplete. Meanwhile, I'll take a decision... --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 00:32, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks, Neigel for cleaning up the article. This is the guidance I was hoping for from a more experienced Wikipedian. I believe so much more can be accomplished at Wikipedia through positive feedback and guidance as opposed to <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">biting the newcomers</a>. I honestly appreciate what you've done, no matter which way you decide to vote.--<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave.seidner_8421.html" title="User:Dave.seidner">Dave</a> 01:16, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, if and only if this article is turned into something like <a href="../../../l/e/r/Lernu%21.html" title="Lernu!">Lernu!</a>. I totally agree with Karmafist, specially when he says that EaC is in "the border of notability".

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article seems a useful NPOV stub when I read it (see time stamp). AND: I don't like the term <b>wikilawyering</b> either we have policies or we don't and either we apply them or we don't, no one should be criticized for pointing out a failure to adhere to our own policies. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 01:27, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Based on the work that has gone into the article to improve it immeasurably, I am changing my vote to a <b>Weak keep</b>. I still agree that it's on the borderline of notability, but it appears now to be within acceptible bounds. The article still has some edits more to clear sections that still feel like advertising, but it's far better than it was in the beginning. On another note, while I do agree with the concept that Dave was "Wikilawyering", this also does prove that the AFD process, as well as the criteria we use for the process, does need to be more heavily scrutinized. If this site were as nn as some (including myself) think/thought it to be, this should have been a far easier and simpler process (especially with the influx of "one-time responders" from EaC). Likewise, to defend it, I don't think that justifications of notability should have been turned into an epic saga. Everyone here's going to need to look at the processes we use both to delete and protect articles in the AFD process, or else we're going to be nothing more than a debating club that gets nowhere.--<font color="#4B0082"><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">み使い</a></b></font> <i><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitsukai_5376.html" title="User talk:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a></b></i> 15:24, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Abstain</b>... I've removed my delete vote above. I still don't see sufficient evidence of notability to satisfy me enough to vote keep, but in the interest of good faith and perhaps fostering a little less contentious atmosphere here, I'll withdraw my objection.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:26, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>... I'm a new user to EaC, this week in fact. It looked like it was just going to be a skeletal duplicate of the IMDb. But I've found it quite unique, and I've been spending much of my time this week adding votes, films, actors, etc. to the database and comparing votes to others. I'm quite impressed. I believe the site is valuable, and will be moreso as more people find out about it. Agreed that it shouldn't read as a promo.</li>

<p>In my opinion it is notable, it is information on something which is a significant part of game, which a lot of people play. Over 40,000 people play Utopia, and HaJ is relevant to them all. There are about 1000 people for whom HaJ is more directly relevant, as they are (to varying degrees) part of it. I'm sure that to someone that doesn't play the game Utopia, it is irrelevant, but thousands of other articles also seem irrelevant unless you already know something about them.</p>
<p>To be honest, considering the lack of space this page takes up it surprises me that it matters if it stays or not. If it is useful to some people, why not just let it stay?</p>
<p>It has had a blank page for a long time, I just thought I'd provide some further information.</p>

<p>I fear I must disagree with you when you claim it to be a non-notable game. Utopia <a href="http://games.swirve.com/utopia" class="external free" title="http://games.swirve.com/utopia" rel="nofollow">http://games.swirve.com/utopia</a> is a game of many players that involved intricate details of strategy, communication and diplomacy. Utopia began as a small gathering of 10,000 players in 1998 and has since then been growing. For a full review of Utopia please follow this link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(online_game)" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(online_game)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(online_game)</a> to the game's wikipedia entry.</p>
<p>I must also disagree with your contention that HaJ is a non-notable portion of this game. The Honour and Justice alliance has been around since the seventh age of Utopia, marking it one of the oldest and best known alliances in the gaming world of Utopia. Honour and Justice has hundreds of members with hundreds more passing through her halls each year. HaJ has become an integrated part of the game and is note-worthy for such a venue of information -- wikipedia.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I never claimed the game was non-notable. However, " "Honour and Justice Alliance" Utopia" gets 7 unique google hits, one of which is -- <a href="../../../h/a/j/Haj.html" title="Haj">Haj</a>, a disambiguation page, and one is a mirror of that disambig page.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The Honour and Justice Alliance is recognized by any player that is familiar with Utopia gameplay. Honour and Justice is the oldest surviving player organization in the game. It has spent many ages contending with other organizations and has dominated many game top charts. The organization is more than noteable within the game for these reasons.</li>

<p>That article is new, but if you search for "HaJ" you will find a disambiguation page, with the option of "Hajj" (a Muslim pilgrimage) or "HaJ" (this alliance.) Following the HaJ link takes you to a blank page.</p>
<p>I understand that to the vast majority of people, this is irrelevant, but there a still a lot that it is relevant to. There are many articles here that contain fairly insignificant information, but it is still vlaid information. Any information and a subject, if correct, is better than a lack of it is it not?</p>
<p>I see why a lot of people may not see a reason why it should be here, but I see no real reason why it <i>shouldn't</i> be here. If someone can explain that (preferably in a non-offensive way) I would appreciate it.</p>
<p>Although a merge would be better in my opinion than an outright deletion, I don't believe it is a good idea. Although HaJ is a part of Utopia, the Utopia article is not really an appropriate place for the information. To use an analogy that would probably make more sense to those that don't play Utopia, it would be similar to having information on Manchester United in an article on football/soccer.</p>
<p>I'm sure that to those that don't play Utopia or a similar game I must seem like a geek with biased views who places too much significance on something which is completely pointless, but I am trying to be as impartial as possible. --Kombucha 15:26, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First of all, why do you all post together? Secondly, your posts are worth almost nothing, because you are not backing up your opinions with anything. You continue to say, for example: "non-notable gamecruft" and "<b>Merge</b> content with main article" when I have already given reasons why both are not, in my opinion appropriate. You have said nothing to say why you disagree with these views. --Kombucha 12:14, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Kombucha, you're probably more likely to annoy people than to get good results by telling everyone their opinions aren't worth much. As the author of the page, and as a new editor who's only edits have been related to this, many people aren't going to weigh your opinions very heavily. This is all about having an appropriate level of detail. If the main game is significant enough to have an article, that's one thing. But many editors feel that we don't need seperate articles on everything IN the game. Why not set up a wiki all about this game, and then you guys can have whatever editorial policies you want? Here, we're trying to be an encyclopedia, and that means we use verifiable information and discuss whatever is most relevant about the topic at hand. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:42, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>What I said was not that their opinions were worth nothing, but that their posts were worth little. My point was that they were giving no reasons for what they said, or responding to my previous points.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is not all there is in the world. Whether I have made a lot of additions or changes to Wikipedia or not, my opinions can still be just as valid and my points just as correct.</p>
<p>I understand that Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopaedia. But from my point of view, that means containing as much information as possible. Of course, incorrect information is worse than no information, but this information is correct, and relevant to thousands of people. It is by no means the most important article here, not by a long shot, but it may be useful to some people. I see no reason to remove the article, it is doing no harm by being there, as long as it does not contain false information.--Kombucha 21:12, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>On being asked to close this Afd</b> I'll add my two penn'orth. Somebody asked me to close the AfD on this "<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Honour_and_Justice_Alliance_f5fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Honour and Justice Alliance">this slam-dunk gamecruft article</a>" yesterday. I declined. I said in reply:</p>
<ul>
<li>'I don't like to do article deletion closes. If I encountered this in AfD, I'd probably wonder why such an obvious merge candidate had been nominated for deletion, and why so many people were supporting deletion with no other rationale than that they believed it to be "cruft"'</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that whoever does close it will take into consideration all opinions expressed, but will honestly express our dictum: <i>if in doubt, don't delete.</i></p>
<p>If I encountered this article in cleanup, I'd probably just merge a sentence or two into the article on <a href="../../../u/t/o/Utopia_%28online_game%29.html" title="Utopia (online game)">Utopia (online game)</a> and redirect. That is <i>all</i> that needs to be done here.</p>
<p>Thank you. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 01:28, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am glad to see that someone in a neutral position is at least disagreeing with the idea of deletion. I would like to point out, again, that a merge would not be a particularly good idea, and would be akin to merging an article on a famous sport team to the article on that sport. Kombucha 01:34, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's one or two key differences: a famous sports team would surely have reputable sources talking about it, and most editors wouldn't find it an inappropriate level of detail to have an entire article about just one team. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 01:40, 23 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see no reason why what I have written is any less reputable than an article that most people would write on a team. I assure you that what I have written is true. If you would like me to prove this in any way, I will, if it is possible. It is rare for articles to prove what they say; this article does not contain an unusual level of statements that are not backed up.</dd>
<dd><b>Edit:</b> How would you (or anyone else) suggest that I improve this article with sources? Due to the nature of the article it is not easy to supply a source for all the statments there, however, I will do what I can.

<p>Oh for heaven's sake, this is an encyclopedia that anyone can edit. Why would it be such a bad idea to edit this article right now to redirect it to <a href="../../../u/t/o/Utopia_%28online_game%29.html" title="Utopia (online game)">Utopia (online game)</a>? In what way would Wikipedia be harmed by my ending this debate by doing that now?

<dd>HaJ is not the same thing as Utopia. It makes no sense to redirect to Utopia. The reason no one has done anything like that so far is because we are still discussing it. Whether Wikipedia is irreparably harmed or not is not the point. Kombucha 08:21, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"Keep" i own all of RS's catalog. i can't believe anyone would even be bothered by this. jealousy and insecurity are such nasty traits of emotional weaklings. get a life, haters.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Even though Mr. Stolp does not appear in Rolling Stone, he is a highly valued, respected artist of our generation. Interest in his musical pursuits as well as artisitc faculties is growing at breakneck speeds. It would be a great disservice to present and future generations to stifle his quest of informing people of his talents and making them aware of his place in this world of everything online. I myself own a highly sucessful website, which proudly displays a link to his work. I recieve numerous inquiries about his work daily. How can an artist wether it be musical, canvas, or the written word, be invalid? One must wonder if this form of communication and advertisement was around since the beginning of time, would someone had suggested a Beethoven entry here was vanity? Would Salvador Dali be put up for deletion due to someone judging his entry as self promotion? Furthermore, would a user decide that Einstein's theroy was impossible, thus put it up for deletion based on their own judgement that it was improbable? What has society dwindled to when people are so quick to jump on the judgement train. I say KEEP Mr. Stolp's entry loudly and proudly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Over the last few years I have watched Mr.Stolp's career grow..With each passing cd his music has gained world wide recognition and critical acclaim. Not only do I own his cd's, but I own a web site where Mr. Stolp's, web address appears.. To delete him due to vanity or whatever other claims that are being brought against his entry at Wikipedia, is ridiculous. He is proud of what he does, he is honest, and he is talented. The trumped up charges agaisnt Mr. Stolp have no merit. Keep his entry in tact. His talent, integrity and dedication to his art, is proof of the kind of man he is.</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> I believe that the move for deletion was brought on by a competing website. Gweedo767 happens to run <a href="http://witendofi.com" class="external text" title="http://witendofi.com" rel="nofollow">WitendoFi</a>, and he has repeatedly tried to comment when DSmeet or other websites that compete with his are mentioned on blogs or other websites (this instance on Wikipedia is another instance of such). Some evidence: <a href="http://calico-media.com/wordpress/?p=105" class="external autonumber" title="http://calico-media.com/wordpress/?p=105" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> <a href="http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/28/1259220" class="external autonumber" title="http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/28/1259220" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> I believe this is the motivating factor behind his push to delete this article, and I ask that you consider it when you make your decision. As for whether or not DSmeet is actually a notable website, I have some thoughts on that as well: DSmeet has a fair <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=dsmeet.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=dsmeet.com" rel="nofollow">Alexa rating</a>, and has <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/ds/meet-strangers-for-dsing-147835.php" class="external text" title="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/ds/meet-strangers-for-dsing-147835.php" rel="nofollow">been</a> <a href="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2006/02/13/ds-meet-introduces-online-tournament-system/" class="external text" title="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2006/02/13/ds-meet-introduces-online-tournament-system/" rel="nofollow">mentioned</a> <a href="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2006/01/29/animal-crossing-online-catalog/" class="external text" title="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2006/01/29/animal-crossing-online-catalog/" rel="nofollow">often</a> <a href="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2006/01/11/ds-online-community-service/" class="external text" title="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2006/01/11/ds-online-community-service/" rel="nofollow">in</a> <a href="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2005/12/10/mariokart-decal-maker/" class="external text" title="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2005/12/10/mariokart-decal-maker/" rel="nofollow">the</a> <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/mario-kart-ds/search-for-mario-kart-ds-user-names-139580.php" class="external text" title="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/mario-kart-ds/search-for-mario-kart-ds-user-names-139580.php" rel="nofollow">press</a>. I believe that the impact this website serves in the Nintendo community is absolutely not trivial, and I also believe that Nintendo is closely monitoring websites like DSmeet to see how to best conduct their future online endevors, as this is an important new direction for their business with the Nintendo WFC. Full Disclosure: I am the owner of DSmeet and I do believe DSmeet is non-trivial, but I also acknowledge that I am a heavily biased individual. In any matter, I await your vote whatever the outcome may be. --<a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchelon_3be1.html" title="User:Echelon">Echelon</a> 02:16, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> DSmeet simply isn't a big enough community to require a Wikipedia article. A compromise would be to add a section on <i>friend code sites</i> in the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_Wi-Fi_Connection_0a4a.html" title="Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</a> article giving a brief summary of each website (all while keeping an NPOV). Most of the article is indeed plugging a website and is an article that simply isn't needed. (Sidenote: I am a moderator on this forum and yet disagree with this article being online.) --<a href="../../../s/a/k/User%7ESakurina_4963.html" title="User:Sakurina">Sakurina</a> 02:30, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've been thinking about my earlier proposal, and I actually must go back on it. DSmeet has, by far, more users and traffic than the others combined. It's more impacting in the Nintendo community. I think if we did a general article on all friend code websites, it would simply ignore the reality that there is only one "big" and "active" directory/service. Consider this: I now think of this issue in terms of an article on, say, an IMDB competitor. There are hundreds of them scattered about the web, but none of them are as significant or well known as IMDB is. If we were to make a general "DS Friendcode Services" article, it would be the same as creating, say, a "Movie Database Websites" article. I think that would miss the point--IMDB is significant in movie culture. DSmeet is significant in the Nintendo WiFi culture. --<a href="../../../s/a/k/User%7ESakurina_4963.html" title="User:Sakurina">Sakurina</a> 02:02, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> There are 55,000 Google results for "DS Meet" and "DSmeet." I'm not sure how many are necessary for it to be considered "notable," but, at any rate, if the problem is that the article is plugging the site, why not just correct the article instead of deleting it? It would be a fine part of a collection of articles about the online communities Nintendo's first true venture into online gaming is creating. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWild_Bill_925c.html" title="User:Wild Bill">Wild Bill</a> 03:35, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Change vote: Keep.</b> I'm changing my vote because I completely forgot that we could simply edit the article to modifying the non-NPOV/plugging aspects of the article. And with the recently posted proof that DSmeet is more notable than I thought it was, this simply made me want to change my vote. --<a href="../../../s/a/k/User%7ESakurina_4963.html" title="User:Sakurina">Sakurina</a> 03:43, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have to disagree with DS_Meet being considered a "trivial" website. As previously mentioned, DS_Meet has received alot of recognition throughout the web. Users join DS_Meet to fill a void left by Nintendo's own community and are provided with useful tools and information to enhance their gaming experience. I feel it is a notable website and should be allowed to remain in Wikipedia. Gweedo767's reasons for requesting removal are clearly personal and should be discounted as such. --<a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENisMax_b1e2.html" title="User:NisMax">NisMax</a> 07:40, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is an advertisement for a multi-level marketing scheme with a bait-and-switch component. I tried to fix it, and I have debated what to do with it over several days. I believe it needs to be deleted. It contains numerous links to articles singing the praises of this obscure numismatic company that produces this product. It also encourages people to pass NORFED's privately minted coins, which closely resemble some older official U.S. government issued coins. This article and the accompanying links, and as a result Wikipedia, come very close to encouraging illegal behavior like uttering, passing counterfeit money, fraud, and theft of goods and/or services by deceit. This is definitely something Wikipedia should distance itself from.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I was one of editors who some time ago worked to clean the bullshit from the article. In my opinion it is financial <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snake_oil.html" title="Snake oil">snake oil</a> and crookery, but it is notable snake oil, hence deserves coverage. If anything, it needs a heavy-handed POV control, but not deletion. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 23:23, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a bit more than MLM snake oil, it's an issue associated with the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian_Party_%28United_States%29_808f.html" title="Libertarian Party (United States)">Libertarian Party (United States)</a>, the 3rd or 4th or so largest political party in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.

It's also a well written, balanced article (not that that should decide whether the issue is worthy of an article at all), and we document many worse things than MLM here, see <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloods.html" title="Bloods">Bloods</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crips.html" title="Crips">Crips</a> ...<a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGRuban_6db9.html" title="User:GRuban">GRuban</a> 23:35, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Assuming this is a pyramid marketing scheme is a paranoid reaction. I receieve over 600 scam e-mails a day and not one has ever mentioned this currency. The wikipedia page comes across as a factual description of a novelty item which nobody in their right mind would confuse with government issue currency, and the article in no way led me to believe that the NORFED coins were genuine government issue currency. The BrianGCrawfordMA user indicates that wikipedia is encouraging people to engage in "theft of goods and/or services by deceit" but I was in no way encouraged to do so by this article. Please examine:</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.treas.gov/education/faq/currency/legal-tender.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.treas.gov/education/faq/currency/legal-tender.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.treas.gov/education/faq/currency/legal-tender.shtml</a></p>
<p>Where you can clearly see that to be committing fraud there would have to be the suggestion these NORFED coins "are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues" but there is no such suggestion and the wikipedia article paints them as a novelty item private individuals may if they wish swap with one another in exchange for objects or services.</p>
<p>If NORFED novelty coins were widespread and commonplace then the Federal Reserve would no doubt manipulate the LAW in any way it considered necessary to eradicate them. They however, are not - and this is almost immaterial as the wikipedia article is descriptive and not suggestive. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.10.172.204 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.10.172.204_b913.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.10.172.204">contribs</a>).</small> <small><i>and is the only recorded edit by this user.</i></small></p>
<ul>
<li>This seems to be a noteworthy topic (passes google and might just squeak media coverage) but the POV in the article is overwhelming. The article is obviously comprehensive and well written but is entirely designed to give an impression of these objects as valuable, sensible and popular... I would need to hear evidence from respected sources (not blogs, local papers and anecdotes) that assert this scheme is sensible and not just someone's pet nest-feathering project or a scam which claims to work on "libertarian principles" in order to rip people off. As is I'm going to <s><b>abstain</b></s> because although there is way too much POV here, the monetary system is inherently fraudulent and just plain wrong and anything that tries to give it a kick up the backside is fine by me, something I feel so strongly about that even <i>my</i> deletionism is pushed aside. If it can be proved to be a scam, delete. If the article is wikified, keep. It has to be said that the above <b>unsigned</b> post really tries my patience and I believe it's author should declare themselves and any involvement they had in the article or with NORFED if they want their opinion to be considered in this debate. <b><font style="verdana" color="#990099">++D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#9900CC">iz</font></b> 01:50, 18 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am the author of the above opinion, I have and never have had any involvement with NORFED or with the article. I read pieces of wikipedia regularly but have never seen a discussion about if an article should be deleted or not before - hence my "unsigned" nature, I am not really a big part of forming the site nor intend to be. I am suprised my comment made <b><font style="verdana" color="#990099">++D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#9900CC">iz</font></b> emotional and I do not wish to be involved in a heated dispute about this. As to declaring myself, I do not know what you wish me to to declare? I came to the article looking for information about the Liberty Dollar and it provided me with the information I was interested in. I do not understand how shrinking the knowledge contained in wikipedia is to anyone's benefit, but I am willing to admit that perhaps I am simply hardened to MLM-style nonsense and my brain filtered out everything except the facts I was interested in. If you want to do something about the page, why not re-write it in it's entirety yourself, leaving the factual information about what the coins are, their weights, NORFED, etc, remove anything you find "salesy", add the comment many people consider this to be an MLM and the rational behind this - because to me (and I admit I did not consider the intention of NORFED in their manufacture - because it is immateral to what the objects are) they just came across as novelty coins that people could use in a "club like" fashion to trade with one another - should they be so disposed.</li>
<li>Could you please elaborate what exactly is POV in the article (in its talk page, not here), so that we could fix it? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 02:05, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I searched extensively for such sources, but could find almost nothing. See my vote above. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 06:35, 18 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I had about the same success as Will Beback on this. I did several searches over several days, trying to find something written by someone who is not involved financially with this project, but I couldn't. With the exception of the news story that says that two men were arrested for passing one of these to a shopkeeper, which is linked in the article, all the stuff I found was written by people who had paid the $250 to become an "Associate" and thus, they had a clear financial interest.</li>

<p><i>I don't think this article can be made neutral without original research because of this very real problem, and that's another reason I felt it needs to be deleted.</i> Compare Liberty Dollars with silver coins minted for circulation by the U.S. Government. The Liberty Dollars are cunningly designed to look like U.S. Government issues. Like U.S. coins, they have the word "liberty" spelled out on the obverse above the stylized head of a woman. Sound familiar? I guess what this comes down to is a lot of people think that the U.S. Government is irresponsible and should not have gone off the Gold Standard, regardless of the fact that it is one of the basic responsibilities of any government to completely standardize its currency and so prevent frauds like this. Now these people are willing to pay twenty dollars for a piece of silver they could get for eight, just to prove a point. Even worse, they want <i>you</i> to buy the overpriced silver to prove their point too. <i>Wikipedia is not a soapbox.</i> I would remind everyone that this is not the place to promote a personal agenda, but I fear this falls on deaf ears. There seem to be people involved with the Liberty Dollar who think this is a fine place to promote their product. This is an ad, it's hopelessly POV despite my substantial edits, and there's no reliable information to be found anywhere about the Liberty Dollar. To pretend that this article is neutral is to lie to every reader of this article. Please delete it. BrianGCrawfordMA 15:10, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Having read the raging debates on the talk page and done some more digging, I've come to the following conclusion: The article for this topic will <b>never</b> be NPOV, but this topic will <b>always</b> have an article. Catch 22. Is there a WP policy for this situation? BGCMA and others who are willing to police it, good luck... I'm going back to the safety of stoner rock and Korean baseball. <b><font style="verdana" color="#990099">++D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#9900CC">iz</font></b> 16:37, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> and <b>redirect</b>, changed from <b>delete.</b> In spite of how repugnant this scheme is, upon further research I have come to think that the material in this article should be made more concise and merged with either the article for "Commodity money" or "Private currency." "Liberty Dollar" and "NORFED" should be redirected accordingly. Maybe then this information would get the broader context it desperately needs. "Phoenix Dollar," a similar currency/program/movement should also be merged and redirected to one of these topics, but maybe that's a discussion for another time.

<li>I am afraid this is not how wikipedia works.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Sorry, I'm still in favor of <b>Keep</b>. Make it <b>Strong Keep</b>. Three reasons:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The fact that most editors think it's a scam shouldn't influence whether or not we have an article on it - it should merely influence the tone of the article. If you think it's a scam, back your opinion with research, and put it in the article. Google gets 85,000 hits on "Liberty Dollar", it's pretty clearly notable, so if we don't have information on it, that's a gaping hole in the Wikipedia. We've got articles on <a href="../../../a/m/w/Amway.html" title="Amway">Amway</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbalife.html" title="Herbalife">Herbalife</a> and Ghu knows what else, whether or not it's a scam is not a reason to either delete it or hide it as a subsection of something else.</li>
<li>Second, I'm not sure why people keep saying the article is an ad. Every section of the article has some pretty critical lines: "not endorsed", "not legal tender", "not widely accepted", "resulted in arrests"... What more could we want? The very fact that it's hard to find any criticisms of the scheme <i>elsewhere</i> is a reason to <i>keep</i> our article, it's one of the most critical articles on the subject out there! And it does have links to criticisms in the External links section, which otherwise would be quite hard to find.</li>
<li>Finally, unlike Amway and Herbalife and similar organizations, the Liberty Dollar is a political statement. Even if the MLMers are trying to make a fast buck, the actual <i>users</i> aren't in it for a buck, they're just doing their best to criticise the "soft money" policies of the US govt. That's worth expounding on. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGRuban_6db9.html" title="User:GRuban">GRuban</a> 00:08, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The article simply describes what LDs are, and doesn't encourage anyone to go out and get them. Furthermore, if the Federal Reserve, Department of the Treasury and the Secret Service all deem the LD to be legal, then it's legal. End of story. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.160.10.106 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.160.10.106_7ecf.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.160.10.106">contribs</a>).</small> <small>on 00:40, 18 February 2006 and seems to have been (hopefully unintentionally?) deleted by <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">User:Will Beback</a> on the very next edit.</small></li>

<dl>
<dd>Kmweber, I don't "fail to understand," as you put it, how the Liberty Dollar works. It's a great way of separating fools from their (real) money. Unless you are one of NORFED's very own "patriots," I'd bet you don't know as much as I do about it, as I've spent several days on crackpot militia movement and survivalist blogs that extoll the virtues of NORFED, the Liberty Dollar, von NotHaus, and any other brave soul who purports to put a boot in the Fed's ass. Let me know how much junk silver I can unload on you at twenty bucks an ounce. Buy it for Freedom.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, Kurt, I have plenty of problems with the content, and I will keep fixing it and changing it until the NRA, NORFED, Ted Nugent, and the Aryan Nation and all their associated, so-called "Libertarian," gun-show loving, sh#%-kicking ilk pry my keyboard from my cold, dead hands.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I still don't understand why these righteous freedom-loving patriots in right-wing crackpot communities across the country are so keen on silver, a commodity with a <i>highly variable</i> price that has lost a huge amount of its value over a relatively short time. I'd rather barter with smoked hams than Liberty Dollars. At least you could eat the ham, and it may outlast NORFED.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I want to hurt this article as much as it has hurt me. Yes, it deserves to die, and I hope it burns in Hell! I may have no real beef with NORFED as long as they keep their propaganda to themselves, and I'd never heard of them till I found out about them spamming Wikipedia articles, but when "Liberty Dollar" survives this vote, you can bet your life I'll be on this article like white on rice, and NORFED will no longer be able to rely on Wikipedia as a free advertisement for its scam.

<li><b>Keep</b>&#160;: I've known about the liberty dollar for some time - seen their presentation - and am skeptical about their claims. After reading about the Fed M3 stunt on for March 23, I decided to consider the liberty dollar as a safe haven from the crashing dollar. I came to wikipedia to see the LD discussion and was happy to see the views of others that are skeptical. So, as long as there is a "criticisms" section - I think the article is valuable and should stay - for the sole reason of keeping people from foolishly buying into it. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrer_vole_ef51.html" title="User:Brer vole">Brer Vole</a></li>

<p>An article was dleeted at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_interesting_or_unusual_place_names_982d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of interesting or unusual place names">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of interesting or unusual place names</a>. It was taken to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> where deletion was endorsed, and several expressed themselves satisfied with its continued existence in Project space at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_interesting_or_unusual_place_names_a454.html" title="Wikipedia:List of interesting or unusual place names">Wikipedia:List of interesting or unusual place names</a>, since it failed <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. This seems to me to be a pretty blatant attempt to get round that by citing <i>other people's POV</i> - including some newspaper space fillers. I don't want to provoke a war here, but I am greatly disturbed by this apparent forking. I realise it's slightly different in conception, but overall it really isn't significantly different to the old article in that it is still POV and OR, it just says so up front and then appeals to the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a> fallacy to justify it. In the end, "Fucking" is only funny to a sophomore Anglophone - in its native language it is not actually that odd - and the places listed as producing many "unusual" names are merely an artifact of dialect or influx of people from non-English speaking countries. So this should, if anything, be a list of place names considered by an arbitrary subset of people to meet some arbitrary definition of "unusual". But in the end no amount of saying "look, this is not the same thing, really it isn't" doesn't make this any less a fork, in my opinion. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 23:16, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
