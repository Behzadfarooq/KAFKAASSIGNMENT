<p>The result was <b>delete both</b>. Patrick Eris has not been discussed much here, but the notability of that subject is heavily intertwined with Sandman's, so I feel that the discussion here is sufficient justification for its deletion. In particular, Nemo Sandman is the only article that links to Patrick Eris. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 10:35, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Also the changing of the artist name from Jean-Manuel Moreau (easily verifiable on Google) to Nemo Sandman is not helping...

For example "Riding the rafale" is a film produced by Teuf Production. How can this info can be verified&#160;? By a link&#160;? Thank you to point me in the right direction.

Editor's certainly got a lot of links now, but following Consumed Crustacean, many of them are shaky.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Look, we already know you're heavily invested in keeping this article alive (one of the reasons, come to that, cited in both <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> why you shouldn't write an article about yourself). But quite aside from that being mentioned in another article isn't in of itself proof of notability - <i>I</i> am, in two articles yet, and that doesn't make <i>me</i> notable - such links are found in Wikipedia all the time, and isn't a particular deterrent to the AfD process. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 11:33, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
