<li>Fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. No entries on artistdirect or allmusic, nothing in the article which indicates notability. She sells her records on cdbaby and from her myspace account. She's also ten years old.

<ul>
<li>What matter? How would her having been sent a message clear anything up? If she is personally notified or not, it has nothing to do with her notability. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 04:11, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>DELETE</b>. This article is nothing more than a publicity page. Wikipedia is not a bulletin board for posting advertisements. Interesting that the only contributor to the materials on the article has participated in this deletion discussion by calling the article "her [Brianna's] <i>profile</i> here." Wikipedia is not a place for profiles. MySpace is. I am sure this cute little girl has a lot of potential, but she still has a long way to go before she makes it into an encyclopedia. Best of luck to her, and bye-bye!<a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 04:26, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Fine. Go ahead and delete it. But when you start getting hate mail from her fans, don't come crying to me. I tried to warn you. -- <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESummers95926_3a10.html" title="User:Summers95926">Summers95926</a> 12:37am PDT, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fans? I see only one fan, that person being yourself. If Brianna Rieffel's alleged fans find the idea of this deletion upsetting, how come they haven't come to the rescue by providing the 3rd party references that were previously requested? Threats to spam the email boxes of other Wikipedians are not an appropriate way to keep an article in the system. I think that Brianna Rieffel is probably a super-great little kid, but she's not an appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article yet. Maybe in a few years. I hope to see great things from her in the future. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 18:06, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE!!</b> I'm really not sure what all the fuss is about? There are several other child entertainers that are listed here on Wikipedia and they are ABSOLUTELY ADVERTISING. Do we need to post newspaper articles to make this "notable"? These other child entertainers are ALL advertising on here so why delete this one? Unless you care to delete ALL OF THEM? Why single out this one? This little girl is making a big impact on those affected by hurricane Katrina by the heartfelt song she wrote for and about all those people. She has been on <a href="../../../w/d/s/WDSU_5c49.html" title="WDSU">WDSU</a> TV News, radio on KMRC 1430 which can be found on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_radio_stations_in_Louisiana_f2ae.html" title="List of radio stations in Louisiana">List_of_radio_stations_in_Louisiana</a> and in The TIMES PICAYUNE because of this song. She is donating ALL of the proceeds from her song back to the people of New Orleans. For this article to be deleted would be a serious injustice to this little girl's cause. Like I said, if you delete this one, then you need to delete all of the young entertainers that are on here! User:breezee95

<li>You're missing the point Jamoche.......this <b>should not be deleted</b> forget about what order my original response was made. The point is, if you delete this one, then all the rest of the child entertainers listed on here need to be deleted too. User:breezee95
<ul>
<li>Because, of course, Brianna has so much more public recognition than "all of the rest of the child entertainers". <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 04:26, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No more no less. She should be treated equal. The other "articles" on these other child entertainers are clearly advertisements, just as you claim this one to be. All of these kids have positive messages to send this world, so let them speak and quit trying to delete it. It's starting to sound like you have some "personal issue" with this particular child entertainer. Otherwise move on to getting someone else deleted. user:breezee95
<ul>
<li>I am not sure I fully understand why someone is working hard to get Brianna Rieffel's profile deleted. Granted, she is a little girl so she would not have a extensive history to mark as accomplishments. She is a survivor of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and has written a song to express her feelings over the "promises that were broken". Since Hurricane Katrina has been one of the biggest natural disasters the United States has ever witnessed, to find someone so young who wants to express the feelings of tens of thousands of people in such a positive way by writing and recording a song about those feelings are remarkable. Remarkable in the way that she has no plans to profit from Katrina (many have), but has choosen to give the proceeds back to building schools in Louisanna, to me, is a postive in keeping her profile on Wikipedia. In my opinion, you can never give children enough examples of positive, child role-models. Brianna will be a huge success regardless of whether she makes the pages of Wikipedia or not. user:AGTGrasshoppa</li>
<li>That's very nice. When she <i>does</i> become a huge success, then she will have met our guidelines for notability, and she can have an article about herself. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 17:05, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think the child, Brianna, cares either way if she is listed on this site or not. I don't think that is the issue here, delete her if that is your goal. Personally, I see no harm on leaving her profile on Wikipedia. It doesn't take up unnecessary space and after reading just one entry on the homepage about Ramu in the category of "famous monkeys" I have to wonder how this particular monkey became so "notable". Now I ask "why this monkey and not others?" Forgive me for comparing a talented 10 year old child to a pesky monkey whos only claim to fame seems to be biting people.user: AGTGrasshoppa</li>

Yet, she gets no press, no attention, and rejection from idiots sites like Wikipedia. She gets profiled on Wikipedia and her fans were estatic. Only for those morons to drop her because it "did not follow their guidelines". Who needs them? She has three things: her family, friends and fans. You just wait until a country superstar finds out about her and asks her to go on tour. Heck, don't be surprised if she sings the National Anthem at a Tennessee Titans NFL or Nashville Kats Arena Football game. She's that talented!</i></li>
