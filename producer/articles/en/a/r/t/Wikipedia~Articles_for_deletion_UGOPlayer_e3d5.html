<li><b>Comment</b> Don't you get it? The reason for that is because this is the only article I care about. And I probably understand the site a lot better because I actually was there for about a year or so. I know what the inside things are, I know what the outside things are, and I know how to look at things without bias from there. It makes sense that this would be the only one I care about, because I was probably the most nationalistic (In terms of sites) person there, and probably will be the last one. So yes, 100% of my contibutions are there, and with reason. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.80.168.7 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.80.168.7.html" title="User talk:67.80.168.7">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.80.168.7_907d.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.80.168.7">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>"The insertion of any textual personal biographical information within an article which does not significantly add to the clarity or meaning of the article.

Like, if a person goes on, and sees a site, what would they want? What's it's purpose, how does it meet that purpose, does it have a second part to it (In this can a forum), and in this case, what has happened to that forum in the past. Maybe even what groups and clubs are on that forum. I will get you a poll on a neutral site on whether certain movies are cult or not. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.80.168.7 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.80.168.7.html" title="User talk:67.80.168.7">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.80.168.7_907d.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.80.168.7">contribs</a>) 15:46, February 4, 2006.</small>

<li>Just because it's not about you (I have no way of verifying that, BTW) doesn't mean it's not vanity. The fact that you're writing about something you're involved with is. That said, the problem here isn't mainly vanity, but the fact that the article contains massive amounts of information that is not verifiable and hence should be deleted.

<li>I have one. It's sbloemeke. I just don't use it much. And for your information, I have not been there since last May. It's not vanity to write about something there. And you know what? What is vain in that article? Anything? Give me a reference. Just because you were involved in something doesn't mean that you cannot write in a neutral unvain point of view. Reference something. Anything. Use your own logic. Oh, and if you want, why don't I just quote the number of views with the ratings of the movies/games. There's your source that they are popular.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Do we have precedent on keeping by virtue of Alexa ranking? ie, are we going to have articles on all sites that ever occupy the top 3K?

<li><b>New idea</b> I still advocate for keeping as is, but I will suggest an alternative. The following things would happen:
<ul>
<li>1. The article is labled as a stub</li>
<li>2. The stub is given a neutrality dispute on the top.</li>
<li>3. The article is left as is, or added on to, until references are added.</li>
<li>4.
