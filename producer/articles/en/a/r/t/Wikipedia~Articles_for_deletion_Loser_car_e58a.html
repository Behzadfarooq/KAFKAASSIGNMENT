<p><b>Dont Delete</b>apparently you don't understand. As is said in the artical "not in a insulting manner" this was not an insult to people like you who own the yugo. (if the yugo is a high performer, this is not under the definition of a loser car). I myself drive a Geo Metro which everyone calls a loser car. This is not directed at me, however, this is a comment used by other teenagers/young adults to describe this type of car in general. The term loser car is a used as an adjective to describe all cars that fit the definition I have given. Also if this term is put into Wiktionary (I would appreciate that), yes it is a slang term. Wiktionary is a tool that probably includes more words than any other dictionary. By putting this term into wiktionary misunderstandings (like that of the yugo owner) would clear up. People will understand that this is a term that is gaining popularity and means no insult to them or thier car but is a slang classification for a basic performance compact vehicle.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.140.67.148.html" title="User:69.140.67.148">69.140.67.148</a> (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.140.67.148.html" title="User talk:69.140.67.148">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__69.140.67.148_aa51.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 69.140.67.148">contribs</a>) 21:13, 28 October 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>You guys think im some stupid prank teenager. yes, im 18, but i have written many other good articles. My writing is just as valuble as yours. If you want to see my other articles (which were completely written by me) try looking up <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Jay%2C_CA_2ec9.html" title="Blue Jay, CA">Blue Jay, CA</a>. This isn't done yet, but check out my start. How about <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Potomac_High_School_60f1.html" title="West Potomac High School">West Potomac High School</a>? Others think of it? Maybe 30 years ago you would have understood. This site is a free encyclopedia serving EVERYBODY including teenagers/young adults. Though YOU may have never heard this term this is a part of spoken language for people my age. It is an appropriate article for an encyclopedia. THIS ISN'T JUST ME. THIS ISN'T JUST WHAT THE NOMINATOR THINKS. and about what? I have nothing against geos, kias or yugos(yugos are not loser cars except for the low performance ones). IVE ALREADY SAID I DRIVE ONE!!! I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT MY CAR. I DONT HATE IT. This isn't my opinion. This is a fact. Facts belong in an encyclopedia (or dictionary). Next time someone criticizes my article i want FULL details. I dont want a brief criticism, I want a reason why you say something. This will be more helpful. I am open minded if you give me a good reason why you want me to remove this article i may agree with you and i will. I WANT <b>FULL</b> details. It would be more polite for the nominator to remove it (and i might) than a person who doesn't fully understand <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.140.67.148.html" title="User:69.140.67.148">69.140.67.148</a> (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.140.67.148.html" title="User talk:69.140.67.148">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__69.140.67.148_aa51.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 69.140.67.148">contribs</a>)  02:12, 29 October 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<li>Look, you're not the first person to get annoyed with the brief, often codified debates. Please just understand that this page gets <i>a lot</i> of stuff coming to it, and in order to get the unpleasant task done, a lot of people sort of speed through it. However, I would suggest that you not use all caps to yell us into submission.

<li>Hi, man, slow down. I don't believe anyone thinks you're being insulting, they just think that dictionary definitions belong in Wiktionary, not Wikipedia. I liked your article, I just don't think it's encyclopedic. I hope you'll keep writing lots of articles. Contributors like you are the heart and soul of Wiki. I also wish that people would refrain from harshing on one another's age. It's behaviour that counts, not years. I stand by my vote to delete, and I think if you slow down and take a look at it, you might still disagree with me, but you'll understand my reasoning.

<p><b>From the Writer</b> Thank you very much for your constructive and polite criticisms and the understanding. Im sorry for my rudeness in the last debate article i wrote. I was only responding to the rudeness in the other preceding criticisms. I agree with TECannon about this article being put in Wiktionary. Please, next person suggest it be put into Wiktionary by puting the template on the bottom(so it says on top that this article is being moved to Wiktionary and not this article is being recomended for deletion) I will then remove it from Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. <b>Comment</b> for 69.140.67.148, since you want to discuss your edits, please explain your vandalism to the <a href="../../../y/o/n/Yonex.html" title="Yonex">Yonex</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geo.html" title="Geo">Geo</a> pages. You can also explain Brenco, now on Afd.

</ul>
<p><b>Writer's Response</b>My past criticisms are right i must be more respectful to people like you. Yes I was having fun on Yonex. I was expirimenting you are right. Brenco however is real. I actually know about it by googling my own name. I share my name with a notable buisness man who tried to industrialize turkmenistan after the soviet collapse. Though his efforts failed I think his attempt to develop a third world country is deserving of an encyclopedia article. My "vandalism" to Geo is explainable to me saying the term loser car is real. If you find this offensive i will stop adding that to that page. Please keep googleing Brenco, you have to eventually come across something about the company. However, thank you for your suggestions i understand how you think I made such things as a prank.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> I actually have had my car called a "Loser Car" before. Keep on fighting 69.140.67.148. --<a href="../../../b/p/r/User%7EBPRoy_7b99.html" title="User:BPRoy">User:BPRoy</a></p>
