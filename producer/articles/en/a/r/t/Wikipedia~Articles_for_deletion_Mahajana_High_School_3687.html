<li>It takes only a simple majority or three people to get an article undeleted. The undeletion policy hinges upon the deletion policy. Articles are deleted by the deletion policy, and they are only kept by the deletion policy. In other words, no article's value has ever been or ever will be proven by the fact that it was able to get undeleted. —<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrockert_5ba4.html" title="User:Brockert">Ben Brockert</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrockert_bf66.html" title="User talk:Brockert">(42)</a> <small><small><a href="http://usufructer.livejournal.com/" class="external text" title="http://usufructer.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">UE News</a></small></small> 03:00, May 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b>. It's only a stub rather than a substub because it waffles (its age is vague, that it's been used as a polling station is true of thousands of schools, so is not significant). The article essentially says: "The <b>Mahajana High School</b> is a school in Erode"; that just about qualifies it for speedy deletion. The support for undeletion was based largely on the fact that it was speedily deleted in error (<i>mea culpa</i>), so was procedural not substantive. The claim that most schools are notable is an odd one, but even if I accepted it, there's no indication that this school is one of that majority. If just one of the people who think that it should be kept would actually add some information, then I'd be convinced, and change my vote. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 10:45, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</s>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. That it's a stub is evident, because it correctly identifies the location of the school. The bit about it's supposed age is indeed waffle, but that's not relevant to whether the article is a good school stub--that is to say, an article that defines its subject matter well enough to be expandable by someone who has information about the subject. The claim that undeletion was merely procedural is a falsehood; there was no consensus that the article was deletable in the last vote, it was speedied because someone claimed falsely that no such school existed under that name, and the admin who performed the deletion failed to check that this claim was true.</li>
<li>Finally the statement that an article consisting of "Mahajana High School is a school in Erode" would qualify for speedy deletion is absolutely false. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:55, 15 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>This is the second time that you've presented this false account of events, and it's still just as false as it was the first time that you did. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> laid it all out at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_undeleted_af4f.html#Maha_Jana_High_School" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion/undeleted">Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion/undeleted#Maha_Jana_High_School</a>. It was speedied <i>because it was a redirect</i>, and the undeletion <i>was</i> a procedural one because it was a redirect with editing history and speedied by mistake. In the original VFD discussion it was <i>kept</i> because I said that no such school existed <i>by the name <a href="../../../m/a/h/Maha_Jana_High_School_891c.html" title="Maha Jana High School">Maha Jana High School</a></i>. Indeed, in the original VFD discussion I said that a school under the name <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahajana_High_School_3229.html" title="Mahajana High School">Mahajana High School</a> existed (in <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mysore.html" title="Mysore">Mysore</a>).

<li>Nitpicking. Because of your false claim it was redirected to Erode and then deleted. In essence, the article was mugged.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I still consider the blanket claim that all schools are notable to be absurd, and this school seems to be an ordinary, common-or-garden, bog-standard school of interest to no-one but the local community — but there's enough in the article to raise it above the substub/stub that it was. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 08:40, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Would you take that site as a reference for how to spell "elementary"?

<li>Comment - sneering at people whose first language is not English for a miss-spelling is beneath contempt. The issue is whether we can verify the school's existence, which I can with reference to this electoral site and I have referenced the verification for the benefit of other Wikipedians. I did not write the site and am not responsible for the spelling errors contained within. I did not need a street address, I needed to establish whether there was such a high school in Erode - for my purposes this web reference attests to that fact and also the content of the article referring to the use of the school as a polling booth. There is now a more adequate reference with <i>The Hindu</i> article referred to on the school's wikipedia page. That there are two addresses does not phase me, many institutions operate out of more than one site - for example <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avans_Hogescholen_306c.html" title="Avans Hogescholen">Avans Hogescholen</a>. --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 08:54, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>How much more time do you need? It's been around since <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>-<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2.html" title="November 2">11-02</a> and twice had the attentions of people who have actively tried to expand it. The first time, the article actually <i>shrunk to nothing</i>, as it was discovered that none of the information in it could be verified, not even that a school by the name <a href="../../../m/a/h/Maha_Jana_High_School_891c.html" title="Maha Jana High School">Maha Jana High School</a> existed in Erode. During the VFU discussion it was moved to a different name, <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahajana_High_School_3229.html" title="Mahajana High School">Mahajana High School</a>, but so far the purported evidence that <i>that</i> school merits an article in its own right has in fact demonstrated exactly the opposite. The evidence presented for having an individual article about this school is a long list of schools used as polling stations, which actually shows that it's identical to <i>lots</i> of schools in this respect (probably hundreds of thousands, worldwide), and doesn't stand out from the crowd in any way whatever. Similarly, the ration card news article tells us that "various schools" are used as ration card distribution centres, too. The remaining minutia in the article is in fact about a person named Shri R. Soundara Rajan, and not about the school at all. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>, but the only things that are in this article are: effectively a paraphrase of its directory listing in a (clearly less than 100% reliable, given the number of glaring errors that leap from the page when reading it) list of schools used as polling stations and an paraphrase of its (implied) directory listing in a list of schools used as ration card distribution centres. As a criterion for encyclopaedia-worthiness, the trivium about people being moved into a back yard really <i>is</i> at the level that would establish the infamous shed in my back garden as encyclopaedia-worthy. I find it saddening that the level of desperation to prove a plainly unsupportable assertion has risen to such an extent that people are willing to employ criteria that actually present a significant danger of the shed in my back garden getting an article. It's amazing that <i>even when</i> the prime reference being waved around is a long list of schools about which exactly the same thing can be said, the point that large numbers of schools are identical, and intentionally so (as a matter of public policy in many countries), still seems to be missed, even when it is glaring right in one's face as here. As per <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a>, mention in <a href="../../../e/r/o/Erode.html" title="Erode">Erode</a> that schools are used as polling stations and ration card distribution centres (albeit that the former fact is so general that it could be mentioned in <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_India_0d2c.html" title="Education in India">Education in India</a>) and <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:06, 2005 May 17 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Okay, I usually stay out of these high school debates, but I will make an eception here. The original <i>poor</i> <a href="../../../m/a/h/Maha_Jana_High_School_891c.html" title="Maha Jana High School">Maha Jana High School</a> article was kept, and then improperly deleted (first redirected, then deleted). I was the one who brought the article to VfU as an improper deletion. The current revision of the article is <i>much better</i> than the one at the first VfD debate, and if that one was kept, this one most certainly should be. I recall also <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">User:Postdlf</a>'s comment on the VfU debate, if we can verify that the school exists, undelete and don't list again on VfD. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 07:31, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
