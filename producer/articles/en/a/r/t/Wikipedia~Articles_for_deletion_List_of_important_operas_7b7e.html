I don't think there is any policy on WP that states that adjectives like 'important' require to be specially defined. other than by ordinary dictionary meanings. The page is indeed referenced. Some people regard any list like this one as 'original research' but lists serve various purposes (e.g. introducing the subject and quantifying it etc.) and WP would be the poorer if all lists were removed because of the pedantic interpretation of WP policy. - <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 20:21, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Notable" is an established Wikipedia term of usage. "Important" is not. "Notable" simply means, in Wikipedia parlance, that verifiable sources have <i>noted</i> it.

<dd>The purpose of this discussion is not to assess whether the connection of the text to the sources is as tight as it could be. Wikipedia is full of articles that no one would propose for deletion, that provide a general list of references rather than footnoting every fact. If it should turn out that "important" is truly an unsourced POV, perhaps my vote would change. But as this article appears to represent serious work, my vote is to give the editors a chance to fix what is wrong with it. Deletion is an extreme outcome, which should be reserved for articles that are irredeemable. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Shepherd_cff4.html" title="User:Marc Shepherd">Marc Shepherd</a> 21:05, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> the sources provided are appropriate for the topic. Being <i>referenced</i> does not mean the same thing as having <i>inline citations</i>. An article can be referenced without having inline citations, and I would say the references given are appropriate. The reason the sources are general opera books is because the topic is an important <i>general opera topic</i>. There are two other lists of operas, one including all the operas which have articles on Wikipedia, and one which is working on being a comprehensive list of operas, and this I think cuts down significantly on the POV concerns. The reason I think this list is needed is that the subject of opera is so huge, and the number of operas is so huge, that for a neophyte a list including all of these would be overwhelming, and frankly, not very useful. If a person comes to WP and wants to find an opera, not knowing anything about opera, this list is far more helpful than the list of all the operas or the category system. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 21:39, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> A useful resource for those of us who aren't opera experts. The project should come up with, and state in the introduction, an objective definition of 'important' (eg first example of some trend, frequently performed, critical acclaim, noted in textbooks &amp;c&amp;c) which would remove the criticisms noted above. <a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspresso_Addict_7f98.html" title="User:Espresso Addict">Espresso Addict</a> 21:42, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Many milestones and achievements are documented. Opera is a dying art, so it is useful for those who are not acquainted with it. Important isn't a good word to use in a title, but the article steers clear of POV problems. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 21:49, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> unless the following can be provided: A definition of "important" (which is probably about 60% there already) and (much more importantly) <i>specific</i> citations for the claims being bandied around. To take only the first section as an illustrative example, we have "first operatic masterwork" - says who? "breaks new dramatic and musical ground in a number of ways" - such as? again, says who? "often regarded as Monteverdi's masterpiece" - by whom is it thus regarded? "masterpiece" - says who? "Considered a masterwork" - by whom? And so it goes. If the references are in the general works cited, it shouldn't be hard to footnote them to the text. If they're not there, we've got <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> on our hands here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 22:44, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This was a cooperative effort. The list was limited to about 100 popular and historically significant works spanning the four hundred years of opera development. There was a selection procedure (see the Talk Pages). Regarding your specific questions, the list provides links to the articles on the operas where the information is explained in more detail. There is no original research. Citations in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Grove_Dictionary_of_Opera_e273.html" title="New Grove Dictionary of Opera">Grove</a> could be provided, but providing these at the list level rather than in the individual opera articles would be strange and inappropriate. - <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 23:13, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

It's an (orthodox) explanation/encapsulation of why the opera is popular for an arts encyclopedia entry. It's not an original (or personal) opinion (or research). Comparisons are normal (in the arts) as a way of contextualizing works, movements and events. While we strive for objectivity, some subjectivity will always be present (e.g. deciding to allocate 93 pages to Mozart and 26 to Gluck). - <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleinzach_3112.html" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> 10:47, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> maybe a slight change of title is merited, but there is no doubt that this is well researched and correct.

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem with a name change is that every opera at Category:Operas (500+) is "notable" (a precondition for the individual article's existence). There is already such a list at <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera_corpus.html" title="Opera corpus">Opera corpus</a>. The purpose of the "important" list is to selectively pick operas that are of particular importance in the history of the art (rather than being notable for its occasional contemporary performance or being written by a famous composer). I think the current title makes sense. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireplace_0f6a.html" title="User:Fireplace">Fireplace</a> 13:36, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>By that rationale, I could create List of stupid people as long as I found sources for someone saying each of the people are stupid. But if I chose to include <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W.

<dd>So what makes an opera "important" enough to be on the list, as opposed to the category? All these operas must be relatively important if they have their own articles, obviously. Are you saying I can, and should, take any category - say, Category:Pizzerias - and extrapolate from that, a new list called List of important pizzarias? Important to <i>who</i>? By what criteria?

<li><b>Comment</b> the decision to include anything in a Wikipedia article requires original synthesis. Are you saying that a selective list is always POV? Just because editors are involved in choosing what to include does not make the list inherently POV, because they're basing it on mainstream understandings of the works' significance. I could, for example, if I had a source, add to the Chopin article that his eyes are blue. It might be verifiable and true, but it is no POV not to include it, because it's not important to a person's understanding of Chopin. The same is true of this list -- decisions are made based on what the mainstream understanding of a works significance is. If we completely copied another reference work's list, that would be copyright infringement. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 15:18, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You haven't heard me. It's not just the fact that this is a list. It's an arbitrary list gathered <i>under an opinionated title</i> with vague criteria. I don't see how I can make it any clearer.

<dd>What about List of operas in the standard opera repertory. It may be much easier to reach a more objective consensus on the operas listed from standard sources, and the list would not need any explanations as to why each opera is "important". --<a href="../../../s/s/i/User%7ESsilvers_b573.html" title="User:Ssilvers">Ssilvers</a> 17:22, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>...also, an opera might be historically important without being part of any standard rep. This is true of probably 1/3 of the current list. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireplace_0f6a.html" title="User:Fireplace">Fireplace</a> 18:07, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>The point is to include works which are <i>important</i> for whatever reason for a person's understanding of opera. This includes operas which are considered by some to be "part of the standard repertoire", such as La boheme, or works which show a significant shift in the way operas are written or performed, such as Armide. There is no one criteria which make a work important to the development of opera, but there are agreed-upon benchmarks, and I think it makes sense to have a list which points out these benchmarks. You are right that there must be a certain amount of editorial discretion. You label this as original research, which is a legitimate concern. I would argue that it is original synthesis (there's an essay which needs to be written), based on a reasonable amount of research and accepted truths. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 17:54, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

The solution might be to decide on outside authorities (what are the five or six authorative opera guides?) and stipulate that any opera listed must have a non-trivial entry in all of them. Unlike most other articles that pop up on AfD I see a group of dedicated editors at work here, so I'm hoping the problems raised in this AfD will get a good hearing on the talk page.

<dd>Well, sort of. But what are these authoritative guides? First, there's Opera Grove, which has (I believe) articles on about 1800 operas. Then there are Kobbé and the Viking/Penguin guide (I own the penultimate edition of each). The former contains over 300 operas, the latter well over 1000, although music-theatre works are included as well as operas proper.</dd>
<dd>The list of important operas currently contains around 110 entries. I'm prepared to bet that very nearly all the works currently listed are in all those guides (and, quite likely, in the Rough Guide, too). This might satisfy <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a>, but would it satisfy <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a>? Will we be compelled to add the other 200/900/1700 operas, too?</dd>

<dd>The difference is that we usually leave the choice of sources to editorial discretion, as long as they fulfill that foggy <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">"reliable"</a> criterion. The talk page discussions looked fairly collegial to me, so I'm not too worried that picking the guides will turn into encyclopedic mud wrestling. The other difference is that you can actually make claims of the "considered X's masterpiece" variety if that's the opinion of one or more guides. As it reads now (and by looking at the selection process) it smacks too much of POV &amp; OR. Also, if you find two guides with 300 operas each, but a number of more exhaustive ones, I'm fairly sure that the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intersection_%28set_theory%29.html" title="Intersection (set theory)">intersection</a> of those sources isn't bigger than 150. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 17:11, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
