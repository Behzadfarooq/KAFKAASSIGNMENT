<dd>How is this issue petty? It is scary that Artscroll editors faked photographs of rabbis to make them look like their sterotypes of Haredim.

<dd>How is it hatemongering to discuss Orthodox response to this censorship? Check out the archives of Orthodox Jewish e-mail discussion forums, like Avodah and Mail-Jewish. You will find that they are filled with observant Orthodox Jews who view Torah and sages in the same regard that you do. These forums contain both Orthodox rabbis and laypeople (Mail-Jewish has some Conservative Jews as well, but is mostly Orthodox); Both forums are well-represented by Haredi and Centrist Orthodox voices. I am aware that for anyone not familiar with the controversy, this will be uncomfortable. Artsroll is presented by many as the voice of Orthodox Judaism, so criticism of this one publisher is seen as an attack on Orthodoxy. But it just isn't so. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 14:32, Aug 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is hatemongering because changing the colour of the rabbi's shirt could have been for esthetic purposes. Where was the picture, anyway? There are no colour pictures in his biography, save for the cover. <i>If you don't provide a serious source, this is based on unsubstatiated rumour and fails to pass any standard of encyclopedicity.</i> Your disaffection with Artscroll alone is no valid reason to include this silly, teenager-<i>fähig</i>, nonsensical argument.</dd>

<dd>The disaffection with Artscroll is coming almost entirely from within the Orthodox community. It is isn't silly or nonsensical. You don't fake photograohs of rabbis to make them appear as a sterotype of Haredi Jews, or as a stereotype of Yemenite Jews, or as a sterotype of anyone. If someone at Mesorah feel that a rabbi isn't kosher because of the clothes he wears, and fakes photos, then that is indicative of a serious problem on their part. In the secular academic world, a person who did this in a peer-reviewed journal, or book published by a university press, could be fired for academic dishonesty. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>

<dd>JFW, please do not make this personal. Many people have been misled to believe that Orthodoxy = Artscroll, but that is just not so. Orthodox Judaism existed a long time before the early 1980s, when Artscroll came into existence. The disagreement is about the actions of this one publisher, not on Orthodoxy in specific, or against Judaism in general. This has nothing to do with the desire to fight assimilation. I can assure that the all the Orthodox sources I referenced also fight against assimilation. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>

<p>Most of all, note that <i>none</i> of these critical articles and letters were written by me. They are all from Orthodox sources. Please leave me out of it! Also, virtually no one in Reform or Recon. Judaism cares about the issue, and I don't know of any academic critiques of Artscroll even from within the Conservative movement. This is an inter-Orthodox dispute. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 17:00, Aug 29, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>To be intellectually honest, one has to present the fact that many Mesorah publications are widely accepted and used, even in segments of the non-Orthodox Jewish community. As such, note that I have written a new section for this article about its popular acceptance. Also, I think any criticism should be specific; the criticisms are generally about the biographies and Tanakh commentaries, and not with the Siddurim, Mishnayot, Talmud, etc. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></p>

<dd>The people I keep referencing are not what you make them out to be. Their statements are public, some are even published in the Rabbinical Council of America's <i>Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Thought</i> and in Yeshiva University's <i>The Torah Umadda Journal</i>. These are pro-Orthodox sources, with real names given, and are certainly <i>not</i> anonymous anti-Orthodox attacks! I caution people not to assume that Artscroll Judaism is the one true faith; most Orthodox Jews throughout history have never even heard of Artscroll.

<p>In the item criticizing literalism in Artscroll's translations, I deleted the line: "This is especially in the Songs of Songs where literalism is claimed to reduce the meaning and purpose of the text." This has it backward! Artscroll refuses to provide a literal translation of Shir ha-Shirim, asserting that any such would be unfaithful to the text. Artscroll provides only an allegorical rendering. I'm sure this is controversial, but for the opposite reason. WBcoleman 03:37, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is both a great exaggeration and common misconception to say that <i>"Artscroll refuses to provide a literal translation of Shir ha-Shirim."</i> It is indeed true of the version which appears in the ArtScroll Siddur as the prelude to the Friday evening service, and in my opinion this is perhaps appropriate for that situation, where the intention is recital as liturgy. But a person who is intent on studying the text for its meaning is more likely to be reading either the ArtScroll Tanach or the standalone ArtScroll Shir HaShirim, and in both of those cases, a full and complete literal translation DOES appear in the commentary at the bottom of the page. If you want, quibble over their decision to include it in the commentary at the bottom rather than in the translation above, but it is NOT omitted as many claim. --Keeves 13:42, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I really like the Artscroll translation of everything EXCEPT Shir HaShirim. If King Solomon saw fit to write this the way he did , allegory or not, who are the Artscroll editors to decide they know better? They could have made a true translation, and their interpretation a commentary. Chani 65.74.59.37 09:05, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The translators give reasons. The obvious reason is that apart from Rabbi Akiva all sages wanted it hidden because the erotic metaphors are easily misunderstood. This is editorial policy, and in line with what ArtScroll's readership would want. I will not elaborate on the incident of Rav Raphael Breuer. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 21:53, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have edited the page so as to bring out that the Artscroll Tanach gives Rashi's allegorical rendering, not the literal translation. It is true that the footnotes give the literal translation, but that makes the text so fragmented that you cannot read it in sequence, and you lose the poetic power of the book. I accept that the eroticism of Shir haShirim may be a problem for orthodox Jewry, but I still find this deviation from the original text a shortcoming of this otherwise superb edition of Tanach.

<p>So far, we've managed to debate the question whether the editorial staff of Artscroll-Mesorah are revisionists and falsificators or dedicated publishers with noble aims. RK is forcefully of the opinion that this is revisionism, and uses individual criticism <i>by individuals</i> aimed <i>at individual publications</i> to draw generalisations.<br />
While I do not claim to be able to read his mind, I am getting the impression that RK does not understand the process of criticism. I <i>refuse</i> to read mailinglist archives. The discussions that have raged on these mailinglists <i>do not pertain</i> (unless, of course, they quote an officially stated criticism, in which case you should insert a direct quote). <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a></p>

<dd>It is a <i>fact</i> that many Orthodox Jews are upset with Artscroll. JFW denies that this is true, yet refuses to read these lists...becasue that would prove that the claim is true. If anyone questions the veracity of these statements, then they can simply see for themselves. Go to a Jewish library and check out the various editions of the books that are made (note that the books in question had multiple editions!) Further, see the discussions in Orthodox journals such as <i>The Torah Umadda Journal</i>. I don't understand this apparent attack on the honesty of these writers. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>

<p>If it is a <i>fact</i>, then it should be easy enough to show without resorting to unreliable sources like mailing list archives.

<dd>That is certainly true. As such, I just took a trip to the JTS library and photocopied a dozen articles, one of which is relevant to this topic. (And other mostly unrelated Judaism topics that I am doing reading on.) The relevant paper is "Haskalah, Secular Studies and the Close of the Yeshiva in Volozhin in 1892", by Rabbi Dr. Jacob J. Schacter, <i>The Torah U-Madda Journal</i>, Volume Two, 1990 (p.76-133.) He discusses the printing and recall of <i>My Uncle, the Netziv</i>, which was first issued in May 1988 by Mesorah Publications, Ltd., but recalled due to a letter rejecting its sue by the Lakewood Cheder School, on July 7, 1988, by its executive director, Rabbi Baruch Manes. Manes sent a letter to everyone who had received a copy of the book, accusing it of not correctly portraying "the...hashkafos, kedusha and yiras shamayim" of the Netziv. Rabbi Jacob J. Schacter writes:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What was it in this work by the author of the <i>Torah Temimah</i> that was found to be so objectionable? Which aspects of it do not "correctly portray the...hashkafos, kedusha and yiras shamayim" of the Netziv to the extent taht it was deemed inappropriate to read? Was it his description of "my uncle's habit of reading the weekly newspapers even on Shabbat and discussin curent events at the Shabbat take? (1) Was it his noting that the Netziv had secular books in his library? (2) Some have suggested that the opposition to the work was based on R. Epstein's statement in the name of his uncle that had the Rambam studied Torah with a group of scholars, instead of by himself, he would have avoided any number of errors he made in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>? (3) Perhaps it was this acknowledgement that the Rambam simply erred in his <i>pesak halakhah</i> that made some people feel uncomfortable. In all probability, as the context of the Lakewood Cheder School letter indicates, their reconsideration was related to Rabbi Epstein's assertion that at one point the Netziv <i>did</i> permit secular studies in Volozhin and allowed the yeshiva to be closed only in 1892 when submitting to the escalating demands of the Russian authorities would have changed its entire character. (4) This apparently ran contrary to the tradition accepted by Gedolei Torah referred to in the letter that the Netzviv had made "his decision to close the doors of his famed Volozhiner yeshiva rather than introducing secular studies into its program." (5) [p.78]</dd>

<p>Okay, let's carry on but stop threading questions and answers. The <i>homo religiosus</i> question goes to the heart of the issue and may explain our differences in opinion.<br />
I never said that non-Haredi sources are not valid. Quite the opposite. I'm simply annoyed that you advance [Non-Haredi] Orthodox sources as somehow more valid than Non-Orthodox ones in criticism of Haredim.<br />
I have explained my refusal to read mailing list archives - they're like smalltalk overheard at a petrol station. I will not let myself be influenced by opinions of individuals voiced on public fora. I expect you to extract the relevant information if you'd like it to be appraised in this debate! You still haven't told me if there are differences between the various editions of "My Uncle the Netziv", and I'm getting very suspicious that these differences do not exist in the proportion you're presenting them. Similarly, the photo doctoring claims can be put down to paranoia until this speculative mumble can be buttressed with facts.<br />
So you claim to speak on behalf of the Orthodox readers of some mailing lists that you've subscribed to. Again, these are not sources worthy of inclusion into Wikipedia (unless individual participants happen to have some public standing that makes them authoratitive).<br />
I apologise if I've managed to offend you with certain comments, but I'm getting disgusted with this discussion and it's an utter waste of time. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 14:23, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Orthodox Rabbi B. Barry Levy writes that "Artscroll is full of errors" in his article in <i>Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought</i>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>what is perhaps most astonishing is the number of plain, old-fashioned mistakes. The translations are frequently accompanied by notes recording the "literal" meanings of words or phrases which have been rendered into idiomatic English. Much of the time these "literal" translations are possible meanings of these words in other contexts or dialects of Hebrew. In their present contexts the literal translations are often misleading, if not totally wrong, and create the impression that the editors would have preferred less accurate translations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Diqduq (grammar) is anathema in many Jewish circles, but the translation and presentation of texts is, to a large extent, a philological activity and must be philologically accurate. Again, the Artscroll effort has not achieved a respectable level. There are dozens of cases where prepositions are misunderstood, where verb tenses are not perceived properly and where grammatical or linguistic terms are used incorrectly. Words are often vocalized incorrectly.</dd>

<dd>These observations, it should be stressed, are not limited to the Bible text but refer to the talmudic, midrashic, targumic, medieval and modern works as well. Rabbinical passages are torn out of their contexts, presented in fragmentary form to enable distortion of their contents, emended to update their messages even though these new ideas were not expressed in the texts themselves, misvocalized, and mistranslated: i.e. misrepresented.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>...How these errors have managed to escape the eyes of the many sages whose approbations adorn the volumes may seem somewhat puzzling, but again, it is the presentation of these letters - the Madison Avenue blitz - which makes these documents what they are . Anyone who reads these "approbations"...will see that the rabbis who wrote the letters did not read the commentaries themselves. These letters are more like personal good wishes, character references and the like than testimonies to the work's accomplishments.</dd>

<p>Under prevalence, I've added some notes on the recent completition of Artscroll's Schottenstein Talmud. I would appreciate it if this can somehow be expanded into a full fledged section (as it has been noted as a major event in most Jewish Newspapers) or if at the least it could be clarified with additional facts. Hopefully, what I've added is just a start. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpaceFalcon2001_2983.html" title="User:SpaceFalcon2001">SF2K1</a></p>

<dd>I agree that information about Schottenstein Talmud should be expanded. It may even warrant its own article. I am new to Wikipedia, so here is what I propose for the time being. I would rather not add the section to the article right now as I have never edited an article, and would like some feedback before I add anything. Much of the information comes from the introductions to the <i>Schottenstein Talmud Bavli</i> folios, from <i>The Creation of the Schottenstein Edition Talmud Bavli</i>, and from my own experiences with the Schottenstein Family, studying <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemara.html" title="Gemara">Gemara</a>, and at the Siyum dinner. It is a little technical, so please let me know of anything that is irrelevant or needs further explanation. I also state below that the upcoming Schottenstein Jerusalem Talmud will be the first English translation of this work. (I am not sure if that is totally true.) Please let me know what you think:

<dd>===Schottenstein Edition Talmud===</dd>
<dd><i>Mesorah</i> has a line of <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mishnah.html" title="Mishnah">Mishnah</a> translations and commentaries, and followed up with a line of <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylonian_Talmud_e932.html" title="Babylonian Talmud">Babylonian Talmud</a> translations and commentaries, The Schottenstein Edition of The Talmud Bavli (Babylonian Talmud). These have received widespread acclaim throughout the Orthodox community, and are also used by many non-Orthodox Jews. In late 2004, the final volume was published, giving a 73 volume English edition of the entire Talmud, only the second complete translation of the Talmud into English. The total cost of the project was $21 million, most of which was contributed by private donors and foundations. Some volumes have up to 2 million copies in distribution, while more recent volumes have only 90,000 copies currently printed. A completed set was dedicated on February 9, 2005, to the Library of Congress, and the <a href="../../../s/i/y/Siyum.html" title="Siyum">siyum</a> (completion dinner) was held on March 15, 2005, the 13th <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahrzeit.html" title="Yahrzeit">yahrzeit</a> of Jerome Schottenstein, at the New York Hilton.</dd>

<dd>The first volume, Tractate Makkos, was published in 1990, and dedicated by Mr. and Mrs. Marcos Katz. Jerome Schottenstein was introduced to the publication committee shortly thereafter. He began by donating funds for the project in memory of his parents Ephraim and Anna Schottenstein one volume at a time, and later decided to back the entire project. When Jerome passed away, his children and widow, Geraldine, rededicated the project to his memory in addition to those of his parents. The goal of the project was to, "open the doors of the Talmud and welcome its people inside."</dd>

<dd>The text generally consists of two side-by-side pages: one of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic.html" title="Aramaic">Aramaic</a>/<a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> Vilna Edition text, and the corresponding page consists of an <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> translation. The English translation has a bolded literal translation of the Talmud's text, but also includes un-bolded text clarifying the literal translation. (The Talmud's text is often very unclear, referring to places, times, people, and laws that it does not explain. The un-bolded text explains these situations to name a few. The text of the Talmud also contains few prepositions, articles, etc. The un-bolded text also takes the liberty of inserting these parts of speech.) The result is an English text that reads in full sentences with full explanations, while allowing the reader to distinguish between direct translation and a more liberal approach to the translation. (This also results in one page of the Vilna Talmud requiring several pages of English translation.) Below the English translation appear extensive notes including diagrams from sources ancient to modern.</dd>

<p>Unless the ArtScroll/Slifkin incident is properly referenced, I am tempted to regard this as dirty laundry and remove it. Who organised the "public pressure"?

<p>As far as I can tell, the "S" is always upper-case in every single ArtScroll publication.</p>
<p>I'll admit that most people -- myself included -- have a tendency to spell it with the lower-case "s", but I think this is mere laziness or ignorance, and is incorrect in either case.</p>
<p>Therefore, I propose changing the title of this page from "Artscroll" to "ArtScroll". Any objections? --Keeves 20:33, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I think the ArtScroll website itself is reasonable support for this assertion.

<p>I removed it earlier, anon put it back in. This is a pretty serious allegation! Admittedly, as a Chareidi Jew, I am not neutral here. BUT: if you're going to throw around serious allegations such as this one, they <i><b>have to be</b></i> supported by examples and sources for obvious reasons. Until and unless they are, they cannot be in this article. If anon, or anyone else wishes to talk this over further, feel free to write to me on my talk page (if anon, let me know where to respond). An attempt to put it back in w/o explanation or support will be met with resistance. - <font color="blue"><strong><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">the.crazy.russian</a> <a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">(T)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crzrussian_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crzrussian">(C)</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">(E)</a></strong></font> 23:32, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Citing those who disagree with ArtScroll's approach because it is Haredi is innapropriate in the article. Such citations do not constitute criticism but rather general disagreements with Haredi Hashkafah.

<p>Content and translation issues aside, I don't think that the article emphasizes what a key role in the success of the ArtScroll siddur was played its beauty and <i>usability</i>, especially in contrast to it's competitors in the '80s. This article is incomplete until the words "layout" and "order" are included, which were such great contributors to the success of the Siddur. References on this subject would be welcome. Say what you like about the translation; as a tool for helping people say the "right" thing at the right time, it remains a landmark creation. -<a href="../../../v/o/n/User%7EVonfraginoff_acc0.html" title="User:Vonfraginoff">Vonfraginoff</a> 14:43, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
