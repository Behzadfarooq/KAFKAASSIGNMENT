<p>This person is listed as the author of several books, but of the two where the publisher isn't listed as unknown, one is a church, and one is "Pentland Press". If that's Pentland Press, Inc. of North Carolina (there was apparently a UK publisher named Pentland Press that went into liquidation) the only information I can find about the publisher is its imprint Ivy House, which describes its "mission" as "to offer an investment-based program, whereby an author has every chance of financial recuperation. You would fully invest in the first edition of the publication."<a href="http://www.ivyhousebooks.com/index.php?pid=publish" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ivyhousebooks.com/index.php?pid=publish" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I'm sure this was written by someone who thought Dr. Kring was a wonderful person, and you know what? I'm sure they were <i>right</i>, I'm sure he was a great guy. But being a great guy, and being notable enough to merit an entry in an encyclopedic, are different things. If the greatest claim to the subject's encyclopedic notability is having some books privately printed, which it currently appears to be, that's not really enough. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 03:36, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have added the author's book, <i>Herman Melville's Religious Journey</i>. It is indeed published by the known vanity publisher Pentland Press, NC, there is no indication that its theses were ever recognized anywhere, and for what it's worth, its Amazon sales rank is 1,504,475. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 14:00, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>His claim to fame is also in his pottery which was shown at the World's fair, and for the 'Kring Red' Glaze he invented as well as his work on Hermen Melville. He was a Minister for most his life and was in the Navy during 2 major battles as a Chaplain. I will edit the wiki when I can get more information. I also have alot of his books he published here, that I will need to dig out to get the ISBN and publisher, the information on the wiki now is just what I could find on web. Thank you for the book information, I will update his complete works ASAP and I agree that his published works should be at the bottom of the page. This is my first page I have done, so some help would be appreciated. He was also involved with the 'Timothy Leary Acid Tests'. I will need to get information about this, but he also had some influence in the NYC area regarding 'Malcom X' and the 'Black Panther' movement of the 60's. I also have the audio version of his funeral service on MP3. Zothip</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The above post is by Zothip, the author of the page in question. Please sign your comments (four tildes). Also, there is nothing rude about the nominator's comments, IMHO. He simply pointed out that, while the subject may be a decent human being who had an impact on the lives of some, the information is not worthy of encyclopedic entry here at Wikipedia. (As per my vote above, I agree. I must also point out that the additional information you provided above does not make it more so, either.) --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 07:24, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Why? <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herman_Melville_9326.html" title="Herman Melville">Herman Melville</a> is encyclopedically notable; there is little question about that. But notability is not transitive; one does not automatically become notable just by writing about Melville. Also, in regards to your now-removed statement that you would like to tell me "where to go <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum" rel="nofollow">shove it!</a>" I will say two things: first of all, how in your mind would it be possible for <i>anyone</i> to raise <i>any</i> question about whether this person is encyclopedically notable, without you assuming that the question is so "rude" that it fully justifies you being so very rude in return? secondly, please read <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>; if you intend to stay and contribute to Wikipedia, you will have to do so in a manner befitting a mature adult. No, merely saying "I would <i>like to</i> attack you with rude anatomical insults" is not a way around this rule. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:58, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm sure they were <i>right</i>, I'm sure he was a great guy." So, yes! Black is white, up is down, freedom is slavery, and calling someone a wonderful person is attacking them!
