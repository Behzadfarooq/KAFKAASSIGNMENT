<p>Creator of article keeps restoring unsourced and off-topic information, but when you remove the cruft, this non-notable article is nothing but a one-sentence stub. "Music of South Florida" hasn't been demonstrated to deserve an article all its own, and the creator seems intent on making this a vanity article that promotes persons, styles, slang, etc. which do not fall under the topic. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:48, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep per Captaintruth below!</b>. The article can be greatly expanded, give it a stub tag and give the article some time to grow. Actually, I'm not the creator of this article - but I am seeing if I can source this article properly. I've asked for some time to do so, but Wikipediatrix seems to be a bit impatient. When this article was created, I along with several other editors, assisted a new editor in some technical aspects of creating this particular article. I think there may be some value to this one, and I'm trying to explore the background of this particular music scene. I think this article may be something that can be sourced and expanded like the article on <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_rap.html" title="Southern rap">Southern rap</a>, which has sections on "spirituality" "typical features" and things besides just the music. I think it's an interesting article on a regional social style and should be given a chance. <s>Perhaps it needs a change of title?

<dd><b>Comment</b>. In the small amount of investigation I’ve been able to pursue over the past few days while I recover from surgery, it looks like South Florida, specifically Miami, is a major, innovative and unique hotspot for music from the State of Florida. I think I understand what <a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatience561_0223.html" title="User talk:Patience561">User talk:Patience561</a> was trying to say and I don’t think <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Florida_c3c9.html" title="Music of Florida">Music of Florida</a> quite does the southern region of Florida justice. I believe there may be sufficient material for “Music of South Florida” to have its own article. With the heavy influence of Cuban and Latino music added to the innovative and unique Rap style of the area, further mixing in southern rock, and a country heritage that brings a unique blend of sounds out of the southern Florida region, it looks like a “Music of South Florida” article could be rich with interesting and unique information.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Now that Captaintruth has begun expanding and sourcing the article, I think we should take the suggested course of action, keep the article, give it a stub tag and allow it time to grow.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I understand your desire to clean up and save this article. From the history, it looks as if you have been fighting this battle largely on your own since the other main editor stopped tending the page in July. Maybe a change of title would help the article more than a tone of work. The AfD will be open for several days (at least 5 in most cases) which should give you a bit of time to work on it. The AfD nomination will also bring quite a bit of support from Wikipedia Inclusionists who will help you clean up the article. I'll do some poking around on my own to see what support I can give you. In the mean time, I'll hold off judgement by changing my proposed delete to an undecided. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 17:25, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I changed my vote to keep the article now that I see it is starting to shape up and has more significant material. I further agree that it should keep going in the direction it is going but I also feel other editors should get involved so this does not turn into a one man show. There are certainly other editors who know about the music of the area and the people who make it happen.

Can we discuss the article on it's talk page? I'm looking for sources, but my time is limited. I'm recovering from major surgery and don't really have the stamina to sit in front of the computer too long just yet. Bad timing....:) What should the title be changed to? How do do I do that? Create a new article and move the contents of this one, or ask an admin to change it? Suggestions on a new title are welcome! Looks like the "Donk Donk" content is easily sourcable...what are your thoughts on a title based on Donk..:) Many thanks to you and Bobby both for your offers of help!

<li><b>Comment</b>. That’s an interesting suggestion, <b>Tuf-Kat</b>. The origin of the article “Music of South Florida" actually stems from a suggestion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Patience561&amp;diff=65018835&amp;oldid=64890500" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Patience561&amp;diff=65018835&amp;oldid=64890500" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> in July that it be created if the editor found <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Florida_c3c9.html" title="Music of Florida">Music of Florida</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Rap_536b.html" title="Southern Rap">Southern Rap</a> to be either too restrictive or too broad.

<li>But <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Florida_c3c9.html" title="Music of Florida">music of Florida</a> is not too broad for the content here. There's plenty of space, and it would fit right in. Then, per <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a>, if South Florida-related content got to dominate <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Florida_c3c9.html" title="Music of Florida">music of Florida</a>, an appropriate subarticle could be created. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 03:11, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> and apply stub tag. South Florida has made outsized musical contributions (Jimmy Buffett, the Miami Bass sound, hub for latin music to provide a few examples). Thus, there is plenty of good content with which to populate this page.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It's a no-brainer (at least to me) that since Miami is in South Florida, most of the info about Florida music in general would logically be here. The question is, is there a reason to differentiate this from the non-existent article Music of North Florida? For example, even though most of the notable music scene of Illinois is in Chicago, we don't place it in an article called Music of North Illinois. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 15:59, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. IMHO, it's simple, because South Florida is such an incredibly robust music scene, so completely different than the rest of Florida that it truly is a no-brainer that it should have it's own article - a concept well covered under <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a> - because there is no doubt that the information on the South Florida music scene would dominate "Music of Florida". As far as I can see, this in no way requires the creation of a “Music of North Florida” to “differentiate” the two. "Music of Florida" <i>itself</i> should also be expanded to include older and broader music history of the state. There's nothing in Illinois to compare to it. Please let us enthusiastically expand both <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_South_Florida_ac31.html" title="Music of South Florida">Music of South Florida</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Florida_c3c9.html" title="Music of Florida">Music of Florida</a>. You can revisit them a month or two from now and see if they deserve life or extinction. What's the rush? <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlocke_8280.html" title="User:Dreadlocke">Dreadlocke</a> <small><a href="../../../d/r/e/User_talk%7EDreadlocke_6c29.html" title="User talk:Dreadlocke"><span class="Unicode">☥</span></a></small> 18:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>There is plenty of notable music info re North Florida. For example, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Morrison_e018.html" title="Jim Morrison">Jim Morrison</a> is from <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daytona_Beach%2C_Florida_1bd6.html" title="Daytona Beach, Florida">Daytona Beach, Florida</a> and Lynyrd Skynyd is from the <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacksonville%2C_Florida_dcd8.html" title="Jacksonville, Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>. I am sure that there are numerous country stars from the area that some research would reveal. As for Central Florida, ever heard of the whole boy band craze of the 90s? The fact of the matter is that South Florida is quite distinct culturally from the rest of the state and its musical flavor (carribean and latin influences, urban edge, etc.) reflect this distinction. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a> 20:10, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
