<p>Turkish suffixes may be the problem that prevents a healthy google search. Search instead for "adamolmaz," "adam olmaz," or "adam olmazlar." The "lar" at the end of the word simply makes a word plural. Languages like English or Chinese are very analytic, and analytic languages have an advantage for internet searches. Synthetic languages like Latin or agglutinating languages such as Japanese or Turkish don't do so well because the root of the word, which is what you find in the dictionary, is not used by itself; suffixes are added onto it.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I was able to verify that some of the names given in the article are, in fact, academics in mathematics and philoshopy. I am not sure why a negative Google search would be evidence of a hoax. More likely a non-notable "movement" which could be kept as a stub or deleted if unverifiable (by Google or other reference). <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 22:38, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

I have a newspaper article which is copyright March 3, 1954, but I cannot publish it without permission from the Chicago Tribune. I see a simuliar article pertaining to the Motorcycle Club - The Hells Angels - which I see as a biased opinion against the motercycle club. I will accept all opinions and concerns. I am not on Wikipedia to be a tyrant! Starry, if you think that the Gaylords are a myth, go back to the page and click on the external links concerning gang research for Chicago. In the section on Latino gangs, <a href="http://www.gangresearch.net/ChicagoGangs/latinkings/lkhistory.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gangresearch.net/ChicagoGangs/latinkings/lkhistory.html" rel="nofollow">Latino Gang beginnings</a> which states half way down that the Gaylords were around in the 1930s and 1940s, the only white gang listed.

<li><s>It's not that they don't exist, the question is are they notable and well known enough in the greater community to deserve an article.

<li>First of all Mr. Butera, much as I like your choice of font, you clearly have a vested interest in the article (since you're the only one who has made contributions to it, and it is one of your few contributions to Wikipedia), and thus you should say so up front. Second, I am not doubting the the existence of the gang, and I am not saying they are a myth. The point is that they are not notable enough for inclusion in an encyclopedia.</li>

<li>I copied your font. Yes, I am new to the forum. Yes, I do not have many, if any, other contributions to the forum. I hope that you took the time to look up the references that I added to this discussion. If so, you would see that the Gaylords are more than Chicago related spam, but a well known street gang. The research I have done has been used by U of I - Chicago and the Gang Research foundation. I was following the guidelines that I saw being used by another gang related entry - the Insane Popes. Included in the Insane Pope entry, the Gaylords were given credit as the largest white Chicago street gang. I hope that this debate is about the content and not bias against street gang material on this forum, because street gangs are a part of US history whether we want to accept it or not. The fact that a book <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?TTL=Lords+of+Lawndale&amp;userid=O24aw0EALO" class="external text" title="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?TTL=Lords+of+Lawndale&amp;userid=O24aw0EALO" rel="nofollow">Lords of Lawndale</a> and a documentary <a href="http://gaylords712.com/glcsac.html" class="external text" title="http://gaylords712.com/glcsac.html" rel="nofollow">Documentary</a> would give the subject matter some kind of credibility.

<p>Do not delete gaylord.We are alive and well.Ask any adult Chicagoan,born,raised here and they'll tell you what a gaylord is.Hey Saberwyn,appreciate your opinion,but just what is your true motivation?player712 www.gaylords712.com Hey Starry eyes, I also appreciate your opinion but the Records page needs your attention. Joe Butera,Good Job.We'll see to it Gaylords stays put.The point is The Gang is "notable eneugh" for inclusion in an encyclopedia.Apparently Mr.Butera &amp; I are'nt the only ones that think so ,considering GAYLORD was included prior to our "contribution".</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Delete this after I just found it?! No way. I grew up in Chicago in the sixities, and the Gaylords were a part of the street scene no matter where you went. Now that I'm forced to be an adult, and have to travel for a living, it's amazing the number of people I come into contact with who are interested in "Greaser" culture, and who are aware of the Gaylords as purveyors of same.</p>
<p>Please, you have to look at this in the context of the times, and through the same lens as those who would be searching for them. Certainly, a word as common as "gaylord" will have numerous hits in any search, but then, most any word that isn't inherently exclusive will. The Gaylords, whether viewed from California or Chicago, are simply iconic. To delete them because of a misperception that they aren't universally known would be a mistake. To equate them with the Hell's Angel's M.C. would be a mistake. No member of the Almighty Gaylords has ever been indicted or convicted of racketeering, which is a claim the H.A.M.C. can't make. I believe that what you say when you say that they don't have the same name recognition factor as the H.A.M.C. is that they aren't as infamous, aren't as titillating as the Angels are.</p>

Hi, I am one of the workers who is a member of the BC Rich Archive. WE offer afree information sewrvice to anyone who requests it. We do not make money, we do not take money. We offer free services for those who request data from us on these vintage instruments which are becoming rarer every day.</p>
<p>There are very few people on het planet that can offer the info we provide, even BC Rich themselves cannot offer the info we provide in most cases.</p>
<p>I see no reason why this page should be deleted, however it is quite anoying that hackers keep interfering and editing our information.</p>
<p>Thanks. demonx</p>

I appreciate what the Archive is trying to do, but there are very clear rules against creating articles that are attempts to correspond with people, even for non-profit reasons.

Lvr, What I suggest is to delete all Franco-Belgian comic artists from the page and give a link to the main article: <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franco-Belgian_comics_e626.html" title="Franco-Belgian comics">Franco-Belgian comics</a>. However, not all Belgian comic artists have connections with France, especially Flemish comic artists. Therefore there is a need for this page, though it's still very underdeveloped. Perhaps we could make here a short introductory page about Belgian comics, referring to the differences between Belgian comics (Flemish comics, Walloon/Brussels' comics, Franco-Belgian comics, other cooperation), each different type linked to the main page.

<li><b>Keep</b> Bill Murray got a Best Actor nomination for the character and, though he didn't win the Oscar, was the pick of most critics. Charlotte is really the only other significant character in the movie, so a character list, as per above, is not needed, and I definitely think that an article that focuses on him is at least worthy of a place on a page outside the main article. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFraghappy_c2ef.html" title="User:Fraghappy">Frag</a> 05:26, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - Because there are so many chants in Major League Baseball, one article should be made to feature such entries, like <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_chants.html" title="Football chants">Football chants</a>.

<li>The user who created the article did so to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>, apparently to counter the <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yankees_Suck_b732.html" title="Yankees Suck">Yankees Suck</a> article. On first glance, it might seem like he has a point, however, upon further inspection, the Yankees Suck article is not just about a chant, but also about the heavily merchandised regional phenomenon, which stands in stark contrast to both the Boston Sucks chant and article. As a Red Sox fan living in New York City, I can tell you from first hand experiece that letting one and all know that "Boston Sucks", especially in the presence of a Red Sox fan, at times may seem like legit hobby vociferously employed at random moments by less tactful New Yorkers - however, as it stands, it's just a sports chant, and just an insult, a barely notable one at that.

<li>You completely misunderstand my intention. I, as the creator of the article, am also a Red Sox fan who lives in New York City. The reason I created this article was because I saw that a <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yankees_Suck_b732.html" title="Yankees Suck">Yankees Suck</a> article existed and hadn't been deleted, so I tried my hand at making a Boston Sucks article.

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> I originally created the article, and I feel that although it could most certainly do with being expanded and more useful information being added (as many people have done so excellantly already), it should not be deleted as there is much more to be said than just what has already been stated on the pages for "cardboard" and "box". For example, the appearance of cardboard boxes in contemporary art such as the new "Embankment" exhibition at the Tate Modern in London. 80.42.140.213 09:37, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ol>
<li>Per G1 as patent nonsense, as it is clearly "so completely and irredeemably confused that no intelligent person can be expected to make sense of it." The Dallas Tariff was indeed a <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/813/000049666/" class="external text" title="http://www.nndb.com/people/813/000049666/" rel="nofollow">real historical event</a> in 1816, involving <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Clay_7415.html" title="Henry Clay">Henry Clay</a>. It was basically a <a href="http://webroots.org/library/usahist/fotu0005.html" class="external text" title="http://webroots.org/library/usahist/fotu0005.html" rel="nofollow">protectionist tariff</a>, but it had nothing whatsoever to do with dead babies.</li>
<li>Per A6 as disparagement, as this article seems to have been created in bad faith to insult a historical event. Someone created a wikilink to the Tariff in the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Clay_7415.html#Protectionism" title="Henry Clay">Henry Clay</a> article, which has been the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henry_Clay&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henry_Clay&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">target of a heck of a lot of vandalism recently</a>. Why do I have a feeling that someone failed their history test because of the Dallas Tariff and is lashing out at their teacher?</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Fellow brothers they are trying to delete our chapter Wiki entries under the belief that they are non-notable. if you wish to also join in on the good fight please come post in the Alpha Epsilon Zeta Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega entry. i am trying my best to defend our ideals by defending our chapter wiki's, i am doing this in hopes that it will help defend our organization's ideals and principles and spread our message of friendship, leadership, and service. by no means Tregoweth take this as something hostile, i am a firm believer in talking things out and dealing with things in a calm manner. i am doing this in the hopes to pursuade you in letting our chapter wiki's stay. besides i know just from hitting the random article link that there are better fish to fry out there. thanks for your time.<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButterbean04_eea7.html" title="User:Butterbean04">Butterbean04</a> 02:39, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Not all chapters have their own entries - only notable ones. Being that Alpha Phi Omega is not a traditional fraternity (in the Animal House image) - it's a service fraternity - many of the chapters that are notable have made a great impact on their campuses and communities. Delta, for instance (referenced here) cared for the university's mascot for <b>40 years</b>, and erected many significant monuments on Auburn's campus. If a single person had made such an impact, he/she most certainly would warrent an article of their own. Why should it matter if it was an organization? Taking into account the accomplishments of some of the notable chapters, I challenge those of you voting to delete for provide a more concrete reason than simple stating 'fratcruft'.

<li><b>Keep</b> First off, I am not a member of this organization. However, seeing it on the VfD list, and having grown up in the state of Alabama, I immediately thought: "interesting, that's the big service organization up at Auburn U. that does a lot of good stuff and maintained the live Eagle mascot many years until Federal Law made it unallowable for any other than a federal organization to maintain live eagles". And the article has those references, so good. Simply because this service organization uses a Greek letter designation, does not make it a "frat". If the group instead called itself the "Auburn Order of the Eagle" or "Auburn Service Organization", these "fratcruft" comments would no longer apply. The issue should be the content, not the Greek letters. The content is reasonable, the organization has a long history. (Which is probably indicated by the chapter being designated "Delta" I would assume...)

<li><b>Keep</b>; maybe remove the "leading" in the name of NPOV, till someone can come up with figures showing how they rank compared to whatever their competition is, but they do seem to be significant enough to warrant an article.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The comic is rather notable, and the saying "due to a lack of funds required to finance further printing" refers to the original incarnation of the comic BEFORE it became a webcomic. That comment did not refer to it's current online status, but only in it's original published form. (which was reprinted for the comic's historical reasons) That comment was meant to describe a footnote in the comic's pre-history as a published book that was privatly printed one year before, and was cancelled around December of 2003. <i>Not</i> the webcomic version, which was created the following Janurary and currently continues to receive many hits and pageveiws. In addition to the comic, the author is a well known font creator whose comic is almost that of the same reputation. You clearly misunderstood the "lack of funds" comment to mean something that you assumed. Therefore I vote the comic to stay for the reason of a misunderstanding by Dragonfiend. - TheNewX October 2005
<ul>
<li>I agree that Dragonfiend may have mis-stated that part of the nomination, but the fact remains that we have no evidence of "many hits and page views" or other notability. Can you cite a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">source</a> with some kind of indication of notability? You might see the <i>proposed</i> guideline <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> for the sort of things that we might look for. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 02:13, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Also, i'd like to note that someone keeps defacing this page, with the first defacing being the removal of my nomination and replacing it with nonsense text and the constant repeating of the number 6 by a user with the IP of 152.163.100.138.

<li>I would like to respectfully add that when I created this page, I was unaware of the standards for adding an article of this variety.

<ul>
<li>Sorry if my AfD was confusing on the note about financing further printing. My intended point was that one could consider a webcomic moving into print as a sign of notability, but a print comic moving to the web due to financial trouble is a likely sign of lack of sales and therefore an indicator of non-notability. (Which of course may have as much or more to do with the economic climate as it does with the quality of comics themselves). Thanks to those that helped clarify my statement, and thanks to User:4.156.144.241 for being gracious and understanding while watching one of your first articles go through the AfD process. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 09:02, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, with apologies. I take the evidence presented at face value, but I do not think the comic is notable enough <i>yet</i> to warrant inclusion in the encyclopedia.

<p>I've had to add the deletion template back, as it was reverted. This article is complete garbage. Take a look at the history.

<li>It is actually very much significant to the storyline. The card itself, yeah it's not worth its own entry, but as an item within the MTG storyline category, it certainly deserves to be there. The story of the Brothers' War -- ending with the use of the Sylex, is something of the creation myth for the Magic storyline. <b>Keep</b>Vestdan 11:20 30 October 2005</li>

<li>You know it amazes me, an entire plethora of people jum p to the conclusion that an article should be deleted for the reason that it surpases the knowledge level of the reader. Looking at the prepositions for deletion thus far, the individuals proposing this articles deletion are all software designers or liberal arts specialists. Being a microbiologist in the Pacific Northwest (Seattle), I can attest to the truth of the existence of the Hexopedic cuniculus. At the Oceanic Biologist Conference last year, the hexopedic cuniculus was the main item for discussion. Over the 4 day retreat in Harrison British Columbia, Canada, that we decided it was worth preserving this genetic abnormality. It was decided at the end of the conference to encourage highschools in Canada to preserve this modified rodent.</li>

<dd>Yes, this page needs work; however, this is not a hoax. Having observed the hexopedic cuniculus in slide shows and video, i can attest to it being a real animal.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think that the kid is a newb, but the article does have some benifits to it. There is some evidence on Google that it is more than intense frisbee with a bunch of jocks running around. I say that we keep the article, or merge it with ultimate frisbee.

<li>Good day! While we respect your considerably well-bolded and logically sourced right to practice any religion that strikes your fancy, it should be noted that said right doesn't extend to other people's/group's/etcetera's websites. Additionally, as has been noted, Wikipedia is not a soapbox. Nor is it a country, a planet, a galaxy, or a universe - it is an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> (link provided for clarification), and thus an innapropriate place to <i>practice</i> religion. Now, if your belief system was notable, which we invite you to prove, we'd be more than happy to mention it. Until then, I invite you to surf around and become familiar with wikipedia, what warrants inclusion, and community norms and standards. Have a wikiwiki day! --Jeffrey O.

<li>Thank you for your well wishes. on your argument that Wikipedia is not a place to <i><b>practice</b></i> religion, well, that depends on what the definition of <i><b>practice</b></i> is. We started this article so that we may share our ideas with the world, wikipedia's the easiest ways since most of the world's media is biased to some degree. Since wikipedia's mission is to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">share knowledge with a neutral point of view</a> then we have the right to share our beliefs with the world as much as anyone do. Adding to that, Internetism adheres to the sharing of knowledge which is a way we <i><b>practice</b></i> our religion; and since wikipedia's and our interests do not conflict, we shouldn't have any problems then, with the support of the <b>1st Amendment's</b> guarantee of freedom of expression.
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia's mission is to also present articles about <i>notable</i> subjects. This has nothing to do with the first amendment - you want people to know about Internetism or whatever, put up your own website. You have failed to prove notability. --Jeffrey O.

<li><b>Comment</b> -- I worked on (partial) cleanup and I want to mention my reasoning. Millenarianism is a topic of serious academic study. Having information about Baxter's books and radio programmes here is going to be useful to people in 50 or 100 years who want to study the forms millenarianism took in our time and need to run down primary sources. The entry needs to be shorter and more factual, and it may reasonably be merged into an article on something more general. I don't think it's 100% cruft, though. <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETECannon_4144.html" title="User:TECannon">TECannon</a> 14:48, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Kept.</b> Of course Kay Tipton is a notable person. She is an outstanding mathematics educator, as shown by her many awards and recognitions. Her inspiration has rekindled an interest in mathematics at VHHS, formerly one of the most hated subjects in school. She is a legend both in the high school math community of the American Southeast and in the Mu Alpha Theta national honor society. Under her guidance, the VHHS math team has been national champions about fifteen times out of twenty at the Mu Alpha Theta National Convention. It is absurd to think that just because someone is not on Google numerous times, then he or she is not notable; Google is not always correct about academia. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWan726_add7.html" title="User:Wan726">Wan726</a></li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> She's definitely contributing much to this country. She sets the standard for what people should call as "mathematics," almost forgotten at this modern age of stupidity.

<li>The punk band article and the album article edit history are in the same page. If you delete the former, you'll delete the latter, too. I simply reverted the "Know Your Enemy" article to a version without the punk band. You don't have to wait for a decision on it. I have never noticed that they would vote on AfD about a partial deletion of an edit history although such action is technically possible.

<li>Now someone reverted the article to the punk band version. The visitor presented these reasons: "This group meets criteria to be found notable, having gone on a national concert tour in a large country, as well as consisting of members which have done the same." Well, they have a website in Myspace, and it shows only gigs in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut. This can't be a national concert tour.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> for technical reasons until a better nav box is created. Like it says in the edit history when I created it: "stubbing out red link in nav box to keep it off the Most Wanted list". All of the <i>List of STATE railroads</i> articles in the nav box use the same nav box, {{<a href="../../../u/s/_/Template%7EUS_links_fbc5.html" title="Template:US links">US links</a>}}, which links to <i>List of XXX YYY</i> where XXX is one of the regions listed in the box and YYY is a parameter to the template (in this case, "railroads"). <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlambo_7b8d.html" title="User:Slambo">slambo</a> 20:19, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>That being the case I will group nominate the rest of the blank railroad articles in one AfD when I get a chance later today.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. Because there are so many delete votes, and I personally don't view individual chapters of strange Merkin fraternities as notable, I have chosen to ignore the votes by <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">User:Kappa</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">User:Trollderella</a>, who I know to vote keep on pretty much everything. I am left with 8 delete votes and 2 keep votes, which is a pretty clear consensus for deletion. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 19:21, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Fellow brothers they are trying to delete our chapter Wiki entries under the belief that they are non-notable. if you wish to also join in on the good fight please come post in the Alpha Epsilon Zeta Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega entry. i am trying my best to defend our ideals by defending our chapter wiki's, i am doing this in hopes that it will help defend our organization's ideals and principles and spread our message of friendship, leadership, and service. by no means Tregoweth take this as something hostile, i am a firm believer in talking things out and dealing with things in a calm manner. i am doing this in the hopes to pursuade you in letting our chapter wiki's stay. besides i know just from hitting the random article link that there are better fish to fry out there. thanks for your time.<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButterbean04_eea7.html" title="User:Butterbean04">Butterbean04</a> 02:39, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a term that is well known to folklorists. A search for "Murder Ballad" turns up 28,000+ hits on Google. However, it is not a sub-genre of heavy metal (or more properly, it is not limited to heavy metal).

We only recently published our theories in small, independent science newsletters, but will soon release our findings to the public in a more widespread form. I have listed my findings here first only as a step towards getting my research out into the public. I insist that you keep this, as well as the Pinowski and J-Curves. -Dr. Nicholas Langer, discoverer of the N-Curve - DrLanger89 13:26, 25 October 2005 (UTC) <small>(actually 141.154.137.115 2005-10-25 15:27:09 UTC according to edit history. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:06, 25 October 2005 (UTC))</small></li>

<p><a href="../../../r/o/a/Road_safety.html" title="Road safety">Road safety</a> is already long and merging a consideration of this topic will make it longer than desirable, but there is a large section on road safety interventions which is getting quite detailed; it would be possible to split that out as Road safety (interventions). Alternatively I could keep this (which I'm still actively researching and have just got some more source papers) and retitle it Road safety (controversy) or some such.

<li>I'll vote <b>delete</b> if not <b>userfied</b>, which I think would be better. Can I suggest someone with more wiki-experience than me approaches the author to explain the process?

<li>Assuming that user Destiny or DestinyG is Sandy Berger, you could place the information on your user page providing that you control the copyright from the compukiss Meet Sandy page. The article breaches our <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECopyvio_e1c3.html" title="WP:Copyvio">WP:Copyvio</a> policy which aims to ensure that copyrighted material belonging to other people on other pages. It also violates <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> if you are Sandy Berger in that it seeks to promote yourself or close friends or relatives. We have another policy called <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> or Neutral Point Of View which is considered to be a fundamental policy. This provides that all articles aim to present a objective overview of the topic. Articles written by the subject have difficulty doing so. There may well be case for an article about this Sandy Berger but not an article written by her or a copyright violation. If it can be userfied without a copyright violation to user Destiny's page that should happen.

<li>Personally, I'd <b>delete</b> both of the articles. (First of all, the new one is almost a complete word-for-word duplicate, right down to sentences like "The Ninth's scale may have been extraordinary, but this had other effects on the atmosphere in the Troop." It's obviously a copy, possibly an indirect one.) I don't see any particular notability to this scout troop beyond simply being (or having in the past been; it's unclear) the numerically largest in the UK or Europe; it does not seem to be widely discussed or referenced. (It's also very unlikely to be notable on a world scale; the troop I belonged to in the U.S. had 90 members and it was pretty average.) <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 02:08, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Repeated from discussion: How does this go up for deletion consideration yet no one has a problem with the articles for 4chan, GameFAQ and YTMND? What's the difference?

<dd>The discussion is about <i><b>this</b></i> message board. If you don't think the others should be here, then nominate them and let the consensus of the editors be heard.

<dd>The fact that the others have yet to be deleted suggests a precedent that message boards are, apparently, good enough for articles in this international encyclopedia. So it's more than apt for me to be bringing them up in this discussion. And I have no idea what the boards being "defunct" has anything to do with it. As if articles on people and events of the past aren't included. If it happened, it happened. There's plenty of information to be included in this article, that's why I set up the article as a temporary template. I expect (hope) that something close to 20 people will be working on this article by this time next week. Point is, if those articles made it through, then there's no reason this one shouldn't <i>unless</i> you are of the mind that the message boards of <i>this</i> article aren't important, and that's an opinion and nothing more. I consider the hundreds and hundreds of dedicated posters that made up this community, not to mention the almost 10 year history the boards have, to match any requirement of message board notability. It won't be any more or less than any other such article. Enough4 04:27, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It took me a while to realize what this was. It's a table-formatted list of videos for Mariah Carey songs. It's not clear why this isn't named "List of videos for Mariah Carey songs" or somesuch, but this is not a list of music videos that Mariah Carey has directed (although I presume that she "starred in" them). This is not an encyclopedia article and it is pretending to not be a list. It is certainly not helpful if someone were doing "research", as there is no indication where one might find encyclopedic information on its subject, and if someone were to be "researching" music videos for Mariah Carey songs, I imagine that person would expect to find any discussion of Mariah Carey promotional materials in the articles about the songs they would be promoting. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 00:32, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Merge perhaps if you can find a suitable place, but strictly speaking it's neither WAMP or LAMP and certainly not Apache. I almost wonder if the people who voted for deletion/merging know what it is. It's a combination of packages beyond Apache, MySQL and PHP/Perl. I agree it's not a very good article, but there are far worse. It should be listed as a paget for improvement, not just arbitrarily destroyed. (Personally I wouldn't use it, I'm a roll your own type of guy, but I don't see why it got listed.) <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabriel_40ce.html" title="User:Gabriel">Gabe</a> 20:13, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not sure if this is a pro-life argument, humor, or what. "Zigota" looks like the word "zygote," but I can't find what language that would be. I guess it doesn't matter; WP already has a <a href="../../../z/y/g/Zygote.html" title="Zygote">zygote</a> article. The thing about the Croatian Parliament seems to be a joke; searching on Google for "zigota" and "croatian parliament" produces only results derived from this article. A user has already called this vandalism on the article's discussion page, and I must say that it doesn't seem to belong in wikipedia. <b>Delete.</b> <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoel7687_4b33.html" title="User:Joel7687">Joel7687</a> 06:30, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
