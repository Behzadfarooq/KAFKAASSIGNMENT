<li><b>Delete</b> as original research per nom. Some historians place specific great importance on some of these battles, largely for contemporary reasons -- e.g. as a "macrohistorical" battle between Western and non-Western civilizations. There is no historical consensus that these battles were important in that sense. Certainly there is very little support for the idea that Thermopylae (between Greeks and Persians) can easily be shoehorned into a precursor of the Crusades and Christian-Muslim conflict. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 19:27, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sorry to spoil your illusion, but the Europeans have always used the fight against the Eastern civilizations as part of their cultural identity, not only against Muslims but against anything that came from the East since Roman times. Sometimes even defeats (such as Kosovo_Polje) are used to form national identity, while wars amongst the Europeans themselves are mostly regarded as tragedies <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 23:08, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am assuming good faith, and by the way the Greeks don't identify with Thermopylae, Macedonians sure do. But in central Europe the battle of Vienna is the great focal point of cultural identity, for the Balkans it is Kosovo Polje, for the French Poitiers and each of these battles were against Muslims. The great heroes such as Roldan, El Cid, Prinz Eugen and about a million more were always in battle against the <i>Moors</i> or Turks in popular culture, even though historically the reality is much more diverse ( El Cid for example had a better relationship with the Moorish rulers than with the Christian kings) .

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Bad faith nomination. The edit history shows the author is still working on the document and may be adding sources soon. The document is only about a month old. I do not see any attempt at talk or otherwise to get the author to provide sources. Unreferenced tag was added AFTER the AFD nomination. This nomination is rediculous to say the least and is biting of the head of a new contributor.

<li>The nominator <b>never gave the author a change to supply the sources</b>. Never tried to tag as un sourced. <b>Makes claims about POV and OR without any real evidance</b>. We should assume <b>good faith</b>, in that the author will provide the necessary sources eventually, say after the article has been tagged for a few months. Not while it still being written! The nominator also assumes it is a single purpose account, clearly this is not 'good faith' to a new user, but a clear attack upon him.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a> 03:44, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Notwithstanding the definition of single purpose account, you have to admit that this account has not done any other editing on Wikipedia. This does not prejudge of the future. I have "never gave the author a change (sic) to supply sources" for the simple reason that there is a very big <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_Convention_5be7.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming Convention">Naming Conventions</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conflict_12e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conflict">Naming conflict</a> on such an article. Its title itself makes it inherently biased and restricted. So, the <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslav_War_1114.html" title="Yugoslav War">Yugoslav Wars</a> will not be included as "founding battles of European identity"? On which criterias? Maybe because they show that it is not the problem that I have a POV (while, of course, you are "moderate" and "neutral"), but because this article does not allow for NPOV. <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Europe_0f59.html" title="History of Europe">History of Europe</a> does, and contents should be moved there, and this article deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b>, for now. It is evident that the article has been edited on a continuous basis since creation so one can assume that sources will be added, especially after being tagged as unsourced.

<li><b>VERY STRONG Keep</b>, for now. As <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> noted, this article has been continuously edited, and its greatest weakness is sourcing, which is certainly correctable. I am sorry that this is viewed in a Christian versus Islamic perspective - but reality is that in Austria the seige of Vienna is viewed with at least as much reverance as Americans do Yorktown or Saratoga, and in both Germany and France, Tours/Poiters is viewed in the same light. I am sorry but the critics of this article mostly are doing so because of POV, not history. This has the makings of a very good article, and certainly can be sourced.

<li>Again, please don't engage other people under your flag. As already said, I happen to be a citizen of one of the country you mention, and I can assure you that, although one of the battle you've mentioned was often cited in elementary schools in the 19th century, we've done some (little) progress. Furthermore, I can also assure you that a very large part of my fellow citizens ignore the very existence of this battle, at best, they've heard about it when in elementary school. We more generally remember battles of the 19th and 20th century, sorry for any possible desillusions. <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> 22:11, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> this Article, it is already being sourced.I was asked to look at this article, and evaluate whether or not it needed deletion. It does not. The request is simple POV, and there has been no good faith shown, as the requester simply bitterly attacks all those who oppose deletion. oldwindybear has begun sourcing the article, and I will assist him, as will the original editor, I am sure.

Some of these battles have a controversial importance (e.g. battle of Tours - many say it was just a raid) or their inferred importance is of dubious relevance (e.g. battle of Chalons - what if Attila would have reached Atlantic Ocean?).

<li><b>Keep</b>. Most academic sources agree that certain battles shaped the (evolution of) Europe. In other words, most historians agree on these battles.

<li><b>Delete</b> is my conclusion after minutiously reading all the stuff and comments. Technically, the article is OK, however it is grounding upon two erroneous premises:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>the ideological premise of tacitly identifying Europe with Western (catholic&#160;?) Europe</li>
<li>the methodological premise of supposing that “battles” are relevant at a macro-historical scale; this is conjectural history, a sort of pseudohistorical approach speculating upon “what if…?” (What if Napoleon would have won Waterloo&#160;?); no professional historian engages in historical conjectures.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>However, in order to save the work done, you could include the material to a History of Western Europe, mentioning these battles as “significant”, no more. --<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintila_Barbu_9193.html" title="User:Vintila Barbu">Vintila Barbu</a> 12:00, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Vintila Barbu above. The problem is that individual battles usually do not have "macrohistorical" importance (Theromopylaye did not stop or destroyed Persians, it was the Athenian fleet and troops, during Battle of Vienna the Otoman Empire was past its former glory). Mongol invasion is missing as well as crusades and gradual destruction of Byzantine empire. An article on macrohistory (or European macrohistory) should precede this kind of list in any case. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 19:43, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>: this is an article on an important and timely topic, and merits further development and improvements, not the ax. Yes, the title is kind of odd, and probably should be changed.

<li><b>Comment</b>. First, please assume good faith. Second, how can you really argue that this is not OR, since it relies on the very ill-defined concept of "European civilization" (not even adressing the questions about which battles should be included in this so-called "macrohistory" - where does this concept comes from? - and on which criterias). And, notwithstanding the question of the coherence of the concept of "civilization", what do you call "Europe"? An geographical expression, as Charles de Gaulle used to say, which went from the Atlantic Ocean to the <a href="../../../u/r/a/Ural_mountains.html" title="Ural mountains">Ural mountains</a>? Or does it includes parts of Russia? Or should it exclude Russia, although it is a country which has been very closely related to European culture? Or do you mean <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>? What about Eastern Europe, which lived under a communist regime so long? And the UK, do they belong to Europe, although they're not part of the European continent? But fifty years ago the EU had only six countries, and before didn't exist (so how can you have battles defending the EU before its existence?) Alf photoman's opposition between "European civilization" and "Muslims" is POV, and was the subject of a strong debate between EU countries during the drafting of the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_establishing_a_Constitution_for_Europe_13f5.html" title="Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe">Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe</a> (TCE), some arguing that "Christianism" was part of "European identity", while others argued that <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secularism.html" title="Secularism">secularism</a> was more important and that Europe was not inherently Christian (see <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Treaty_establishing_a_Constitution_for_Europe_0661.html#Mention_of_Christianity_in_the_preamble" title="History of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe">History of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe#Mention of Christianity in the preamble</a>). So, Jews are not part of "European civilization"? What a nice thought... So, why shouldn't we argue that "European civilization" was defended by the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Reich_a799.html" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a>, and that it's last battle, which it lost, was in 1945 against the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies.html" title="Allies">Allies</a>? PS: the very example of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Martel_3f32.html" title="Charles Martel">Charles Martel</a> and the 721 <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Toulouse_c15b.html" title="Battle of Toulouse">Battle of Toulouse</a>, which more or less tends to accredit the thesis that the 7 centuries (!) of <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Andalus_24f6.html" title="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a> were some sort of parenthesis, not to say "alien parasite" on the Christian Europe, is not only OR, but simple racism and ignorance of the huge importance of Islam for this so-called "European civilization".

<dd>We should not assume that Adolf and his gang of loonies wanted to defend Europe or European culture because their self proclaimed intent was to supplant the European culture with their own amalgam of loonacities they were making up as they went along. By the way, I don't think that Attila and his gang were Muslims (but from the East), yet the battle against them (aiding the Romans) was what at the end of the day formed the Frank identity, which later formed the first Holy Roman Empire of German Nations (took 400 years but what the heck...) whose first aim was to convert Eastern Barbarians to Christianism (such as the Saxons, the Allemande and so on) and later the Moorish invaders (sic.) in Spain. And no, I don't think these battles formed the European civilization, but surely they formed the European identity. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 00:23, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

But certainly we don't seem to agree on what European identity, while you are quoting what it should be I am quoting what renowned authors define it as.

<dd>I am sorry for offensing you. I have to insist that the title of this article is a source of continuing ideological debates which are best kept to a political forum, which Wikipedia is not. I am not quoting what "European identity" should be, I am pointing out that there is no single definition of that, as shown by the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Treaty_establishing_a_Constitution_for_Europe_0661.html#Mention_of_Christianity_in_the_preamble" title="History of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe">debate over the inclusion, or not, of Christianity to the preamble of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, debate which ended with the decision not to include it</a>. I think this provides sufficient sources for my claim that this article is ill-named and should be deleted. Its author may include its content in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Europe_0f59.html" title="History of Europe">History of Europe</a>, where it belongs. I am not even adressing the concept of "macrohistory", in particular when it refers to "battles", sending for this to <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fernand_Braudel_44f6.html" title="Fernand Braudel">Fernand Braudel</a>'s work concerning long tendencies in history (he talked about the Mediterranean Sea, not about soldiers). <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> 16:57, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Ok, lets cool this, sincerely I don't like the content of the article either and I abhor the idea of wars being nation building, but that does not take away the evidence that it is factual, or at least generally accepted by historians. This has nothing to do with what we like or we don't like and that is the difference between history and the pamphlet of a political movement <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 17:15, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But the problem is precisely this: historians don't agree on what constitutes the "identity" of the "European civilisation" (assuming there is such an "European civilisation", which, for the sake of not engaging in philosophical debates, I will temporary accord you), much less on the concept of a "macrohistory" (if there really is such a concept), so the whole article falls under OR. The "factual evidence", as you put it, such as, let's say, the fact that there was in 732 a <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Tours_b847.html" title="Battle of Tours">battle in Poitiers</a>, headed on the French side by [[Charles Martel], does not entail the ideological interpretation that this event was a "macrohistorical battle" on which depended the fate of European existence. In fact, I don't see why, if the battle had been lost by Charles Martel, the existence of Europe would have been endangered. It would have been different, which is not the same. But the fact that <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Andalus_24f6.html" title="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a> existed in modern Spain for 7th centuries did not "destroy European identity" (sic). All the factual events cited in this article should be moved to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Europe_0f59.html" title="History of Europe">History of Europe</a>, which is a NPOV title, and if the author wants to argue that they had "macrohistorical importance for the destiny of European civilization" (in particular the Christian part of this "civilization", leaving out <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosniaks.html" title="Bosniaks">Bosnians</a> because, although they are a European ethnic group, they don't have the luck to fit into this ideological reading of history which excludes Muslims from it), well, let him argue that in a NPOV article: History of Europe. You can't seriously say this entry has got a NPOV name, and much less back-it up with serious sources. I have already cited the debate about the European Constitution, I think this is enough source for a Wikipedia debate. We all have more important things to do than political arguing here. <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> 17:36, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I certainly agree with <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> that we need to wind down the level of rhetoric, and stop the naming calling first and foremost. Then a better title needs to be found. I personally do believe the article is worth keeping though its present title needs changing, and it needs to be sourced - it's biggest weakness is the lack of references, which I am beginning to rectify. As to Tours, I think Bury - one of the truly great giants in the field of history - said it best: <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._B._Bury_392c.html" title="J. B. Bury">John Bagnell Bury</a>, writing at the beginning of the 20th century, said "The Battle of Tours… has often been represented as an event of the first magnitude for the world’s history, because after this, the penetration of Islam into Europe was finally brought to a standstill.”<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Let us discuss this rationally, and no one engage in accusing those of differing opinions of bad faith. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 23:34, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You can't build a 21st century Encyclopedia on historical accounts of the early 20th century. Would you imagine what kind of account of World War I it would do? With, for example, a section supporting the French views of the epoch, and calling Germans names, while the other would support Germany, and insult French? Or something about <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonialism.html" title="Colonialism">colonialism</a> calling Black people "<a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">niggers</a>" and "barbarians"? No, all my respect for Bury, but there have been some progress since in historical research and views, and Bury rather belongs to <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historiography.html" title="Historiography">historiography</a>, as do all historians from this period. This article should be deleted, because the name is very POV, and its content transfered (that's not difficult) to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Europe_0f59.html" title="History of Europe">History of Europe</a>. I can't see any other way to find a consensual decision, and I don't know why you don't consider this simple solution: the list of battles will remain, just as part of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Europe_0f59.html" title="History of Europe">History of Europe</a>, instead of some Original Research concerning "macrohistory" (not to say "European civilization")? <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> 03:14, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I remember the battle fought over Tours on wikipedia, it was really ugly - of course people don't mention <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Davis_Hanson_b671.html" title="Victor Davis Hanson">Victor Davis Hanson</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_E._Watson_9962.html" title="William E. Watson">William E. Watson</a>, two of the most respected historians of this era, both of whom say today that Tours was a battle of incredible importance. However, you may have suggested a way to settle this without a long drawn out fight - I would certainly be amicable to change the title and leave the list, remaining as some sort of subtitle to the History of Europe. I think that is a reasonable suggestion. We can debate the individual battles, such as Tours, afterwards, but I certainly think your suggestion that the list remain, but retitled to remove the offensive wording is a reasonable and fair solution. I owe you an apology for saying you were only acting out of POV. In attacking your motives, I was doing the very thing I was condemning, and I apologize. I like your idea of leaving the list of battles but retitling it, and <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> has begun referencing the entire article, and I will help him source each article. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStillstudying_e9b9.html" title="User:Stillstudying">Stillstudying</a> 12:53, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am not sure how historians are valued, but there are reputable scholars considering the battle of Tours of little importance (like Tomaž Mastnak for instance, which you will find in the same article on Tours). Also while mentioning Hanson, one should remember his main theory but also his conflicts like the one with Jared Diamond (the two proposing two different drives for progress: Hanson - an aggresive culture of warfare and pragmatism and "democratical values", Diamond - an environmental preconditioning), and realize that when some people argue for macrohistorical importance, actually they speak within an ideological framework, within a paradigm, therefore their assessment is strictly conditioned by their premises (and not by some premises with quasi-universal acceptance in various historiographies worldwide). My point is when someone invokes a historian like Hanson and represents his POV, he actually represents his whole theory of how the world is changing/progressing. Therefore even if a scholarly reference would argue for a series of battles (I am not sure if Hanson argues the battles he chose to be all of macrohistorical importance or just examples to promote his theory), that would be at best only a POV which furthermore needs balanced by other POVs. And last, but not at least, the POV supporting macrohistorical importance relies most often on speculation and at best analogies (for the case of Tours: that Islam would further advance in Europe, that Ummayads would have continued a conquest in Gaul or furthermore in other European lands, that the ascension of Charlemagne would have been eclipsed by the insuccess of Martel to stop the Muslim forces at Tours, that the situation of Gaul would be the same as the situation of Iberian peninsula etc.), which even when coming from scholars, they still should be taken as they are - simple claims, not actual arguments. Of course, it shouldn't be us, the editors, pointing that but we can invoke those scholars debunking these myths (and as I mentioned before, for the case we're discussing there are already references in the article on Tours). The burden of proof lies on those claiming the macrohistorical importance (i.e. the positive claim) and just saying the world would have been drastically changed it doesn't make it so. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 13:18, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obviously, every historian had his or her own perspective, or philosophy, which you could call point of view if you want. But the wikipedia policy is simple: we are barred, as editors, from interpreting anything, and can only cite the original scholars and their theories. So while Hanson may have had a framework he put Tours in, believing that it fit into his theory that the Carolingian control of Europe, and the feudal systems which would carry Europe through the Dark Ages after Rome's fall were assured by Charles Martel's signal victory at Tours, it really does not matter. We won't settle the Tours argument here - oldwindybear and others have been fighting that for years! But the fact is that most of the western historians of today do believe Tours was of macrohistorical importance. Hanson believes even if it was not in the grand scheme of stopping Umayyad conquest of Europe, it certainly was in that it assured Frankish dominion of Europe, which led it safely into the Middle Ages after Rome's collapse. Watson is even more fervant in praising Martel. My point is, you said their saying this battle changed the world does not make it so - but it does for our purposes. Hanson and Watson, just to name two, make detailed and strong cases for why that battle was a crucial turning point in history. Hanson in particular is a very well thought of military historian, and his analysis of the battle is first rate. Watson is another very well known modern historian who has made a very detailed and complex argument that historically this battle determined the fate of Europe as we know it. We can only cite them, and those in opposition, and let the reader decide. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStillstudying_e9b9.html" title="User:Stillstudying">Stillstudying</a> 16:56, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"But the fact is that most of the western historians of today do believe Tours was of macrohistorical importance" - this is still to be proved. I haven't seen anywhere in this article, in the article on Tours (or any other battles listed in this article) any decent attempt to review scholarship and historiographies (possibly none of us has the ability or the knowledge to do it, then we should refrain from hiding behind assumed majorities). Let me browse few historians from my own bookshelves: Pierre Riche (1989) claims "the battle of Poitiers for some was an unimportant military action stopping a raid while for others was a significant event for the destiny of Charles Martel and the Carolingians" (nothing about an iminent conquest of Islam/Ummeyads, though), while the same author justified with another occasion (1962: due to constant Arab raids and invasions, the dukes of Aquitania called Charles Martel and thus the southern Gaul was ruined and gradually fell under Austrasian/Carolingian authority (nothing particular about the battle of Poitiers). According to Lucien Musset (1965), Charles Martel intercepted the Arab offensive (heading for St. Martin sanctuary to pillage it) and defeated them but that didn't stop the Arabs which kept invading the southern parts of France in the following years (730s). The significance of Charles Martel southern campaigns was that the Austrasians started to focus on this rich region and attempt to drag it under their authority. My concern is - who and how has estabilished the "mainstream" of interpretations is to value the battle of Tours (or any of these battles) of macrohistorical importance?</dd>
<dd>Hanson's perspective is not given at all, so the work of the editors is not complete until it is shown the macrohistorical significance given by Hanson is tributary to his specific and perhaps controversial view (like someone nicely observed in one of the paragraphs below, ultimately a Hegelian view). As already suggested, perhaps it would be a nicer/more fruitful discussion (or even article), the opposition of paradigms: to take a simple case based on two of our examples so far - a historian of Annales like Pierre Riche and a historian like Hanson. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 21:35, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I thank Achileus for his quick, and to the point, comment, refering to the 1851 work, which shows all the problems lifted by this article. Note that at the time, scholars didn't even feel the need to say "Europe", as "World" was a synonym. Europeans found after World War I that there were other states to take into account. I also do agree with Daizus, who points out that the reason behind our controverse concerns the <i>philosophical nature</i> of this article, <i>rather than a simple historical account</i> (I'm sorry for having taking the point a bit too seriously, but it is, in fact, a serious matter, which clearly provides a dividing line, for philosophical &amp; political matters - that mustn't stop us from speaking like... Greeks in an Assembly...).</dd>

Thus, it is impossible to try to NPOV it by providing sources from historians;<br />
first, as we all known, history is not a science in the same sense as physics, and can only tend towards objectivity, without ever achieving it (see <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Ricoeur_b97a.html" title="Paul Ricoeur">Paul Ricoeur</a>'s interesting account on this).<br />
Second, this article does not concerns a historical debate but a <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_history.html" title="Philosophy of history">philosophical reading of history</a>, mainly based on <a href="../../../h/e/g/Hegel.html" title="Hegel">Hegel</a>'s reading. It doesn't ask itself if X did happen? or how much was the cost of grain before the French Revolution? And how was the climate during the time preceding the French Revolution? - see the works of <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmanuel_Le_Roy_Ladurie_81d5.html" title="Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie">Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie</a> on the history of climate, which, although Ladurie is known for <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microhistory.html" title="Microhistory">microhistory</a> (:), is certainly of macrohistorical interest - dinosaurs, anyone? ) It is, of course, on purpose that I refer to historians, such as <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fernand_Braudel_44f6.html" title="Fernand Braudel">Braudel</a> or Le Roy Ladurie, who claim that battles are, after all, events which belong to a short time-span compared to long-time span such as climates or geographical influences (work on the Mediterranean Sea, the real "hero" of history for Braudel, and which is the basis of any geopolitics - i.e. seeing long tendencies and continuities between the Russian Empire &amp; the Soviet Union, not to say today's Putin's Russia...)<br />
Thus, apart of the problem of a "Western civilization" (which is, I think, a concept a bit more convincing than "European civilization", especially today), and of a very ideological attempt at <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identity_politics.html" title="Identity politics">identity politics</a>, which may have been done, or not, on purposes (but which explains why I adamantly refuse this pseudo-opposition between Islam and Christianism, which clearly is POV far from being mainstream), there is a real, philosophical problem, about the importance of battles in general, that is, of "macrohistorical battles". As someone pointed out at the very first of this Afd, "macrohistorical battle" is a contradiction in terms. Referring to the historians above, I agree with him. Beside merging the content of this article into <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Europe_0f59.html" title="History of Europe">History of Europe</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_history.html" title="Philosophy of history">Philosophy of history</a> might be an article that will interest you — it is a passionating subject! To recall you that there are very different perspectives on this "philosophy of history", I'll recall <a href="../../../n/i/e/Nietzsche.html" title="Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>'s words here, concerning "Great Events":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ye understand how to roar and obscure with ashes! Ye are the best braggarts, and have sufficiently learned the art of making dregs boil.<br />
Where ye are, there must always be dregs at hand, and much that is spongy, hollow, and compressed: it wanteth to have freedom.<br />
'Freedom' ye all roar most eagerly: but I have unlearned the belief in 'great events,' when there is much roaring and smoke about them.<br />
And believe me, friend Hullabaloo! The greatest events--are not our noisiest, but our stillest hours.<br />
Not around the inventors of new noise, but around the inventors of new values, doth the world revolve; INAUDIBLY it revolveth.<br />
And just own to it! Little had ever taken place when thy noise and smoke passed away. What, if a city did become a mummy, and a statue lay in the mud!<br />
And this do I say also to the o'erthrowers of statues: It is certainly the greatest folly to throw salt into the sea, and statues into the mud...<br />

<p>If there is such a thing as a "European civilization", one thing is sure: it is not a fixed, permanent, essential identity, to which we should refer to as a myth which must governs our politics. "European civilization" is what we make of it, and <i>if</i> ("with 'if', says a saying, "you can put Paris into a bottle"...) the Third Reich had won, than Europe would still exist, although it would be certainly sad. "If" Charles Martel had not won, than maybe <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Andalus_c3d3.html" title="Al Andalus">Al Andalus</a> would have extended itself, and the wonders of that place, and its tolerance towards Christians and Jews, and its amazing knowledge concerning architecture, medicine, philosophy, etc., would have permit Europe to avoid the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wars_of_Religion_b155.html" title="Wars of Religion">Wars of Religion</a>, the dark Middle Ages (which were not as dark as we think they were), and immediately pass to the bright Renaissance and then <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlightenment.html" title="Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>... One needn't be Muslim to acclaim the wonders of Al Andalus, especially compared to the dark period that succeeded to it, and not buy the fairy tale that "Islam" is a threat to so-called European identity. <i>Around the inventors of new values, doth the world revolve...</i> indeed <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> 18:27, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>NO DELETION, but I have no trouble agreeing to renaming the article and putting it with the History of Europe. As to the claim that Hanson did not address Tours as a battle of macrohistorical importance, please read "<i>Culture and Carnage: Landmark Battles in the Rise of Western Power</i>." On page 167:
<dl>
<dd>"Recent scholars have suggested Poitiers, so poorly recorded in contemporary sources, was a mere raid and thus a construct of western mythmaking or that a Muslim victory might have been preferable to continued Frankish dominance. What is clear is that Poitiers marked a general continuance of the successful defense of Europe, (from the Muslims). Flush from the victory at Tours, Charles Martel went on to clear southern France from Islamic attackers for decades, unify the warring kingdoms into the foundations of the Carolingian Empire, and ensure ready and reliable troops from local estates."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This is pretty clearly an analysis that states flatly that this battle was absolutely vital in the development of Europe as we know it today. Whether that is a "good" or "bad" thing depends on your perspective. William Watson, one of America's better known historians in this generation, says of Tours:
<dl>
<dd>"There is clearly some justification for ranking Tours-Poitiers among the most significant events in Frankish history when one considers the result of the battle in light of the remarkable record of the successful establishment by Muslims of Islamic political and cultural dominance along the entire eastern and southern rim of the former Christian, Roman world. The rapid Muslim conquest of Palestine, Syria, Egypt and the North African coast all the way to Morocco in the seventh century resulted in the permanent imposition by force of Islamic culture onto a previously Christian and largely non-Arab base. The Visigothic kingdom fell to Muslim conquerors in a single battle on the Rio Barbate in 711, and the Hispanic Christian population took seven long centuries to regain control of the Iberian peninsula. The Reconquista, of course, was completed in 1492, only months before Columbus received official backing for his fateful voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Had Charles Martel suffered at Tours-Poitiers the fate of King Roderick at the Rio Barbate, it is doubtful that a "do-nothing" sovereign of the Merovingian realm could have later succeeded where his talented major domus had failed. Indeed, as Charles was the progenitor of the Carolingian line of Frankish rulers and grandfather of Charlemagne, one can even say with a degree of certainty that the subsequent history of the West would have proceeded along vastly different currents had ‘Abd ar-Rahman been victorious at Tours-Poitiers in 732."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Noted educator Dexter B. Wakefield writes, "A Muslim France? Historically, it nearly happened. But as a result of Martel’s fierce opposition, which ended Muslim advances and set the stage for centuries of war thereafter, Islam moved no farther into Europe. European schoolchildren learn about the Battle of Tours in much the same way that American students learn about Valley Forge and Gettysburg." So for those who claim that Tours is not a landmark event in western history, sorry, most historians, early, mid, and modern, disagree. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 01:28, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Most historians? How many historians have talked about this battle? Hundreds? Thousands? How many can you list? Even you quoted Hanson with "Recent scholars have suggested Poitiers, so poorly recorded in contemporary sources, was a mere raid and thus a construct of western mythmaking or that a Muslim victory might have been preferable to continued Frankish dominance". On what grounds do you assume these "recent scholars" are actually a minority? Hanson himself is not supporting this view. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 13:00, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I did not write the article, but am rewriting it, putting in opposing viewpoints, and sourcing it massively. But the sources have to be cited correctly. People who depend on Hanson -- and it is understandable, as he is one of our foremost military historians! -- need to go READ Hanson, who very carefully dismantles the theory that Tours/Poitiers was merely a raid, and shows how Martel and his men put an end to the Islamic wave that had swept aside empires on three continents, see Hanson summarizing the long term influence historically of this battle, Page 167:.
<dl>
<dd>"What is clear is that Poitiers marked a general continuence of the successful western defense of Europe. Flush from his victory at Poitiers, Charles went on to clear southern France from Islamic invaders for decades, unify the warring kingdoms into the foundation of the Carolingian Empire, and ensure ready and avaiable troops from local estates."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Hanson gives an extremely detailed military analysis of why this battle was so vital to western history - citing many times the sources for this being a macrohistorical victory "saving" Europe, "the great land" as it was called by the Umayyads, as he explains why those holding the thesis that it was merely a raid are historically and militarily wrong. Hanson cites Gibbon, Ranke, Creasy, Oman, Fuller, and quoted the great german military historian Hans Delbruck, who said of this battle "there was no more important battle in the history of the world." (<i>The Barbarian Invasions</i>, page 441.) After Tours, Hanson said, quoting Oman, "for the future we hear of Frankish invasions of Spain, not Saracen INvasions of Gaul!" (<i>The Dark Ages</i> Pages 476-918, 299). He talks about Martel's remarkable ability to unify warring tribes to face the Islamic invasion, quoting Constantine, <i>War in the Middle Ages</i>. Hanson closed his article by assessing why Europeans adapted so easily to modern warfare by saying on page 169:
<dl>
<dd>"they were not the products of a nomadic horse people, tribal society, or even theocratic autocracy, but drew their heritige from tough foot soldiers...the type of men who formed a veritable wall of ice at Poitiers and so beat Abd ar-Rahman back."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You need to read Hanson's works, which very clearly and very systematically explain why this battle is of such huge macrohistorical importance, and why Charles and his infantry were able to withstand the supposedly invincible Islamic cavalry, page 157:
<dl>
<dd>"The legions had crumbled not because of organizational weaknesses, technological backwardness, or even problems of command and dsicipline, but because of the dearth of free citizens who were willing to fight for their own freedom and the values of their civilization. Such spirited warriors the barbarians had, and when they absorbed the blueprint of roman militarism, a number of effective local western armies arose - as the Muslims learned at Poitiers." <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 14:35, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Look, I'm not a fan of Hanson, I've rather browsed Carnage &amp; Culture, read some of his reviews and materials in press, watched some of his debates with Jared Diamond, and generally I wasn't impressed by his arguments and I've read better arguments from the other side.</dd>
<dd>On this topic, Hanson et al. have yet to persuade me that Islam and Western Europe Christianity are two monolithic entities to make their theories work for me. Hanson et al. have yet to persuade me their take on the alternative histories is the correct one (that the Islamic forces from Spain would indeed pursue to conquer Gaul, that if Martel would have lost a battle he'd have lose the entire Gaul to Arabs, that if Arabs eventually would have invaded the entire Gaul, the reconquest would be similar with Spanish Reconquista, etc., etc. - so many speculations and assertions and so little evidence for it).</dd>
<dd>Also when someone quotes rather obsolete historians really doesn't make a good impression (unless he tries to evoke a historiographical tradition). No offense, but historians relying on Gibbon are in my eyes like physicists relying on Newton. Relying on Creasy, von Ranke, Oman, Fuller looks also obsolete. I mean, they may have valueable ideas, but they can't be simply quoted as authorities for the historical studies of the 21st century! You can evoke them, but no more. Several decades it is a long time in this field, though I like their writing I have my inherent doubts even when I'm reading historians like Lucien Musset writing 4 decades ago. I know, I'm no position to reject secondary sources in being present in the Wiki articles (unless I bring scholars to support my position), but I can show you there's no way to persuade me in quoting massively rather outdated scholarship.</dd>
<dd>Oh, and on Hanson quoting Oman - I hope you know there were other Saracen invasions in Gaul after Tours. Like the plundering of Arles and the much of the Provence region in 734 or the later invasions in Burgundy. See also Martel's campaigns in southern Gaul in 736-7 which are documented even here on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 18:01, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I wrote you on the talk page of the article, I am just beginning a rewrite of an article I did not write. If you want a great account of the invasions circa 734-737, see Fouracre or <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonio_Santosuosso_743c.html" title="Antonio Santosuosso">Antonio Santosuosso</a> who maintains the defeat of the Muslim forces at the River Berre by Martel was far more important than Tours. I am just in the beginning stages - I honestly believe you will feel the article is fair when I am done. As to the accounts of Martel's campaigns in Gaul in 736-7, if you check the history, I wrote most of what is here. Please give me time - I have ordered Hitti's book, and other material I need to finish this rewrite. You know as well as I the major problem now is generalizations without sourcing. I am going to rewrite putting in all views, sourced heavily.</dd>
<dd>As to Hanson, I think his best work lies in his analysis of why heavy infantry was the key to Frankish domination, (the history of heavy infantry, what it was, et al) and his analysis of cavalry versus Knights, and mixed force armies. I think he is right on those issues - on Tours, frankly, despite the time gone by, Bury convinces me more than anyone except Watson, who is the best we have today.

<p>Hey <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> If I did not hear the criticisms, I would not have taken on the chore of correcting what was wrong with the article. I did not write it, but I felt you and several other people, whose work I respect, had raised some very legitimate critques that needed addressing if the article was to stay. Please realize I don't have a personal interest in what happens in this vote. I didn't write the article. Since the original editor had not begun correcting it, I decided to, and in fact, had asked another editor I respect greatly to help me. I agree with you in part on the naming conflict, I only entered this dispute because someone brought this entire issue to my attention, and I decided that the article was salvagable, but had to be completely rewritten and sourced. Remember, one tenet of our work on wikipedia is editors are encouraged to be bold, and try to correct errors in fact and form where they are found. I don't think my motives, especially considering I am not the original author - can be questioned for being anything other than a simple desire to make this a better article. I think as many people support it as want to delete it - but you have a very valid point that there is no point in working on an article which may be deleted. I will wait for the result of the vote before investing any further energy and time in it. The books I ordered will be useful for work on other military history Carolingian articles and medieval issues in any event. As to the issue of using older historians, Gibbon is still cited as the paramount historian on Rome, despite his work being over 200 years old! Creasy is cited by Paul Davis, Mike Grant, and Hanson, just to name three modern scholars. Bury is still regarded as the great authority by some of the foregoing on the later Roman Empire. I don't think just the age of the work renders it obsolete. In fact, this whole issue of what role the work of those historians should play is a very interesting ongoing academic conflict. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 22:48, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is pretty obvious the vote is in favor of keeping the article at least long enough to see if we can source it and rewrite and retitle it. When is the vote formally over, so we can begin correting the things which need doing? I have done some, but a LOT of work needs doing, and the way the vote looks, we need to get to it.

I have asked a couple of really first rate editors to help, and I think it can be put in fine fettle.

<p>Non-notable baseball league which operated for one season. Don't be fooled by the blue links for the teams - they just redirect back to the league page. Just 436 Ghits for <i>any</i> league named Mid-America League, which falls to 80 when the word baseball is added. League later became the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heartland_League_ef74.html" title="Heartland League">Heartland League</a>, so if anything, this information should go there. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzzy510_a9be.html" title="User:Fuzzy510">fuzzy510</a> 00:22, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep or merge</b> per Fuzzy510. What a suspiciously-created article, complete with all teams as circular links! I doubt that any of these teams have a hope of being notable enough to have their own page, so the links to them are silly—I have removed them. But as to the nom, what makes a league "notable"? "Small, small geography, short-lived" is certainly gonna cut down on the ghits (which isn't the be-all/end-all of notability anyway). I just added a ref to the article, which itself cites two published and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>-sounding sources, so the thing is at least worthy of coverage in published works about minor-league baseball. But given that there's not much to say and the league was short-lived (reincarnating as another short-lived one about which there also doesn't appear to be much to say) maybe better to have a single article about them and their timeline than two more isolated articles. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 03:12, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That ref, itself not reliable on its face, does list several hard-copy refs, which I have now added to the WP article.

<li><b>Keep</b> Even though WWE hasn't used the term in a long time, it doesn't mean we should get rid of it. For example, even though the old American Football League doesn't exist anymore, should we wipe that article out as well because they merged with the NFL?

<li><b>Delete</b> As pointed out in the article itself, the very term "Grand Slam" varies per the promotional needs of WWE. Shawn Michaels has been dubbed an achiever of the Grand Slam. Fine. Add that info briefly to his article. <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuriel1981_fc18.html" title="User:Suriel1981">Suriel1981</a> 11:19, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Thats a pretty flawed logic. True, Shawn Michaels when he won the title was considered <i>the</i> Grand Slam Champion, since he was the only one to accomplish it. If he was the only one to win it, I would agree, merge it into Shawn Michaels article, but you can't since 6 or 7 (maybe 8 pending who's definition you would like to use) have accomplished this. Having a dispute on what definition it is (if we could agree on one definition) is no reason to delete the whole thing and say it never existed. — <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#000000">Moe</font></a> 21:13, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you can cite a reference from WWE themselves giving their current definition of what the "Grand Slam" is then I'll change my vote. <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuriel1981_fc18.html" title="User:Suriel1981">Suriel1981</a> 12:14, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>DUH! That has been the situation there for over 4 months. No source doesn't equal deletion of article. We have definitions, but we can't agree on which ones. WWE hardly chimes in on things and fails to post things like that. Asking for a source by WWE doesn't work anyways since we don't usually like primary sources, we usually need secondary sources from a outside source. The issue is not if that it exists. The problem is that we can't agree on the correct definition. — <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#000000">Moe</font></a> 16:52, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Suriel1981, if the article relating to Grand Slam goes then all wrestler listed on this article will have to have all comments about the Grand Slam removed, because you can't "add that info briefly" to the wrestlers individual articles if the actual Grand Slam article no longer exists. If the Grand Slam article goes then all references to it must be purged as well, otherwise this will create an argument to re-do the Grand Slam Article. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarrenhusted_5fa7.html" title="User:Darrenhusted">Darrenhusted</a> 18:43, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Why would the references have to go? A simple addition to an article saying something along the lines of <i>this title win meant that &lt;insert name&gt; had held every recognised title belt, an achievement referred to as the "Grand Slam"</i>.

<dd><b>Reply</b> I think in my comment I explained why all references would have to go, because there would be temptation to re-create the article to explain what a WWE Grand Slam is. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarrenhusted_5fa7.html" title="User:Darrenhusted">Darrenhusted</a> 14:20, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Read Shawn Michaels book. It states that during a meeting before he was set to win the IC Title, one of the producers spoke up and said that if they went through with the win, that would mean Shawn has won every title in the WWE. Vince then said that it was important and they needed a name for it. That was the birth of the Grand Slam Champion. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillswitch_Engage_cada.html" title="User:Killswitch Engage">User:Killswitch Engage</a></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> To me, this article and the Triple Crown article are too related to have one exist without the other. GS borrows heavily from TC, and if the TC article stays, this should too. Also, enough people have given enough sources to keep it. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnakinjmt_7c04.html" title="User:Anakinjmt">Anakinjmt</a> 07:24, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>i'm not sure, but i have two concerns about this article. first is whether it's notable. paavo basically wrote the music for dransik, whose article was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ashen_Empires_8999.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ashen Empires">deleted</a>. second is whether it currently can actually be expanded to anything more than a ministub. using a simple google search, i wasn't able to find anything more than is now in the article, even his birthdate, for example. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_A_865a.html" title="User:Bob A">Bob A</a> 01:46, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I took the time to read over the article's references. Many of them say little or nothing about the anti-globalization movement; their focus is on "the left" in general. In the Naomi Klein article, the anti-Semitism angle is focused on the presence of Jean-Marie Le Pen, who showed up to at an anti-World Bank/IMF rally. But Le Pen is a far right-winger; he was there for the "free Palestine" rally, not the anti-globalization rally. The Toronto NOW article (<a href="http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2004-03-18/news_story6.php" class="external free" title="http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2004-03-18/news_story6.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2004-03-18/news_story6.php</a>), talks about the possible link between anti-Semitism and some of those who are opposed to the American neo-cons. It says nothing about any link between anti-globalization and anti-Semitism, except that it mentions a prominent anti-WTO activist who <i>condemned</i> an allegedly anti-Semitic Adbusters article. Doesn't exactly support your thesis, does it? And the references from FrontPage and Mark Strauss are inherently biased sources: FrontPage and Strauss' "Foreign Policy" journal are furiously PRO-globalization. If anything, the references provided for the article weaken, not strengthen, any argument for retention. <a href="../../../j/2E/r/User%7EJ.R._Hercules_fd8f.html" title="User:J.R. Hercules">J.R.

If you did, you would have found that most of them don't even talk about any alleged link between anti-globalization and anti-semitism. A few of them do: 1) an archived 1999 opinion piece from an obscure Dutch group's website; 2) a hit-piece from the conservative <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frontpagemag.com.html" title="Frontpagemag.com">frontpagemag.com</a> site; and 3) Mark Strauss' article for <i>Foreign Policy</i> journal -- a journal whose very existence is based on the pro-globalization stance (which hardly qualifies it as an unbiased source for an encyclopedia article's information, especially for this particular encyclopedia article.) <a href="../../../j/2E/r/User%7EJ.R._Hercules_fd8f.html" title="User:J.R.

And yet, the Klein article was cited by a dishonest Wiki editor as an example of a link between anti-globalism and anti-Semitism? And the editor's rationale for making this connection?

<li><b>Commentary</b> At this point, it would be useful to include some historical context regarding this article. Almost two years ago, it was subject to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Anti-globalization_and_Anti-Semitism_05b8.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Anti-globalization and Anti-Semitism">another Afd challenge</a>. One of the principal defenders of the article from two years ago? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a>, who's back to lobby once again for the article's retention. This is what SlimVirgin has to say <b>today</b> in defense of keeping the article:</li>
<li><i>"Keep. The page isn't well written, but there are reliable, scholarly sources available who explicitly address this issue, and who can be added to improve it."</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><i>"Comment. I've tidied it a little and added some more material."</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now contrast SlimVirgin's current remarks with what she said <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Anti-globalization_and_Anti-Semitism_05b8.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Anti-globalization and Anti-Semitism">two years ago during the first Afd challenge</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"Note: the article has been tidied and references have been added. The allegations are certainly notable: for example, there's an article about the issue on a website run by Yale University."</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><i>Keep. This does seem to be a legitimate topic judging by Google searches. I've tidied it up a bit, have added a couple of extra sources, have found links for the quotes already there, and have added a references section.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, it's nearly two full years later, and the "tidying up" from the first time around has turned into..."tidying up". If the article merely had to be "tidied up" two years ago, and yet its defenders are <b>still</b> saying that all that needs to be done is to apply some "tidying up", just how viable of an article could this be? <a href="../../../j/2E/r/User%7EJ.R._Hercules_fd8f.html" title="User:J.R.

<dd>Yes, she significantly improved it in April 2005, and improved it even more now. I can only surmise that you were making your comments to thank SlimVirgin for her tireless efforts to improve Wikipedia articles. It's becoming one of Wikipedia's best articles - no doubt that's why the discussion here is even more strongly in favour of keeping the article than in April 2005. If only the early commenters who almost unanimously voted "Delete" could have seen the article in its current condition, I'm sure the non-politically motivated among them would have voted quite differently - one can see how the trend has changed on this, concurrent with SlimVirgin's diligent work. Of course, Wikipedia articles are always a work in progress - no doubt someone will come along one day and improve it even more - odds are that person will again be SlimVirgin, she seems dedicated to actually helping Wikipedia, rather than just pushing a political agenda. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:44, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hercules, the reason my first attempt at tidying petered off was that I was confronted by editors who were trying to slant the article to imply there is no antisemitism in the movement, so I gave up and took the wretched thing off my watchlist. The only reason I returned was that I saw it was up for deletion again. This happens a lot around these articles — people try to fix them but get discouraged by the shenanigans. Aren't you glad your nomination led to its finally being improved and (it appears) kept? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:05, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When I first read the Brake fade article it was fairly concise although based on two items of folklore (that drums expand and that brake shoes produce gas, both effects separating brake shoe from drum). When I offered a rewrite, explaining the cause of brake fade, author "justanother" rejected it, replacing the original version. In successive exchanges "justanother" edited his article to spred it under several subheadings with no change to the cause of brake fade. This folklore is backed up by an article in an auto enthusiasts magazine that neither explains how it can occur or shows a scientific basis for the claimed effect. I explained the phenomenon, its cause and gave reference to a Michigan State University publication that corroberates my description. I also cite Wikipedia items that support my text.<a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobstbrandt_df5e.html" title="User:Jobstbrandt">Jobst</a> 04:51, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Wrong, but certainly forgivable in a student publication when disk brakes were pretty new. Anyway, I reformatted the article without changing much specifically so that he could add his material on drum brake fade; a topic on which he seems very knowledgable. I went out of my way to be helpful; see the article talk page. But nope, it is his novel idea or nothing, I guess.

<li>"justanother" may have found 368,000 hits but when investigated they mostly repeat drum brake folklore, the man on the street not understanding servo and positive feedback. Many of these hits are bicycle brakes that have myriad light weight problems that compromise performance before getting to heavy braking. Their's is not fade but rather loss of hand lever travel from weak brake lines and contaminated brake fluid. That is not brake fade. In contrast, Bendix<a href="http://www.roadranger.com/Roadranger/productssolutions/brakes/airdiscbrakes/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.roadranger.com/Roadranger/productssolutions/brakes/airdiscbrakes/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, a major automotive brake manufacturer, shows a disk brake and states that there is no fade, which is typical for aoutomotive brakes, except that it is such a non issue that no one, other than users of drum brakes, talks about it. You'll notice the disk is not drilled full of holes to let gas from the brake pads escape. The Bendix page is aimed at truck manufacturers who still use drum brakes... that fade. That is the only reason fade is mentioned. Truckers and many truck engineers have been so latherd with these tales that fade is "common knowledge"! Instead of imputing the Michigan State University author (shoot the messenger), a refutation of that engineering report would be more credible. This Brake fade article is important because somewhere science and folklore must be separated. Validated in Wikipedia may make folklore live for a long time.<a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobstbrandt_df5e.html" title="User:Jobstbrandt">Jobst</a> 09:37, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Jobst, that is a great reference and I wish that you would use it to improve the article rather than to abuse the process here. It is clear from the article that friction fade is a factor on disk brakes and that Bendix has claimed to made a breakthrough to reduce it. Good for them! The issue of fluid fade is not addressed because Bendix is not selling brake fluid in that ad. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 13:34, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>i was going to do that, but theres nothing to merge; <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messiah.html" title="Messiah">messiah</a> already has just about everything this article says arguably in a more organized way. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_A_865a.html" title="User:Bob A">Bob A</a> 07:26, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>If the content is already substantially similar, then merging the content will be easier. Personally, I would suggest differentiation, as I do see a difference between the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messiah.html" title="Messiah">messiah</a> and the prophecies about them which this article should be covering.

<ul>
<li>That is not the point, Bob A. When two articles are duplicate, we merge them. If that means adding info from one article to the other, thats good. If there is no information to add (because it already is all there), we simply make a redirect. We do not delete articles in these cases. This way the author history is preserved. Because the chance exists some people already have used info from article X to include in article Y prior to this and the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> requires all author history to be preserved, we <i>merge</i> and <i>don't delete</i>.

<p><i>At this point, some of the Wikipedia staff get suspicious and propose that the article be deleted because "subject appears to be non-existant." You think? This of course begs the question why this is STILL up on Wikipedia, even though it's been almost two months since the dogs at Wiki started suspiciously sniffing around. This is where we should really start tipping our hats to the creators of Zack Vank. Realizing that their fun was going to be short-lived if all they did was provide unsubstantiated information and start sexual orientation rumors, they created an external link to the high school Zack Vank supposedly went to, the Redwood High School previously mentioned at the end of my first post about him. Not only did they do that, they created a little profile for him there so that if anyone on Wikipedia got suspicious, they could click on the link and see:</i> [made up quote] <b><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave6_6c0a.html" title="User:Dave6"><font color="blue">Dave</font></a></b><font color="blue">6</font> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave6_be96.html" title="User talk:Dave6"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 09:35, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - not spam. I wrote this on my talk page which is related to this: I'm 16-years-old and a full-time high school student. In my spare time, I write for Wikinews, Wikipedia, and recently, Practical eCommerce. I draw inspiration for what I write about from things I read and watch, people I meet, and generally things that interest me (including e-commerce and search engines). I follow some local (Christchurch) companies including Netconcepts. Sometimes the things I write about get me noticed (I got to know a couple people at Netconcepts because of some of the writing I've done), which is cool when it happens but I'm not here just to network. Don't worry, I always keep a NPOV when I write.&#160;:-) Even when it gets me in trouble (like it did here Talk:SLI_Systems). <a href="../../../n/z/g/User%7ENzgabriel_ecaf.html" title="User:Nzgabriel">Nzgabriel</a> 04:55, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Coming to this article as a new pair of eyes, my immediate reaction is deep unease. As it stands the article looks dangerously like spam/advertising. I'm deeply perturbed by the NZ Herald articles, which have all the hallmarks of lazy journalists cribbing from corporate press releases, and the other articles are slightly too hagiographic of the company's founder to make me feel they're unbiased. This is one of those "snowball/heck" cases: I can see the way this debate's going, but my every instinct would be to <b>delete</b> for lack of real ( independent, non-press release ) sources. It doesn't seem to me that this article really passes <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, on the grounds that we don't have enough truly independent sources. At the very least, I'd like to suggest a good <b>Clean up</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Since I am the creator of the article, you know what I will say as far as keep or delete. However, I do have some comments. In reference to <a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a>, Yes, the "1" isn't first place but the fact that the Permian Band has never gotten anything but a "1" in it's existence and is the only school in Texas, I believe (There may be one more), that has a streak of "1" ratings ever since creation is different than just getting a "1" on occasion. The other thing I would have to say is that the main article, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permian_High_School_0544.html" title="Permian High School">Permian High School</a>, is more for the football and <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friday_Night_Lights_%28film%29_d748.html" title="Friday Night Lights (film)">Friday Night Lights</a> portion of the school. I would rather it be merged if faced with deletion but the addition of such would be out of place, in my opinion. <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEaglesmarty08_c3c8.html" title="User:Eaglesmarty08">Eaglesmarty08</a> 21:32, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The school's own article can and certainly should be more than just football and <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friday_Night_Lights_%28film%29_d748.html" title="Friday Night Lights (film)">Friday Night Lights</a>, and that is where this content (stripped of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">directory</a> entries) belongs. Also, I am not saying there was any intent to deceive with the use of "straight 1 rating", but there is clearly the potential to mislead, and I thank you for the clarification. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 07:36, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>Speedy Keep</b>. Articles for deletion is not clean-up, and since the nominator suggests the material should be merged, the nomination is not seeking deletion.

Also as there are no deletion arguments made beyond the nominator's, I am invoking <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignore all rules</a>. In this instance the encyclopedia is not best served by the deletion of the articles, but rather by the improving of them. Also note the specific passage at WP:NOT reads <b>A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger topic.</b> I would suggest these ancilliary articles form part of a larger topic, and that this matter is better discussed at the article talk page for the time being. I would also suggest that where editors identify potential problems, they first look to fix the problems rather than seek deletion. Since the issue's which led to this nomination can be addressed by adding real world context, deletion is not the appropriate solution to the problem. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 10:04, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page violates WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE section seven - the page contains nothing more than a plot summary, which is specifically prohibited. It fails to make any establishment of historical significance, any impact, real-world context or analysis. Furthermore, I fail to see any potential for development here that could not go into the Sword of Truth series page, or Terry Goodkind's personal page. I therefore nominate this page for deletion.</p>
<p>For the same reason, I am also nominating the following books from the same series:</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Despite lacking sources it is clear the plot over views are to big to fit on the series page because of the number of books. Nomination should be nominating all of the books not just this one.--155.144.251.120 05:21, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good point, I'll add the rest to the nomination. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by MPoint (<a href="../../../m/p/o/User_talk%7EMPoint_0d11.html" title="User talk:MPoint">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPoint_420e.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPoint">contribs</a>) 05:22, 21 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Can definitely be improved on. Several of these books have been on best-seller lists, and I fail to see how historical significance or real-world context is a criteria for notability. <i><b><a href="../../../b/i/b/User%7EBibliomaniac15_4b0f.html" title="User:Bibliomaniac15"><font color="black">bibliomaniac</font></a><a href="../../../b/i/b/User_talk%7EBibliomaniac15_e27b.html" title="User talk:Bibliomaniac15"><font color="red">1</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bibliomaniac15_b1b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bibliomaniac15"><font color="blue">5</font></a></b></i> 05:31, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am not nominating the series on a lack of notability; I am nominating them for violating WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE section seven. To put it in plain english, the pages are plot summaries, which are prohibited.MPoint</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Book is clearly notable as part of a best-selling series. If the content bothers you, tag it for clean-up or merge. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:33, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As above, the problem isn't notability; it is that the pages are of an inherently unencyclopedic nature. Anything of value can safely be put on the series page - the only content the individual book pages add is a series of plot summaries, which are forbidden by WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE section seven. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by MPoint (<a href="../../../m/p/o/User_talk%7EMPoint_0d11.html" title="User talk:MPoint">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPoint_420e.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPoint">contribs</a>) 05:39, 21 February 2007 (UTC).</small>
<ul>
<li>And that is not a deletion problem, that's a clean-up problem. The problem here is the content needs improvement, not the subject. Tag it for clean-up, take it to the talk pages. Deletion? That's just the wrong response. It's neither necessary or desirable. You've posted this response several times, but you haven't yet said much about cleaning up the pages. Why not add the appropriate clean-up tags instead of deleting? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:34, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>BTW, you've added the other pages, but even if I accepted your argument as grounds for deletion, it seems to me that you didn't look at the pages themselves before adding them. <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard%27s_First_Rule_6c0e.html" title="Wizard's First Rule">Wizard's First Rule</a> though not what I would consider a high-quality article is slightly more than a plot summary. Again, I would suggest cleanup not deletion. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:38, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But, as stated and bolded below, it must be part of a larger topic. As it stands, the overwhelming portion of the article is summary; the focus must be on the surrounding material, either by shrinking the summary to uselessness or increasing the size of the other segments. What, though, are we to include in the article? Sales figures, awards, the wizards rules list and such? All of those will easily fit on the serie's main page and the author's page, leaving nothing but the summaries for the book pages, which would be a violation of policy. Thus, the need for individual book pages is eliminated. Thus, my recommendation that they be deleted and redirected to the Sword of Truth series page, with all non-summary information moved to the other page, and perhaps a SHORT summary of what the series is about. Having just checked, however, I now note that there IS no main page for the Sword of Truth series, neccessitating its creation. I, being currently busy, will make such a page for it tomorrow.MPoint
<ul>
<li>Actually, you're wrong, there is <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sword_of_Truth_bad9.html" title="The Sword of Truth">The Sword of Truth</a> which does cover the series as a whole. The fact is, your problem is not a deletion issue, it's a clean-up problem. If you don't feel the individual books in the series would need a page of their own, try the {{merge}} tag. Go to the <a href="../../../s/o/t/WP%7ESoT_b4ad.html" title="WP:SoT">Sword of Truth</a> Wikiproject. Convince people of what you feel is appropriate. Deletion, however, is not the proper route to go here. Not as a first step. As it stands, I just see this as the wrong approach. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 07:39, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah, I had missed it, as it is not linked from the Sword of Truth project page, or the individual book pages. I would support a merger if there was something to be merged, but as it stands, there isn't. All that is in the book pages that is not in the main page is a plot summary and list of characters, which is the problem - there is nothing usable or encyclopedic in the pages. We don't have any sense of why they're important, or what impact they're having on the world at large - no information as to how well it sold, or who recognizes it as important, no examination into its hidden meanings or who looks to it for inspiration. A lot of work went into these articles, and it's a shame to see it wasted, but the fact stands that it's not proper Wikipedia material, and would be better placed on a fansite. The main article, now that I have read it, says everything that needs to be said. MPoint
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Actually, the plot summaries and lists of characters are quite encyclopedic and are valid content for a merger. You seem to have this idea that plot summaries absolutely cannot be on Wikipedia. That is not true(and if it were, it'd mean thousands of pages would have to be pruned). the problem is when plot summaries are the only thing in an article. Well, given that these are books, the plots and characters will have to be covered, so the question is detail and context. Can more be added to add real world perspective? Maybe, maybe not, though given that these are best-sellers, I would not take your word on faith about that. But again, as I see it, in this case, your problems are more properly clean-up issues, not deletion ones. There are many templates that can be used to mark an article for clean-up or improvement so that interested parties can act. You should have tried that method, not AfD. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 08:35, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Show me how the plot summaries from each book can be merged into the main series article without losing important detail or bloating it beyond reason, and I will agree merge is the right option. At the moment, I believe that the best option would be to write a completely new (and short) summary for the entire series, as it would be significantly easier to write something like that from scratch. Character lists? Perhaps. The best option for that might be a new list, indicating which characters were in which books, on a single page, as opposed to broken up the way it is now. As stated below, putting up a cleanup tag and talk page notice would have been better form, I agree (which, to avoid putting up a dozen articles on AfD in one night, I have done with other books suffering this problem) - but here we are now, and if nothing else, we'll probably see distinct improvement over the next five days if such is possible. I hope that I'm proven wrong, and the article improves, as I dislike removing any article from Wikipedia; but, if it does not improve, then its removal will be in the best interests of the series.MPoint</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(reducing indent) To be honest, I don't believe that an appropriate level of description from each book would fit into a single article on the series, so if you did propose a merge, I wouldn't support it. Individual articles in this case are my preference, and I'd rather expand the articles with more content. But at least a merge would have some plausibility to it. If that did happen, then yes, the current articles would need to be pruned. However, given that this content does exist, that it is valid and accurate, I would prefer to keep it as a baseline rather than start over from scratch. There is no need to throw the baby out with the bathwater here. The fact is, removal of otherwise valid information is not in the best interest of anybody. It'd be one thing if this was poorly written, or absolute nonsense. But it's not. It's just some articles on books that are best-sellers, and so do deserve some mention on Wikipedia. So why delete? I can't imagine why. Improvement is the better choice here. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:30, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To be honest, I see no baby here to be discarded. There is one section, success, in the first book which can be added to the main article, or (if the rest of the article were shrunk to near-stub level) could be kept, but the rest of the articles have nothing to use outside of their own (policy-violating) articles. To summarize the series is best done from scratch, because individual book summaries have a level of detail that cannot be used in a series summary, leaving them completely separate. Character lists, if they choose to make such a list, may be a valid argument for merging that particular information from the articles, but such a suggestion had not been made prior to this AfD. The books deserve mention, yes. They deserve a redirect to the main Sword of Truth page, where they can be mentioned as a list, and can be of use as reference for a discussion of how the series arcs in its philosophy and development.MPoint
<ul>
<li>I don't agree that it's best to start from scratch, the current quality of the articles is not so poor as to make that mandatory or desirable. They are at least some kind of foundation to build upon. I simply feel that's a better way to do things. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:29, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>(reducing indent again)I'm not saying that the quality of the summaries are poor, merely that as they were written to summarize a book, their focus is inherently unsuable for a summary of a series. It's best to look at what the major events of a book are in relation to the series as a whole are when writing a series summary, and it is more difficult to do so when you trying to figure that out from the summary of a book written with an inherent focus on an individual book. That said, it can be done either way, and discussing which method is superior is really a matter of taste. I guess agreeing to disagree would probably be best on that point&#160;:) .MPoint</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No, I wouldn't say their focus is unusable. Perhaps not completely what is desired, but they're still of some utility. It'd take something of far worse quality for me to agree it was unusable. Besides, I'd prefer the individual books have a page anyway, so it's a non-issue for me. Tag them for clean-up and move on.

A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a <b>larger topic.</b>" If the articles were to focus primarily on something that wasn't a summary, there would be no problem.

Hence, the deletion.MPoint

<li>I <i>do</i> believe it to be unsalvagable, however, as there lacks sufficient information to include per book that will be substantially different from the main series page. It will therefore be either redundant or in permanent violation of section seven, meaning that it fails the policy guidelines, and can thus be deleted under the same grounds as any other WP:NOT violation.

<ul>
<li>I happen to disagree, but that <i>is</i> just my opinion. If you <i>do</i> think they are unsalvageable, then your nomination certainly becomes valid. However (assuming they are unsalvageable), would you support a merge into a "Sword of Truth" series (proposed on the articles or to the articles' primary authors)? I can understand and perhaps even be convinced by arguments that separate articles shouldn't exist, but I don't think the content should just be deleted, when it can be cut down and moved to a more appropriate place.

<ul>
<li>I really wish that merging was an option for more of the articles, but I don't think that it is. Taking a look at the articles again, the Success section of Wizard's First Rule could and should probably be merged into the Sword of Truth main article, but the other articles don't even list the release dates of the books, and the two articles that give a brief discussion of the philosophy in their respective books do so without citing any sources, leaving them unusable. It is my sincere hope that the articles make a dramatic improvement over the next five days, demonstrating my nomination to have been a horrible mistake, but the articles as they stand now are almost useless, and the series as a whole would be better served by removing the individual book articles. A new summary of the Sword of Truth series would be needed for the main article, however, as a reasonably short summary for the series cannot be made from the summaries for the books. I can be convinced that the articles aren't unsalvagable, mind you - it's entirely possible that there is some dimension of expansion that I hadn't previously considered, and I may have been too judgemental because of the excessive size of the current summaries.

<ul>
<li>The problem is not the size of the summary and lack of other content; those are symptoms. The problem is the lack of <i>potential</i> for each of these for every book. One page for all of the books would be very reasonable, and I would have no problem with it. As it stands, however, they lack the potential to reasonably fill the space that individual book pages offer them. A summary as a tool to help one understand the series and how it has impacted the world is encyclopedic and necessary. To have the summary be the focus is unencyclopedic, and detracts from the usefulness of the section as a whole.MPoint
<ul>
<li>I don't see any need for the books to "fill the space that individual book pages offer them" as not every article needs to be full of in-depth content. But given that they are best-sellers, I'd say it's at least as possible with them as it is with any other book with its own article. If these articles don't contain that content, that's the article's problem, not the subject's. In any case, your problem is best expressed as a clean-up issue not a deletion one. If you don't feel there is a need for individual articles, try proposing a merger. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 07:39, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps I was a bit hasty in my nomination, as it is bad form to not give a warning first, but I consdier it a valid one. As for it being possible for them to fill their content, I don't believe it is, at least not without a good deal of overlap with the other book pages - from a strictly organizational perspective, I believe it would be better to keep all of the information on the series on one page. The main Sword of Truth page seems to be exactly what I had in mind, and what I believe to be near the limit of what could be reasonably written on the subject.MPoint</li>

<li>Ah, thank you. I'll tag them for cleanup now, and nominate for deletion if no talk or action is generated from the tag/talk page. The Harry Potter page is borderline, however; the introduction, missing text section, and displays of different covers comes very close to pushing it out of "mainly a plot summary". Perhaps the Fellowship of the Ring page is different from my cursory scan of it (I'll check before I tag it), but it appears to be mainly a summary at the moment. MPoint</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Though I see MPoint's point, my gut fails to agree and application of his criteria would require the deletion of virtually every novel on wikipedia that's not a literary masterpiece with multiple reviews and academic analysis. Articles should be expanded with whatever information can be added (sales, best-seller status at minimum, these particular articles could probably be expanded with Goodkind's opinions on what the themes of the novels are (but only the themes, not their impact on literature, the world or people). I agree with Black Falcon, Mister.Manticore and the other keep votes. Fix, add content, don't delete. Given Goodkind's agenda of adding significant philosophical content to the fantasy world and books in general, linking plot points with his overall writing goals should be possible, though sourcing may be problematic.</li>

<i>"should" is the magic word in the passage quoted from "What Wikipedia is not". "should" refers to something desirable rather than to a prerequisite. "should" is not synonymous </i>

<p>applies in the case of all the novels.

That would therefore indicate that this is a valid nomination, if perhaps overly harsh. That said, if you can tell me what else you plan on adding in the next month, and how you are going to change the article sizes to emphasize the new material while minimizing the summaries, and how the new structure could not be handled more effectively through use of the main Sword of Truth page and Author page, then I will happily reverse my position in this AfD as having been premature.MPoint</li>

If a <i>significant</i> section on the themes and philosophy of each book can be written for <i>each</i> book, without <i>any</i> reliance on the other books of the series, and based on <i>reliable sources</i>, then I will agree that the individual book pages can stay, though the summaries would probably need to be shortened. As it stands, however, I suspect that it would be easier, shorter, and more organized to discuss the philisophical themes of the series as a whole, with references to which books stress which themes the most.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I think MPoint may be confusing the need to delete with the need to expand. Could all the above articles be improved with historical significance, critical commentary, and third-party analysis? Of course (assuming it could be done in a neutral, NPOV tone citing credible, notable references). But to even consider deleting these pages? That is completely ludicrous. All the novels in the series (apart from the first two) have been New York Times Bestsellers, with the series as a whole having sold tens of millions of copies worldwide. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunch_22cb.html" title="User:Runch">Runch</a>
<ul>
<li>I do not believe that they can be improved <i>on an individual basis</i> in a way that would not invite redundancy, or be better organized by a section on the article's main page or the author's page.

Millions of books sold (a more precise number added to all of the book pages would have been helpful in preventing this, by the way, as well as how long they were on the bestseller's list) is not an excuse to ignore policyMPoint</li>

<li>In addition to the fact that these articles obviously pass Notability guidelines, I'd like to make a reference to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Novels_ArticleTemplate_8953.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels/ArticleTemplate">Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels/ArticleTemplate</a>. All the articles listed follow the <a href="../../../n/o/v/WP%7ENOVELS_3258.html" title="WP:NOVELS">WP:NOVELS</a> guidelines, and they are clearly not "just plot summaries".

And they are <i>mostly</i> summary, falling afoul of the last half of section seven; "A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a <b>larger topic.</b>". They currently are not, as the summaries ARE the topic of the article. Say I'm being too harsh or too legalistic perhaps, but these are valid grounds.MPoint</li>

<li>You misunderstand me. Yes, I do dislike the series, but I recognize that it is a notable work and a valid subject for wikipedia; what I do not agree with is the existance of individual book pages that contain nothing but a plot summary. If every individual book has enough information to be compliant with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE</a> section seven, then add it; if not, remove the book pages, and add a <i>brief</i> series plot summary to the main article. We must be policy compliant.MPoint

<li>As a matter of fact, I'm currently in the process of putting cleanup tags on most of those articles; if you check, you'll find that I've already finished tagging all of the Wheel of time novels, as well as couple of the Song of Ice and Fire articles; some of them, however, are borderline, and so were left with a message on their talk page. A Dance with Dragons is fine at the moment. Thank you for the other suggestions of what to tag, though! If these aren't fixed within a reasonable period of time, then yes, they will also be nominated for deletion. And I am also convinced that there are several hundred other novels and books that are currently in violation of section seven, hence why I'm going about doing this. I have no interest in picking fights, however, as you insinuate, I only have an interest in maintaining the policies of Wikipedia. Something needed to be AfD'd, and this series happened to be the first non-borderline case I stumbled upon. Was it hasty to not tag it for cleanup first? Yes, as I have previously stated. What can I say, I was in a bad mood, and it happens. But now that it is here, I stand by my decision; it was in poor form, but it <i>was</i> justified under the polices.MPoint
<ul>
<li>For the record, you're using the wrong tag. These articles really don't need cleanup (which implies that grammar, formatting, order, etc. needs to be fixed). If anything, use a more specific tag, such as the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpand_6021.html" title="Template:Expand">Expand tag</a>. - <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunch_22cb.html" title="User:Runch">Runch</a> 23:47, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Having a quick look at the Malazan pages, and the SoT pages for that matter, there's lots of content that's not just plot summary. The info boxes for one, contain an enormous amount of relevant real-world information. Accordingly, by that measure alone none of these should be AFD. Also, editors deciding to spend their time working on other articles is not a reason to nominate it for deletion. The time taken to put up all the tags could have probably been used to move at least one of them to the point where it did not need it. All of us have limited time, and this AFD is not a good use of it. Since there is no chance that any of these pages are going to be deleted, I'm not spending any more time on this one. <a href="../../../w/l/u/User%7EWLU_ad34.html" title="User:WLU">WLU</a> 00:04, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As the focus of the articles are the summary, the infoboxes are insufficient to address WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE section seven. As for the accusation that I'm wasting my time by tagging, they took approximately one minute a piece to tag after I read the articles, and felt that I should not add any new information before consulting with the people who had been working on the article previously. At no point did I suggest that editors working on other articles as opposed to these ones were a reason for deletion, and I resent the implication that I stated so. That said, if it were taking longer then five minutes a piece to write these while I wait for responses from other people at work, I would probably not be spending time on this AfD either, for simple fact that I suspect we're just restating our arguments at this point.MPoint</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yes and no; the cleanup tag is specifically supposed to be a generic tag to catch anything the more specific tags lack. Tags covering what you believe cleanup implies would be the copyedit, spelling, and restructuring tags. More specific tags for my particular complaint might be unencyclopedic (though I felt that would have been perceived as too hostile), the cleanup-book tag, one of the context tags, or one of the expansion tags. However, the expansion tag or context tags would have been <i>too</i> specific; removal of summary or addition of new material both could deal with the issue, and both exclude the other. that said, I had thought that I was using the cleanup-book tag, and I'm quite uncertain as to how I missed the fact that I wasn't for a good ten articles or so.MPoint</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia deletion policy states, "deletion is based upon policy and not personal likes and dislikes."

<li>On the contrary. For an article that states its subject is a college "humorist", organizing a one-off, minor pseudo-protest that backfires (ie. isn't funny) is not notable.

<li>Yes, I noticed that article when debating this one, and thought it deserved an AfD as well. As it is different enough (one a comic, the other a game: one exists, the other is in development: ...), I thought it would be a bad idea to make this a mass nomination (something I normally don't oppose though). But the fact that they are both listed is not a mere coincidence of course. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 14:59, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b>. The article for the main comic doesn't say much about the spinoff except that it exists, so it seems to me that it'd be better to move the content into there and then get rid of what's unnecessary. (Incidentally, when I tried Googling "The Wotch: Cheer!" I got nearly 600 hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22The+Wotch%3A+Cheer%21%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22The+Wotch%3A+Cheer%21%22" rel="nofollow">(see for yourself)</a> - it seems to depend on which country's version of Google you use to do the search.

<li>Again, not a valid argument: <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOGLEHITS_9f7d.html" title="WP:GOOGLEHITS">WP:GOOGLEHITS</a>.

<li>There are 600 hits, but some 60 or 70 distinct hits (click on page 10 of your Google search and see how many results you get: add -wikipedia to exclude wikipedia and most of its mirrors, as these aren't reliable independent sources anyway). This does not depend on the version of Google, that is just a skin (except for some notorious cases like Google China perhaps), Google.be gives exactly the same results as Google.com. Anyway, the number of Googlehits, while a possible indicator for (lack of) notability, is not a reason for deletion in itself: the lack of reliable, non-trivial sources amongst those hits is a good reason though (except when people would be able to give good sources which do not appear in a Google search of course). You have the best chance of finding a good source when looking for the exact title, preferably with the author included (can you imagine a review of a book, comic, webcomic in a reliable source that doesn't mention both the name of the webcomic and the name (pseudonym) of the author?

<li><b>Merge</b> This comic is currently number 26 in the TWC, has remained in that area for about a year or so now. Also has several cannonical and non-cannonical ties to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wotch_1335.html" title="The Wotch">The Wotch</a>, and why is it that the Google test only works to prove non-notability, but not notability? Anyways, Redirecting this to The Wotch would just plain and simple be wrong, This may not be 'notable' enough to get its own article, but as Vikedal said, star trek TNG and star trek aren't the same, redirecting gives the wrong impression to somebody who doesn't know the subject. Merging will offer some clarity to fix that problem (I hope) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheturtlehermit_0269.html" title="User:Theturtlehermit">Theturtlehermit</a> 15:42, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Not that I know of right now, I am contacting Tbar (the author) to see if he has any mainstream media, I doubt that there has been...but then again, EGS was writen up in a paper on geneology, so weirder things have happened. I should get better info on TWC in one to two business days, and on media of Cheer! in about a day or so depending on Tbar's schedule...<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheturtlehermit_0269.html" title="User:Theturtlehermit">Theturtlehermit</a> 16:03, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I may be doing a wrong search here, but it looks like many notable webcomics are not even listed on TWC: Penny Arcade, PvP, Schlock Mercenary, 8-bit theatre, ... Doesn't this make the value of this topwebcomics a bit less than it appeared at first to be? It's not only a reader's poll (not a reliable source, but could be an indicator of popularity), but a poll among a section of all webcomics that excludes a lot of the most popular and best known ones... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 06:28, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>This may be true, but just because <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a> isn't on <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> doesn't mean that it is any less notable. I believe, and once again, I do have outstanding requests for verification about this, that any webcomic can register freely for this list, which makes Cheer!'s constant possition in the upper to mid 20's even better. Accoriding to Tbar, when he first regestered for this it started out just about where it is now, for over a year and a half. Also, Tbar said he didn't have any mainsteam media writeups that he knew about. Which is why I have from the start said <b>merge</b> because this comic has enough notability to merit a paragraph or two, but not enough on whole to merit its own page, at least by current notability standards. Is that clearer? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheturtlehermit_0269.html" title="User:Theturtlehermit">Theturtlehermit</a> 12:57, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Good question about "why is it that the Google test only works to prove non-notability, but not notability?" - going by the WP: GOOGLEHITS rule mentioned above, the low number of hits can't be used as an argument <i>for</i> deleting the article, either. (I wasn't aware of that rule, by the way - I just thought I should mention that I got a different result to Fram's. Thanks to Part Deux for informing me.) All the same, I'll try a few other search engines and see if I can find anything useful. DGemmell 20:27, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm glad to see that the deletion is being discussed. If Cheer! fails Wikipedia's rules, I will not object or think poorly upon such a deletion. I was, however, very disturbed by the initial redirect by <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a>, as it rather effectively deleted the article without the burden of proof or input by the community; the "courtesy" that was mentioned. It is unfortunate that this AfD has been put forward by the same person who circumvented the due process, but that does not deny the potential validity of the claim. Now we will see what the proper consensus is.<br />
<br />
As the author, my opinions are not valid here; I have far too much invested. However, I would like to point out that Google does have very different results depending on the country of origin. It is not just a skin... I discovered and confirmed this fact a while ago when my page was linked first in Google under... a somewhat disturbing search string. I would also like to point out that the name of the comic is not and never has been "The Wotch: Cheer!" in its entirety. This was an error that has persisted to this day due to the images used in the webpage design. The name of the comic in question is simply "Cheer!" Hopefully this will help you more accurately determine the reach of this comic. I leave you to your deliberations. Tselsebar 01:53, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, that does remind me - on my webpage I get very different incoming traffic from different country "editions" of Google. And now I have to go check on the title "cheer."

For my part, I was merely commenting on the mistaken belief that the different Google pages are only skins, and the results are identical, which is not the case.

<li>If by separate he means 'should not be merged', then all we can do is delete it. Keeping something only because it is a separate entity is not an argument. AS for the I like it: the second sentence of his or her keep opinion is nothing but I like it. But in the end, I don't really care about ILIKEIT, OTHERCRAPEXISTS, and other flawed keep arguments: as long as someone doesn't give arguments which counter the deletion reason(s) given in the nomination and possible additional deletion reasons given in othere delete opinions, then his or her opinion, while perhaps interesting, is of no value in determining the consensus as to whether any article meets the standards for inclusion in Wikipedia. If editors don't agree with the standards, they should take it up on the talk page of said standards: until then, those are the guidelines and policies we have to follow, and any other&#160;!vote basically boils down to "we have to keep it because it is useful, it is popular, it does no harm, or I like it". Like the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> (a policy, not an essay) says, "deletion is based upon policy and not personal likes and dislikes." "They are separate entities" is not a reason to keep an article based on any policy or guideline.

<li>Ok, look all I was trying to say is that if you are going to discount anybody's votes, please do so for an appropriate reason, that said, I do feel that while these are seperate entities, they could be legitimately merged, (kinda like how <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joanie_loves_Chachi_9021.html" title="Joanie loves Chachi">Joanie loves Chachi</a> could be merged with <a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_Days_98db.html" title="Happy Days">Happy Days</a>) because while they are sperate they do stem from the same tide.

<li><b>Keep</b>The inclusion of this webcomic in an independent listing of popular titles in the genre (i.e. named noteworthy by those who read webcomics, just as a movie is made noteable by the large percentage of moviegoers who buy tickets to see it, thus giving it a rank in the 'top ten') makes it notable.

The same goes for the Halo series of books (Cite: OXM, Winter '06, the one with the Halo: Ghosts of Onyx Preview in it). They are considered Fan-made Canon simply because they are NOT made by Bungie, But the writer (In 3 of 4 cases, Eric Nylund) Got approval for the storyline from Bungie, to make sure it was in Continuity with the Halo Storyline. <a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVikedal_6e99.html" title="User:Vikedal">Vikedal</a> 05:58, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> As one of the developing staff of The Wotch: My Sister, Myself, the game is not far enough along to warrant a wiki page.

<li><b>Keep/Merge</b> You're pretty much saying that "Hey, it hasn't been released, and google/amazon don't care, so it's not notable" to most of the webcomic AfD's i've seen. Have a look at what's happening here. If Halo 3 didn't have the fanbase, it would have no google or amazon hits, thus making it "Not Notable" and AfD'able, which i'm sure some game-hating NUT would do. Give it some time, because the whole point of Wikipedia is to be an encyclopedia, and this one definitely helped me out on some aspects of the game (Beforehand, i had no clue what the game was about).<a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVikedal_6e99.html" title="User:Vikedal">Vikedal</a> 05:54, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>You are quite correct: if noone had ever bought or even released Halo 2, the article on Halo 3 would be deletable. If no one had ever read or done a production of Shakespeare, his article and the article on his works would better be deleted as well. But what kind of argument is that? Halo 3 <i>is</i> notable, the article is referenced to reliable sources (part of them independent ssecondary sources), and this is one of these cases where you know that the game will be reviewed extensively, whether it is brilliant or it sucks. On the other hand, this is a game where little is known and nothing is written by independent reliable sources, and it is doubtful if even if it would ever be released, such reviews would appear anyway. If that does happen however, and this game does get notability, then nothing stops you from creating an article for it. An encyclopedia is not supposed to give you information on everything because it may one day become notable (every kid may one day become notable), but because it is already notable, whether it is already released or not. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 06:16, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - and cleanup. I do not believe a merge in this case would be effective, since this <i>particular</i> topic has been the subject of discussion in the relevant religious circles quite independently of the individual herself. The discussion of the figure and her gift as it appears in literature and history require a significantly different treatment, so I believe the articles should both be retained and kept separate. Of course, this article requires some non-trivial cleanup and rewording. One case in point: "Ellen White didn't call herself a prophet, as there were others in America at the time who were claiming the title and giving it a bad name." Statements such as this are not encyclopedic unless they are <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">attributed</a>; otherwise they introduce the editors' point of view and likely quite a bit of original research as well. Still, problematic statements are not sufficient grounds for removing the entire article or simply merging the content with another topic from which it has sufficient verifiable independence. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">◄</font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel">Zahakiel</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">►</font></a> 18:13, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Shopping malls are major structures so I don't think <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> exactly applies here. They are especially relevant in parts of the world where not every town with more than 500 people has one. A number of the malls on the list are blue-linked and notable. The main problem is that the articles that have no links need to be sourced. Were it a list of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">living persons</a>, I might argue differently, but in this case I think we should keep and tag the article with {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}}. Most of the content seems easily verifiable (I did a google search for 5 randomly-selected malls). If there is a consensus to keep if sourced, I will go through and source any entries that are not blue-linked.

<li><b>Comment</b> Just out of curiosity, aren't lists like this meant for Categories? It seems like any shopping mall in India should be placed in a "Shopping Malls in India" category, rather than having a separate entry for such lists... I guess I agree with everyone that per current Wikipedia regulations, the list should stand. But maybe the topic of categories instead of lists should be discussed?

<li>Categories only work for persons/objects/events that already have WP articles.</li>

<li>I think categories are useful and should be used in many cases. However, I don't see why they cannot exists side-by-side with lists. In essence, I don't think being a list is itself a reason for deletion <i>unless</i> the list is highly inferior in quality to the category, which requries that it be redundant (all info contained in one is contained in the other), unreferenced, and simply a listing of names without any additional information or any form of subdivision (e.g., by location, time, etc.).

<p>This character was only in a single film with no expected sequels as of yet. The article is not even linked to on the actor nor the film's page. This article is unlikely to be expanded too much further and to my knowledge there are no other characters in the film that have articles. As a member of WP:Films, I have seen some character articles for more notable films (<i>Star Wars</i>, <i>The Matrix</i>, <i>Battle Royale</i>) and this one does not appear notable enough to have an article. Good film, but it is not necessary to have an article for Zach. <a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehrams2020_121d.html" title="User:Nehrams2020">Nehrams2020</a> 06:49, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>An article of the same name <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Martin_Hernandez_21a9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Martin Hernandez">previously deleted</a> for vandalism. The subject is a 15 year old mexican. Also bundled with article on the actress sister of the subject (aged 16), and a film ostensibly created by the young director which claims to have won a number of awards. No information available on the film. Likely hoax, but at best fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 08:09, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> as hoax article. Of the five Martin Hernandezes IMDB cites, this kid isn't any of them. The only <i>All Over Again</i> IMDB reports is a 2001 film, not a 2006 film, written and directed by Clive Nettles. One of the awards he claims doesn't exist, while the BIFA 2007 awards won't be issued until November and exclusively go to British-made films. The alleged IMDB link doesn't exist, the film's "official website" is a Myspace page, and I've spent too much time as it is backchecking this kid's spurious nonsense. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:57, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I suspect the rationale for db-tagging it was that the article (one sentence long) contains no actual assertion of notability. It tells you what the site is, but doesn't tell you why it's important, making it speedyable under A7. However, if we're going to put it through the full AfD process, then <b>delete</b> per no evidence of notability, external links to their own site, no proof of multiple coverage by reliable independent sources. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 10:42, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>One of the reasons I brought it here is precisely because I think it may be notable and the sources may exist. In other words, I'm asking people to help me look for the sources, and, should the sources fail to exist, only then should we decide upon deletion. As it stands, I was able to find one from google news: <a href="http://tech.yahoo.com/blogs/null/15109" class="external text" title="http://tech.yahoo.com/blogs/null/15109" rel="nofollow">an article on yahoo's tech blog</a>, which seems notable. It also received a mention from <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2085295,00.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2085295,00.asp" rel="nofollow">PCMag</a>.

<li>Very clever, Part Deux. <i>Technically</i> it now asserts notability, but it still has no evidence of independent sources to prove notability.

<li>Walton, please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. The reason I did that was so that we wouldn't keep on talking about "the article no longer asserts notability", when I was simply asking for us to be <i>searching</i> for notability, rather than claiming it doesn't <i>assert</i> it now. So I am asking others to help me find sources (rather than just vote) because they appear to exist. I've already provided a few, PCMag and yahoo business. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPart_Deux_5572.html" title="User:Part Deux">Part Deux</a> 15:57, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I apologise, I wasn't intending to assume bad faith, nor did I mean to imply that you were mis-using the process. As I said, if you can add the sources you mention to the article, then I will change my vote to Keep. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 16:22, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>NP. In any case, I've added the two articles, though they're a little silly. The first, the yahoo article, supports notability, but this particular article isn't about the product. The second, PCMag, just mentions it having a bad name. In any case, I bet 10:1 the sources exist somewhere. But, I gtg, so I can't check further.

<dd>Of course they should be in there. I will do that tomorrow if I don't forget, but my point is that a cursory check on Google could've prevented an AFD to begin with.

<p><b>Comment from closing admin</b>: In addition to the above listed images used only on the respective articles, I am also summarily deleting the following orphaned images (plus a few that are only used on articles for other "to be released" albums), since the creator seems to have a history of uploading fake/photoshopped album cover images. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2007-02-25 06:26Z</small></i></span></p>

<dd>They seem like unusual search terms, which would tend to militate against a redirect.

<dd>when they simply delete, instead of redirect.. someone always just re-creates it, and we go through this all over again, or redirect tot he AFD age anyway.. so save some time and headaches and redirect to begin with either to the AFD discussion or the artist page itself. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlankc_f56e.html" title="User:Alankc">Alankc</a> 23:11, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Well, it's a parkway.

After two minutes, the prod was removed by <a href="../../../n/e/2/User%7ENE2_ab1c.html" title="User:NE2">NE2</a> with the edit summary <i>"This is a clearly notable road."</i> I think not.

<p>This article deals with the group dynamics in a relationship with mentally ill people, especially borderlines and narcissists. While the topic this article tries to address is valid, this article is not maintainable. It would have to be rewritten <b>and</b> moved.<br />
This is impossible due to editorial gridlock. An article 'owner' has been trying to get rid of the page for more than half a year (strangely enough he never listed it for deletion). Work on this article is impossible (constant deletions reverts and what not appearing on the horizon, most writers will be scared off just like me). <b>There is no benefit in having this article</b>. Whoever wants to write on this topic should recreate the article under a more appropriate title, probably a broader topic like Relationships with mentally ill people. The topic is more of a self-help-topic which is covered by popular press and psychology. The article owner thinks that only natural science topics should be allowed on Wikipedia and cites numerous policies. (None of the policies confirms that of course.) It is pretty much impossible to cover the topic from the point of view of natural science due to its nature being a self-help-topic. The authors of the books that this article is based on are all social scientists (psychologists) not psychiatrists (natural scientists).<br />
A <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borderline_personality_disorder.html" title="Borderline personality disorder">Borderline personality disorder</a> would be <b>misleading</b>, because it covers the opposite of the article in question here and there is a whole group of people on this article who all oppose the inclusion of non-empirical research, popular culture material and self-help-literature. Which I agree with, the content of Non-BPD should not be merged into <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borderline_personality_disorder.html" title="Borderline personality disorder">Borderline personality disorder</a>. Keep popular culture topics separate from hard science. There is almost no <b>psychiatric</b> research about the group dynamics in a group with a mentally ill person which is what the sources for the Non-BPD article would be about. Group dynamics is not a subject psychiatry deals with.</p>

<dd><b>Reply</b> I haven't evaded anything as far as I can see. Without further valid evidence I have no choice but conclude that the term "Non-BPD" exists only as the topic of a self-help book called "Stop Walking on Eggshells" and it's non notable offshoots. As the book, in itself, seems little more than villification and marginalisation of anybody who can be percieved (not diagnosed, just percieved) to show show traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, a medical condition acknowledged to be caused largely by abuse in the first place. The main author of this book, Randy Kreger is a former (or maybe she still is) public relations consultant who's entire experience of Borderline Personality Disorder, at the time the book was written, consisted in attributing it to at least one family member. Now pardon me if I find all of that a little questionable in terms of validity, encyclopaedic value and NPOV. I make no secret of the fact that I would prefer the article be deleted, BUT I think it is only right and "Wikipaediac" (&lt;is that a word?) to try and establish/see if anyone can establish other valid credentials for the term "Non-BPD". I even went so far as to persuade an editor with appropriate qualifications to re-write a neutral, informed section on "Non-BPD" for the redirect to the <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borderline_personality_disorder.html" title="Borderline personality disorder">Borderline personality disorder</a> article<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Borderline_personality_disorder&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43445085" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Borderline_personality_disorder&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43445085" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>, and persuaded him to leave it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Borderline_personality_disorder&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=72380693" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Borderline_personality_disorder&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=72380693" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> when he wanted to delete it as a result of a book deal to write a book on the topic. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Borderline_personality_disorder&amp;oldid=72394670#Replaced_NonBP_Material_Removed_by_69.183.55.120" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Borderline_personality_disorder&amp;oldid=72394670#Replaced_NonBP_Material_Removed_by_69.183.55.120" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>.

<dd>So the agenda of the book by Mason/Kreger, according to you, would be that the authors are trying to vilify and marginalize borderlines? You probably misunderstood this book. There is a process Mason describes that encourages the reader to distance themselves from the person emotionally and try to see the illness in their behaviour rather than the insults (borderlines tend to rage at their relatives/significant others and insult them with all kinds of things). It does not tell them to hate them, vilify them or marginalize them. The same holds true for the other books that talk about relationships with borderlines (Kreisman: I hate you, don't leave me; Lawson: Understanding the borderline mother; Judovsky). Lawson's book even has the term 'understanding' in the title. But we both agree that stressing the non-aspect is not the correct way to tackle this article.--<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_E._Dougle_226e.html" title="User:Grace E. Dougle">Grace E.

<dd><b>Reply</b> No, I am quite certain that I haven't misunderstood anything at all. I am familiar with the book, et al. But this is not the place to debate (or promote) that. This AFD is about the article "Non-BPD". If the term only relates to one self help book and it's agenda without other academic references or citations it is not sufficiently noteable for an article, if however, you, or anyone can find citations from reliable sources that are peer-reviewed and supported by research, just like <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigotry.html" title="Bigotry">Bigotry</a>, however unpleasant, it must stay. But in a neutral, balanced article that also cites the opposition and perhaps manages to get along without links to pdf rants, like "A survivor's tale" by fully identified men about their ex wives (who are identified by association).</dd>

<li><s><b>Strong Delete</b></s> I was going to list it myself as it was re-directing for months anyway to <a href="../../../b/p/d/BPD_3eab.html" title="BPD">BPD</a>, and now the Non-BP section it redirected to has been removed from that article (primnarily because it remained uncited and unverified I think) it seemed better to delete. However as it seemed so important to <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_E._Dougle_226e.html" title="User:Grace E. Dougle">Grace E. Dougle</a> the same editor who just listed it for deletion (??) it only seemed fair to give her plenty of time to come up with some valid, verifiable, NPOV information to convince me otherwise. Obviously that is not going to happen now. Personally I would be very wary of "self-help" articles (particularly on a broad, undefined topic such as "relating to the mentally ill"). It doesn't seem very encyclopaedic, most of the time the "information" in these areas masquerades as pseudo science, while, in fact, being unsupported by any kind of academic sources or research and too many of the "experts" are, in fact, self appointed and, at best, higly subjective (at worse...well...let's not go there...). I am also not sure how wise it would be to encourage that kind of unregulated, agenda driven, promotion in an encyclopaedia? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 12:06, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b>Changing because this article was listed for all the wrong reasons, and, as it turns out, prematurely in any realistic sense. The topic may be far broader than previously indicated by the article's content, and there really should not be an AFD before that is explored.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 04:43, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, this appears to merely be an editing dispute?? They way to resolve this is <i>not</i> by bringing it too AfD.

<dd><b>Solution</b> Just request an early closure here, on whatever you consider your grounds to be, without prejudice to the article's being relisted for deletion again. You might like to also like to repeat the request on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> to hurry things up. I certainly won't oppose, although my personal preference is strongly for deletion I had no intention of listing it without giving you time to come up with valid sources and citations. When you listed it I assumed that you were not going to do so. Somebody pointed out that you were only new and might not have noticed or understood what an RFC might entail.</dd>
<dd>I will take this opportunity to give you fair notice that the only thing you can do to change my mind is to produce valid, neutral, peer reviewed sources for the notability of the term Non-BPD. Anything else is a waste of your time, and mine.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. The article is called "Non-BPD," but the rest of the article uses the term "nonBP" or "non-BP," which just means not having BPD. Should every article have a non-<i>n</i> equivalent now? I note that in news archives "non-BP" normally refers to things that are not British Petroleum or not affiliated with British Petroleum. Will we need a disambiguation page to distinguish between things that are <i>not</i> BPD and things that are <i>not</i> British Petroleum? <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPubliusFL_ece6.html" title="User:PubliusFL">PubliusFL</a> 18:15, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> It appears that this short article is the only reference to Non-BP's that is left on Wikipedia. I no longer see Non-BP referred to - where it started - in the Borderline Personality Disorder article.<br />
To delete the article eliminates all Wikipedia reference to a real social issue. It is for that reason that I oppose the deletion. Someone who has the misfortune to find themselves in a relationship with a BP may find this article to be a very helpful indeed. And Wikipedia is just the kind of place that such an individual may look for this kind of information.<br />
Perhaps the term "Non-BPD" is a misnomer. It does not mean someone who does not have a Borderline Personality Disorder (as some have suggested). Many people with a Borderline Personality Disorder also claim to be Non-BPD's. A Non-BPD is to someone with a Borderline Personality Disorder as an <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Anon_2f79.html" title="Al-Anon">Al-Anon</a> member is to an Alcoholic. And BTW, there are no references or citations in that article, yet I don't see any move afoot to have it deleted. Could it be that Al-Anon members are more sympathetic figures than Non-BP's?<br />
I am not enamored of the term Non-BP, if it is too closely associated with Randi Kreger's book, then choose another, more generic term.--gargoyle888 03:08, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think you will find that is because the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Anon_2f79.html" title="Al-Anon">Al-Anon</a> article is confined to discussing the nature of the organisation itself, whereas the Non-BPD is confined entirely to pseudo psychology on the nature of relationships with people with BPD, such as <i>As noted, the Reactive nonBP does, in fact, become drawn into the inertia of the Borderline disorder, and does this in two very distinct ways; transpersonally, and counterpersonally.</i> which definately requires either academic citation or deletion. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 04:29, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply.</b> I see that you have removed the offending text from the article. That's fine with me, in fact, that text always bothered me. Nor would I object to renaming the title from Non-BP to something that is less tied to a Kreger's coined name and commercial interests.</dd>
<dd>If the outcome of this discussion is to keep the article, then shouldn't there be a link in the BP article to this one? Otherwise, how would anyone ever find this?--gargoyle888 15:29, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am a strong inclusionist, but by everyone else's standards this band is non-notable (673 Google hits). That wouldn't be so bad in and of itself, but the article is so terribly formatted, nothing links to it and even the article's name doesn't adhere to the manual of style.--<b><a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHisSpaceResearch_9ccf.html" title="User:HisSpaceResearch">h i s</a></b> <i><a href="../../../h/i/s/User_talk%7EHisSpaceResearch_e5e1.html" title="User talk:HisSpaceResearch">s p a c e</a></i> <b>r e s e a r c h</b> 11:39, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I'm a bit torn on this one: the article claims plenty of notability, including being the supporting act for major artists, and several national singles. However, I'm not seeing sources to back up the best parts, and their record label according to the article, "Sirwin Music Group", gets no Google hits at all, hardly a good sign.

<p>Was originally prodded as "non-notable flashlight". I don't know of any notability standards for flashlights, but ones in the shape of fish from a notable brand qualify in my opinion.

<li><b>Keep</b>, why does the nominator ask if the should bother checking for more sources? Of course they should check it out as far as it reasonably possible based on the article before nominating it for deletion. My quick look shows that google gives (excluding wikipedia results) over 5 thousand hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Pocket+trout%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Pocket+trout%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. Though... on second thoughts it appears it is also slang for cock. Found a photo of it <a href="http://www.flashlightmuseum.com/flashlight_view.cfm?item_number=EV00201" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.flashlightmuseum.com/flashlight_view.cfm?item_number=EV00201" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>. Anyway..... my point is that this nomination should have been thought out a little bit more beforehand. Oh, though hang on.... it would appear from reading the nomination they are not even advocating the deletion of the article? Sounds like a possible candidate for a speedy close if they withdraw their nomination.... <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 13:36, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Spart_dfd6.html" title="User:David Spart">User:David Spart</a> created a new page called <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad_Messianism_8922.html" title="Chabad Messianism">Chabad Messianism</a> which was mostly content from the <a href="../../../y/e/c/Yechi.html" title="Yechi">Yechi</a> article and the controversy section of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad-Lubavitch_9846.html" title="Chabad-Lubavitch">Chabad-Lubavitch</a>. I believe that instead of having multiple articles on every aspect of the messianism and the controversy there should be one article on the controversy in chabad and perhaps a shorter article on the phrase of <a href="../../../y/e/c/Yechi.html" title="Yechi">Yechi</a> and if that gets too long than to further split as per <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">WP:SIZE</a>. Therefore I had moved his new article to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies_of_Chabad-Lubavitch_f92b.html" title="Controversies of Chabad-Lubavitch">Controversies of Chabad-Lubavitch</a> and merged in the rest of the controversy section of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad-Lubavitch_9846.html" title="Chabad-Lubavitch">Chabad-Lubavitch</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Spart_dfd6.html" title="User:David Spart">User:David Spart</a> does not agree with this. I am therefore putting this article up for deletion, to see what the consensus would be. Should everything go back to the way it was before with all the controversies staying in the chabad-lubavitch article or should just the messianism page stay separate along with a separate <a href="../../../y/e/c/Yechi.html" title="Yechi">Yechi</a> page, or should the main article be controversies of chabad-lubavitch. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 12:28, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Bad faith nomination</b> I created the Chabad Mechanism page because that is the true nature of the issue. If you read the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies_of_Chabad-Lubavitch_f92b.html" title="Controversies of Chabad-Lubavitch">Controversies of Chabad-Lubavitch</a> article you will note that the first section is unencylopdic blather about Chabad in general, and all the rest is either about of stemming from Chabad Messianism. PinchasC refused to allow me to write the article and kept deleting my material WHILE he knew it was still being written, despite requests. <b>Chabad Messianism</b> is worthy of a topic in its own right, check Google to get a taste. Numerous '<b>scholarly BOOKS and ARTICLES have been written on the topic</b> from many perspectives, many of them peer-reviewed.
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>When the <a href="../../../y/e/c/Yechi.html" title="Yechi">Yechi</a> article was nominated for deletion there was a strong consensus to keep. Note that all <a href="../../../y/e/c/Yechi.html" title="Yechi">Yechi</a> is is the mantra that Chabbad Messianists use. IF that deserves an article obviously Chabad Messianism does!</li>
<li>PinchasC did not grant my request to allow the article a week or two to stabilise before he nominated it for deletion, to perhaps merge in the Yechi stuff etc. <b>He did not even nominate the article he wants to be deleted</b> <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad_Messianism_8922.html" title="Chabad Messianism">Chabad Messianism</a> for deletion because he knows that it would stay. He instead has tried to confuse the issue further (a theme in his edits on Chabad topics) by nominating an article for deletion that no-one wants to be deleted, so that it will stay - since no consensus will be reached to delete - and he will then use that as a pretext for deleting the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad_Messianism_8922.html" title="Chabad Messianism">Chabad Messianism</a> article WITHOUT consensus , based on this smokescreen.</li>
<li>If PinchasC wants <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad_Messianism_8922.html" title="Chabad Messianism">Chabad Messianism</a> deleted, then <b>he should rescind this bad-faith nomination and nominate THAT article for deletion</b> and stop merging articles without consensus.</li>
<li>PinchasC has long maintained the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies_of_Chabad-Lubavitch_f92b.html" title="Controversies of Chabad-Lubavitch">Controversies of Chabad-Lubavitch</a> article in the parlous state that it is now in. Notice that in all wikipedia there is only ONE PARAGRAPH of discussion about <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad_Messianism_8922.html" title="Chabad Messianism">Chabad Messianism</a>. One of the biggest controversies in Post-War Judaism has one measly paragraph that is then followed by a lengthy OFF THE POINT attacks on David Berger from some marginal sources! <b>This is due to PinchasC's constant edit-warring to maintain the Chabad articles the way that he likes them. He is not a disinterested party, as anyone can see and should step back from editing Chabad articles for a while.</b></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I would not be opposed to a merge or restructuring of these articles as long as content is preserved.

I (as others have suggested above) have been concerned that editing articles on Chabad is closely controlled by admins such as PinchasC and Eliezer. This is not healthy. I sympathise with the creator of the above article, I recall similar problems about a year ago and see that nothing has changed.

<li><b>Keep</b> The multiplicity of articles seems in part to be due to an edit war. I'm not impressed by the references of any of these articles. Can anyone who wants to defend their own article be sure to (1) be sure that all the links actually work, (2) that any real published books have ISBNs? I'd allow all these articles to exist until there is one master article that is extremely well-sourced and is acceptable to the general Wikipedia community as being a good article. What's here now does not seem to meet the normal WP standards. For example, there are many claims made without in-line citations. We are supposed to take it on faith that the person writing the article is correct. The only article by David Berger that I could find was a web posting, that probably does not count as a reliable source by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. If this stuff is important, someone should be able to write an article that is well-sourced by general Wikipedia standards. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 22:55, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Perhaps a merge with the main Chabad article will do? Anyway, this article is already very well off and has no problems, is very informative, well-cited, good structure, . I have heard tell of PinchasC nominating it under an ulterior motive (not sure). <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoogster_f017.html" title="User:Noogster">Noogster</a> 03:07, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Deproded by the article's creator with no explanation. Article is about a fictional ship in a fantasy series. The ship is not the main focus of the story or a central element of the plot, it serves no notable pursose and it not a character itself. It is just a ship that happens to be in the book series. The article not only fails the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">fiction guidline</a> but the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">general notability guidline</a> as well.

<li><b>Merge</b> to the article about the book<a href="../../../e/l/d/Eldest.html" title="Eldest">Eldest</a> after paring down considerably the original research in the article.

Counterbalancing this adherance to <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is the notion that if a group of editors create a project, then everything they create is notable.

<li><b>Merge</b> possibly disambiguate. I would also support merging the valid content to <a href="../../../e/l/d/Eldest.html" title="Eldest">Eldest</a> or the individual character's articles, but I seem to recall other ships by the name of Dragon Wing (including the one in the novel of the same name), so it might be best to disambiguate. However, I could be convinced that this particular ship is important enough within the series that it can stand on its own. It may not be an Enterprise or Pequod, but it does claim to be the premier ship of a particular fleet. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:14, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - sorry that I didn't finish the disambiguation. I only added one to the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Wing_a69c.html" title="Dragon Wing">Dragon Wing</a> page itself when I removed the ship material. But you're correct; the novel Dragon Wing also contains a ship called Dragon Wing, and other books in that series contain a second ship also named Dragon Wing, so the Eldest ship isn't the only ship of that name. -- <a href="../../../i/m/m/User%7EImmora_c108.html" title="User:Immora">Immora</a> 18:36, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> sounds fine to me. I don't know the material at all to know how notable this thing is; I just split it off and worked on it because the original article had been slapped on top of one of my projects. Didn't appreciate that, so I made the separate article to get it off <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Wing_a69c.html" title="Dragon Wing">Dragon Wing</a> rather than just revert and possibly get into an edit war. However, going by what other contributors have added, it sounds to me like the ship does have a notable plot function that warrants some sort of description of it, even if that's not its own separate article. Trying to keep the article pared down since speculation and redundancies keep getting added. The original creator (the material seen in the first edit of the article) apparently removed the notice because he felt he'd added enough to the article to justify its continued presence. It belongs <i>somewhere!</i> -- <a href="../../../i/m/m/User%7EImmora_c108.html" title="User:Immora">Immora</a> 18:36, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>neutral</b> I'm not so sure that this is unnotable. I've usually heard these referred to as 'groups' in my chem. classes (both organic and inorganic), but if sourcing can be found then this term may be notable. It's not a synonym for 'group' because not all groups share unique properties, IE alkali metals, alkali earth metals and noble gasses all share notable properties with their group-mates (the series, apparently). Some other groups don't have much in common from period to period (say group 4 or 13). The fact that halogens all form strong mineral acids and have high electronegativity means that they're more than an arbitrary grouping. That said, unless someone marginally important or more has used the term (I've seen them called 'special groups' before, never chemical series) it's, while still interesting, not notable. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 19:24, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Being important to the show is far different from being important or useful to Wikipedia or the average reader. This has nothing to do with liking the show or not, or anything of that nature.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I wrote this article because I had not realised earlier that there was an epilogue in the final episode to each of the characters. The articles for each character included a written epilogue which didn't say where the information was found. I googled it and learned the epilogue was in the final episode. I wasn't sure if it was appropriate to create a page just for the epilogue so I created an article for that episode. Isn't the ending of the characters important too? I found it strange that I couldn't even find picutures of the future of the characters on wikipedia. This is my first time editting wikipedia so I probably messed up when I uploaded the pictures..</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't mean to start pairing wars but the episode seemed pretty clear as to who married who, and who is left open ended (did I mess up that part?). I also created it because I thought it was important to show that each of the kids achieved their goals. (ChloeSong 19:55, 23 February 2007 (UTC))</p>

<li>My "pairing war" comments had nothing to do with you.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I am currently in an ongoing heated debate with Peter Stas about the notability of his company, and given how hard he's finding it proving the notability of his company, never mind himself, I see no reason why these articles should be here. No substantial claim to notability, not verfiable, potential vanity page and no sources. Only source that got provided to me so far is a 2 year old article that rubbished the claim that him and his company introduced the silicium escapement wheel in the last 21 days (which was the claim to notability) and made absolutely no mention to either Peter Stas or his company. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 14:06, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Gentleman</b> - As a first user, it still is a learning experience how you guys work and try to destruct a contribution. On talk pages, I have added various links to external articles on a Silicium Escapement, Frederique Constant and myself. The comment "If the company's <b>president</b> can't give us sources" is inappropriate. I have had a discussion already with Kinslayer on the <b>Assume good faith</b> guideline, which he considers unbinding. Still, I would like to ask if you can also give constructive critism as my intention was:</li>

<p>1) To enter information on a revolutionary <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicium_escapement_wheel.html" title="Silicium escapement wheel">silicium_escapement_wheel</a> that we have introduced in February.

<p>2) To enter Frederique Constant, a well established watch company with, as also mentioned below, over half a million page references.</p>
<p>3) To enter myself because I saw that most companies have information on the CEO and founders of their companies. Please delete the page on myself if you feel it is of no contribution. I made the link after looking at other pages and thought that it was supposed to be done like this.</p>

<p>Re uniqueness: If you would have looked at the image of the Silicium Escapement Wheel that I uploaded, and it seems you have removed from the pages, you would have seen that the center of the wheel is made in the image of the Frederique Constant trademark logo. This is an unique design feature that every goodwilling person would have seen and confirmed. We further developped the shape and surface of our Silicium Escapement Wheel. It takes a whole technical discussion on the calculation of the teeth profiles which is most probably lost on you. As a start, place back the photo on the discussion pages so that everybody can see what I am talking about.Pcstas 15:36, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I actually laughed out loud at this! 'It's notably unique becuase your companies logo is on it'?! I have a wallet with my own design on it, but that doesn't entitle me to claim I have created a revolutionary new wallet! As I said earlier, redesigning/improving upon an exisiting design is nowhere near as notable as creating the design to begin with! Over the course of the last couple of days, you've gone from claiming your company created the SEW, to claiming they 'introduced' it to the market two years after it was actually introduced, and now your down to claiming it's unique merely becuase it has your company logo on it!Incredible! Does it make it unique? Perhaps. Does it make it notable? Never.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 16:08, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that those sources do prove you and your companies notability, but the picture your showing us is a computer generated image? What the heck is that supposed to prove? Your company can produce an image using a computer? Well done. Moving on, I suggest a compromise. I'll change my opinion to keeping both articles, but I must insist that the claims of creating the Silicium escapement wheel stop. There are multiple readily available sources of other companies who also make the same claim, and theirs goes back further than 21 days, such as <a href="http://www.ulysse-nardin.com/e/news.e/newsdetail.e.jsp?ID_Display=10000M" class="external text" title="http://www.ulysse-nardin.com/e/news.e/newsdetail.e.jsp?ID_Display=10000M" rel="nofollow">this one.</a> More are available on demand.

<p>This seems to be a soapbox article that cites various internet fora, blogs, and discussion groups as evidence for the truth or untruth of the underlying concept. Unfortunately, there are no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> cited therein, and I can't find it discussed in sources other than blogs and the like. It doesn't seem to me that this meets our content standards, and therefore I'm nominating it for deletion. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 14:16, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - blatant <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">WP:SOAP</a> issues aside, the term appears to still be a neologism. Can anyone find any reliable sources?

<li>Well, Firman and Gila, on page 68 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0791455335</a> (part of chapter #4, entitled "multiplicity within the personality"), discuss Roberto Assagioli's notion of subpersonalities and assert that "subpersonalities are normal". They state that DID is "further along a continuum of dissociation that we all share", although it's unclear whether they consider being that far along the continuum to be healthy. In contrast, there's a fair amount of documented opinion saying that multiplicity is <i>not</i> healthy, such as Glass on page 60 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0801482569</a>, who asserts that whilst one may choose to have multiple tastes and interests or choose to be eccentric, "one does not choose, however, to possess a multiple or fragmented identity". Radden, in chapter 3 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0262181754</a>, seems to take the idea that DID is not healthy as a premise. On the gripping hand, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1932690034</a> acknowledges that people with DID can function. And those are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this topic. See also the sources cited in the parent article at <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_personality_controversy.html#Healthy_multiplicity" title="Multiple personality controversy">Multiple personality controversy#Healthy multiplicity</a>, which are omitted by this sub-article.
<p>The biggest problem with this article is that it has <i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">forked</a> out one side of the disagreement over DID/MPD</i> rather than creating a <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">summary style</a> fork in a neutral manner. Forking out just the side that asserts that DID/MPD is healthy is wrong. Any sub-article on the subject should address both the views of those who say that it is healthy and the views of those who say that it is not, and should have a title that does not implicitly take the side of the former. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:31, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Uncle G, I respect the work you're doing here, but note that the issue isn't the underlying question of whether or not multiplicity is healthy, but whether the <i>term</i> "healthy multiplicity" exists as a distinct concept in reliable sources. I don't see that term in any of the sources you cite -- am I missing something?
<p>In other words, if the <i>term</i> isn't in use in reliable sources, then I fear it is a neologism, and hence inappropriate. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 17:03, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You are missing the fact that articles are about subjects, not terms, and the subject <i>is</i> the underlying question. We don't look to see whether "terms are in use", and when discussing the deletion of an entire article we look <i>beyond</i> the title. Looking to see whether words are used or not is Wiktionary territory. This is Wikipedia. We look to see whether subjects are documented, and what names they are documented under. The subject here is that very underlying question that you mention. That the people who, as I have already pointed out, have expressed opinions on the healthiness or unhealthiness of DID/MPD didn't use the exact phrase "healthy multiplicity" just means that this article is badly titled. But we knew that already. The <i>very problem</i> with this article is the inherent non-neutrality of its scope, as delineated by its introduction and title; which is fixed by <a href="../../../r/e/n/Help%7ERenaming_%28moving%29_a_page_4970.html" title="Help:Renaming (moving) a page">renaming</a> it to a neutral title, <a href="../../../e/d/i/Help%7EEditing_dd53.html" title="Help:Editing">editing</a> its introduction, and editing the rest of the article so that all sides of the arguments are presented. Thus one of the tasks is to come up with a suitable name for the topic that doesn't implicitly support one side of the debate to the exclusion of the other — and fixing the non-neutrality of the section in <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_personality_controversy.html" title="Multiple personality controversy">Multiple personality controversy</a> at the same time. (Whether multiple personality is a disorder is one option.) Fixing a bad title doesn't require an administrator to hit a delete button. Any editor with an account has the tools for fixing a bad title. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:42, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Too late for that, the only way you can permanently fix that problem is a time machine. But honestly, there's no great cost associated with keeping the history, storage space is cheap in the details, it's only in the aggregate that it gets costly. So as arguments go, I'm not convinced.

<li><b>Keep</b> The vast amount of information is what makes wikipedia great. This is that kind of things that is so notable with wikipedia in comparison to other encyclopedias.

<dd>Yeah, Wikipedia is great because we have articles on fictional starships that even to Star Trek fans or even the people that created the series are hardly notable. Fabulous.

<dd>I think I see a problem here. I don't know about you, but I see any rules on Wikipedia as methods to help improve the content of Wikipedia, and as such, saying "But this violates the rules" is not a persuasive argument. That just comes across too coercively for me. You need something more than that to persuade me, like explaining why it's a problem. And that's not even getting into the problems with notability anyway. It is a contentious subject on a lot of fronts. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:08, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This issue is real simple. These starships are only notable for the roles they play in the episodes/films, as such they should only be mentioned in the articles on those episodes/films. We aren't talking about ships like Enterprise or Voyager that appear throughout whole series, or even ships like Excelsior that make multiple appearances in more than one film/episode. We are talking about one ship that was mentioned in one episode, never appeared in that episode or any other, and was never mentioned again. Another ship that appeared for seconds at the end of Generations with no significance whatsoever and never appeared again. And one or more ships that were briefly mentioned in throwaway lines of dialogue in DS9. Only the Original Series Farragut even begins to approach something that is worth mentioning, and it is only interesting from the point of view the character Kirk or the episode Obsession. The ship is mentioned in both articles. There is nothing else that can be said about it here, so why do we have this article? What does Wikipedia gain from having this article? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 03:02, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think that given the disagreement here, it's not as simple as you claim. I could say that it's simply obvious to me that this should be kept, but I doubt that would persuade you. You might even find it offensive. So I'll try to explain in a better way. The point about having other articles is that it provides information that may not be apparent on reading the episode's article. How would you know from reading any of those episode articles that the Farragut or the other ships you nominated also had ships of the same name in other episodes? Perhaps this information doesn't interest you, but it does interest many people (in fact, I'd say that the use of names like Farragut and Enterprise reflects an ongoing interest in historical names for ships that the Trek writers are presupposing as continuing into the future). So while I can understand the desire to condense information, there's also a desire to present it explicitly as that can be more helpful in terms of presentation. I find a page like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Starfleet_starships_ordered_by_class_7ecb.html" title="List of Starfleet starships ordered by class">List of Starfleet starships ordered by class</a> to be an excellent way to present information about a reasonably interesting and notable subject that is far more helpful to me than just having the information spread across articles on dozens of different television episodes and movies. Thus I would support merging and redirecting this page to that. It'd serve the need of presenting the various ships separately from the episode pages, by collating them into one logical place. Any that get sufficiently long can be split elsewhere. I really don't see a need to delete. This isn't bad content, and as Wikpedia is not paper, it makes sense to take advantage of the ability to cover minor topics. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:31, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Okay I'm only going to respond to one thing here. You say you like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Starfleet_starships_ordered_by_class_7ecb.html" title="List of Starfleet starships ordered by class">List of Starfleet starships ordered by class</a>, please go look at the edit history, specifically the first fifty or so edits. Then how about you look at the edit history on an article like <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Sternbach_95e0.html" title="Rick Sternbach">Rick Sternbach</a>. I'm not suggesting this article be deleted because I hate Star Trek, or because I'm not interested in the specific subject.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia has policies. If you want information included here you have to follow the policies. This article fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and more specifically <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. If you don't like the policies please devote your energies to changing the policies, not suggesting we ignore them. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 03:55, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Again you refer to policies in a way that troubles me. The point of policies is use them to improve Wikipedia, not to have some set of rules that simply can't be violated. If those policies inevitably lead to the deletion of otherwise valuable information, then I would say those policies need to be changed, not information deleted. And I don't know why you want me to look at the history of those pages. Is it because you think you're going to show something about yourself? You're not going to show me anything other than you want to try to make your arguments matter more because of some past actions. That you weren't even direct about it makes me even more doubtful about doing so. I don't know about anyone else, but speaking for myself, you'd have been better off directly saying something more like "I am concerned about Star Trek articles and I do not oppose their existence" . It wouldn't be a particularly good argument, since it'd still be asserting you over the merits of your position, but it'd at least be forthright. Sorry, but what you've done before matters not to what I think you're saying here(and your chosen method makes it irritating to me), and I still think that you are mistaken in your insistence on deletion. Deletion is not the not the only solution, there are other methods available. Deletion is but one tool in the Wikipedia improvement shed, there are others. Mergers, redirects, clean-up tags. In this case, I would have used them. I doubt anybody would have protested, and this long AfD wouldn't have happened, or any of the numerous others possible. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 07:30, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I fail to see how Wikipedia is harmed by containing the information, this isn't patent nonsense or absolute trash. It's a reasonably well-written article on a distinct subject. As far as it goes, I find this kind of article several orders of magnitude more valuable than any number of articles on politicians, musicians or state highways, but I also think it might be better to present it in a combined page rather than many separate pages. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 23:10, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What is the obsession with redirects? Two (count them, two) articles link to this page.

<dd>The articles that link to this one, don't gain anything by linking to them. They already cover everything we know about the ship within themselves.

<dd>No, we don't necessarily include every criminal, but according to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> we <i>do</i> include anyone who has been the subject of multiple non-trivial coverage in independent reliable sources. This person has had four separate news reports, in the Times, Guardian and BBC, written about him. Therefore he automatically passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. If he had defecated in 22 trains and it hadn't appeared in the news, or had appeared only in the local newspaper, then he wouldn't be notable. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 09:35, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - four separate news reports counts as multiple non-trivial coverage in third-party sources, per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> Almost empty article describing a non-notable person. A very poor article. If you want to keep it, ask "How can the article be expanded?"

<li><b>Keep</b> The version recently updated by <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> is fine. This person clearly passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. In fact looking at the previous version, that had enough in it to assert the notability of this person. Just because an article is in need of improvement doesn't mean that the subject is not notable. Should this article have been tagged for cleanup or improvement rather than AfD? <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules1975</a> 15:28, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Correct me if I am wrong, but the various articles are all describing a single event (OK, several instances, but the story was mentioned once in the media). Therefore I still do not think this individual meets the Notability criteria. But maybe this is because I have an "outside of the UK" perspective? Those living in the UK may consider it more newsworthy. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobinson_weijman_cd79.html" title="User:Robinson weijman">Robinson weijman</a> 15:36, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> He's done one thing (defecate on trains) many times. I (based in the UK!) think he's done enough (as it were) to be notable. Having read <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> again I can't see any requirement that a notable person has to be notable for more than one reason, they just have to be notable. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules1975</a> 17:12, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, as far as I can read wiki guidelines both WP:BIO and WP:V have been satisfied. It is a question of debate whether being noted (or notorious) for asocial behavior is enough to warrant an inclusion in an encyclopedia, but as it stands it meets the rules <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 21:50, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> person being hunted for defaecation and desecration, a horribly gross (vulgar) crime but misdemeanour. We've deleted articles on people who have had coverage for repeatedly getting arrested for wandering around the streets naked, and this is on about the same level. The references supplied are covered by the "one coverage" rule, whereas it actually requires multiple coverage to pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (The pirate king cites BBC article as its source). <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 06:35, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The author's requests to keep it are due to it 'gaining popularity' and a possible re-release.

<p>I guess I don't really understand how this works. What was written was fact, not opinion, and was in a style emulating the wiki/kidrobot page which is a store very similar to Local35's. How is a store "not notable" if it is noted by an internationally respected organization (GQ) and was voted, by people who exercised their opinions, on citysearch as the BEST in their field? Seeking help, Justinmachus 00:04, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Basically, what would need to be changed to make it <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_for_speedy_deletion_c969.html#General_criteria" title="Wikipedia:Candidates for speedy deletion">fundamentally different</a>? Nowhere does it say "go support this store" or "I think it's cool" or "people who visit the store and buy things are cool". I just don't understand, but I am willing to change it...

The Uprights were very influential in San Diego. The Ska scene here is lackluster and there is not much hope for gigs or local prominence and The Uprights did much to change this. They are a source of continued inspiration for ska musicians in San Diego.</p>

<dd>OK it isn't marked as a disambiguation page, but its content consists solely of 2 links to 2 different Star Trek starships named USS Endeavour.

<li><b>Delete all</b>. Yes, I know in the past I've said I'd prefer to keep these lists.

My main concern with these lists is: <i>How are they encyclopedic?</i> "<i>Mario Party</i> is more about minigames than anything else." Sure. But <i>how does a list of them benfit the encylopedia?</i> From <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Mario_Party_3_minigames_8e26.html" title="List of Mario Party 3 minigames">List of Mario Party 3 minigames</a>: "Eye Sore- Circle around a Mr. I to shrink it away.

<li><b>Delete</b>. (a) I don't find the alumni argument convincing, and it is not part of Wikipedia's policy ( schools proponents' views notwithstanding ), (b) the article is inadequately reference/sourced, and (c) the article was created by someone who has been going along creating schools articles on a regular basis without then asserting or demonstrating notability. I don't have a problem with individual articles being created and then giving them time to grow, but this particular article is part of a whole group, many of which display the same pernicious pattern. It would be better for EagleFan to create articles on one school at a time, and work on them till they meet our standards, rather than simply impose his preference for inadequately documented schools articles on the project as a whole.

<li><b>Delete</b>. (a) The article is inadequately reference/sourced, and (b) the article was created by someone who has been going along creating schools articles on a regular basis without then asserting or demonstrating notability. I don't have a problem with individual articles being created and then giving them time to grow, but this particular article is part of a whole group, many of which display the same pernicious pattern. It would be better for EagleFan to create articles on one school at a time, and work on them till they meet our standards, rather than simply impose his preference for inadequately documented schools articles on the project as a whole. As Wikipedia editors we all surely want high quality articles: we are not well-served by the bulk creation of low quality articles. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 14:07, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

This award clearly satisfies Criteria 2 of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, which states <b>"The school has gained national recognition for its curriculum or program of instruction, or for its success at the national level in extracurricular activities such as art or athletics."</b>. Statements of the ilk of "No notability asserted whatsoever, and it doesn't seem likely that any can be found" are decidedly biased and unhelpful, and are demonstrative of a failure to perform even the most basic research before participating in an AfD. Rather than targeting the articles created by this individual as one set deserving knee-jerk deletion, it would be helpful for our nominator <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeinfreak37_c36b.html" title="User:Seinfreak37">User:Seinfreak37</a> whose "Another non-notable Ohio school" shows little insight, or <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">User:WMMartin</a> who has made the exact same vote in every one of these discussions, to review each article independently and make an informed decision, rather than cloning multiple AfDs or cutting and pasting the same text multiple times. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 15:37, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: At what point does the burden of research and asserting notability fall on the article creator? The author, by creating article after article after article without demonstrating notability, is not being helpful. If the author was doing this with subjects other than Schools (such as people or businesses), all of these articles would be <b>speedy deletes</b>. But since there is not yet a policy on Schools, he can get away with it? That seems illogical. -<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeinfreak37_c36b.html" title="User:Seinfreak37">Seinfreak37</a> 15:56, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It falls on both. I will never vote to keep an article where I haven't read the article in question and made an effort to check sources. I won't vote to delete if I haven't read the article and checked for additional evidence of notability. If I find additional material, I will make every effort to add it before voting. If I can't find it, I will make every effort to find a target for a merge/redirect. Is this Wikipedia policy? No. But I do believe it's a level of intellectual honesty, and as stated at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a>, "<b>Before nominating a recently created article, please consider that many good articles started their Wikilife in pretty bad shape. Unless it is obviously a hopeless case, consider sharing your reservations with the article creator, mentioning your concerns on the article's discussion page, and/or adding a "cleanup" template, instead of bringing the article to AfD.</b>" Most school articles, especially at the high school level, are far from hopeless. Of course the primary burden falls on the creator. And I have posted a lengthy note on his talk page pleading that he focus on a smaller number of quality articles, rather than creating a stub for every high school in Ohio. But it seems no easier to justify a laundry list of AfDs as it is to create a laundry list of articles. These stubs are expandable in many cases, and it isn;t hard to do so, just not when dozens of such articles are listed for AfD. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 16:17, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, although WMMartin notes that this is one of many high school articles EagleFan has suddenly created, at the top of this discussion EagleFan says he's developing them.

<dd>Excuse me?? This is the full text of that article: <a href="http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=11082" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=11082" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>. The only way you could have thought that the article contained only a passing mention is if you either did not read it, or completely had no <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a> in the fact that I had read the full text. The subject of this Afd is a critical of the theme of that article, as the reporter could not have chosen anyone at random to fill his shoes. Three paragraphs are focused on the man with two non-trivial quotes. As a result, I dont think the mention can be called <b>trivial</b>, which is the way <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is framed. That said, the notion of <i>non-trivial</i> is IMO one of the most subjective part of the main notability criteria, so its hard to argue either way on borderline cases. But I dont see how this is a borderline case. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 00:02, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To clarify, the focus of this 48 paragraph article is not about him, rather it quotes Sokolovsky over 3 paragraphs as saying that the rebbe is alive because he is a <a href="../../../t/z/a/Tzadik.html" title="Tzadik">Tzadik</a>...

<dd>If this article was in isolation, I would agree it isnt enough. But there are other sources as well, and if use this article as an example, he is being used as a source along side a crowd of other notable people. Four people are quoted in the article (in order of the size of the quotes):
<ul>
<li>Rabbi <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Berger_%28professor%29_b57e.html" title="David Berger (professor)">David Berger (professor)</a>, a history professor at Brooklyn College</li>
<li>Rabbi Ariel Sokolovsky</li>
<li><i>Michael Rosenthal</i>, a 24-year-old Lubavitcher who works for the emissary in Great Neck, in an interview outside.</li>
<li>one anti-messianist not named</li>
</ul>

<dd>In addition, three other people are mentioned by name:

<li><i>Jeffrey Buss</i>, the attorney for the Gaboyim</li>
</ul>

<dd>The issue of notability has been discussed in the previous call for deletion (are those statements now invalid?), with these newly added sources (sorry for the mess - learning) to support (as you requested above). "US singer" isn't as appropriate as community leader when considering notabilityTotalvocal 06:55, 17 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Fine, community leader...can you show me what non-trivial source you think backs up the claim that he is a notable community leader. Most of these articles are about college a cappella groups winning an award and there is a quote from him in the article; that doesn't really establish notability. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 18:55, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Part of his notability is for college a cappella institutions he founded. In this case, college newspapers are non-trivial sources and articles in them can contribute to notability.</dd>

<dd>In addition, being quoted once in a paper is indeed no big deal. But being quoted frequently (likely more frequently than any other person on the topic of contemporary a cappella) is an indication as being a "non-trivial" person from the media's perspective, especially when those sources include the New York Times, CNN, etc. Totalvocal 20:55, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sharon is perhaps the most influential figure in United States a cappella--and certainly collegiate a cappella--in the last two decades. His radical modernizing of the traditional glee sound while at Tufts completely altered the college landscape. His founding of CASA, his creation of BOCA, his involvement with The House Jacks... If his article is delted, well, one can't really make an argument to include any single modern a cappella figure. We simply need to source the article more completely. --Patchyreynolds 02:17, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>With no disrespect to Savidian, this seems to be a one man crusade to remove as much collegiate and professional a cappella as possible. Consider the previous discussion on The HouseJacks that Savidian referenced himself - the end result referenced his failed crusade. Despite this, I don't wish to make my argument based upon a vendetta, but rather upon merits. With a cappella becoming increasingly mainstream and more popular, it seems a shame to remove any article that is clearly justified (Deke Sharon does a cappella for a living! It's not a mere hobby of his.) A quick google search of Deke's name references over 77,000 hits. Given the unique nature of his name, I think it's fair to assume a large portion of those have something to do with him. I'll gladly grant you that the article isn't as sourced as well as it should be, but I don't believe that leads to a total deletion. Given the lack of contemporary a cappella information on wikipedia, I believe that removal of Deke's article, as well as similar ones, would weaken an already small section on contemporary a cappella. <a href="../../../l/c/m/User%7ELCMike_649e.html" title="User:LCMike">LCMike</a> 19:55, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Sharon clearly passes the bar for Notability under the WP:MUSIC guidelines. One guidline for notability suggests an artist has "become the most prominent representative of a notable style", which is pretty clear by the article's media references, such as the Boston Globe, the Oakland Tribune, and CNN. An argument can also be made that he meets the requirement of having "established a tradition or school in a particular genre" - the tradition of contemporary acappella music has been created and forged through his projects, such as the founding of the Contemporary Acappella Society, the BOCA and ICCA programs - his actions have established a unique tradition in this particular genre.Iangoldstein 05:05, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Actually, as a longtime member of the WP community, I'm glad to see that folks who are clearly knowledgeable about and interested in a more specialized genre of music have taken an interest in WP's communal production of knowledge. Isn't the point that as the scope and depth of the project increases more people will aid in the development of different categories? After all, Nupedia became Wikipedia precisely to foster contributions by those outside the scope of the original project. I would think, Savidan, that our aim would be to laud new contributers and hope that their contributions increase in number and breadth of interest in the future, not marginalize them for being new to the site.

<li><b>Keep</b> for eventual expansion, unless some biologist suggests where it might be merged to. The article adequately demonstrates at least some academic currency of the term.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am a little bit torn over this article. Don't get me wrong I find the article to be worthy of an article in Wikipedia as it adds to the greater whole of information and it is a distinct subject worthy of its own article. However at the moment it is a one liner. I am not an algebraic biologist, I have a friend who is though. So I don't know how to contribute to the article in order to expand it. But I want to do so even if it seems utterly impossible with the current knowledge on the subject I possess at present. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordmetroid_b969.html" title="User:Lordmetroid">Lord Metroid</a> 22:25, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>weak keep</b> on the basis of the name of the conference proceedings. As a one-time biologist, Judging from the table of contents of that conference, <a href="http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/about/conferences/ab2007/" class="external free" title="http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/about/conferences/ab2007/" rel="nofollow">http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/about/conferences/ab2007/</a>, it's about the application of logical or algebraic methods to almost anything in bioinformatics or biophysics. In this general part of biology, subjects do arise on the basis of techniques, either experimental or physical, and the boundary lines are not clear (see the art. of Biophysics for a discussion.) The importance will be judged by the work that gets done under its banner, but it is probably already enough for an article. I said weak keep rather than keep because I am not certain the name will stick. If not , it can be merged to biophysics--almost anything can.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:16, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

These article are merely lists of names belonging to a language or culture (i.e. a word list) with no prose or explanatory text or encyclopedic purpose. Wikipedia is not a dictionary. This is the kind of thing that Wiktionary is made for, and so they have been transwikied to Wiktionary and may now be deleted. Recently, all lists of given names have been moved to Wiktionary and deleted; these are, as far as I know, the last remaining ones, which have just been transwikied.</p>

<li>I'm not sure what you mean; the articles are in the "Appendix" namespace according to Wiktionary policy. The Transwiki namespace is just a holding cell so they can be reformatted according to Wiktionary standards before going into the main namespace. Articles are automatically transwikied nto that namespace. As for List of Hebrew names, there's nothing wrong with the transwiki (though it looks messy now), it just hasn't been formatted yet. A Wiktionarian will clean it up in a day or two. Keep in mind though, that whether Wiktionary has it or not has no bearing on whether it is encyclopedic or not, it's just more desirable not to lose the unencyclopedic information entirely. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 01:17, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Your first two sentences answered my question, thanks. As for the latter part, I agree that the article should not be in Wikipedia, but that doesn't mean we should delete it without a proper transwiki. If the transwiki <i>is</i> cleaned up, then all's well and the page should be deleted per convention (note, I've modified my comment). However, if it cannot be cleaned up (meaning that there is a problem, perhaps with the Hebrew characters), I don't see why the article can't be kept on Wikipedia until a solution is found to the problem.

<li>Ah, yes I agree with you that if an article is worthy of transwiki to somewhere else, we should definitely wait until everything's transferred. I've just seen the argument that <i>it's information</i> used to mean <i>it's encyclopedic</i> too often. The problem with the Hebrew article is pretty simple: all Hebrew letters are templates on Wikipedia, and not on Wiktionary, so they turned into broken linked instead of letters. It just requires some find-and-replace when I get a chance; all the content is there. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 03:43, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>OK, then. I have no problem with the articles being removed from Wikipedia (in fact, I'm all for it) <i>as long as</i> the content is preserved somewhere else (in this case, Wiktionary).

I think it's important to chronicle the unreleased recordings of an important band (many songs of which actually worked their way onto subsequent albums). I think having one article for unreleased recordings is OK, considering many bands on Wikipedia have separate articles for every song they've ever recorded. I think we can spare one article for Aerosmith's unreleased recordings. I'm sure it could be modified, so it's not an all-out list and possibly converted to paragraph form. However, that can be done over time. Deleting an article and having to redo it again is a much more difficult and time-consuming process. I also urge that Gonzaloc be notified of this AfD nomination, since he created the content anyway, and would be the one most likely to be able to verify/cite the data. I simply rescued the information as it was deleted from the Aerosmith article a while back and tried to make it more visually appealing. --<a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAbog_81bb.html" title="User:Abog">Abog</a> 18:06, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not necessarily saying that any of these articles (on B-sides, outtakes, bootlegs, etc.) should go, I'm just saying there shouldn't be double standards applied on Wikipedia. I think these articles on unreleased recordings of all major artists have value. Many of these sub-articles were created to make the main artist page or discography page not as long, as well as allow users to know the important musical history of many important, prominent musicians. I alsmost view the deletion of these articles as depriving users of historical research and music in general. When we have 100s of articles for all individual songs an artist has recorded, yet we can't even have just 1 article chronicling unreleased material? It just doesn't seem justified. --<a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAbog_81bb.html" title="User:Abog">Abog</a> 23:49, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Every song an artist recorded also doesn't get an article, only the notable ones. Simply existing doesn't make a song (or anything else) notable. I know I probably seem like a broken record, but rather than make accusations of inconsistent standards or hatred of Aerosmith or other such things, could at least some time be put to reliably sourcing this article?

<dd>Where have you been? <a href="../../../a/c/2F/AC_DC_2284.html" title="AC/DC">AC/DC</a> has 104 songs that have their own articles on Wikipedia.

I don't view it as being other crap that exists. I view it as useful information that exists. I just wish Aerosmith could have the same, that's all. I just don't understand this sudden article deletion campaign. As far as souring the article, there are notations after many of the songs on where they came from or where they later resurfaced. And the ones that resurfaced need not a citation as one can just look at an album like <i><a href="../../../p/a/n/Pandora%27s_Box_%28album%29_5e15.html" title="Pandora's Box (album)">Pandora's Box</a></i> and see that it's there. Additionally, I didn't really come up with this list. If you look at the discussion page for the article, you'll see that I simply rescued the information as it was originally on the main article but deleted as it was out of place there, so I made this article and cleaned the info up a bit. But if you want citations, you're going to have to contact Gonzaloc as he came up with the information. --<a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAbog_81bb.html" title="User:Abog">Abog</a> 04:24, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps I should rephrase: Every song an artist recorded <i>is not supposed to</i> get an article.

And since you don't like "other crap exists," you probably right like this one either, but, we have an essay about <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">potentially useful stuff</a> as well.

<dd>Well then, if that's the case, why should I bother creating any more articles on Wikipedia? I thought Wikipedia is to expand knowledge and make the internet not suck, rather than be a generalist encyclopeida. I thought it was supposed to draw on a multitude of people with specified areas of interest and knowledge to create articles in their special areas. But if Wikipedia is all about being generalist and deleting articles rather than creating them now, I guess I'll be leaving. I mean why should I waste my time creating an article on an Aerosmith song if it's not wanted and will be deleted anyway? --<a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAbog_81bb.html" title="User:Abog">Abog</a> 18:02, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's been about a week now, and I think the result is "no consensus". I already compromised by letting the "Aerosmith in popular culture" article go, by merging the info into other articles. However, this is a notable list of unreleased recordings of a notable, long-lived highly important musical group. I believe Aerosmith is listed as a high-priority musician, and thus I think it's important that an article exists chronicling their unreleased recorded material. I know that most of this info is pretty reliable and indeed true. One needs to only read the band's autobiography <i>Walk This Way</i>, purchase <i><a href="../../../p/a/n/Pandora%27s_Box_%28album%29_5e15.html" title="Pandora's Box (album)">Pandora's Box</a></i>, buy a few singles, etc. to verify most of this information. Sure, it could be better sourced and cited, but that is no reason to delete it. Additionally, as already stated, almost all other artists of the same prominence and caliber of Aerosmith have similar articles chronicling unreleased material, B-sides, bootlegs, and the like. I believe it is important to have these articles, as they are chronicles of the artists' music, whether it has been recorded or not, and gives more insight into the artist, their music, and their albums. Remember, when in doubt, don't delete. <a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAbog_81bb.html" title="User:Abog">Abog</a> 07:28, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>TRHG rocks! It's been around for 20 years and is well worth an entry in Wiki. It is well-known through it's distribution in Comics International and the downthetubes site, where the strip is usually found, is a prime refernce point for British comics creators.

<p>This person does not appear to be well known, at least without reputable sources. In regards to Daryl Bonilla's professional wrestling career, usually successful professional wrestlers will have "championships" or "titles" as a part of their resume, but that doesn't look to be the case here with the exception of a single "AZW Tag Team Champion" title. As an actor, there doesn't appear to be any really major roles this person has played although sources could certainly change that. Houstonroxets4 21:59, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Non-notable school - not referenced by independent sources <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam613_ccbd.html" title="User:Adam613">Adam</a> 20:36, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Strong KEEP</b> I am the principle author of the page and though I have a vested interest in the article, I firmly believe it should not be deleted. The page links to the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portsmouth.html" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> article, whereby articles exist for all the citys largest and most notable schools, all of which would fall under the same "non notable" reason given here (indeed I believe thousands of articles on schools would, the Hampshire schools category (of which this article is included) has hundreds of schools with no references).</p>
<p>I have recently edited the article, improved its layout and added some external links as well as two references. However If the question of this article is that it needs more referencing, then I suggest that a tag be added asking for more references and the deletion tag be removed. If after a time, no more references or independant sources can be added, then the page should be reconsidered for deletion then, and only then. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordHarris_aa9b.html" title="User:LordHarris">LordHarris</a> 21:52, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> What about this school is notable. "There are lots of non notable schools with articles on WP" doesn't seem to be a reason to keep this one <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules1975</a> 22:08, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In response, I would argue that this school is notable, firstly because it is one of the largest three schools in the City of <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portsmouth.html" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>. Secondly it meets one of the criteria for <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">wikipedia:schools</a> which states <i>"A school may meet the criterion of being the principal subject of multiple reliable independent non-trivial published works in several ways"</i>. In this case number two: <i>"The school has gained national recognition for its curriculum or program of instruction, or for its success at the national level in extracurricular activities such as art or athletics. For example, the school has been recognized with a notable national award, has won a science competition at the national level, or its athletic teams hold a nationwide record. Or, the school has gained recognition at the regional level in multiple such areas"</i> In this case, the school recieved in 2003, the nationally recognised <a href="../../../i/n/v/Investors_in_People_8f0a.html" title="Investors in People">Investors in People</a> award. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordHarris_aa9b.html" title="User:LordHarris">LordHarris</a> 22:32, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>More importantly</b> the article states, for example, "The school has gained a high level of achievement academically" when the links to the DfES stats quite clearly show that it hasn't, low GCSE pass rate and more importantly its CVA (contextual value added score) is well under average.

<dd>I do believe that this article deserves it existence. But I have to say that I actually agree with you arguments EliminatorJR. I just wish that the user who nominated the article for deletion had explained as well in his reasons. I would also like to add a few things in defence of principle. I think when it comes to wikipedia deletion policy on schools, its wrong for articles which contain more than just an address, to be deleted, even if it is by consensus of frankly, a small group. There are after all thousands, upon thousands of school articles that have even less than this one but I dont see a genuine effort by the deletionist community to get rid of them all! It just seems a shame to delete information, in whatever the context, even though in this case the sources are out of date. The information on the history of the school, although unreferenced is the only existing source accessible in an internet search, especially since most Portsmouth schools dont yet have web pages. I cant help but feel that deleting the odd school page here and there, is more about personal opinion, than it is about the pursuit of spreading knowledge around the world. Except for tidy up, legal reasons and for joke articles, deletion should be wrong. Thats my two cents anyway. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordHarris_aa9b.html" title="User:LordHarris">LordHarris</a> 00:44, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As the user who nominated the article for deletion, apologies for not making my reasoning more clear. I'm a little new at this AfD thing. Fortunately, others stated my reasons fairly well. I do agree that we need a more coherent policy on schools, but I don't think most primary and secondary schools are notable.

<p><b>Strong KEEP</b> I have no vested interest in this school but I feel that these articles in general are worthwhile. I feel Wikipedia's criteria for "notability" are being applied far too narrowly here. If this is done to schools, it should also be done to many other areas where not very notable things are being recorded. (For example, individual railway stations, or biographies of individual lower division footballers - which are also of interest to some!) Wikipedia is becoming (or has become) a major source of useful Internet information, often of material that is of historical value but not accessible elsewhere on the web. Schools publish written histories, so why should this material not be included on the web, and made readily accessible for all? Information about its history, founding date, previous schools etc is of value. I found the information on this particular school useful (and corrected some of it!). If it is felt that the article and other similar ones does not meet Wikipedia's current guidelines, then I strongly suggest such guidelines are now outdated and instead of deleting this article, I call for a debate first on the whole question of notability in <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">wikipedia:schools</a>. On several occasions over the last year people have tried to get school articles deleted en masse and this has been rejected. With over 1.6 million articles on Wikipedia, there is surely room for description of any school where the people involved are interested enough to contribute something. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperman_42_7b51.html" title="User:Hyperman 42">Hyperman 42</a> 01:42, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, one source is primary (evident from "we" pronoun), others are statistics lists, which are largely primary and pretty trivial. As to school articles in general-if you want to prove that most schools <i>are</i> notable, quit just repeating it, and start writing a bunch of articles on schools with <i>nontrivial secondary sources</i> cited. Every school I see up for AfD (and most I run across random-article patrolling) have a lot of howling about how "all schools are notable", but the one thing that could settle any AfD definitively and on the side of keep (citing multiple nontrivial sources) is never done! Repeating something often enough does not make it true. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 05:19, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't think that the usefulness of an article to one person justifies keeping it; that seems to me to be close to <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> (I know that's an essay, not policy). Furthermore, Hyperman 42's argument that 'there is surely room for description of any school where the people involved are interested enough to contribute something'.

<li><b>Comment</b> Frankly it does seem to me that double standards are being applied here. On the one hand seemingly all sportsmen who play in any professional league are considered "notable", even when the articles about them lack any sources other than automatically generated statistics. On the other hand, the background and history of schools that have educated and strongly influenced thousands of people are considered to be worth deleting (especially if they are state schools). Granted, there is a need for better citing of sources; on the other hand, plenty of evidence is available in school archives, local authority records and local/national media (all of which can be quoted as bibliography). These are not generally published or accessible and it is a useful service to present them on the internet. The origin and development of schools in Portsmouth (or any other location) is a significant factual item. There is obviously a difference between <a href="../../../d/e/l/Deletionism.html" title="Deletionism">deletionists</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inclusionists.html" title="Inclusionists">inclusionists</a> here, but I fail to see why the former seem to have such particularly strong views against schools articles. If they are mere vanity articles ("I went to this school and it's great") then yes, they should be deleted, but this article, though possibly over-long and too detailed, does not seem to me to fall into this category. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperman_42_7b51.html" title="User:Hyperman 42">Hyperman 42</a> 01:19, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hyperman, there is no double standard. In order for there to be a double standard, there would have to be a unified body of editors - and there's not! If you think there are railway stations or sportsmen who are non-notable, and whose articles should be deleted, nobody's stopping you from recommending deletion. As to this article, two questions. (1) can the useful information you mention be incorporated into a subsection of a related article? (2) will those voting "keep" improve the article's quality, and address some of the concerns in this discussion? If so, that might be a reason to change my position - but as it stands now, I stand by <s>"weak delete."</s> -<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteforsyth_da42.html" title="User:Peteforsyth">Pete</a> 01:50, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You slightly miss my point. I would not want ANY of these articles deleted. They are all of value. I guess this makes me an <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inclusionist.html" title="Inclusionist">inclusionist</a>&#160;:-) I feel the same way about, for example, keeping articles about obscure rock bands which seem to miss all notability criteria and are of zero interest to me but nevertheless seem to make a reasonable case that they had a significant place in developing one particular genre. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperman_42_7b51.html" title="User:Hyperman 42">Hyperman 42</a> 22:27, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Also I take your point (1) - it would be useful to have the basic historical information for all Portsmouth schools in a single article (probably based on a wikitable) but it will take some time to get this written. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperman_42_7b51.html" title="User:Hyperman 42">Hyperman 42</a> 22:30, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I have also added a link to the schools ofsted report in the external links section and also found the schools official website, now mentioned in external links (with the newsletter referenced to the main article). In a search I was also able to find mention of the school and its design of a new prominent local statue. Have incorporated that into the article with a reference. I also found a link to some of the schools building history, as well as a reference to the engineering department and a donation made by BAE.

I would have thought it was in the public's interest to keep articles about anything of factual worth, and pages about schools may be of use to people moving into an area thinking about choice of schools. -<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtybrad_268e.html" title="User:Artybrad">Artybrad</a> 01:07, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> That information should go in the article about the area; each school doesn't require a separate article unless the school is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> on its own. I have actually used Wikipedia for a similar purpose (although I was looking for synagogues rather than schools). <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam613_ccbd.html" title="User:Adam613">Adam</a> 04:46, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This might be a hoax and if not would appear anyway to be a vanity page. How can one person be cast as both a baby and an adult character in the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Rings_293e.html" title="Lord of the Rings">Lord of the Rings</a> films? I can't find anything to substantiate the claims that this person was in the LOTR trilogy or in <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shortland_Street_9b44.html" title="Shortland Street">Shortland Street</a> or the musicals listed. I couldn't find a reference to his Shortland Street character on the official Shortland Street website.</p>
<p>Even if the claimed film and TV appearances are true, they hardly seem enough to make this guy notable. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules1975</a> 20:40, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Neologism, POV, unreferenced, already adequately covered in <a href="../../../m/i/n/MINI_%28BMW%29_9c2b.html" title="MINI (BMW)">MINI (BMW)</a>, never likely to be more than the smallest possible stub. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 20:52, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Background: There is a classic car called the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mini.html" title="Mini">Mini</a> which has an enormous number of fans and supporters (I am one of them). In 2001 BMW bought the company and the name from the previous owner - shut down production of the classic car and started making the <a href="../../../m/i/n/MINI_%28BMW%29_9c2b.html" title="MINI (BMW)">MINI (BMW)</a> as a 'retro' car with some of the look and attributes of the original. A small, but very vocal minority of classic Mini owners are utterly furious that this happened to their car and are throwing invective and general nastiness over the web. One thing they have tried is to pursuade people to call the new car the 'BINI' (a contraction of BMW and MINI). This small but notable fact is duly noted in the article <a href="../../../m/i/n/MINI_%28BMW%29_9c2b.html#Criticism" title="MINI (BMW)">MINI (BMW)#Criticism</a> in a suitably NPOV fashion. So - then an entire article has appeared entitled <a href="../../../b/i/n/BINI_8480.html" title="BINI">BINI</a> which basically says that ALL classic Mini owners dislike the new car...and nothing else. So - the term is a Neologism, it's been around for a few years. It's certainly not used by all classic Mini owners - I belong to a classic Mini club with about 200 members - approximately a third of whom actually own both a classic Mini and a BMW MINI - and in a recent email thread on the subject, not one person said they use the term BINI. This article will never have decent references - it'll never be more than one sentence and it's already adequately covered in the correct place: ie in <a href="../../../m/i/n/MINI_%28BMW%29_9c2b.html" title="MINI (BMW)">MINI (BMW)</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 21:05, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why does this guy keep getting deleted? Ive been a huge fan of his stuff for almost a year. Theres biographies for webcomic creators that are nowhere near as popular as the nerd, every time he puts up a video it gets a few hundred thousand hits, stuff like his article getting deleted is why people rightly stereotype wikipedia editors as pedantic jackasses</p>
<p><br />
At the very least this guy is more than just an internet meme, or viral video. He's on a couple of fairly established videogame websites. The article needs some work, but I'd lean towards keeping it. BoosterBronze 18:09, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Keep! This article has again been considered for deletion without any adequately explained reason. The AVGN is all over the internet. He is a great star that lots of people know about. There are many articles on wikipedia with a far smaller audience so I really don't see the problem with having a AVGN article. He has millions of views on <a href="http://www.youtube.com" class="external free" title="http://www.youtube.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com</a>, <a href="http://www.screwattack.com" class="external free" title="http://www.screwattack.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.screwattack.com</a> and more recently <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com" class="external free" title="http://www.gametrailers.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gametrailers.com</a> Ask on any public forum and you'll find plenty of fans begging for a wikipedia-article. Also the Nerd has appeared on TV a few times, is being discussed in plenty of online communities Again. I really don't see the problem with having an article. Unless whoever nominated this article for deletion (again) can come up with some really good reason for deletion, I suggest leaving this article alone and improving it instead. Also when people hear of a internet celebrity (or any famous person for that matter), where is the first place they go. Wikipedia! Seb2net 18:22, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Before the "No new developments" phrase is senselessly dropped on this article, please note that MTV-owned GameTrailers has acquired ScrewAttack and now hosts exclusive rights to premiere the episodes of the Angry Video Game Nerd.216.37.86.10 19:02, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>James Rolfe himself has stated that he is very excited about making many new videos in the future (something similar is mentioned in the article, but I've read it in a discussion with him on the ScrewAttack forums as well), probably gaining an even greater fan base as time passes. Thereby making an article even more necessary Seb2net 19:19, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Strong keep! The Angry Video Game Nerd is an established internet phenomenon, much like webcomics (PvPOnline, Ctrl+Alt+Del, ...) and comedy websites (Ebaumsworld, Something Awful...). These all have their own Wikipedia entries so I can't see why The Nerd couldn't have one too.</p>
<p>For some reason, I cannot find the article. Has someone deleted the article despite the strong "keep-opinion"? I have a feeling this happened last time as well. The main opinion was keep but the article was deleted nevertheless. Could someone please explain what's going on here? I get the feeling wikipedia doesn't want a AVGN article come hell or high water. Seb2net 22:35, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article does appear to be gone, despite the fact we only started discussing it two hours ago. Isn't that a little fast? BoosterBronze 23:21, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Keep! Currently listed on Youtube as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=JamesNintendoNerd" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=JamesNintendoNerd" rel="nofollow">JamesNintendoNerd</a>, he is the #28 - Most Subscribed of All Time, and is the #52 - Most Viewed Directors of All Time with 4324926 views. He even has his own <a href="http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd/gallery.html" class="external text" title="http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd/gallery.html" rel="nofollow">Fanart Gallery</a> Gardenghoul 05:20, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Someone unfairly has it in for this page - the current page was very well-written (much better written then some of the pages that currently remain undeleted) and the subject matter is more than relevant and significant, as Rolfe is a well-known internet personality. Whoever continues to delete this page is, to quote the Nerd, "a shitload of fuck".</p>

<dd>I'm not extremely good at all the wiki codes and functions, but someone should revert (or whatever it's called) the page if that is possible. There is no reason why it shouldn't be there.

<dd><b>Strong keep</b> For a start, this has been pruned away from the YT article (it's not called the 'Censorship' section anymore either), and it now just says main article - here. More importantly, it quite definitely meets the standards for Wikipedia inclusion. And much of the page was not written by the people concerned - I know, because I recognise the wording of the total banning part - some of that was identical to wording I had used in the <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> article, which was clearly cut and pasted onto this article. So the text was not written by those concerned (I'm quite definitely not NickG, and I am not a member of the RRS, although I agree with their aims etc.) <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhase_Theory_d0e1.html" title="User:Phase Theory">PT</a> 22:41, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The overwhelming majority (over 99%) of all topics that have been featured on multiple non-trivial news sources do not merit inclusion on Wikipedia. I see articles get deleted all the time that have appeared in much less trivial news sources than <i>Christian Today</i>. (Besides, neither of those articles are actually about "YouTube atheists". They're both about the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blasphemy_Challenge_6e6c.html" title="Blasphemy Challenge">Blasphemy Challenge</a>, which was nevertheless recently deleted and merged into <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rational_Response_Squad_67c2.html" title="Rational Response Squad">Rational Response Squad</a>.) So this article's only two reliable sources aren't actually <i>about</i> "Youtube atheists" (except indirectly), and all this article's other references (which are what are actually relied on for the overwhelming majority of the article's claims) are to YouTube pages, the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secular_Student_Alliance_eb7b.html" title="Secular Student Alliance">Secular Student Alliance</a>, Nick Gisburne's personal homepage, and an unrelated University of Buffalo policy page. That's pretty damned unimpressive, especially compared to other Wikipedia articles which are billions of times more noteworthy and newsworthy than this one and yet are regularly deleted and merged. That's why Wikinews even <i>exists</i>—and this topic clearly falls far below the standards of Wikinews, so why do you think it satisfies the <i>much higher</i> standards of Wikipedia? -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:09, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: It gives undue weight to deaths in the Pro Wrestling business as compared to other high stress athletic fields like Pro Boxing, Football, Basketball or Baseball (why isn't there a list for these sports? - Pro Boxing would have an even worse record IMHO since its not staged). The POV contention is of course, participation in Pro Wrestling causes "early" (ill defined) death which is not proven (compared to other sports/professions). The only death I can see on the list that can be directly pinned on Pro Wrestling is Owen Hart's accidental death from a wrestling stunt gone wrong. --<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 09:05, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: It's POV (how "early death" is defined) and possibly <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">OR</a>. Sure, a significant number of notable pro wrestlers had drug problems that may have been a cause of death, but it's not really encyclopedia-worthy to list all of them together (or perhaps categorize them together). Even an article on steroids in pro wrestling I don't think would be good enough to keep (because the well-known cases are for wrestlers who have appeared in the "big league" promotions, which of course is not indicative of the industry as a whole - after all, WWE makes use of an extensive travelling schedule more than the average indy promotion). <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelvSYC_688e.html" title="User:KelvSYC">kelvSYC</a> 19:01, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sorry, I hadn't checked this page in a while; I was busy working like normal people do. The fact remains that the 40 plus people mentioned in this Wiki article died early deaths. What are you people debating about?</li>
<li>This isn't a category, and it doesn't have to be a list. I would say that, if a couple paragraphs can be added to this, and then the list of wrestlers is at the bottom of the article, that should be alright. If you have to, rename the article to "Professional wrestlers who died before age 50." That would get around the whole "what qualifies as an early death?" debate.</li>
<li>If there can be lists of sexual positions, and lists of "Nintendo games that feature Mario as a character", why should this article be the subject of such scrutiny.</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b>*The problem I have with this article is that it (IMHO) gives the biased point of view impression that the Pro-wrestling business "causes early deaths". Its not balanced and rather unfair to the industry. It doesn't take much effort to selectively cherry pick a bunch of deceased wrestlers, put them in a list without any context whatsoever and call it "Early deaths in professional wrestling" - You might as well retitle this article "Pro wrestling causes early deaths", in which case it will be speedily deleted as a biased attack article. There is no context to this list, as I have stated in my comments above - a biased cherry picked list of dead people is simply not encyclopedic and does not warrant inclusion in Wikipeadia. I can selectively list early deaths in any number of professions (lawyers, doctors, policemen, insurance adjusters etc.) and give the false impression that n-profession causes short life-spans. --<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 03:34, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Go ahead and try to come up with a list of lawyers that died early deaths. You won't be able to come up with 50 people that were significant enough to be mentioned on wikipedia in the first place. There is a list on wiki titled "People that committed suicide by gun." This could just be thought of as "People that committed suicide by working over 330 days per year, for 15 years straight, then had their heart explode." Is it really so different?</li>

<li><b>weak keep</b> I just added what i could find, I'm wondering how this fits into the 100 years test at <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wp%7Ebio.html" title="Wp:bio">wp:bio</a>, as its been more than 100 years, and I'm sure <i>someone</i> will find this info useful. The guy has a few redlinks at wikipedia germany, but no article there. Being a professor back then seems rather prestigious, as elitist as universities were, so perhaps this satisfies examples 9 and 10 at <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. Also, this is a case of an article which helps <a href="../../../b/t/w/WP%7EBTW_16cd.html" title="WP:BTW">WP:Build the web</a>.

<dd><b>comment</b> I understand that I'm sort of saying that we should include almost every seventeenth-century professor from every major university in Europe. I think this isn't a universally held idea, but I think that being so generally means you satisfy the notability criterion I mentioned. Please, let me know how I'm wrong if you think I am.

<dd><b>strong keep</b> Dr. W. is not being written about on the basis of having a PhD, but of getting the degree, becoming a professor himself at another university, and training doctoral level students. Just getting the degree would not have been enough, and nobody is suggesting that all recipients of the doctorate would be included, any more than they would be today. (For one thing, most of them went on to law or medicine or the church.)</dd>
<dd>In dealing with contemporary academics, we currently generally include all full professors at research universities, either on the basis that they have been repeatedly been peer-reviewed for quality by qualified and knowledgeable senior faculty from several universities (at least 3 times in succession), or on the basis that they invariably have written a considerable number of well received works of scholarship. In the 17th century there were many fewer universities, and very few full professors in each, and so they can be assumed to have been at least as notable.</dd>
<dd>His coverage in the Mathematical Genealogy project is accidental, because of the difficulty of setting subject boundaries within the then very broad stretch of "philosophy" but I think this is a plus--the methods used in that project are applicable to what are now the other academic fields. The article should be edited to call him a philologist, not a philosopher, or a mathematician, on the authority of <a href="http://mdz1.bib-bvb.de/%7Endb/ndbvoll.html?inpAuswahl%5b%5d=64844.," class="external text" title="http://mdz1.bib-bvb.de/%7Endb/ndbvoll.html?inpAuswahl%5b%5d=64844.," rel="nofollow">the Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie</a>--a truly wonderful resource-- and I have just done so. (He presumable presented a conventional thesis, and then went his own way.) I have also checked for further books he may have written. Now that I realize he was a philologist I recognize the name, because he was also the University librarian. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:22, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>.

This is a very small article, so it's not using up very much of our resources, and I like the notability arguments of DGG. The information that is already in the article is 'hard-won' because it's not easy to research people from the 17th century. So its deletion would represent more of a loss than in some other cases. The sources which are there now seem quite good. It seems possible that the Mathematical Genealogy Project is mixing him up with his father-in-law <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_Mencke_37da.html" title="Otto Mencke">Otto Mencke</a>, but I haven't traced this out in detail.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- his name appears in the genealogy of countless mathematicians (just google it); this is a non-negligible measure of notability, which, in and of itself, should warrant keeping the article.

Moreover, the fact that someone lived long ago and thus is unfamiliar to you is not sufficient to delete the article.

<li>I am going to have to say that I have serious issues with the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> of this, especially when no sources have been cited in the article. For a US airliner, even a short lived one, I would expect to find easily <i>something</i> about the airliner with an easy search but I cannot. There does appear to be a website for "British Atlantic International Airways", but I cannot see any evidence that the <i>airline</i> it claims to be the website for actually exists. For instance, I would expect the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airliners.net.html" title="Airliners.net">Airliners.net</a> to have some photos of them in their database, especially when they operate in Europe and America. Jetphotos.ch does have an image for an Atlantic International <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed_TriStar_9d52.html" title="Lockheed TriStar">Lockheed TriStar</a>, but that is a prop for the movie <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passenger_57.html" title="Passenger 57">Passenger 57</a>. Although I think commercial airlines with scheduled passenger services are all notable as they form an integral part of a country's transportation network, my belief is that the airline does not exist and has never existed. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:40, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

It is possible this band may become notable in the future, but for now I don't think they're there. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyguy649_8ae4.html" title="User:Flyguy649">Flyguy649</a> 22:50, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep / Comment</b> - I appreciate the compliment regarding the work put into this page. The copyvio for the Revolver article could be corrected with an edit. This was my first article / entry into wikipedia and still have a lot to learn. Regarding the <a href="http://www.amg.com" class="external text" title="http://www.amg.com" rel="nofollow">All Music Guide</a> link from flyguy... that link is to a financial / investment company. No offense, but the band definitely will not show up on that website. Regarding notability of the band, I would aggree that they do not havea commanding web presence at present beyond their official and myspace page, but they are well known in the Harrisburg area and are currently playing with both local and national acts, including Cute is What We Aim For. I am open to suggestions to improve the page and feel that there is room for this entry in the music section of wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianrudge_b06b.html" title="User:Brianrudge">brianrudge</a> 09:17, 22 February 2007 (EST)</li>

<li><b>Do not merge</b> whatever happens, this stuff was intentionally separated from the main article. The "... in popular culture" articles" do have purpose - to keep the main texts clean. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 19:57, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
