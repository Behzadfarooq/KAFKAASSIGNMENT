<li><b>Keep</b>. As the long-running program is already clearly notable - I think info regarding a confirmed upcoming series of the show is also notable.

<li><b>Delete for now</b>, the article curtrently is speculative having no sources. And adds nothing to WIkipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b>. There are plenty of future events that are very likely to occur; that doesn't mean we need to create placeholder articles for them before any official information is available.

<li><b>Delete</b> as above; WP is not a crystal ball, and this contains no information that a link to the other articles on the series would not provide.

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> but only for now. There are articles on individual Big Brother seasons, of course, but my feeling is it's a bit premature. Make sure it's mentioned at the main BB article, and when the show actually goes forward (as in there's information beyond speculation to print) then by all means recreate it. An exception would be if for some reason the new season becomes somehow noteworthy before broadcast (such as the controversy that has erupted regarding the yet-to-be-broadcast new edition of US Survivor.) <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 22:27, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
