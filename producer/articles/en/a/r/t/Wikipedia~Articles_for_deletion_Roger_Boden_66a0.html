<p>Just another bursar (there are thousands of them; they're minor financial functionaries). He had a little run in with Employment law over racial discrimination, and it was settled out of court.

<p>"Mel Etitis"'s statement above does not provide adequate grounds for deletion. This story (and Boden's name) was reported in the national and international press - it is of significance in light of the current UK government's attempts to promote university education for all. Racial discrimination is an important topic and was brought to the fore by Boden's actions. Nobody is suggesting that this is the biggest story in the world, but it is well recognised by thousands of Keble and Oxford alumni. It is belittling, misleading, and offensive to describe Boden's actions as "a little run in" with the law - thereby not warranting publication. I strongly contest the above user's case for deletion. -- 18:45, 5 November 2005</p>

It seems that the would-be censors of the Roger Boden page are current Keble College members or associates of Boden who want to brush this under the carpet.

<dd>Since I haven't been editing here very long, it's possible that the above suggestion of impartiality could be taken seriously. It would be hard to prove the facts that I have never visited Oxford nor heard of Keble College.

<li>Sensor wrote to delete "per nom", meaning "per nomination", or in other words, on the same grounds as those stated in the original nomination (see above). This is common phrasing in Articles for Deletion discussion.

<li>Thank you for the explanation user Sensor. I have been looking into the claim made by user Zoe above. When I type "Roger Boden" in quotation marks into google.co.uk, a good number of results refer to Boden of Keble College. There is no question that there may be other people called Roger Boden, but this is not grounds for deletion. In addition to the Guardian online newspaper column reporting Boden's actions already posted on the disputed article, google.co.uk also shows me an article on a Race Rights website: <a href="http://www.blink.org.uk/pdescription.asp?key=8117&amp;mid=&amp;grp=7&amp;cat=31" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blink.org.uk/pdescription.asp?key=8117&amp;mid=&amp;grp=7&amp;cat=31" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<li><b>Objection</b>: "Just zis Guy, you know?" has already just censored the Roger Boden article by deleting half the contents, and is now requesting to have the article speedied. Although he may never have read about Roger Boden in the Oxford Mail, those of all who are involved with Equal Opportunities up and down the country are very aware of Boden and the associated discrimination case. I am dismayed that in this day and age (and moreover on a forum such as Wikipedia), other users choose to be so dismissive about such events and personnages. A pity indeed. -- 84.64.91.128 22:32 5th November 2005 (GMT)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Please, 84.64.91.128, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> on behalf of Wikipedia editors. Editing an article does not equal "censorship", especially inasmuch as Wikipedia is not a governmental entity. In any event, from the research I just did, albeit quickly, it appears that Mr Boden was indeed the plaintiff in a discrimination lawsuit. That, however, does not in and of itself make him notable. Please see Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">guidelines to notability</a> to understand what is considered "notable". This is not to disparage Mr Boden's plight in any way; however, because Wikipedia is an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, and <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_Wikipedia_is_not_infinite_e3e9.html" title="User:Uncle G/Wikipedia is not infinite">Wikipedia is not infinite</a>.

<dd>I don't agree with your interpretation. There's no exactly threshold for the "Google test," but I get only 169 hits on exact phrase Robert Boden on google.co.uk returning only "pages from the UK:" <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22roger+boden%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryUK%7CcountryGB" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22roger+boden%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryUK%7CcountryGB" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Many of them do not seem to be the same Roger Boden who is the the subject of this article.

<li><b>Final post</b>: I disagree with your implied definitions of the words "impressive" and "newsworthiness". I no longer wish to spend my time on this earth defending the legitimacy of the article. Boden is significant - and those who fail to recognise this I can only describe as unfortunate souls. Whoever finally removes the Boden article should take a good hard look at themselves in the mirror and ask the question "Is this the right thing to do?", for I fear that you will have blood on your hands. I will never contribute to Wikipedia again in my life, as - with respect - it seems to be the domain of pedantic beings who lack spirit and vision.
