<p>i was born at 5:52am on may 27th in florida, did you know that? i'll be 25 tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>when i was 12 years old i made a time capsule and i wrote myself a letter. the capsule was to be opened in 12 years.</p>
<p>so, last year, i opened it up and read the letter. i really let 12 year old me down. of all the dreams he had, i hadn't done any of them.</p>
<p>but i don't have dreams anymore. i only have nightmares.</p>
<p>when i dream now it's dark. there's no way out of it. there's nothing to take me from the darkness. there's nowhere to go. it's hot and dark and quiet. no matter how far i go, i can run forever, and it never ends.</p>
<p>that's what i dream. that's what i see every time i blink.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> To begin, I think that every Vfd that Bloghate nominated, should be reverted, as he/she nominated quite a few articles in a short period of time, with lack of a valid reason. As for <b>this</b> article, it was created on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Buonauro&amp;oldid=4815143|00:00," class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Buonauro&amp;oldid=4815143|00:00," rel="nofollow">24 Jul 2004</a>, and I am quite sure that many wikipedians have seen it since. The votes for deletion stating that WP is not a memorial, is the lazy vote, I am sorry to say. It is quite unfortunate that the majortiy of the web has turned a great deal of his websites into memorials, rather than displaying his accomplishments. This article has been on Wiki for almost a year, Michael Buonauro must have been notable for his art and writing, and because a blog hater, nominated it along with several others, its up for removal. In the time it took to vote, or for me to even write this, the article could have been brought up to a higher standing, than just a memorial. Which by the way, I am doing as soon as I quit. Also, Google is not the only research tool on the net.

<dd>I agree that this article, in its current state, does not prove notability. However, there are other articles of very famous people, that only have one or two lines, and do not get deleted. Article lack of content, or poor layout, should not be grounds for deletion. Its just unfortunate, that this article got nominated in the manner it was, and may prove notability if someone actually did work on it. Either way, I dont know who he was, nor do I know anything about him, would rather the article be filled with content than deleted. <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who"><font color="#FF0033">&lt;&gt;</font>Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#00FF00">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¬ø</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a> 07:02, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ladies and gentlemen of the supposed VfD, the writer of this article would certainly want you to believe that it is encyclopedic. And they make a good case. Hell, I almost felt pity myself!</li>

<dl>
<dd>But ladies and gentlemen of this supposed VfD, I have one final thing I want you to consider: Ladies and gentlemen this [pointing to a picture of Chewbacca] is Chewbacca. Chewbacca is a Wookiee from the planet Kashyyyk, but Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now, think about that. That does not make sense! Why would a Wookiee‚Äîan eight foot tall Wookiee‚Äîwant to live on Endor with a bunch of two foot tall Ewoks? That does not make sense!</dd>
<dd>But more important, you have to ask yourself, what does this have to do with this case? Nothing. Ladies and gentlemen, it has nothing to do with this case! It does not make sense!</dd>
<dd>Look at me, I'm arguing to delete a nonsense essay, and I'm talkin' about Chewbacca. Does that make sense? Ladies and gentlemen, I am not making any sense. None of this makes sense!</dd>
<dd>And so you have to remember, when you're at your computers deliberating and conjugating <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>... does it make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, it does not make sense.</dd>

<li>Delete the former and keep Wagner: Far too granular. Notable politicians have an effect on the world. If their effect is merely the election, then their <i>names</i> can be in a list of officials in a year. Given that elections may be every year, there are going to be untold numbers of people in these positions. Remember, folks: there is a HUGE difference between containing the information and suggesting that there must be a <i>biography</i> of that person. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:58, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: There is no consensus that "notability" should be a criterion for inclusion. See <a href="../../../f/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7EFame_and_importance_8fa9.html#No" title="Wikipedia talk:Fame and importance">Jimbo Wales' view on notability</a>, as expressed in the poll where notability failed to become an accepted reason for deletion. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 16:02, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Inherently, it is <i>the</i> criterion behind all the others. We can call it "significance" or "importance," if we like, but it amounts to the same thing.

<li>But if one were to apply your very high standard of "having an effect on the world", it seems to be we would eliminate quite a lot of Wikipedia content: (1) all backbench Members of Parliament around the world; (2) state governors and their equivalents; (3) probably most cabinet ministers, other than ministers of finance, foreign affairs, and defence; (4) mayors of cities; and so on. If we set out to do that, then I think we have to giver serious consideration to the thousands of articles about various elements of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Category%7EStar_Trek_29d0.html" title="Category:Star Trek">Star Trek</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Category%7EStar_Wars_74fc.html" title="Category:Star Wars">Star Wars</a>, Buffy and <a href="../../../m/i/d/Category%7EMiddle-earth_books_33ed.html" title="Category:Middle-earth books">Lord of the Rings</a> universes. After all, these articles are about <i>fictional</i> characters. Do they affect world events? They do affect the lives of people who are interested in them, just as the Governor of Alaska affects Alaskans, and member of the Manitoba legislature affect Manitobans. If there are people who are interested in these people enough to write verifable, properly-linked and formatted non-vanity articles, I see no reason to cull them out. If we set a high standard of notability, then how is Wikipedia different from Brittanica or World Book?

<li>Would people ever want to know more information about these people, their times, and what happened. I argue, yes. What does it harm Wikipedia to have good concise articles on these former elected representatives? I think it helps. A World of Information at your keyboard.

<li><b>Delete</b> This information belongs on the pages of the works in question with explanation of why they are dubious.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Noting <i>dubious historical resources</i> is not a bad idea, but the items mentioned don't belong together. Livy's histories, for example, were not journalism in the modern sense, but more like docu-dramas, and were relatively accurate by that standard. A historical source that was biased or fraudulent by the standards of its time would be noteworthy. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 06:05, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> All historical sources are "dubious," in the sense that they should all be regarded with a healthy skepticism. Beyond that, any comparative exercise is unsalvagably POV. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 06:43, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> although a renaming to a better title might be in order. This is mostly a list of items which are not widely accepted by historians, and such a concept is valid. Looking at the page history, I see that this list used to include such items as the joke history book <a href="../../../1/0/6/1066_and_All_That_4595.html" title="1066 and All That">1066 and All That</a>. Incidentally, there is a good chance that there is a better version somewhere in the pages history. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 11:49, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and rewrite</b> Whether to trust a source is an important part of history that deserves its own article. If this is rewritten from that perspective, with the list just being a section of the article, (with at least one line of explanation for each,) then it will become a useful article. <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic_Mew_f169.html" title="User:Sonic Mew">Sonic Mew</a> 13:56, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is a good idea to deal with the topic you suggest, perhaps as a subsection under Historical research, or as a point of interest in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">History</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historian.html" title="Historian">Historian</a> articles. To convert this article to such content, though, it would essentially need to be totally rewritten <i>and</i> renamed. This might as well be deleted, in other words, because, although your concept is related to this one, there is virtually nothing useful to be transferred. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 18:20, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: The list is <i>inherently POV.</i> That's enough to kick it out. However, it is up to each author to indicate when there are doubts about a source used in an article. While I might well agree with the dubiousness of X or Y on this list, I can also go into any article that cites one of them and indicate the nature of the doubts about its validity.

<li><b>Move to meta.</b> Quoting myself from the Talk page: "It would be far more on-topic (&amp; less controversial) there.

There are a fair number of plausible historical facts for which Herodotus, the Old Testament, the Qur'an, or the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle are the principal source; and often, the original and sometimes the only source.

<p>Vanity. Self-promotion by author of non-notable stick figure webcomic "Man and Goat" (no Alexa data; 180+ single-panel installments)<a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> ‚Äî <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 02:40, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Vanity--<a href="../../../n/y/m/User%7ENymphadoraTonks_8482.html" title="User:NymphadoraTonks">NymphadoraTonks</a> 03:07, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Abstain</b> - I would like to make several points. First, this article is not self-promotion; the author of Man &amp; Goat resides in Canada (<a href="http://goatart.com/index.php?p=11" class="external free" title="http://goatart.com/index.php?p=11" rel="nofollow">http://goatart.com/index.php?p=11</a>), yet the article in question was written by a New Zealander. Second: Gwalla's derisive mention of 'stick figures' is a merely a refection of his personal taste, which should not be a factor in any decision on an articles fate. 180 panels is consistent with the length of time since its release; weekday installments for almost 10 months. Finally: Alexa's methods, as well as the very notion of web 'rank', are flawed, and its results are meaningless for niche sites such as this. <a href="../../../2/0/3/User%7E203.109.252.196.html" title="User:203.109.252.196">203.109.252.196</a> 04:03, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll concede that it's not strictly self-promotion; I was not aware of Mr. 203.109.254.50's nationality, and the article's style and content seemed consistent with the usual vanity pages that float through VfD. However, the mention of stick figures has very little to do with my personal taste, and very much to do with the amount of expended effort evident in the comic. The Alexa test is common for articles on websites that do not establish notability otherwise, and this one doesn't. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> ‚Äî <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 05:15, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: Wikipedia, like all encyclopedias, is inherently conservative about coverage.

<li>Sorry about the lack of bolding, now corrected. But perhaps you and I are using different google tests. My own gets <i>one million</i> for "phobia". The word is hardly new: the <i>OED</i> says it has been in use for over two hundred years, defining it as "Fear, horror, <i>or aversion</i>..." (my emphasis). But perhaps you're treating its use for a mere attitude as a novelty. Let's see what the new article says: <i>Usially</i> [sic] <i>it</i> [sc. "phobia"] <i>is described as fear, dislike, disapproval, prejudice, hatred, discrimination, or hostility towards the object of the phobia.</i> Thus it overlaps with the psychopathological usage of the word: the extension of a word with a strong meaning to everyday uses is normal in language: cf "starving", "famished", etc.; which I think are about as commonly used to describe the humdrum sensations I'm experiencing right now than they are for Oxfam's areas of concern. Here's Coleridge in 1801: "I ... have a perfect phobia of inns and coffee houses" -- thanks to his considerate addition of "perfect", this sounds like an attitude to me. So the word is widely used and two centuries old, the extension to mean mere "dislike" (etc.) doesn't seem new, and thus the description of the word or usage as a neologism seems bizarre. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 11:30, 2005 Jun 21 (UTC)

<li>All you can derive from the <i>Attitude</i> article is that a phobic attitude would be a manifestation of fear vis-a-vis a given object. Ergo, a phobic attitude may consist of, say, running away from a lion. If someone is a "homophobe," he would run away screaming from homosexuals. The previous version of the phobia article (that you mentioned) is utterly flawed and a wikipedia article is no evidence that you are right (if wikipedia articles were always right, none would be edited and none would be deleted).&#160;;-) <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 20:20, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm in favor of taking out large sections of excessively long articles and putting them into articles of their own, but this is not what's happened here. You're pulling out one use of a term and giving it its own article like a 2nd entry in a dictionary or something, specifically apparently because you don't like what you see as a confusion between the "real definition" and a false "popular definition". This looks a lot like POV pushing, although I'm sure that wasn't your intention. Your arguments make sense, but they're unconvincing. I'd prefer to see the material at Phobia#Non-clinical_uses_of_the_term be expanded and clarified rather than to see it split off into its own article...and at such time as it is sufficiently large to warrant its own article, I'd like to see a discussion of how to name that article on Talk:Phobia. I think that something with the word "Prejudice" in its name would be a much better title for such an article, however, than something containing the word "Phobia". <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 21:52, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)

<li>No,no,no. I can read a dictionary myself. I cannot, however, find one that defines phobia as (to quote from the article in question): "<i>Prejudice, hatred, discrimination, or hostility</i>."

I see that what you have done by creating this article is try to make a link for people so that they understand what "phobia" is meant in all those various articles. Your efforts are admirable and I see that you have only tried to be helpful. However, I think such an article is liable to confuse people and lead them into thinking that defining phobia (even as an attitude) as "<i>prejudice, hatred, discrimination, or hostility</i>" is technically acceptable. Therefore I suggest the following (and I hope we can achieve some consensus on this): The common (but technically flawed) use of the term "phobia" should be placed prominently in the wiki article <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia.html" title="Phobia">phobia</a>, and discussed more thoroughly there. The links (<a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrophobia.html" title="Afrophobia">Afrophobia</a>, etal.) should also be placed in that section. You have mentioned that this usage of the term is too inconspicuous in the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia.html" title="Phobia">Phobia</a> article, and I hope this suggestion would resolve that. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts, <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 06:04, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>You don't have to tell me the truth;-) yes, they are neologisms, so what? They are in wikipedia, not deleted.</li>
<li>"technically acceptable" thingy: Words have their semantic ranges. (I feel very uneasy when I have to teach someone English, which is not my native language.) Take the word "<a href="../../../c/r/e/Cretinism.html" title="Cretinism">cretinism</a>" and tell me how many usages of this word are "technically correct", i.e., refer to the deficiency of <a href="../../../t/h/y/Thyroid.html" title="Thyroid">thyroid</a> <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hormones.html" title="Hormones">hormones</a>? The same with "phobia". Want it or not, all dictionaries quote two meanings: the "techically correct" one, ie a kind of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disorder.html" title="Disorder">disorder</a>, and "common parlance", i.e., "fear, dislike, or aversion", which does not necessarily produces high blood pressure and sweating.</li>
<li>I am also well aware of a natural resistance of many people to propagating new meanings of the words. The life of a language is a combination of both flexibility, to accommodate the changing world, and conservatism, to keep the language from turning into a mess. Therefore I am not planning to wage edit wars over the issue.</li>
<li>I am aware as well that some people go over the board with words, and I anderstand your concern about encouraging the "nontechnical" usage of the word. Recently I have found an amazing example at this <a href="http://www.changethatsrightnow.com/shortdescriptionlist.asp?phobiaid=1821" class="external text" title="http://www.changethatsrightnow.com/shortdescriptionlist.asp?phobiaid=1821" rel="nofollow">lovely website</a>:

<li>This completely misses the point.

<li>In this relation I would suggest you think about reasons for the existence od <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disambiguation.html" title="Disambiguation">disambiguation</a> pages.

<ul>
<li>If you feel that strongly that the content of Non clinical usage of the term should not be included in the article, the proper way to handle this is by taking it up on the talk page. Since it's a bit late for that, perhaps you would consider renaming those parts of the article you've taken out and put in Phobia (attitude) and putting a disambig note at the top of the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phobia.html" title="Phobia">Phobia</a> article. I wouldn't personally be in favor of such a move, but I wouldn't oppose it as strongly as I oppose what you've done in the absence of discussion. (And no, let me clarify, I oppose what you've done, not the fact that you did it without discussion. If you'd be willing to discuss a change of name for the article and to put a HUGE {{cleanup}} on the resultant article, I'll be more than happy to reconsider my vote, and possibly to even urge others to do so as well.) <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 09:37, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I first noticed this page as a copyvio. You can see it was taken mostly from <a href="http://www-cs.engr.ccny.cuny.edu/~csmma/academic" class="external text" title="http://www-cs.engr.ccny.cuny.edu/~csmma/academic" rel="nofollow">here</a>. After I tagged it, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;hideminor=0&amp;namespace=&amp;target=Wikiklrsc&amp;limit=100&amp;offset=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;hideminor=0&amp;namespace=&amp;target=Wikiklrsc&amp;limit=100&amp;offset=0" rel="nofollow">person who put it on Wikipedia</a> notified me that they wrote it with Michael Anshel. So, this falls under the criteria for a vanity page. Additionally, it can be seen as a bit of spamming, as a link to his website was inserted several times and removed on the <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptography.html" title="Cryptography">cryptography</a> article by the same person as well. There is a question of lack of notability as well: half his CV is just stuff about his former students, only 8 published papers (compare with someone like <a href="http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/~ajmeneze/research.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/~ajmeneze/research.html" rel="nofollow">Menezes</a>).

Very cooperative and open to becoming better informed of policy. (I'm not the one to inform, perhaps someone with more knowledge can help?)

<li><b>Keep</b>. He seems notable. As far as Mgm's comment, it appears that an article on Scherer existed for over a year an half and was done by someone other than Scherer (judging by the content).

<li><b>Userfy</b> <u>or Delete</u>. The entire article has been typed by Karl Scherer except one single paragraph (the bit about the Turing machine). I believe we need to hold a firm line against self-promotion. Also note that the books are <b>self-published</b>, and the article has links to where you can buy them from <b>his site</b>. I can't remember ever seeing such a blatant attempt to use Wikipedia for financial gain. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 01:16, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC) Mr. Scherer has edited from at least 5 IPs that I have found so far, so there is no way to know that he isn't the sole contributor to the article. Regardless, the total notability claims are, building a Turing machine (unverifiable), having a handful of articles published in a 'math puzzles' magazine, and self-publishing content in a variety of media; even combined that doesn't seem that notable, especially to waive the 'no self-promotion' policy. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 17:10, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>N.b. there is a formal policy, and many precedents, against an article being recreated in any namespace (including User space) in the event of a successful formal VfD.

<p>Doce14 was aired via satellite on May 18, at 8 pm. I think the channel was number 23, because I watched it, but I'm not sure if it was 23 or 22. Anyway, it's satellite. On that site it says Record will be showing them, I don't know if Record bought the licenses to Doce 14 and Water Effect. But hey, those movies do exist. Don't know why to delete them from the encyclopedia.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. No IMDb entries, and I believe the IMDb does cover Brazilian movies. It seems to me if these exist they are unreleased films, equivalent to a vanity press novel. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 21:42, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Water Effect is unreleased. Doce 14 was released only on satellite.</p>
<ul>
<li>Then delete Water Effect for being unreleased, and as such not notable, and the rest for being unverifiable, possible vanity, as google doesn't really turn up anything (0 hits for Grazielle, some for Franco but nothing significant from what I could tell). I don't think these cut mustard whatever language they're in, so cries of systemic bias don't apply. There are some subjects Google doesn't cover well, but recent films is not one of them. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 14:30, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

I think deleting every new bit of information goes against what wikipedia represents. My keep vote is mostly because the article gives a source for its reference. If it did not have the source I would vote to merge it into <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>. I wonder how long until someone erases the source from the article now that I mentioned this. <a href="../../../m/u/i/User%7EMuijzo_2710.html" title="User:Muijzo">Muijzo</a> 03:04, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is a fascinating one. Although one of the first three delete votes (that came within one minute of each other) claimed that he found transracial in a dictionary, none exists. Now I have heard the news refer to Michael Jackson as transracial, so I checked several web dictionaries. None have definitions of transracial. I see that the article was once a link to passing, but no proof exists that these words mean the same thing. Without a dictionary reference at all, I think the relation to passing is wrong. I did a google search for transracial and Michael Jackson, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=&amp;q=transracial+%22Michael+Jackson%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=&amp;q=transracial+%22Michael+Jackson%22" rel="nofollow">See this link for the search</a>. At present there are hundreds of pages all citing him as transracial. Now the person who changed it from a redirect is, according to their user page, a transexual, so I obviously assume they must feel that transracial is like transexual. There was a point raised about renaming this article, but it is moot since <i>transracial</i> is in common usage referring to <i>The King of Pop</i>. Clearly Shorthair did not make this word up out of her (or is it his?) head. Chunitaku 04:08, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ana√Øs Nin</dd>
<dd>Thanks to "advances" in medical and psychiatric technology, we are now able to view gender as a transformative aspect of life: we are not stuck in the sexed body with which we were born. However, our racial identity is still something that seems biologically inescapable, in spite of the now very rich and convincing theoretical history of its constructed, non-essential nature. While the history of transsexualism is marked by the potentially political affect of social transgression, the history of transraciality speaks to us from advertisements for skin-blanching creams, history-denying acts of racial passing, and community-betrayal. Why else the negative reaction-from disgust to ridicule-to Michael Jackson‚Äôs plastic surgery escapades? This is, however, contrary to the everyday experience which finds that individual and group racial identification is a process which is necessarily transracial: in declaring ourselves racially, we all cross boundaries set by societies contemporary and past. In this course, we will attempt to produce an idea of idea of race based on the best of transsexualism. The "race" produced thus, like the "third" gender produced by transsexuality, will lead to a complication of existent preconceptions about racial stereotypes and formation.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I believe it's an interesting article.

And I don't think Michael Jackson will be the last to have this surgery. Oh and a <b>comment</b>, if you think we should change the article name to have the word transformation in it, let's discuss it here, too. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimRaynor_eac5.html" title="User:JimRaynor">JimRaynor</a> 18:58, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comments</b>. I don't think that "Transracial" is a good article title, because it's awkward for an adjective by itself to be an article title ("Interracial" redirects to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interracial_couple.html" title="Interracial couple">Interracial couple</a> for the same reason). Clearly the topic is notable, but the question is now what to call it. "Transracial transformation" gets only 4 Google hits, so if we renamed the article to that, it would just be a neologism; the Google query for "transracialism" did not do much better. One idea I have is to create a new article on Race choice and merge content from this article and <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passing.html" title="Passing">passing</a> over there. The transracial article, for the most part, looks like a POV rant about Michael Jackson that's already covered in the Michael Jackson article; certainly he is worth mentioning as a notable case, but it shouldn't just be about him if possible (and his case should merely be mentioned, since his own article discusses it in detail). I'd suggest bringing this topic up at <a href="../../../r/a/c/Talk%7ERace_e2a4.html" title="Talk:Race">Talk:Race</a> and/or <a href="../../../m/i/c/Talk%7EMichael_Jackson_4164.html" title="Talk:Michael Jackson">Talk:Michael Jackson</a> to gain additional perspectives on it. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 05:54, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "race choice" wouldn't be useful. "Transracial modification"&#160;? "racial modification"? We need something that people can find easily. I agree it should not just be about Michael Jackson... I just thought of another reference, albeit from fiction--In the latest James Bond movie, the villain was Korean but through radical surgery (genetic stuff too) he changed himself to appear Brittish with the side effect that he needs an expensive machine to get sleep. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexicEditor_aec8.html" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 06:32, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you for explaining your reason for nominating this for deletion. As a few editors and I have stated below, we do not believe that this promotes the organization. If you believe it is POV, then by all means, edit it to remove the POV, or at least tag it as being POV. Nominating for deletion is not the appropriate way of dealing with POV issues. If this article is to be deleted because mere mention of the organization and what it stands for makes this a "soapbox", then we would have to look at deleting <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Republican_Party_faa7.html" title="United States Republican Party">United States Republican Party</a>, and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Democratic_Party_b5cb.html" title="United States Democratic Party">United States Democratic Party</a>, amongst many others.

<li>I see. Then the issue you have is with me not so much as to why I chose the "VfD". Why was this article introduced here in the first place?

<ul>
<li>Nothing is being <i>repeated</i> ‚Äì the article should serve as an NPOV description of the organization, its goals, and its activities. That's <i>not</i> something you can get from its website, as anything put out by the group itself would be biased. Wikipedia is an <i>encyclopedia</i>. It contains information about people. places, and organizations, among other things. That someone chose to add an article about this particular organization should not be a problem, unless it's POV, in which case the problem's solution is clear: edit the article, not delete it. And, no, I'm not trying to "VfD" you, but you clearly have some fundamental misunderstanding of Wikipedia's purpose and/or its policies.

<li>I have added info on their activities that show their "notability" (not that non-notablity is an accepted grounds for deletion).

<li>Axon, I encourage you to re-think your comments. I do not think that they are reasonable. I think that most people would agree that reviewing 66,000 weblinks is not a productive use of an active Wikipedia editor's time. I will spend that time making new contributions, copyediting, fixing links, and so on, instead of wasting it on a hugely time-comsuming exercise like that. <b>If</b> non-notability were an accepted grounds for deletion (which it is <a href="../../../f/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7EFame_and_importance_8fa9.html#No" title="Wikipedia talk:Fame and importance">not</a>), and <b>if</b> the Google test were accepted as an fair and accurate test of notability (which it is <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html#Validity_of_the_Google_test" title="Wikipedia:Google test">not</a>), <b>then</b> it might be worth spending time to determine if there were 500 or 1000 (or however many hits were accepted as the threshold) hits linking to this organization. But telling someone that they have to investigate all 66,000 is not in keeping with the spirit of Wikipedia, in my opinion. <s>-- at this point, I must stop in order to avoid an allusion to mental illness, which, as a personal attack, would violate Wikipedia etiquette.</s> In order to meet the 1,000 threshold, only 1.5% of the hits would have to be for this organization. I took a sample in which 98% of the hits were for this organization. I think that should be sufficient evidence. What we have here is a verifiable, NPOV article about a real organization with numerous members. We do not have accepted grounds for deletion, your unreasonable demands for excessive verification notwithstanding. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 28 June 2005 13:20 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Without wanting to get into a lengthy debate about wikipedia policy, notability is relevant for deciding what is and isn't simple promotion/advertising and for determining what is and isn't encylopaedic, and the google test, whilst not definitive, is a good rule of thumb for determining notability. With this in mind, I stand by my vote and my remarks here. No ammount of hand-waving, childish references to my mental state or flawed intepretations of google results will change my mind. Others are free to interpret my remarks and vote as the feel. <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 28 June 2005 13:45 (UTC)</li>
<li>I will withdraw my inappropriate and unnecessary remark. I still would like to know why you really think it is a good use of a Wikipedia editor's time to investigate 66,000 links on a google test. More importantly, if you're going to live by the sword, you also have to die by the sword. If you accept the Google test as a "good rule of thumb", then I think you have to change your vote. I have shown a Google test that, if only 1.5% of the reuslts are links to this organization, "proves notability". I have also undertaken a large sample that shows that 98% of those sampled did. I don't think that you can rejecting this analysis on the basis that I did not invest several days in checking every link. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 28 June 2005 17:32 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I apologize for the misunderstanding with these defintions that I posted. These terms refer to important concepts currently in use by the development industry. I posted it on Wikipedia, because, as an opensource platform, others would have the opportunity to edit these defintions. Through Wikipedia, I had hoped to have an opportunity to see how others understand this concept to broaden my own understanding. Now that I have clarified that, I would not consider it fair to delete these terms only because they are newly coined. Wikipedia hosts many new phrases, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHB" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHB" rel="nofollow">PHB</a> (the comment above introduced me to that acronym), which can be interpreted as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per-Hop_Behaviour" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per-Hop_Behaviour" rel="nofollow">Per-Hop Behaviour</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointy_Haired_Boss" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointy_Haired_Boss" rel="nofollow">Pointy Haired Boss</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhydroxybutyrate" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhydroxybutyrate" rel="nofollow">Polyhydroxybutyrate</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Players_Handbook" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Players_Handbook" rel="nofollow">Player's Handbook</a>, and Pyscho Hose Beast. In fact, considering that Wikipedia's strength lies in its ability to be revised by anyone at any time and to remain abreast of the latest developments in ideas, should it not encourage that its members post neologisms? What else is the information revolution about than the creation of new concepts? JFMahon3 15:15, 22 June 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep It</b>. I've heard of "Base of the Pyramid" (BOP) before from reading C.K. Prahalad's book. It's a fairly new development strategy that is gaining more widespread attention. Similiarly, "Nextbillion" may begin to come into use as the concept of BOP spreads, since the two terms are intertwined. Lpinto

<li><b>KEEP IT</b>. Michael Snow is a known problem user at wikipedia who feels obligated to police everyone but himself. The purpose of an endeavor such as wikipedia is open-source, free contribution from one and all. Were this to be removed, it would be yet another instance of the wiki gestapo attempting to force their own misguided and arbitrary set of "standards"--to which no one contributing here has had to agree--on others. My own hard work here has fallen victim to the same sort of criticism by the ignorant and self-absorbed here who believe that they run this place. The fact of the matter is that there's only one rule here: There are no rules at wikipedia. That being said, nobody has any right to delete others' work, as long as it is factually accurate. Editing and expanding upon of articles is, needless to say, welcome here and what is intended to occur here. Removal of information with which some may disagree should <b>never</b> be tolerated.172.174.76.106 16:46, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep It</b>. I did indeed contribute to the writing of the BOP article because, as I said, I have read about BOP before and wanted to contribute my knowledge. I see no problem with having a legitimate, factual posting on an online dictionary that is open to all. I highly agree with the above post in that things should remain on Wikipedia so long as they are factual and contribute to society. These are documented concepts where links to outside research can be found within the definitions.

<li><b>Keep It</b>. I belief it's a valuable endeavour to define this important concept at Wikipedia, even though there is still some discussion on the definition. Therefore, I hope the discussion-section of the article will also be used more. An encyclopaedia wouldn't be complete without this concept, which is somewhat new but at the same time established and increasingly an important area for scientific research.

Given that this action was taken by a participant in the debate, I reverted this as improper and premature.

<p>Hey Michael, I finally had time today to clean up some of the corporate flattery of linking to a press release and other lame content that made it into this entry that I stated and feel that this it is straight to the point now and stays focused on severing the general public who is interested in an economic development philosophy.</p>
<p>I am committed to keeping track of this post and would like this voting to end 1) What do you think? Do you see merit in the post now? 2) Can we stop this silly voting just because some intern did not understand the greater good of Wikipedia and stuck some press release link in? -- User:Ericgundersen, 29 June 2005 08:45 (est)</p>

<dd>I don't see much difference, it still looks like an attempt to promote an insignificant discussion forum.

<p>Michael, Why is <a href="../../../b/o/t/Bottom_of_the_Pyramid_d533.html" title="Bottom of the Pyramid">Bottom of the Pyramid</a> on the deletion vote with Next Billion? They are not related. I guess I didn‚Äôt see that before. Now I am starting to think that you didn‚Äôt even bother to read these posts. What are you trying to do grouping them in together? They are different.

<dd>They're related for the purposes of this discussion because they're both newly coined phrases being used to market a discussion forum. (The fact that you started both articles at the same time is a pretty good indication of the relationship.) If one gets deleted, all the same arguments apply for deleting the other one, and if one stays, they might as well both stay. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 29 June 2005 16:47 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>But the whole point is that they're NOT "newly coined"! The phrase "bottom of the pyramid" is very well established and used quite frequently. Try a google search on it or just check out the links in its definition! "Next billion" is growing as a popularly-used phrase and can also be found used in several different areas with a simple Internet search. Michael, you are the only person who insists on the deletion of these terms and there are several others who have spoken out to keep them. Under the guidelines of Wikipedia, this debate should be over and the entries remain.</p>
<p>Based on Michaels recent move to include Bottom of the Pyramid in with this vote for deletion it is now clear that this just a personal attack on my postings because of some twisted personal vendetta- Michael wrote 'The fact that you started both articles at the same time is a pretty good indication of the relationship.' How can we call this vote to order? Does Michale do this to other people in this community? What can we do here? This is just silly... I want to end this. Michael is so stupid that he thinks these two phrases are used to market a discussion forum rather than shed light on economic development. How does an open community deal with people that try to be disruptive? Anyone?-- User:Ericgundersen, 4 July 2005 09:17 (est)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. First of all, I dread the idea that we will now have articles for every possible matching of sports teams.

<ul>
<li>Well, I assume that was all the stats the article's creator had to hand - there's no reason why it can't be expanded back to 1905. On the other hand, there's nothing particularly special about this matchup - there are a dozen professional clubs in London, and these two are not traditional enemies as such (Arsenal-Spurs and Chelsea-Fulham would be the notable derby matches). <b>Abstain</b> for now, but it at least needs some heavy cleanup. <a href="../../../s/j/o/User%7ESjorford_d4b9.html" title="User:Sjorford">sjorford</a> <a href="../../../s/j/o/User_talk%7ESjorford_13fb.html" title="User talk:Sjorford">‚Üí‚Ä¢‚Üê</a> 21:14, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agree with Sjorford. Though this could be fairly interesting, there are dozens of potential matchups like this in English football alone (Man C vs Man U? Liverpool vs Everton? Charlton vs West Ham?), not including traditional non-derby rivalries like Arsenal vs Liverpool, let alone in other countries and other sports - we could be swamped. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 01:33, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font>

And that's just England - what about Celtic-Rangers, Hearts-Hibs, Dundee-Dundee Utd from Scotland, and Cardiff-Swansea from Wales (plus others in the lower divisions)? Toss in the ones from the rest of Europe and indeed the world, and while we're at it, international rivalries like England-Scotland and Brazil-Argentina, and we're looking at over a hundred, at the very least. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 08:21, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, I'm saying it's possible for WikiProjects to define their own aims and objectives within the broader aims and objectives of Wikipedia. Reducing bias against Jewish people is compatible with the aims of objectives of Wikipedia. THis would apply to any similar project aimed at identifying and reducing systemic bias against any reasonably well defined group of people. Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Scots, Maoris, Canadians, Nazis, Black Americans, Welsh Lesbian Feminist Poets. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:04, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It is only compatable with Wikipedia policy if it simultaneously aims to reduce bias <b>towards</b> Jewish people. If it seeks only to reduce the bias against them, then its actions are one sided, and thus not NPOV, and if successful, without a counter-project, would result in a situation where only pro-Jewish bias remains.

<dd>This is a very odd counter-argument.

<dd>How is a project not bound by NPOV? Article space is subject to NPOV, and the sole purpose of projects is to modify/add/remove content in article space. IF it is allowed to be non-NPOV, then this is saying that activities which produce non-NPOV edits to article space are acceptable, which they are not. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 5 July 2005 08:10 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Projects don't make edits, editors do. They are bound by NPOV in article space. Nobody's suggesting that WikiProjects would be engines for the production of POV edits except you. As far as I've been able to ascertain, this is a straw man. A person encountering a bias in an article and removing it would in your view, it appears to me, be leaving behind a biased article unless he or someone else removed an equal and opposite bias in the other direction. This is obviously wrong, bias does not occur nearly in equal and opposite pairs. Removing bias in one direction does not add it in another. The target is balance. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 5 July 2005 14:15 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I find the recent conduct of <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> vis-√†-vis the article in question disturbing. The VfD notice (posted by <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a>) states explicitly that, while editing an article on VfD is OK, blanking is not. Within the space of two hours, <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> posted the VfD notice, posted his rationale for it <i>on the project page</i>, and blanked all of the project text except for the reservations of <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">User:Jfdwolff</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">User:Jayjg</a>. In fact, he used the year-old reservations as justification (in the edit summaries) for blanking (see the history of this article and the successive diffs for specifics). Additionally, <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> responded to several very old posts in a provocative manner, an ostensibly pointless gesture. As a side point, POV is endemic to project pages (especially nationality ones), and I don't see why this one should be singled out for POV. I think that <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>'s contentions display an apt understanding of Wikipedia policy, yet <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> believes that a project dedicated towards making articles more neutral by targeting specific types of biases inappropriately inserted in those articles amounts to severe violation of Wikipedia policy. Much more appropriate reasons for deletion, I would think, are the following:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A.) This project is not the product of consensus.</dd>
<dd>B.) This project appears static; it's a one-time posting of someone's suggestions vis-√†-vis editing conduct (which basically said, before it was recently blanked, that Jewish editors should follow Wikipedia's civility guidelines and not feel provoked by apparent hostility).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Both these reasons are weak, anyway. It seems to me that this VfD (and related editing) is the product of someone who feels uncomfortable with the existence of a page on Wikipedia that suggests anti-Jewish sentiments among some Wikipedia editors. This editor would, apparently, only be satisfied with the deletion of this page or the creation of a project page suggesting equivalent <i>Pro-Jewish Bias</i>. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> says that the existence of this project page should be dependant on the existence of its counterpart. While I wouldn't otherwise care about the preservation of this page (when I first saw it, I thought it was a bit strange), I wouldn't contribute to an effort to officially confirm the idea that anti-Jewish bias is either absent from all of Wikipedia (I've witnessed many explicit and obscene anti-Semitic vandal attacks over the past several weeks, BTW) or perfectly balanced by pro-Jewish bias (I've seen no explicit or obscene pro-Jewish vandal attacks, except on the user pages of Jewish editors in an effort to "expose" the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_1249.html" title="Protocols of the Elders of Zion">Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a> and the like). While bias and POV certainly go both ways, there is no need to obsess about pin-point equivalence between anti and pro-Jewish sentiments.

<dd>Firstly, I don't mind if you refer to me as <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">-Ril-</a> rather than <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a>, but that is your choice entirely.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, I deleted the content of the front page, as two editors, including at least one who was Jewish, on that said front page, suggested it be deleted. That was almost 1 year ago, and no objections to them had been <i>obviously</i> raised in that time, so I went ahead and did it - 1 year is enough time to see if there are any objections. N.b. I explicitely stated that it was me who deleted the content on the page itself, so it is not as if this was anything secretive.</dd>
<dd>Thirdly, the counter-project I suggested is necessary to retain a semblence of NPOV, to say that we can only address "Anti-Jewish bias", but must ignore "Pro-Jewish bias", is extremely non-NPOV. The necessity for this counter-project for NPOV is what demonstrates that the project itself is inherently in violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, since, without it, there will only be a biased situation (as Pro-Jewish bias would remain but without any balancing Anti-Jewish bias).</dd>
<dd>Fourthly, you have the events <b>in the wrong order</b>. I left an NPOV dispute comment on the talk page first. Then, realising the extent of the violation of NPOV, and how much it was inherent, decided that it belonged on VfD rather than just as a dispute, so added it here.</dd>
<dd>Fifthly a VfD is <b>not</b> a disruption of Wikipedia, but <b>standard procedure</b>, so it cannot fall foul of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a>
<dl>
<dd>Ril, those editors you mention never suggested that the page be blanked, and they certainly didn't suggest blanking during VfD. They mentioned that the material was inappropriately placed. I don't really think that blanking during a VfD is helpful for anyone. Furthermore, the lack of response to those editors' comments was probably due to lack of interest, not agreement, and that hardly amounts to consensus. Consensus is what is being reached here, and you already read my reservations about the circumstances.</dd>
<dd>If you think that an <i>Addressing pro-Jewish Bias</i> project would be helpful then you have the prerogative to start one and see how the Wikipedia community takes it. While you also have the prerogative of placing this on VfD, following guidelines can still be a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. I think this is a case in point, as I detailed above, and the NPOV tag doesn't change things much.</dd>
<dd>I think that the "project" in question has potential and could develop if attention was paid it (which it probably would be, by now); it could be turned from a sermon into an actual project focusing on balancing polarizing articles (which I am still ambivalent about voting for, as I'm undecided about whether this project is redundant: One the one hand, it's already technically encompassed by the <i>Countering Systemic Bias</i> project; on the other hand, perhaps it's enough of an issue to justify special attention). True that it would be a POV project in the sense that it would target specific types of articles for NPOVing. However, this type of POV motivates much of Wikipedia's growth and is a valuable asset. That is what projects are for: Being narrow-scoped on an individual basis for the sake of a broad-scoped, balanced encyclopedia as a whole. It is surprising that anyone could miss the intro to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, which states that the NPOV policy only applies to <b>"articles"</b>! P.S. I didn't mean to accuse you of being secretive; I meant to point out your activities regarding the project. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 18:35, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anti (x) and pro (x) <b>are</b> equivalent, because pro (x) is anti (y) where y is the situation that is the aim of anti (x). So one situation is anti(x) and the other anti(y). Pro-Jewish bias is bias supports whatever situation it is that Jews, particularly extremists (whatever this may mean) <i>prefer</i>, e.g. "Jews have a fundamental right to 100% of the Gaza Strip and West Bank" (not necessarily true, but for the purposes of an example).

<dd>I think you're conflating systemic and systematic bias here. As far as I can tell, this project is all about <i>systematic</i> bias, and suggests that people are going round deliberately introducing an anti-Jewish bias into Wikipedia. WikiProject Countering systemic bias just says that because we have more Star Trek fans contributing to Wikipedia than we do experts on African politics, it might be a nice idea to coordinate activities to try and write articles about under-represented topics. Apart from the similar names, the two projects have almost nothing in common. ‚Äî <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 1 July 2005 12:42 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Whilst addressing bias against any group on the Wikipedia is necessary, anti-Jewish bias on the vast majority of articles is quickly addressed by the hard work of a variety of contributors, both Jewish and otherwise. On the contrary, this project can only serve to inflame things as it will undoubtedly serve as a POV magnet which is more likely to attract anti-Jewish contributors and conspiracy nuts rather than combat them. The material about Jews being 'naturally moral' has no place on Wikipedia, constituting as it does both religious activism and (in the reasoning employed) original research.<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Lakeman_fa5a.html" title="User:Will Lakeman">illWill</a> 13:53, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Reluctant <b>delete</b>. I think some of the scope of what this WikiProject intends is commendable, but to single out anti-Jewish bias this way seems wrong, and (given that I have not seen a tendency for articles on the Jews to be more often biased one way than the other) seems like it may effectively be an incitement to a pro-Jewish bias, or (more precisely) a pro-Jewish-establishment bias. I would suggest though, that rather than abandon this project entirely, it might be more appropriate to broaden it to a project on eliminating ethnic and religious bias generally, rather than (as this is in part) a call for "Jewish pride". I'm all for "Jewish pride", but not at the expense of the pride of any other people. Even the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Defamation_League_5083.html" title="Anti-Defamation League">Anti-Defamation League</a> of B'nai Brith understands that, in the United States, its work must encompass combatting prejudice against African Americans as much as prejudice against Jews.

<li><b>Comment</b>. While I have been dubious of the project from the start (as my comments there from a year ago have shown), I must say I find a number of the delete rationales here to be troubling. I think HKT's comments are right on the mark; suggestions that the project can only stay if there is a project addressing "Pro-Jewish" bias, or that it should be deleted because it is defunct, or that addressing systemic bias also addresses specific bias, are based on fundamental misunderstandings of NPOV, Wikipedia policy, and the meaning of "systemic bias". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 5 July 2005 03:42 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think it's notable enough to merit its own article. I don't live in Turku, so I don't know the specifics, but I think it wasn't such a major event.

<li><b>Wiktionary</b>. Being from the future, I must point out that just because a neologism is new doesn't mean that it won't last. Seeing as the IWW were actually 'Wobblies', I don't see how this term infringes on the context of that article. Likewise, since many, many, many Workers of the World are now International, who better to make up a wob than Wobblies? Let's save ourselves the irony of a wob action in response to an insensitive deletion of such a fine young term. Let's just agree that this is not for the encyclopedia, but should be immortallized in the Wiktionary.

<li>Yes... right, but what's your idea? That there should be a full article for <i>Traditional music</i> to include that, pointing to <i>Folk music</i> as a quasi-synonim, and including the content of <i>Trad</i> as a section?

<p>A filmmaker under 20, currently studying etc. Can't be found from IMDB (there's one Robin Sharp there, but as he was in Boogie Nights as "band member" and this Sharp was born in 1986, he would've been about 11 at the time, so I doubt he was the same guy); no Google hits that I can find except his own website. (His friend, Cooper Sanborn, has a similar status and they apparently work/study together. I also posted a <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Cooper_Sanborn_7dc7.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Cooper Sanborn">VfD about his entry</a>.) I'm sure he's a nice guy and all, but he's just not notable yet -- seems to be vanity <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:07, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. We should check out the notability of the <i>ESA Film Festival</i>, and the guy's dad, Liam Sharp, whom the author claims is critically acclaimed. Since wikipedia doesn't have an article for that yet, I think it's safe to bet it's vanity. So make that a <b>weak delete</b>. -<a href="../../../h/m/i/User%7EHmib_4096.html" title="User:Hmib">Hmib</a> 03:36, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>His dad might be notable, plenty of google hits, but only three for ESA film festival, it appears to be a school film festival. I still say the son isn't notable. --<a href="../../../e/t/a/User%7EEtacar11_a365.html" title="User:Etacar11">Etacar11</a> 03:43, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Also, I don't think his father's notability enters into it -- if he's notable enough, his son might be briefly mentioned in that article, but that wouldn't really merit the younger Sharp an article of his own, I think... -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 10:34, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)
