<dd>A Mr David Sale and a Dr Ray Dam claim to have offered to buy MG Rover for $5billion. They say they're from a Thailand-based outfit called the Office of International Treasury Control created by ``Governments of the World of Legal Decadency<i>. They complain that Rover's administrators PWC won't take their offer seriously but say that Tony Blair has acknowledged it in a letter. Downing St says it has no record of a letter but that it ``could still be in the system</i>. PWC has never heard of them. Nevertheless, Dam and Sale have big plans for Rover if their offer is accepted - factories in Longbridge, Russia, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. <b>Alas, the Bangkok number on their letterhead doesn't exist.</b> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2005/04/27/ccdiary27.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2005/04/27/ccdiary27.xml" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>

<li><b>Move</b> per Khaosworks. Quasi-legal puffery sounds exactly like typical fraud perpetration, devoid of any verfiable details. But we do need to make this a clean, well written, properly referenced article. I see it this way: if this is a fraud, they won't be able to produce reliable sources and have earned this global outing; if this is really a secret U.N.-sponsored operation, its inability to defend itself with unreleasable, unprovable documents will demonstrate why such things are anathema in free societies. Either way, the article (under an NPOV title) is justified by information provided by reliable sources, per WP policy. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 03:51, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> My personal convictions are the same as khaosworks'. I moved the article after a complaint about this article on my talk page and reading through the article and the previous AfD, this was probably a bad move on my part - at the time I saw it the same as <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_fraud.html" title="Internet fraud">Internet fraud</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/e/Credit_card_fraud.html" title="Credit card fraud">Credit card fraud</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wire_fraud.html" title="Wire fraud">Wire fraud</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/i/Click_fraud.html" title="Click fraud">Click fraud</a> and the like. It has now become apparent that this will be difficult to prove as fraud per se and am content to have it moved back to the original location. I see no reason to delete the article though I see immense problems in maintaining the article's neutrality but having been involved in inadvertantly clouding the waters, I refrain from voicing that opinion. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_alf_522c.html" title="User:Wiki alf">Alf</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWiki_alf_56f1.html" title="User talk:Wiki alf"><font color="green">melmac</font></a></sup> 14:01, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have attempted to address your concern by changing the first paragraph and referrign, with links, to the OITC own account of their creation (as published in the London Daily Telegraph), and to the newspapers that have not refrained from clearly stating that the OITC is an international scam and a hoax. As I have mentioned in the discussion page, all the original information included there has been taken from governmental websites and well-known newspapers. The so called "sources" presented by the OITC people are nothing but a list of incoherences and bizarre claims, wholly unverifiable. I hope the wikipedians will be able to consider the difference and will allow this very necessary article to remain.24.215.205.163&#160;<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.215.205.163.html" title="User talk:24.215.205.163">(talk)</a> 02:13, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Speedy Delete. Comment. This articles carries dangers that are beyond comprehension. In both cases, Ecuador and Fiji, the newspaper reports are based upon supposition, they are totally based upon flawed information and in the Ecuador case, the press is using its power to destroy a rival. The MG Rover situation stating that OITC offered $10 is nonsense. There is a great deal more to it than that. I am a retired police officer, but I spent a lot of time years ago investigating Keith Scott who is an Australian citizen. I have found that while he does engage in unusual financial dealings, as stated by Police Commissioner Hughes, he also delivers. I know of no case where Scott or OITC have ever engaged in fraud, and they have been operating for more than ten years. Yes there is a file a foot thick on Scott, but there is NO evidence that he has ever committed or intended to commit fraud. When under such surveillance, he would have been arrested and incarcerated years ago if he was a scammer. The newspapers rage in Fiji that landowners will have to mortgage their lands, which has been proven to be total nonsense.</p>
<p>Here is why I say this article is dangerous. 1. It definitely impairs the capacity to do correct due diligence which is available through official sources. 2. OITC will eventually sue these newspapers, of that I am sure. Sefanaia Kaumaitotoya warned the press on this. The Prime Minister in Fiji is now very careful what he says about OITC today, Andrew Hughes has gone silent, even though the government and police websites still carry these statements. Extension of these falsehoods and the perpetuating of them is not only irresponsible, for they are merely supposition born from ignorance, these attacks on OITC are criminal. I know OITC lawyers will be asking for the IP address and identity of the person posting these falsehoods. I am told that a leading law firm in Fiji will be paid by OITC in this coming week to file against the Fiji Times and FijiSun Newspapers and to file against The Commissioner of Police. Is this an empty threat. No. As will be learned this week,it is a fact. I am not certain of the legal liabilities of Wikipedia as such, but you will be hearing from OITC lawyers this coming week</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Fiji have constantly refused to denounce OITC. Why? Because they know better. Posted by Waffleknocka 28/4/2006</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The person posting under the username Waffleknocka has appeared here before, and was one of the first vandalizing the original article to suit the views of the OITC. He uses the IP address 202.47.96.40. As any other interested person can check, such adress is one of the many proxys used to hide and to disguise their real IP online (a Google search will show it in many lists all over the net). So, as usual and working with rather rudimentary means, the OITC people are attempting to hide while menacing other users and the very Wikipedia with supposed lawsuits. 24.215.205.122</li>

I, Lambiam, am the sole plenipotentiary authorized by the Intergalactic Connivance of Utterly Demoralizing Barbarities to pay 6 TRILLION (6.000.000.000.000,000) Doghdoohs to the first person to conclusively show that the OITC is not a scam. As a proof of which 3 TRILLION (3.000.000.000.000,000) Doghdoohs in bullion kryptonite are held in Escrow in an impervium vault at the First And Only Monodic Self-Storage Facility on the second moon of Endurium. This is a <u>known <b>fact</b></u>, there is <i>no point</i> in "denying" it!!! My credentials under code YCFSOTPAOTT are ultra-secret and can only be viewed by anyone with Intergalactic Clearance Level (ICL) AAAAA++ or AAAAA**. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:11, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
