<p>Non-notable biography: the name returns only 26 hits on Google, while "Daniel Koshute" returns only 55. I see no other evidence for notability. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandyWang_b828.html" title="User:RandyWang">RandyWang</a> (<sup><a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandyWang_f768.html" title="User talk:RandyWang"><b>raves</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RandyWang_7371.html" title="Special:Contributions/RandyWang"><b>rants</b></a></sub>) 08:22, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I whole-heartedly disagree. I decided to look up Dan's bands and make a page on Wikipedia because people ask me about Dan Koshute and want information on him. Everything I wrote on that page is absolutely one-hundred-percent factual. You say it's not a notable biography, but people can't look for him if we don't have something for him. He's done a lot of studio recording and he's an unfathomable talent. He plays with lots of people and does tons of gigs, so people would very much benefit from having a source of info avaiable on Wikipedia. If it gets deleted then there's nothing I can do about that but I will be deeply personally insulted as I put a lot of heart and soul into that webpage. There's no word for it other than injustice. I'll puke if in a year Dan Koshute becomes a popular radio artist and you guys deleted my page on him. How big do you have to be to be on Wikipedia? I know artists with ten well-selling independent albums, but they don't get play on VH1 or Clearchannel, does that mean that no one would want information on them or that they're unworthy of being talked about? I can't concieve of any serious ill that having this informative available would do. It's not a vanity piece what-so-ever since I'm not Dan Koshute and I don't even know him personally. I've just seen him perform. I'm nothing but a passionate fan, case in point see the glowing review I gave to <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/ramblinron" class="external text" title="http://cdbaby.com/cd/ramblinron" rel="nofollow">Rambling Ron Boone</a>. --AboveGroundSound 08:39, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please remember, I'm not disputing the factual accuracy or validity of any of the information in the article: I'm arguing that Dan Koshute is not a notable enough artist to warrant an article of his own in this encyclopedia. Whether he is famous in a year's time or not is irrelevant, really, since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>: we live in the here and now, so we need to look at the situation as it is at present. This article need not be deleted if you can provide evidence that Dan Koshute is <i>now</i> famous, notable or significant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On that note, please don't take offense at these proceedings and their outcome, whatever it may be. They are in no way intended to be a personal insult or slight on your ability as a contributor - I, myself, have had more than a few of my edits reverted and/or deleted entirely. Nearly every long-time contributor at Wikipedia has. Deletions, such as this, are a normal part of the Wikipedia process, and are <b>never</b> intended to as an insult. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandyWang_b828.html" title="User:RandyWang">RandyWang</a> (<sup><a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandyWang_f768.html" title="User talk:RandyWang"><b>raves</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RandyWang_7371.html" title="Special:Contributions/RandyWang"><b>rants</b></a></sub>) 08:48, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>More google results might come up for The Rhodora as far as the many places they play. Though I tried it and it's also the name of a poem. If I merged Dan with pages on The Rhodora and/or other related bands or rising stars would that be any better? --AboveGroundSound 08:45, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's a worthwhile suggestion, but I don't believe that would be an adequate solution. Eliminating various search terms from the above search leaves less than a thousand that don't <i>explicitly</i> refer to the Emerson poem, with an unknown number of those remaining relevant to Mr Koshute. Since The Rhodora's only relationship with the band is in name, they aren't close enough to warrant a page merge as suggested.

<li><b>Delete</b> Fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. My username and even my non-notable real name has more Ghits than Dan Koshute.

</ul>
<p>Under what condition can I prove that Dan Koshute is currently notable? It's obvious to me based on the amount he's done. I really can't accept a place that would cut down something like this that has only potential for doing good. I won't be using wikipedia again. --AboveGroundSound 08:58, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The accepted way would be to provide outside sources that also assert his significance, such as a major newspaper or magazine. It's just the way we've done things for a long, long time - we are, of course, attempting to build the best encyclopedia we can. I'm sorry this has left you dissatisfied with Wikipedia, but we simply can't accept material indiscriminately. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandyWang_b828.html" title="User:RandyWang">RandyWang</a> (<sup><a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandyWang_f768.html" title="User talk:RandyWang"><b>raves</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RandyWang_7371.html" title="Special:Contributions/RandyWang"><b>rants</b></a></sub>) 09:03, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, read the criteria at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, if it does not pass any of them then the article will be deleted. Don't take it personally, there's just a certain standard required in order for a band to have an article in Wikipedia. For example, take a look at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Shadows_of_Tomorrow_ed61.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shadows of Tomorrow">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Shadows_of_Tomorrow</a>. Shadows Of Tomorrow seem to be much more notable than Dan Koshute, but they will be deleted anyways because they fail <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Joey_Eppard" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Joey_Eppard" rel="nofollow">Joey Eppard</a> is an example of an artist who just barely passes <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 09:17, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Sorry, AboveGround. I took a long hard look at this one, as I'm very interested in music pages myself and many of my interests lie with some of the more obscure acts. However, I have to agree that this chap isn't notable enough for inclusion on Wikipedia. I would therefore agree with all the others that this article should be deleted. However, it's not a badly written article and therefore I'd encourage you not to give up as an editor, as you could make some very valuable contributions in the future. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaise_Joshua_a0a6.html" title="User:Blaise Joshua">Blaise Joshua</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlaise_Joshua_9a46.html" title="User talk:Blaise Joshua">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blaise_Joshua_0525.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blaise Joshua">contribs</a>) 02:06, 15 July 2006.</small></li>
