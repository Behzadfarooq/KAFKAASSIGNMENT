<p>Mentioning a rivalry on a high school's page is fine. But having an entire page devoted to it is another thing. If we had a page on every high school rivalry in the US, we'd be overloaded with pages. Need to just have notable ones and I don't think this is notable. <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">Woohoo!</a></sup> 05:58, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This rivalry is notable to the entire San Francisco Bay Area which has millions of people in it and notable rivalries have millions of people knowing about it too. Why can't this article get it or other high school articles get it? And isn't the point of Wikipedia to create an informative online encyclopedia based on created topics that might not be easy to find online? Wikpedia English has over 1.5 million articles now. Their are probably only about 100,000 high school rivalries in the US. Would it make a difference at all to have 100,000 more articles. That's just a fraction compared to the whole Wikipedia English website. Every rivalry also has a deep history to people and is a tradtion and Wikipedia doesn't discourage users to not write about a local tradition. This article should be able to stay on Wikipedia and all articles that have the same rivalry topic should stay on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../g/n/d/User%7EGndawydiak_9bad.html" title="User:Gndawydiak">Gndawydiak</a> 06:21, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Your first sentence basically states the problem. It is known locally and that is all. It would be like having separate articles on every principal of every high school or every superintendent of every district. There has to be a limit somewhere. We already allow any high school to have a page. I just don't see the point in going beyond that and including non-notable rivalries such as this one. What's the problem with just including the information in the pages themselves?</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Actually I'd say "known locally only to people who follow local HS sports", because I'm local and I've never even heard of the schools, much less the rivalry. If we kept this sort of thing, it would grow exponentially - in my HS football division alone there were 11 teams and 5 long-standing rivalries. Anyone remember Bell-Trinity? Didn't think so. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamoche_0708.html" title="User:Jamoche">Jamoche</a> 19:44, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - In the Bay Area there is millions of people and that makes it very notable and there's records of it on newspapers and websites <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/10/SPGPUNG5461.DTL&amp;hw=Bruce+Mahoney&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/10/SPGPUNG5461.DTL&amp;hw=Bruce+Mahoney&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Writing about every principal and superintendent for every school and district is different. Rivalries people care and listen about it and high school rivalries shouldn't be limited. It shows the rich history of their culture and city or town and shouldn't be discouraged from creating their own article on it and shouldn't just be limited a section on the school's article where it can't flourish like an article. Their are hundreds of thousands of alumni of these school's that would feel the same way as I do and probably the general public of the Bay Area and Northern California would feel the same way. --<a href="../../../g/n/d/User%7EGndawydiak_9bad.html" title="User:Gndawydiak">Gndawydiak</a> 07:03, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> To begin with, an article of this nature is going to be a magnet for original research; this particular article has no citations. Secondly, rivalries of this nature, especially at the high school level, are simply not notable. The fact that the rivalry concerns schools in a big city makes no difference, it may be somewhat notable locally but notability needs to extend outside of the locale where the rivalry exists. Almost all high schools are going to have these 'rivalries' and many high schools are going to have multiple rivalries and most of the time these rivalries are going to be rather subjective as rivalries of this sort are, quite frankly, rather arbitrary constructs. I doubt, though am unsure, that there are articles on rivalries between major national teams or college teams, either, and for good reason. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 00:10, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well this one is mentioned in newspapers and is well known even though its a high school sport. In the Bay Area, high school sports between different high schools are a big thing here. People go these games and come from very far away and is mentioned across the area. If somebody wanted to, they would make a documentary about this rivalry and mention it to the country.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I researched the deletion policy and this article is against the policy in all ways possible so this is an unneeded deletion and is taken to a level that was not needed. You could of just put a clean up tag on it or something like that at a lower level but this is un-needed. I take this deletion as really offensive and if this article is deleted, I'll bring it back no matter what anyone says and I'll fight for it. All users that want this article deleted don't understand any of this and are just following a corrupt user that takes everything at a big level when it's something small. And I don't care if this hurts my future nomination for administrator because I'd rather fight for these articles as a user.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I just looked over what you should look over before nominating an article for deletion. I says that some articles start out bad if they were just created. This article got a deletion notice five minutes after getting it created. This article needs to have a clean up instead of a deletion because as I stated before, the "attacking" user gave this article no chance and is letting it drown in the water with no mercy at all. This user took it to an un-needed level and any administrator who believes in me should remove the deletion and put a clean up tag instead.

However, while you're up for some newspaper reading, I hope you find time for some of this material, too: 1) <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> 2) <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> 3) <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Ok I'm going to shut up after this comment because I'm tired of dealing with these users. What I want to say before I stop is that this article shouldn't be on for deletion just after 5 minutes of its creation. Woohookitty went and over reacted and nominated it for deletion instead of following the Before nominating an AfD and reading that you should consider putting a clean-up tag instead. If he/she put that up, the article probably would of changed over a while making the article better than it is. Now this article is going to be deleted because of an over-reaction of an administrator that didn't look over the deletion policy. This article is notable to millions of people and can be supported by countless articles about this in newspapers. This article can't be merged with <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce-Mahoney_Trophy_9841.html" title="Bruce-Mahoney Trophy">Bruce-Mahoney Trophy</a> because these articles are different things but have some similarites but are different topics. I am sorry for my behavior for this debate but I over-react when somebody does something personal to me and I felt like I have to fight for this because this administrator didn't give this article a chance. Again, I am sorry for my behavior and you may accept this apology or not. If this article is reviewed by anyone else, look at the things that matter about the article and not my behavior or behavior of others. Look at this things that matter for this article. --<a href="../../../g/n/d/User%7EGndawydiak_9bad.html" title="User:Gndawydiak">Gndawydiak</a> 18:42, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Gndawydiak, the process can be frustrating. When I first began with WP, an article could begin as a seed and grow with time. However, the huge volume of junk that is submitted each day has forced WP into a defensive posture to battle the junk and spam. As volunteers we have to be efficient in nipping the junk in the bud ASAP. Now I develop my articles off-line and cut &amp; paste something substantial enough to avoid the deletion process. This is respectful of the efforts by dilligent volunteers who are looking out for our mutual interest in having a credible WP. It is the spammers etc. at whom you should direct your anger. Good Luck. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 19:10, 21 January 2007 (UTC) Bay Area resident and Stuart Hall Alum</dd>
