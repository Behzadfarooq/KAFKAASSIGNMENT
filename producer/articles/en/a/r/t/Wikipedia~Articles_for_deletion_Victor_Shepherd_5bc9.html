<dd>Ummm, I didn't say that page was policy, I merely note that it's a deletion sorting list, which allows one to view all the AfD's for educators and academics together in one place.

<dd>Regardless, your statement is misleading. The fact is that there is only one recognized Prof standard and that is the one at BIO. WP is getting overburdened by rule-mongering, and micro-lawyering. BIO is relatively simple and comprehensive.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Passes professor test absolutely and seems to make it as an author as well. He only needs to pass one test to be deemed notable.

<dd><b>Comment</b> To establish notability you need multiple reviews, the article supplies only one and that one source is rather non-notable itself. Also, there is no independent biography; I believe the biography you consider to be independent is a biography on a Writer's Union website, in other words that biography is likely to have been submitted by Victor himself since he is a member of that union. This is supported by the fact that that biography gives Victor's email address for responses... --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 01:39, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>You're right and wrong (a) he doesn't have to pass all tests; the multiple reviews is just one test. The Professor Test has different criteria (b) from what you say the Writer's Union website may not be an independent source. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 08:02, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>comment</b> Academic works in theology are not expected to be best sellers and should not be judged by the Amazon rank. Popular ones, yes, but thats not what he has been writing. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:06, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> according to <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>, if the subject has been given an award or honor they meet one of the 6 criteria for inclusion. Dr. Shepherd has an honorary doctorate given to him for his work. A note in <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> says that a professorship at a prestigious institution is enough to grant inclusion. Unfortunately <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> is not specific and does not mention honorary doctorates. Although his <a href="http://www.victorshepherd.on.ca/other%20writings/about1.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.victorshepherd.on.ca/other%20writings/about1.htm" rel="nofollow">CV</a> does list a bunch of awards. According to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> one criteria for inclusion is "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work." 2 awards of possible note would be: "Award of Excellence for Outstanding Contribution in the Fields of Historical-Systematic Theology and Preaching, Center for Mentorship and Theological Reflection, 2004" and "Scholarship Excellence Award, Tyndale University College &amp; Seminary, 2006". So it seems he meets both <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> primarily due to his awards. --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuirex_283a.html" title="User:Quirex">Quirex</a> 07:53, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not sure if I'm allowed to comment since I created the original entry, but the comments regarding Amazon sales rankings are not a fair comparison given that (1) the Dr. Shepherd is Canadian and (2) the books are Christian in content which would mean they would usually be sold through the CBA market rather than secular channels. Dr. Shepherd teaches theology at the largest evangelical university/seminary in this country -- does this not count for something?Robclem 04:38, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> since I see I didnt actually express an opinion. This time there are external articles, just as for non professors. There is nothing special about professors that isn't implied by the general N policy. "another prof" and may we have many thousand more--all N--just like major league athletes. (""Sportspeople/athletes who have played in a fully professional league, "--WP:N)--there a a few thousand of them also. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:28, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I have improved this article to demonstrate notability, and would like to point out that the media coverage on <a href="http://www.victorshepherd.on.ca/UCC%20Critique/Bermuda%20Trial/media.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.victorshepherd.on.ca/UCC%20Critique/Bermuda%20Trial/media.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> should be accepted as factual, because this man is very respected, holding positions at the most reputable divinity institutions of the world, and these publications are either not online, or only recently online and their archives dont go back this far.

<li><b>Note</b>. A search on Wikipedia for "Victor Shepherd" brought up four articles, which I have now linked to the article. (see <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Victor_Shepherd_e4bb.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Victor Shepherd">Special:Whatlinkshere/Victor_Shepherd</a>) Three of those were using Victor's biography of the subject as a reference: <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menno_Simons_d02e.html" title="Menno Simons">Menno Simons</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Torrance_6a0a.html" title="Thomas Torrance">Thomas Torrance</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Coke_%28bishop%29_10b1.html" title="Thomas Coke (bishop)">Thomas Coke (bishop)</a>. These were all published in his book "<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_Witnesses_to_the_Word_776c.html" title="User:Jayvdb/Witnesses to the Word">Witnesses to the Word</a>". The book isnt terribly notable in its own right, but it covers a lot of notable people, so I expect it will be useful to fill in missing articles. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 03:19, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
