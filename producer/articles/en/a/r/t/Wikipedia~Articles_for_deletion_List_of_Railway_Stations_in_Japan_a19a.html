<p>Also, there are 21 related sub-pages listed in this Afd entry. Rather than clutter the main Afd page with more entries, I think it is ok to list them like that because there is no reason to delete only a portion of these pages. They all form a miniature ecosystem which nothing seems to be using or updating. If they need to be busted out and listed one at a time on the Afd page, then I can do that. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 01:24, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This entire complex was apparently the personal project of <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottKuberski_8641.html" title="User:ScottKuberski">ScottKuberski</a>, who has been inactive since July 11, 2004 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/ScottKuberski" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/ScottKuberski" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>).

<li><b>Keep</b>. I thought it was established that lists and categories are both allowed for a given area. <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_railway_stations_3a39.html" title="UK railway stations">UK railway stations</a> and Category:British railway stations both exist so these articles have a right to exist. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 08:12, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason this is being listed for deletion is because it's 1) in a non-English order and 2) is a personal project of an inactive Wikipedian. It isn't so much a matter of whether the category deserves a list or not, but a matter how poorly that list is written. If/When this is deleted, I'm sure it will be fine to completely redo the lists in a format that makes sense, if anyone it up to it. -<a href="../../../n/a/m/User%7ENameneko_fd06.html" title="User:Nameneko">Nameneko</a> 18:58, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Can we move this whole complex to the Wikipedia namespace somewhere to keep the structure, links etc.? Although some have few or no entries, some have lots. It would be useful to have a list of names of stations (red links) for expansion. But it does little good as an article as it is (with nobody working on it). <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 08:16, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are two lists of the 21 which may be nearly complete: SA and A. I think those two lists of station names <i>is</i> a nice resource, so moving them to another place for safekeeping is a good idea. But even then, I wouldn't want to consider them to be canonical (I haven't checked -- it seems pretty thorough, but that just means that the gaps will be harder to spot). I've started an unofficial project to build a set of templates for each railway line, similar to the prefecture or state templates (the templates list each station on a specific line, similar to listing each city of a state, etc). <a href="../../../t/e/m/Category%7ETemplates_for_Railway_Lines_of_Japan_40b2.html" title="Category:Templates for Railway Lines of Japan">Category:Templates_for_Railway_Lines_of_Japan</a> As that moves forward, then that may be another place to collect red links, and in a localized manner at that. It is still in its infancy, but help in filling in other lines is definitely welcome.<a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 02:57, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I took the Japanese lists from <a href="../../../../ja/%E6%97%A5/%E6%9C%AC/%E3%81%AE/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E3%81%AE%E9%89%84%E9%81%93%E9%A7%85%E4%B8%80%E8%A6%A7.html" class="extiw" title="ja:日本の鉄道駅一覧">ja:日本の鉄道駅一覧</a> and played a bunch of perl games with them. The net result is that I have a list of romaji names for the ~9000 stations, along with (PREFECTURE) on most of the ones which need them. Until this current mess is cleaned up, I've stuck them in my <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_Sandbox_TrainList_8911.html" title="User:Neier/Sandbox/TrainList">User:Neier/Sandbox/TrainList</a>. There is still some work to be done with the names on the list, such as bad romaji, and also several disambiguations that we need that the Japanese site didn't (like <a href="../../../i/z/u/Izumi-Chuo_Station_8e65.html" title="Izumi-Chuo Station">Izumi-Chuo Station</a>) because the kanji is different, but the romaji is the same. Once there is a clean slate, I'll move the sandbox into a List of xyz structure (after wikifying the romaji names, red-links and all). Feel free to fix things in the sandbox until then. - <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 12:53, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - ample precedent for lists that are redundant with categories. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 21:07, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nameneko's quite right--the reduncancy with the category is <i>not</i> the issue. The issue is that ScottKuberski only finished the list for A, and nobody's going to finish the rest because the people who care would prefer to organize such a list geographically rather than by Japanese spelling, as it is organized here. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 02:34, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Right. I suppose the "category is better" at the end of my afd entry is ill-placed.<a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 02:57, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Incomplete (actually barely started) list, abandoned and unmaintained. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 08:11, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, but without prejudice for another list with a different structure. Lists of stations are valid if they present the information differently from what a category would. The problem as I see it is that <i>this</i> list tries to list the stations in <i>alphabetical</i> order, and without any descriptions on the page, it is very redundant with the category. A list which ordered the stations according to railway line or by geographical location (district/region/whatever) however, would be valid. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:47, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
