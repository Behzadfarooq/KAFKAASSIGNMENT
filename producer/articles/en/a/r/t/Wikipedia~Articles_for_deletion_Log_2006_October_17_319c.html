<li><b>A Must Keep</b> - The Kamehameha wave has become a universal icon and inspiration to the world of modern art and animation. As Western culture and practices become ever more influenced by methods and aesthetics of the East, the significance of the Kamehamehe wave is increasingly noticeable. I find that most arguments made against the inclusion of this definition stem from a disdain for "fans" or people who possess a zealous interest in the particulars of artistic expression (particularly television programs). Ultimately, this article is completely valid and factual in that it accurately represents a term employed in the program referenced, therefore such definitions are factually based, and factually based information, however trivial some may feel it to be, is indeed knowledge. Those who seek its removal seek, simultaneously, to limit the scope of Wikipedia's ability to inform. They seek to cut short knowledge. It is not for us to deem what is or is not "good" or "relevant" or "trivial" information. All information is of worth. And those who seek to remove any information, are guilty of crimes against knowledge.

To quote one of the users in that discussion: "Let me see if I can, I was reading this and then had a look at the page. What does the one page attacks page consist of? Well when you break it down, it's a list of the different ways one character can punch another in the face [note: in this case, it would be "blast someone in the face"]. Using this logic, we should create a page for DC universe offensive use of superpowers - Superman has quite a few and using them in combination he can work up more than 5 "attacks". Once we have done this, we can move onto the same for the Marvel Universe etc. When you consider that minor characters should not have their own articles unless there is good reason.... attacks?" This is even worse than the linked page, since several attacks in this show are very similar.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>- The Kamehameha is a very important element in Dragon Ball and has enough information to keep it's own article. The attack list doesn't do any harm, and it helps readers understand more about what they're reading by giving a picture and description of each attack. I'd say these articles are pretty important, and this request is pretty rash. I also think it's interesting how your account is only 2 says old, and you have 7 edits (6 of which are creating this page and nominating said pages for deletion).--<a href="../../../k/o/j/User%7EKojiDude_79b7.html" title="User:KojiDude"><font color="blue">Koji</font></a><a href="../../../k/o/j/User_talk%7EKojiDude_b028.html" title="User talk:KojiDude"><font color="darkblue">Dude</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KojiDude_f1ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/KojiDude"><sup><font color="lightblue">(Contributions)</font></sup></a> 19:09, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>- It's possible that they are fancruft, but that alone doesn't warrant deletion (please read <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a>). These articles are well written and cited. They should stay. I find Koji's point regarding your account interesting as well. CPitt76 23:08, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, you see, it seems Hydromasta doesn't like attack lists and thinks they don't belong on Wikipedia (apparently, so do many other people, as seen in the articles for deletion linked), and is using the deletion of the One Piece attack list to delete the others. <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigmasonic_X_df4d.html" title="User:Sigmasonic X">Sigmasonic X</a> 23:24, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I read it. It's the same boring set of arguments that were posed in the articles for deletion review of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_injuries%2C_accidents%2C_and_mishaps_on_MythBusters_c575.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of injuries, accidents, and mishaps on MythBusters">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of injuries, accidents, and mishaps on MythBusters</a>. The designation of "cruft" hinges on it being UNIMPORTANT to the topic in general. This one doesn't fit that because of the nature of the show. The anime has the various special attacks and such things as the way of determining combat. Thus having a list of them is almost as important as having a list of races or characters.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarhawkman_ce32.html" title="User:Marhawkman">Marhawkman</a> 03:02, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - In general, it seems that most of the ability stuff is better confined to the characters who use it. Centralized information in the character articles is far more useful. Also, over 40 "fair use" images in an article is most certainly pushing it... <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 05:06, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Why is a user coming onto Wikipedia to nominate articles for deletion and spam talk pages with advertisements about this discussion?

<li><b>comment</b> It exists because this sort of thing was an important aspect of the anime.

<li>All right. Let me rephrase that. My vote is <b>delete</b>, because there is NO REASON whatsoever that this article needs to exist on its own. The information (such as it is) in this article could easily be trimmed and merged right back into the individual character articles. (How hard is it to mention something like "Vegeta's 'Big Bang attack' creates a large sphere of ki which is then launched at the opponent, leaving a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mushroom_cloud.html" title="Mushroom cloud">mushroom cloud</a> in its wake" in the main <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegeta.html" title="Vegeta">Vegeta</a> article?) So. This article serves no purpose that could not be served elsewhere, thus delete. <font color="#000000">♠<a href="../../../p/m/c/User%7EPMC_03a4.html" title="User:PMC">P</a></font><a href="../../../p/m/c/User_talk%7EPMC_cf58.html" title="User talk:PMC"><font color="#FF00FF">M</font></a><font color="#000000"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Premeditated_Chaos_3dcc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Premeditated Chaos">C</a>♠</font> 22:41, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I've seen pages like this before, I don't think this is fancruff at all. I think this is a good attempt at handling attacks that most other major manga and anime attack pages fail to do and it DOES contain useful infomation. Now I'm not a fan of the show (in fact I can't stand it!), normally I would oppose everything to do with DB because I'm somewhat baised, however this page is okay in my books. It may not get read very often (but there are other wikipedia pages that don't get very often too that are far less informatitive) because of what its about... But it is useful. I don't see a problem with this article.
<p>Plus a lot of this page is just common knowledge amongst the DB, DBZ and DBGT media. If you delete this, this might make the DBA wikipedia pages incomplete somewhat. I agree there is still room for improvments, for instance there are far too many pictures for moves as some of them cannot be summed up in one picture. As someone pointed , many of these moves are simulair.</p>
<p>And... Even Superman has his own attacks page so to speak.<a href="../../../p/o/w/Powers_and_abilities_of_Superman_724f.html" title="Powers and abilities of Superman">Powers and abilities of Superman</a>, although its more abilities then attack (just listing what he is capable of doing). Perhaps if this was more written towards like how this article is, would you allow it? I say, if this page is delete worthy at least let everyone working on it at least give everyone a chance to rethink it. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 07:49, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Ah, the flawed and ill-founded "It's just like <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powers_and_abilities_of_Superman_724f.html" title="Powers and abilities of Superman">Powers and abilities of Superman</a>." argument again! <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powers_and_abilities_of_Superman_724f.html" title="Powers and abilities of Superman">Powers and abilities of Superman</a> is a <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a> breakout sub-article of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html#Powers_and_abilities" title="Superman">Superman#Powers_and_abilities</a>. To justify similar breakout articles for one particular facet of Dragon Ball characters on the same grounds, you would have to show that they, like <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> had individual articles on the individual characters that were so crowded that one had to break out the special abilities section, summary style, from the main article on the character. Looking at <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegeta.html#Techniques_and_special_abilities" title="Vegeta">Vegeta#Techniques_and_special_abilities</a>, that's clearly not the case. Indeed, the information on the attacks in the character article is <i>longer</i> than the information on the attacks in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dragon_Ball_special_abilities_c3fe.html" title="List of Dragon Ball special abilities">List of Dragon Ball special abilities</a>. This is clearly nowhere near being summary style.

<li>And for the love of God, <i><b>STOP USING THE "IT'S USEFUL" ARGUMENT</b></i>. Game guides are useful. Weather reports are useful. How-to guides are useful. Phone directories are useful. They still do not belong in Wikipedia. <i><b>BEING USEFUL IS NOT ENOUGH TO WARRANT AN ARTICLE.</b></i> <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterrobamf_9382.html" title="User:Interrobamf">Interrobamf</a> 09:16, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete all</b> per nom. Even the Kamehameha, while perhaps an important concept in the series, does not need this much detail - the entire article could be boiled down into a single paragraph. Quite simply, this is an encyclopedia not a fan-wiki, and as such it is quite adequate to describe a character's <i>most important</i> abilities <i>in that character's article</i>, and only break them out if (like Superman) those characters and abilities are so culturally relevant that it is important to discuss them in more detail than there's room for in a single article.<br />
Note that this clearly doesn't apply to these abilities, because even references to Dragonball in other series tend to refer only to very general concepts like "powering up", not to specific attacks.<br />
As for the people above <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">biting the nominator</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming bad faith</a>, you should be ashamed of yourselves. Note that it is necessary to create an account before one can nominate an article for deletion these days. It is quite plausible that the nominator is a long-term contributor who has not previously had any reason to create an account. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 09:13, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would hardly classify the statements as biting any newcomer. Newcomers do not come straight onto Wikipedia to propose deletions, spam user talk pages, and generally try to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">make a point</a>.

<li>comment To delete or not seems to hinge on one thing: Is it encyclopedic? If you're going to do an encyclopedia article about DragonBall Z, then you're going to need to explain the various techniques and skills performed during the course of the show. Whether or not this takes the form of an itemized list is determined entirely by how detailed you make the article. IMO this article IS detailed enough to warrant a seperate list. As for "justification" I'd like to point out that there's only ONE article for all of the Dragonball characters.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarhawkman_ce32.html" title="User:Marhawkman">Marhawkman</a> 09:56, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>No. You don't have to explain the mass amount of "attacks" "He blasts him away with ki energy." "He blinds him with a ki skill." It's rather easy to explain without resorting to pointless names that only confuse the lay reader. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterrobamf_9382.html" title="User:Interrobamf">Interrobamf</a> 10:01, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually I find it to be the opposite. That sort of explanation is suited to a plot summary. However it's not well suited to an encyclopedic article. Besides, the names aren't pointless. Most of them are mentioned in the anime/manga as the name of the technique when it is shown being used.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarhawkman_ce32.html" title="User:Marhawkman">Marhawkman</a> 10:09, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hilarious how you refer to an "encyclopedic article", as a list of fictional attacks in a cartoon that's treated as if they were real isn't anywhere close to encyclopedic. I still fail to see how "Goku uses an Kalakamakma on Biggu Heado" is more encyclopedic than "Goku fires a blast of ki energy at Biggu Heado". <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterrobamf_9382.html" title="User:Interrobamf">Interrobamf</a> 10:19, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep it as well as the rest</b>: Why the heck is this page being nominated for deletion and on the basis that the One Piece Attacks got deleted? The Dragonball pages are more professional looking than what was deleted plus these moves are more notable than the One Piece ones. Do not delete them because they are integral. They exist because they are part of this types of character. The way a fictional anime and manga character hits someone with a named attack can explain alot of the character. They explain what a character can do and can't do. They explains how far they are willing to go. They explain the character's creativity based on how they deliver the attack. They explain alot of the characters that words alone cannot summarized. You can't explain that in a summary like what the Superman page. The only way to convey that message is to list the attacks in some sort of manner. This is not cruft. In fact as quoted by the admin who deleted the One Piece article "One man's "cruft" is another man's priceless tidbit on information, and regardless of anything else it's incredibly rude to the individuals who have volounteered their time creating the article to use a belitteling and pejorative term." In other words what is useless to one person is useful for another person. This page is worthless to somebody who doesn't like or even knows the show but it is useful to those who do. The One Piece Attacks deletion was a great lost to alot to the people who edited it. It made alot of people sad and angry. Did anyone think about those people who gave alot of sweat and blood for that page. Did anyone think of the long hours and research they tireless did. If you delete this page and others like them based on what really should be in a proper looking and real encyclopedia rather than a free source of information then you are alienating an entire community from wikipedia. You are alienating them all. You are alienting both editors and clients. I am saying all these because I was spammed by one for my opinion who's first post in Wikipedia was in the One Piece attack AFD discussion namely the guy who brought up these entire discussion. I am going a bit uncivil here and risking being blocked if not banned from Wikipedia but it is well worth it.

<li><b>Comment</b> The Dragon Ball Character articles are already massive as it is; now you want us to copy all these attacks and ect. into them? The list is a conveinient and informative article. It isn't "fancruft" at all. It's just ifnormation about attacks used in the show. How are we supossed to write the Dragon Ball articles and expect somone who's never seen the show to understand it? I've seen that in every peer review, Rey Brujo mentions that the article needs to be understandable to somone who hasn't seen the show. That's what this article is. I really don't see what part of this article warrants deletion, and every DB article links to it.--<a href="../../../k/o/j/User%7EKojiDude_79b7.html" title="User:KojiDude"><font color="blue">Koji</font></a><a href="../../../k/o/j/User_talk%7EKojiDude_b028.html" title="User talk:KojiDude"><font color="darkblue">Dude</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KojiDude_f1ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/KojiDude"><sup><font color="lightblue">(Contributions)</font></sup></a> 12:51, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I really don't see how these are all that different from the One Piece Attacks page, they have all the same positive and negative aspects. Reading the closing admin's reasoning on that deletion debate, it seems the main reason the One Piece Attacks were deleted was a complete and total lack of cited <i>sources</i> external to the thing itself. This is a valid concern, and one I brought up in my keep "vote" there. This AFD bundles the attack list with 3 pages on individual attacks. The main attack list is a <i>little</i> better sourced than the One Piece one (but not much), but the other 3 have no sources cited at all. Any keep argument I can come up with would be essentially the same as the ones I made there; however I definately do see the vital importance of sources to Wikipedia's credibility. A lot of people would make an exception for fiction, but I'm not convinced that fiction should be an exception to the reliable sources rule. I do believe, however, that a lack of cited sources is a clean-up concern and <i>not a reason for deletion</i>. However, in instances where sources can never reasonably be expected to be found deletion may be an option. The difference between the main list here and the One Piece attacks list is that this one <i>does</i> cite 2 sources, whatever you may think of the quality of those sources. Therefore, by that reasoning it should be kept. The other three articles however, do not cite any sources (though I imagine they would be the same as the main article), and therefore should be <b>merged</b> into the main list and deleted (or sourced appropriately, including a source for the contention that they are more important then the other special abilities and deserve their own article). Hence, the weak keep. ~ <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</small> 14:37, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So, if I watch a movie or a television show, and I note that a given star was in it, playing a given character, that is original research? Sorry, but no, that is not OR. Now concluding that a given star is making a comeback, or has hit rock-bottom, that would be. However, you don't seem to realize that I am talking about books and other media that are the ones who have done the observation of the Dragonball series, and as such, this content is clealry derived from that, so your first objection does not apply. To your second, well, I don't think it is a prime example of that, as this is all relevant information to the Dragonball series, which is itself a notable anime. If you think it's indiscriminate, please try to convince me without referring blindly to policies. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:22, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, there are clearly verifiable facts in these articles. However, without a single source in any of the articles and just 2 external links to sites which may not be <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>, nothing is actually <i>verified</i>. I'd strongly suspect that a fair chunk of this is indeed OR and so unverifiable, if there are verifiable facts here - give a source so they can be verified. I feel it is indiscriminate in that it lists every attack, no matter how minor, the Kamehameha is important to Dragonball but can you really say that of the Gekiretsu Kōdan? My view is the stuff which should be said on these attacks would be best served in the other DB articles.--<a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENilfanion_64a5.html" title="User:Nilfanion">Nilfanion</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/l/User_talk%7ENilfanion_2aa8.html" title="User talk:Nilfanion">talk</a>) 22:17, 11 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The Gekiretsu Kodan doesn't have its own article. If you want to remove it from the collated one, I suggest you take it to that article's talk page. But since it is apparently used in some video games, presumably by name, perhaps someone with access to them, and their manuals can provide useful sources. I can't do it, as I'm not knowledgeable enough of Dragonball or Japanese to do it, I don't own any of the games, even the card game. Can others? Maybe. But an AfD like this one is unlikely to make it happen. Especially not when you mindlessly focus on one minor entry. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:51, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete all.</b> First and foremost, very little of this is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified or verifiable</a>, particularly the list. All of it is sourced to direct observation of the show itself, and Wikipedia isn't here to provide watchers' guides for longrunning anime series.<br />
<br />
Additionally, it's indiscriminate. The word "indiscriminate" gets thrown around a lot, but what it means is that Wikipedia summarizes subjects, instead of listing every single exhaustive detail. It would be perfectly reasonable to mention that attacks are frequently named in the articles on the various DB anime and manga, and it would be perfectly reasonable to name some of the most prominent attacks, even describing them as the signature attacks of certain characters. This is discriminate. Indiscriminate is a list so exhaustive that it lists <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dragon_Ball_special_abilities_c3fe.html#Gekiretsu_K.C5.8Ddan" title="List of Dragon Ball special abilities">Gekiretsu Kōdan</a>, an attack that is never once used in either manga or anime.<br />
<br />
There are additional, aggravating factors. These articles are laden with fair-use images, illustrating every single attack however minor, even if that attack can amply be described with prose. These articles are often highly speculative, due to the lack of reliable sources. Romanizations are unattributed; I'm fairly sure that a number of these Romanizations are controversial among fans. The lot of these articles are written from an in-universe style, which is <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">inappropriate</a>. Even if these lesser issues were resolved, however, the fact remains that there's no verification and no discrimination, and that's just not the sort of thing that can be included in or allowed in this project.<br />

<li><b>Comment</b> The verifiability of the article is problematic because of the nature of the subject. Independant agencies aren't gonna write about this. It's going to be either fans or the people who made it. In this case that leaves us with two primary sources. The Anime and the Manga.(the primary sources for ALL of the Dragonball Z pages) But while this, arguably, may not fullfill the letter of the verifiability policy, it IS verifiable by anyone who watches the source material. We do have the various videogames made from the series though.

<li>If we can't verify it, we shouldn't be covering it.

<li>But there isn't an article on Gekiretsu Kōdan, it is merely a component of a larger article.

<li>Oh, I understand how they're important to the show.

<ul>
<li>Depends on the context. For DB as a whole, we could easily say, "Attacks in Dragon Ball are flashy, fantastic, and often pyrotechnic. Characters throw punches in flurries too fast for the eye to see, hurl massive balls of shining ki energy, and often shake the landscape or even split planets in the course of a battle." If we wanted to describe one character's style, we'd do that. They're not all alike, but they're all examples of a single, largely unified art style, and the vast, vast majority are different forms of ki or energy blasts, and the ones that aren't aren't attacks at all and would probably be described individually (flight, fusion, transformation) or are different ways of hitting people (which can easily be summarized). - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 22:11, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>There's a difference between a common-knowledge claim, trivially simple to source but unsourced as it isn't in dispute and excessive citation would clutter the article, and a claim made only on Wikipedia, attested to nobody. "Grass is green" is so widely verified that it isn't necessary to specifically attest it but attesting it would be trivially easy; these lists are of such narrow appeal that attesting their claims is nearly impossible.

<li>As you say, it is going overboard to insist on "independent" sources, whatever the real definition of that is. Reliable sources in the context of this article are going to be on the fan sites, where if something is said that is wrong, someone will pick up on it in a Peer Review fashion, which gives legitimacy to the site overall. Kind of like the peer review system here, except they are much more devoted to single topics on those sites (hence improving in accuracy value). <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 00:10, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dude, will you stop saying they don't have sources? They <i><b>DO</b></i>. They have about 3 million. What the fuck is your problem man? Sources which aren't the subject themselves aren't needed. How is an Anime not notable? Are you fukcing high or something? Saying there aren't sources is just plain biased. You want an independent source, fine, look at the millions of fan sites and merchandise. There's no way in hell for you to back up your argument of it being un-sourced, unless, of course, you expect everyone to just assume you're right scicne your an administrator. Two things I've noticed about this AfD is that it was made in Bad Faith by a possible sock puppet, and nobody really has any solid arguments against the articles. I'm pretty sure that warrants closing, unless you wanna use your godly administrator powers to change the policy on closing an AfD so you won't lose the argument.--<a href="../../../k/o/j/User%7EKojiDude_79b7.html" title="User:KojiDude"><font color="blue">Koji</font></a><a href="../../../k/o/j/User_talk%7EKojiDude_b028.html" title="User talk:KojiDude"><font color="darkblue">Dude</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KojiDude_f1ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/KojiDude"><sup><font color="lightblue">(Contributions)</font></sup></a> 01:33, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, okay, I get it, the 279 episode Anime is just my personal opinion. These articles should <i>definitly</i> be deleted, seeing as how having about 3 million sources isn't enough for any article. Let's see, how many artciles on Wikipedia have less than that? You better get started. Oh, by the way, this is directly from the admin guide for deletion: "<i>Administrators necessarily must use their best judgment, attempting to be as impartial as is possible for a fallible human, to determine when rough consensus has been reached. For example, administrators can disregard opinions and comments if they feel that there is strong evidence that they were not made in good faith. Such "bad faith" opinions include those being made by sock puppets, being made anonymously, or being made using a new userid whose only edits are to the article in question and the voting on that article.</i>" Seing as how this whole thing was started in bad faith, your job as an administrator would be to close it, not to repeatedly say that it isn't notable, when it obviousley is. Also: <b>pay attention to what I write</b>. Just because I'm used to using vulgar languege doesn't mean my opinion doesn't matter.--<a href="../../../k/o/j/User%7EKojiDude_79b7.html" title="User:KojiDude"><font color="blue">Koji</font></a><a href="../../../k/o/j/User_talk%7EKojiDude_b028.html" title="User talk:KojiDude"><font color="darkblue">Dude</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KojiDude_f1ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/KojiDude"><sup><font color="lightblue">(Contributions)</font></sup></a> 01:45, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You've mistaken "people interested in the subject" and "structural divisions of the subject" for "reliable sources independent of the subject". You've argued that there are a lot of DB fans and that there are a lot of DB episodes. That's nice, but <i>the fact that DB is important does not necessarily mean that every single detail of DB is sufficient material for its own Wikipedia article</i>. Given the lack of sources other than direct observation, the indiscriminate nature of these articles, the fact that these attacks can reasonablybe summarized in broader articles, and the legion of style problems with these articles, I think there's ample evidence that we don't need such overspecific articles.</dd>
<dd>Now, as for being an admin, I'm here expressing my opinion as an editor, rather than closing the AFD debate (which I wouldn't do, as I've participated in the debate and additionally have a strong personal opinion). The fact that I am an administrator is only relevant insofar as it's good evidence that I'm a user in good standing, as opposed to the nominator, who is apparently a brand-new user. I never meant to imply that my arguments carried any extra weight because I'm an administrator, merely that even if this was a bad faith nom made by a new user with a grudge (the worst possible situation) that the nom had a point and such-and-such reasons were why. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 01:56, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The attacks are probobly the second most important part of the show. The entire series focuses around them, so having articles describing them in detail and they're origin/history is notable, encyclopedic, helpful to the readers, and interesting.</dd>

<dd>I could assert that the color orange is the most important part of the show, and then write Orange (Dragon Ball) about every appearance of the color orange. No interpretation, of course, just a list of every single orange thing in Dragon Ball. (It'd be a lot; orange is one of Toriyama's favored contrast colors.) The hedge against me doing so is the fact that we rely on (sounding like a broken record here) <i>coverage in reliable sources independent of the subject</i>. These lists have the same problem that Orange (Dragon Ball) would, and the argument that the attacks are important would apply, just as reasonably, to the color orange, because it's a claim made by a Wikipedia user with nothing whatsoever other than that Wikipedia user's say-so to support it. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 02:13, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> The preceding comment by Hoary is oh so important. Why oh why would the article have less value to fans if it were on a Dragon Ball wiki? Probably because it's not as well-known as Wikipedia and there's an extra sense of importance that comes with your favorite topic having an article in here. But there's no denying that this article is entirely unreferenced original research and none of the articles' supporters have seriously adressed that concern. Man in Black put it pretty well: it does not make sense to cover this in an encyclopedia when no other third-party source has ever bothered to. It's useful to the show's fans? Sure, so move it all to the useful dragonball wiki and let's get on with writing an encyclopedia here. I urge the closing admin to go beyond counting the votes here. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 14:00, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep and Merge</b> (if I can, following rules, otherwise <b>Comment</b>) I'd like to make you note that an encyclopedia should retain, at least, 'common' knowledge (or things commonly assumed to be known). A lot of "Dragon Ball"-related (as well as "&lt;other anime/manga/TV series&gt;"-related) topics <i>are</i> common knowledge for the young and not-so-young generations of <i>many</i> so-colled rich/industrialized/post-industrialization countries, nevertheless are <i>important</i> parts of their folklore-mythology, much much more than, e.g., ancient greek mythology (which is however naturally retained for historical reasons). Because of it, it's expected <i>at least</i> the presence of articles (or pieces of articles) regarding those most famous topics necessary to understand common cultural references (like Son Goku, other main characters, kamehameha and so on), but, as <i>every</i> good encyclopedia is expected to do, it <i>should</i> (and IMHO <i>must</i>) go into them a little more, exactly to tell the reader more about the things that gave birth to this widespread culture-folklore-mythology (simply what an encyclopedia is supposed to do). That said, I don't propose to retain a single article for every DB ability or such, but to list them correctly (e.g. per character) in the right place (like "List of Dragon Ball special abilities" was supposed to be) and use this page as the link for the other DB-related article citing that ability. I'm not writing that that article is perfect and sould retained as is or that all the 'abilities' should be written in it (IMHO only the most notable ones, but this is another discussion), I'm only writing it shouldn't be deleted. In my opinion, the deletion of similar articles is a sort of censorship of the 'olds' (OK, the world population is becoming older and older but there are younger people too) or cultural racism (something like "every single detail of the ancient greek mythology is acceptable for an encyclopedia because it's 'highly' cultural or 'ancient', but everything relating contemporary mythology is to discard as it isn't culture at all"). To sum it up: there are too specific articles to be merged into bigger ones (like ability-specific articles not culturally widespread, but a kamehameha article to me is perfectly just), there are things to change in these big articles and probably there are things to be deleted, but these, fewer, articles should exist [we are not talking about an unknown manga/anime which sold only two copies]. --87.7.62.159 16:52, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Hydromasta's reason's for deleting this article are horrendous. Unlike other genres of animated series, Dragonball is more or less a parody and a homage to martial arts. Techniques and how they are used are very important througout most of the saga although by late stage Dragonball Z and Dragonball GT the importance of individual techniques where minimized. Still comparing Dragonball to comics like Batman, Superman, Spiderman, etc is not appropriate. This article list is very informative especially to those new to the series and even those who are experienced fans. Individual articles on certain techniques however should be deleted. Articles such as the Kamehameha and Kaioken should be either deleted or merged into this one. Certain transformations however like Oozaru deserve their own article. --Maphisto86 17:39, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>In case any editors haven't seen this suggestion, I will post it again here: Hmm, it seems that the One Piece attack list has been moved to a <a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Attacks" class="external text" title="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Attacks" rel="nofollow">wikia</a>, and after it is cleaned up enough a link to it will be provided on the wikipedia One Piece page. Would it please both parties if the DBZ attacks were moved to a similar place, with links to that page replacing the ones currently linking to the pages up for deletion? For example, if Goku's article said "His main attack is the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamehameha_%28Dragon_Ball%29_f257.html" title="Kamehameha (Dragon Ball)">Kamehameha</a>", it would instead say "His main attack is the [(insert link) Kamehameha]." Pretty much the only real changes would be that the attacks can't be found using the Wikipedia search engine, that the links would have those squares next to them, and it technically wouldn't be on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigmasonic_X_df4d.html" title="User:Sigmasonic X">Sigmasonic X</a> 17:51, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>A Must Keep</b> - The Kamehameha wave has become a universal icon and inspiration to the world of modern art and animation. As Eastern culture and practices become ever more influenced by methods and aesthetics of the West, the significance of the Kamehamehe wave is increasingly noticeable. I find that most arguments made against the inclusion of this definition stem from a disdain for "fans" or people who possess a zealous interest in the particulars of artistic expression (particularly television programs). Ultimately, this article is completely valid and factual in that it accurately represents a term employed in the program referenced, therefore such definitions are factually based, and factually based information, however trivial some may feel it to be, is indeed knowledge. Those who seek its removal seek, simultaneously, to limit the scope of Wikipedia's ability to inform. They seek to cut short knowledge. It is not for us to deem what is or is not "good" or "relevant" or "trivial" information. All information is of worth. And those who seek to remove any information, are guilty of crimes against knowledge... Hmmmm, I may have erred in my posting practices earlier. I am new to this, apparently one is to place comments in chronological order downward? Also, it seems that a username is to be listed. I am currently uncertain how to accomplish this but will attempt my best. Patiencee please. GCZ 01:24, 16 October, 2006 (UTC) <i>... in fact added by User:12.218.119.147</i>

<li><b>Rejoinder</b>: I don't even know what's meant by "universal icon" but doubt that this is one. You say <i>Ultimately, this article is completely valid and factual in that it accurately represents a term employed in the program referenced</i> which makes it seem as if this is a <i>dictionary</i> entry, but WP is not a dictionary. You also say <i>And those who seek to remove any information, are guilty of crimes against knowledge...</i> Stirring stuff indeed!

Just because it is/will be on the Dragon Ball Wikia doesn't mean it can't also be here.

<dd>Should we talk about Dragon Ball's subsequent impact on later works, including homages to its attacks? <b>Absolutely.</b> Is a lengthy description of the Kamehameha going to help that? <b>Not even a little.</b> Right now, there are two sentences in the kamehameha that aren't talking about DB, DBZ, or DBGT, and the place to talk about DB or DB*'s effect on other works would be in the article for the DB series or in the article for those other works, not in a out-of-the-way article burdened with excess plot detail. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:28, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Why is this article not being deleted for lack of sources when a similar article Anglo-Saxon hunting IS being deleted right now for the rationale of lack of sources? <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarthacanute3_8e70.html" title="User:Harthacanute3">Harthacanute3</a> 03:45, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As (I think) the principal contributor to this article some time ago, I admit that the sourcing is not as clear as it could be. Most of the material on forest law (the bulk of the article) was taken from the first chapter of John Manwood's treatise and from Blackstone's <i>Commentaries</i>, both of which are linked in the text; there are also external links to several royal charters in the "History" section. The principal problem, as it stands, is that Manwood (whom Blackstone relied on), though a Tudor justice of the forest, lived at a time when forest law had to some degree fallen into desuetude. His listing of the beasts of the forest is not entirely accurate, as already noted (see also the amply-cited <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_%28free%29.html" title="Warren (free)">Warren (free)</a>), and I am now given to understand that his classification of the court of swainmote is also problematic. Unfortunately, I will have to go to some difficulty to read GJ Turner's <i>Select Pleas of the Forest</i>, an important corrective to Manwood, and will not be able to revise it immediately. But overall, I think you'll find that the bulk of this article can be <i>verified</i> in the sources I've named, even if they haven't yet been arranged into inline citations and so forth. I hope this clears up some mysteries. And speaking of which, might I ask the nominator (who appears to have had some experience of Wikipedia before registering his name) why he marked the addition of the AfD notice as a "minor edit" and omitted a summary, and why his contributions so resemble those of the short-lived User:Fecal Matters? Or what the POV is in the article? <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 04:48, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Star Wars is such a large and encompassing universe, so the major option would be merging it into the weapons list (however, it is so minor, and I don't even get any significant google hits, that I feel it might be best to just ignore it completely). Plus, it seems to be slang numerous other terms (relating to comets and manufacturing), so a redirect is out of the question. Finally, a disambiguation of such a trivial term may be frowned upon. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 01:10, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete.</b> I hate to seem like a deletionist (I'm quite proud of Wikipedia's pop culture sections and the ones I've helped, it's just that many of them need cleanup, compression/merges, and an out of universe perspective)...but I don't know what to do with this article. It's been staring me in the eye for a while, because it is a plot summary of a minor part of a novella called <i>Side Trip</i>, which doesn't even have its own article.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article was created because the issue was overwhelming the main Frist article. I served as an informal mediator during its creation, and the article, at least at that time, was a satisfactory compromise between about five editors with strong views. Daughter articles are a very standard way of keeping relatively minor, but still notable, issues from swamping a main article. This technique has been used extensively, to generally good effect, in many articles. Arbcom itself suggested such a remedy for the John Kerry article, which resulted in several new article covering details of notable controversies (which then allowed the main article to keep focused). Clinton alone has got a good half-dozen such. As to the stated complaint .... this stuff was widely covered. Broaden the sourcing if you like, but it's plenty notable and easily sourced. Also note that the main source was Dr. Frist's own book. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 01:57, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not to sound flippant, but it is irrelevant why the article was created. This "controversy" is based off of a bunch of weblogs and one article in the Boston Globe. No other major source picked it up, or even bothered to look deeper into it. The nature of this manufactured non-event is apparent with the void of reporting on it. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">Torturous Devastating Cudgel</a> 02:50, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, it's not irrelevant. The question is not <b>whether</b> this material should be included in Wikipedia or not. The question is <b>where</b>. It should be presented in a manner that is most convenient for the reader. Usually, that place is in a subarticle if a controversy takes more than a paragraph to describe. Frankly, leaving it in the main article violates the undue weight provision of NPOV. Omitting it entirely is censorship of an issue that is widely known -- google it and see. Thus, a subarticle to allow a neutral presentation, at greater length, for the interested reader. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 03:00, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Three major newspapers, a lesser newspaper, a press service, and his own book are pretty good sources. Hardly "one article" as claimed. The key fact is that he improperly used shelter cats for medical experiments, not that he did experiments outside the norm. Some would applaud him for advancing medical research. Others condemn any experimentation on anmals wherever they were obtained. Seems enough well documented controversy for a subarticle, perhaps too complex for the main article.

Moreover the article explaining this fact mentions that "Gorgescu trains privately at Westgate indoor sports centre in Altona three times a week under Michael Tucci." so there is essentially no link to the school whatsoever. Also, I'm not sure where Ineffable3000 read that being part of a school district is sufficient with respect to that guideline but, if I may, I would suggest that he re-read this before posting that same absurdity in every school AfD out there. As for the "notable and verifiable" well let me try to say this again: AfD is not a vote and these arguments are meaningless since they don't reflect precedents, current practice or consensus. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 03:56, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. An EBBSCO Australia and New Zealand media database came up with one reference on this school: a letter to the editor by a student at the school.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Let me just say that what is important is the consensus among all Wikipedians, not among schoolwatch this is a very <b>alarming statement</b> and not at all in the spirt of wikipedia goals. I visted the link to Schoolwatch and found no discussion as to what are notable or what is not. All I found were a list of AfD's current and a past AfD's with results totaled by month list with totals by month. As to its point of view I found this statement right at top of page <b>"the terms 'keep' and 'no consensus' are used interchangeably (as no consensus defaults to keep)."</b> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRanger_6fb8.html" title="User:TheRanger">TheRanger</a> 15:50, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, it's funny you should say that, because about an hour before you posted that I posted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Barnstable_High_School&amp;diff=82642705&amp;oldid=82626153" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Barnstable_High_School&amp;diff=82642705&amp;oldid=82626153" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Second, notability has to be shown. Those voting "keep" have to actually come up with some non-trivial sources that have <i>taken note</i> of the school. Those voting "delete" have no such burden, although in a perfect world we would all look for sources before voting. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 23:07, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> A research professor is easier to find notability for. Other than his dissertation, no research, no books, no invited papers, no research awards are reported. Google sucks for such research, because there are too many other men with similar names. It says he edits journals and is a Fellow of the national body of his specialty. Carr is more interested in teaching per his facuty page. The article doesn't cite winning teaching awards. Maybe some quotes from famous people in the field whom he mentored could be included to verify notability as a teacher, or publications, invited talks, and editorships could be documented.

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. Again, for one, this is not a high school, it's a primary school (and is a fairly new primary school).

<li>Since the development of coordinated spamming of VfD's. Read any comment by ForbiddenWord on a school AFD; they all say "keep, because we'll spam it with keeps regardless". It's honestly the most appalling thing ever to happen to notability on this encyclopedia. People spend far more time, over the course of their lives, at <i>work</i> than they do at a school, and yet we don't have articles for every place of employment (which, in any reasonable interpretation, are often more notable in their communities than schools are said to be). The ability of the schoolwatch crowd to bully every non-notable school into the encyclopedia is truly depressing, but it doesn't seem like there's anything left to do about it. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 20:29, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think you may have opened a can of worms with your comment here, and I don't think that it will benefit schoolwatch...

<ul>
<li>I agree this is a very <b>alarming statement</b> and not at all in the spirt of wikipedia goals. I visted the link to Schoolwatch and found no discussion as to what are notable or what is not. All I found were a list of AfD's current and a past AfD's with results totaled by month list with totals by month. As to its point of view I found this statement right at top of page <b>"the terms 'keep' and 'no consensus' are used interchangeably (as no consensus defaults to keep)."</b> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRanger_6fb8.html" title="User:TheRanger">TheRanger</a> 15:45, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Doesn't this Schoolwatch inherently promote canvass?

<li>I don't think that Schoolwatch exists to disrupt process.

<li>Erm, no that is not exactly true either. I personally use it to help improve articles that need improvement.

<ul>
<li>The comments by ForBiddenWord are directly opposed to wikipedia policy which states "It is considered highly inappropriate or unacceptable to advertise Wikipedia articles that are being debated in order to attract users with known views and bias, in order to strengthen one side of a debate. It is also considered highly inappropriate to ask friends or family members to create accounts for the purpose of giving additional support. Advertising or soliciting meatpuppet activity is not an acceptable practice on Wikipedia." <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRanger_6fb8.html" title="User:TheRanger">TheRanger</a> 18:30, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll not comment on the actual reason Schoolwatch exists, but the way Forbiddenword presents it, is actually the perfect way to disrupt process. See <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:Spam</a>, the section about canvassing. If one of the reasons Schoolwatch exists is to "turn out enough people to influence any AfD", then it should be abolished for being a POV votestacking mechanism. If this is not the purpose, then it should be made clear to Forbiddenword that his impression of it (and possibly of his perceived consensus as well) is quite wrong.<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 18:33, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There were, a long while ago, concerted efforts to votestack in the very manner that <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> describes. They were disruptive, and caused much division and rancour with no actual improvement to the encyclopaedia. Any editor attempting to restart that should be aware that there are a lot of editors around here who went through it the first time around, and are highly unlikely to favourably regard any attempts to bring back the rancour and factionalism. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:57, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Within certain limits, perhaps the main one being that there has to be enough independent, non-trivial, verifiable coverage, which is seriously lacking for many of these institutions. We currently have guidelines excluding lots of knowledge from this encyclopedia, and there is no reason (except consensus or lack thereof, but not some basic policy) that schools or kindergartens should get an automatic free pass. In case you've forgotten, Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, a directory, or many other things, even though directories, game guides, ... contain knowledge. It is up to us to decide what information is important enough to be included, and while our standards are quite different from paper encyclopedias, they are not non-existant. Your idea of what should be included is equally valid as anyone elses, but I hope that it won't get consensus. Anyway, nothing in this article is verified (as per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), and I wonder if apart from the basic existence, much can be verified (the uniform? doubtful...) <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 05:09, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The subject of this article has requested its removal on the grounds that its existance may tend to compromise his privacy.

<li><b>Question</b> well, he does seem to have some books published, but they might be self-published or something, I don't know. Any idea who produced the books?

<li><b>Delete if</b> the subject wants it to be. I looked on amazon.com, his books do not appear to be self published, although they are not too popular. He appears to be weakly notable. I don't think wikipedia would be worse off without this article.</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I understand the subject's privacy concerns, and I don't think Wikipedia has to index <i>every</i> author in the world. On the other hand, if you publish books, you have to understand that this exposes your private information somewhat. In the absence of the subject's request I would vote keep for this article. <a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 05:09, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Awkward keep</b>. The <i>Fate Magazine</i> and <i>Cincinnati Post</i> references are clearly independant coverage of his writings, whether those are self-published or not. He probably doesn't meet <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> but those two articles ought to earn him the minimum level of notability needed for a keep under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> as an author. The remaining problem is the <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> concern that led to this administrative nomination. Nothing in the article <i>seems</i> to fall within its demense, however. The ufology material is potentially controversial, but it is strongly sourced. The remaining material is not controversial, nor is it "details of [his] personal li[fe]." Furthermore, the caveats of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>'s section on the "Presumption in favor of privacy" for "Non-public figures" seem to be met. To wit, the article's content clearly exercises restraint, disincludes material from primary sources not covered in verifiable secondary sources, and is not "sensationalistic" or "titilating." <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is designed to shield people against misinformation and attacks, but I do not believe it is meant as a blanket means to hide otherwise-notable material from the wider world, at least not as the policy currently is worded (cf. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Talk%7EAngela_Beesley_4d1d.html" title="Talk:Angela Beesley">Talk: Angela Beesley</a>). <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 08:45, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable. Just because you write a book doesn't mean you get a WP entry, and the Cincinnati Post seems to be a local newspaper that and doesn't really guarantee notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> He has written several books. I added the publisher names from Amazon. They sound like "scholarly publishers," but I am not familiar with them. One book is around the 500,000th most popular on Amazon. I would be inclined to give some of the books a read based on the Amazon reviews. I do not see anything remotely defamatory in the article other than noting that the books he has written are about their subjects! So far as we know, no one forced him to write about UFO's, and it is not as if we snatched his private journal out of his desk and made an article out of it, or we sleuthed out the actual name of someone who published under a pen name. Publishing books pretty well removes any claim to personal privacy about having published the books. The books are listed in the catalog of his college, so it is not as if he will get into trouble at work for having written about whaty he wrote about.

<li><b>Comment</b> "If he doesn't want an article about himself here, then it shouldn't be here" this is a blatantly false statement of policy, the wishes of the subject are not an applicable argument in favour of deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I posted the above in full awareness of what policy says; that's why I didn't say anything even remotely close to "Policy says we should delete it." It's my opinion, and one I happen to hold strongly: A living person that doesn't want an article here should be allowed to request its removal. Take it or leave it. (The fact that it's not policy is also why I included the argument about him probably not meeting <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, so the closing admin will accept my vote on that basis rather than my opinion about requests from living persons.) --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 18:26, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: The AfD of a particular article, for better or worse, is not the appropriate place to debate whether policy (and consensus) should move in the direction of this opinion. We <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">cannot appeal to opinion</a>, but only to facts, verification, and policy.

<li><b>Keep</b> According to WorldCat, <i>Camus' Answer</i> is carried in 144 libraries while <i>Medieval Modal Logic &amp; Science</i> is carried in 128 libraries. That's reasonably impressive. And I don't understand Moreschi's suggestion that the "Top 100 Ufologists" claim is "bull" - the <i>Fate</i> article is available online, so you can see for yourself. Yes, ufology is arguably a pseudoscience, but plenty of people are interested in it, so being named as one of the top 100 Ufologists isn't too shabby. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 01:16, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Claims in fringe communities often are not able to meet Wikipedia's verifiability requirements. <i><a href="../../../f/a/t/Fate_Magazine_8bbf.html" title="Fate Magazine">Fate</a></i>, on the other hand, has been in continuous publication since the 1940s, and certainly has earned a position of repute by this time. Their awards and commondations are substantive in the appropriate field. Although giving undue weight to fringe communities or conflating their ideas with established thought does disservice to the encyclopedia's goals, in an article about a fringe science writer, there can be no better verification of impact than the recognition and admiration -- in print, from an established source -- of that same community. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 04:55, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

None of these articles seem to indicate why separate articles are needed regarding the presence of these species in the region. As of right now, they're simple lists of species, so at the very least, these articles should probably be merged into one (perhaps <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodiversity_in_Israel%2C_the_West_Bank%2C_and_the_Gaza_Strip_895a.html" title="Biodiversity in Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip">Biodiversity in Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip</a>). -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 02:51, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> What problems? All I see is a string of "delete per"s. The only actual arguments raised were Michael K. Edwards' assertion that such lists aren't maintainable (answered by Pascal.Tesson) and Yellowbelliedmarmot's contention that listing such things by country is "odd," if that can be called an argument. There's precedent, though, for what it's worth: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Azerbaijani_mammals_5bc2.html" title="List of Azerbaijani mammals">List of Azerbaijani mammals</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_mammals_in_Brazil_5599.html" title="List of mammals in Brazil">List of mammals in Brazil</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Estonian_mammals_271a.html" title="List of Estonian mammals">List of Estonian mammals</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Texas_butterflies_706d.html" title="List of Texas butterflies">List of Texas butterflies</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_dragonfly_species_recorded_in_Ireland_02b4.html" title="List of dragonfly species recorded in Ireland">List of dragonfly species recorded in Ireland</a>. Perhaps that simply means all of those should be deleted, too, but I don't see that a good argument for doing so has been raised. The articles as they stand are poor, but for what reason is the information contained in those articles not encyclopedic? They're verifiable and sourced (via the parent article <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodiversity_in_Israel%2C_the_West_Bank%2C_and_the_Gaza_Strip_895a.html" title="Biodiversity in Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip">Biodiversity in Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip</a>), so that's not the issue. Is the argument that flora and fauna are not encyclopedic? <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 08:47, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>There is no "POV" issue as we've already agreed to rename this to a more accurate/neutral form - however when looking at the extent of this series (~25 entries I think; see {{Biodiversity in Israel Palestine}}), it seems that the coverage here is grossly out of proportion to anywhere else, and that that may be unencyclopaedic. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 13:38, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is the fact that we're lacking other articles really a rationale for deletion? Or for creating those articles? The sheer number here does seem excessive, but merging would address that. What is it about the information itself that makes it not worthy of inclusion? Admittedly I have no expertise in the field, but an easily-accessible set of lists of species found in a given area seems like it might be useful to me -- especially if the alternative is to look up each individual species' article to determine whether it is in fact found in the region in question. It's true we have much more information in this vein for Israel etc. and Britain than elsewhere, but I don't see why that's a problem requiring deletion. I'd think this sort of thing is what the "not paper" guideline is for. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 19:56, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not trying to argue with you specifically, I'm trying to obtain more information from those who voted delete. Your question just seemed like a good place to start from. Unfortunately, most of those who favor deletion don't have their own rationale, and those who do apparently don't feel like expanding upon it.

<li><b>Keep</b> I did create these lists and they are the result of a lot of research on the net and in books. I did not mean to make them as articles, I just wanted lists to support the main article <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodiversity_in_Israel_and_Palestine_50d0.html" title="Biodiversity in Israel and Palestine">Biodiversity in Israel and Palestine</a>. Those who want to see these lists deleted raised the following points:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Do we need to have lists of species in separate geographical areas:</b> The geographical area of Israel Palestine is a very unique one from an ecological point of view. The main article <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodiversity_in_Israel_and_Palestine_50d0.html" title="Biodiversity in Israel and Palestine">Biodiversity in Israel and Palestine</a> describes this area. This geographical area may not have many species unique to it, but its combination of species is unique and this is what the main article and the lists are about. The lists in question of deletion are part of that main article.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Do we need to have lists of species in certain countries:</b> These lists are not about a certain country but about a geographical region that includes Israel and Palestine. So the issue is not countries but a geographical region that has a certain combination of species.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>That the information where a species occurs is already contained on the wiki pages of the various species:</b> The wiki page of each species answers the question <i>where does this species live</i>. These lists answer a different kind of question <i>What species do live in a certain region</i>. These are two important questions. These lists are here to answer the later question regarding the geographical area of Israel Palestine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>That the coverage here is grossly out of proportion to anywhere else:</b> I do not see how can this be a problem, It is a good thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>That these are not complete article:</b> I only wanted to create lists that support the mean article. I did not mean to create articles. These lists are long so it is not suitable to merge them in the article, this will make it very long and crowded. I always wanted to know how can we create lists in wikipedia without the need for these lists to meet article standards. Can any one help me with this?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>My opinion is that these lists are very informative for any one seeking to understand the ecology of this area. They are a great reference for any one looking for a certain species in the area. It will be a great loss if we delete them. I hope more experienced wikipedians may help us put these lists in a more friendly form while keeping them as extensions of the main article <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodiversity_in_Israel_and_Palestine_50d0.html" title="Biodiversity in Israel and Palestine">Biodiversity in Israel and Palestine</a>--<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThameen_af0e.html" title="User:Thameen">Thameen</a> 09:36, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> (but perhaps move to original and more common spelling "paleodicots"). This is a concept that was introduced with some of the molecular phylogenies addressing the earliest branches of the angiosperms, when it became apparent that "dicots" were a paraphyletic group.

<ul>
<li>The word is not poorly defined, it simply represents a non-monophyletic group (as do many group names in plant systematics): those dicots that are not eudicot. That fact does not make it "poof" out of existence. Sure it's a neologism, but plant systematics is full of neologisms, as anybody active in the field in the last 20 years well knows. Wikipedia is full of articles about obscure and rarely-used terms and concepts. If they were all deleted, there wouldn't be much left! I would argue that Wikipedia is at its very best when it provides explanations for the obscure and hard-to-track-down subjects. Here are my tests: does the term actually exist? Has it been used in the literature? Is anybody ever likely to want to know about it? And finally, is the information presented factually? <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 13:21, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. IMHO palaeodicot is a useful term, denoting those angiosperms which are neither monocots nor eudicots.

<dl>
<dd>So what? It contains these (English) references:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>#2 &amp; #3 both point to the same issue of CACM which is inaccessible to non-members (Volume 34 , Issue 10 (October 1991)) and appears to have been written by the originators of ObjectStore</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This paper <i>was</i> written by the originators but was accepted by the CACM, doesn't that make it a valid paper. The CACM was never free, not in its original paper form either. Does that make its papers less valid?</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>#4 &amp; #5 are reports that Starwood hotels is using the software</li>
<li>#6 is not an article about the software, but notes from Cisco documentation of a Cisco product that uses ObjectStore</li>
<li>#7 &amp; #13 appear to be just press releases from the software's authors</li>
<li>#8 is very short and only indirectly about ObjectStore; it's subject is actually another piece of software which uses ObjectStore</li>
<li>#9 is in german, but appears to be just product documentation</li>
<li>#10 &amp; #14 are again just product documentation</li>
<li>#11 is a perl extension that uses ObjectStore</li>
<li>#12 is just a comparison of various databases, not an article about ObjectStore</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 91-44-04449-6</a> could not be found at either amazon or the library of congress</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-13-123829-9</a> appears to be about databases in general, not about ObjectStore</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So, while there seems to be plenty to indicate the software is in use, I only see <b>1</b> of these that might satisfy the guideline (eg. qualify as an article about the subject that is non-trivial). <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValrith_e155.html" title="User:Valrith">Valrith</a> 20:54, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Another reference is the book "Object Databases in Practice" by Akmal B. Chaudhri, Mary Loomis, Hewlett-Packard Professional Books which includes a section on each of 5 object databases, including a chapter on ObjectStore.</p>
<p>Hibernate has a perfectly acceptable Wikipedia entry, and is not considered a Java API for persisting data. ObjectStore is a full ODBMS with backup, recovery, archiving etc.</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> I agree with Valrith. There are not "multiple non-trivial published works" -- in fact, there is maybe one. And if a paper was written by the authors is to be a non-trivial published work, it will have to have received significant attention. Merely being accepted is not enough in my view. <a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 05:16, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

It was the top product in its field and it's been around since 1988. The nomination is inaccurate; this isn't an api, this a database product that's been on the market for over 18 years and recieved plenty of coverage over that time. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 07:01, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Based on the following being true: tuition fees are higher than the local norm and by doing so presumably do not accept every potential student. Tuition information is available at <a href="http://www.northholm.nsw.edu.au/WEBPAGES/enrol_fees.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.northholm.nsw.edu.au/WEBPAGES/enrol_fees.htm" rel="nofollow">this school page</a>. However, regional basis for comparison not available. In my belief, tuition alone does not assert a strong solid case for exclusiveness.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Once encyclopedic, always encyclopedic. The fact that this mall may be demolished soon does not detract from the fact that it was once an important retail area where many people were employed. Understanding the rise and fall of shopping malls in an era of widespread car ownership is an important part of economic history, in the same way that the development of electric streetcars meant that downtown department stores could tap a larger geographic catchment area, at the expense of neighborhood merchants. One role that Wikipedia can play is answering a reader's questions about the sort of company where the reader's grandparents worked. Articles about vanished factories, department stores and even malls play a role in answering those questions. In any event, the references meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, but there are a number of ways in which the article could be expanded. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 05:15, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I remember this mall when my family shopped there while on extended vacation in 1976 and being the ONLY mall within a 100 mile radius at that time, it tends to stick in your mind, so if I remember it after 30 years I am sure that it's neighbors will NOT forget it after 3 years, as the first person who commented on it suggested. It's a part of that area's history, so I say keep it.--<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonicnukleo_00e8.html" title="User:Sonicnukleo">Sonicnukleo</a> 12:12, 17 October 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonicnukleo_00e8.html" title="User:Sonicnukleo">Sonicnukleo</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESonicnukleo_4bed.html" title="User talk:Sonicnukleo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sonicnukleo_f9c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sonicnukleo">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am from New York City, and I remember this mall as well. My husband and I were vacationing in nearby beach resort Ocean City, Maryland (about 30 miles east of Salisbury,MD) and in 1979 I was very happy to find this mall when I needed to stock up on supplies for my vacation. It was the only indoor mall on Delmarva at the time, actually it was the only indoor mall from 1968-1982, until the Dover Mall in nearby Dover,Delaware opened in 1982. It holds historical importance as far as the economic history of the Delmarva Peninsula is concerned. It would be sad to see the article deleted.--ShellyWindsor 12:20, 17 October 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: ShellyWindsor (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ShellyWindsor_3e22.html" title="Special:Contributions/ShellyWindsor">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am one of those neighbors that will certaintly remember this mall long after it's gone. I live just 4 miles from this site, and it was the very first job I had back in 1970. I won't be forgetting it after 3 years as one person had suggested earlier. It was the largest retail outlet and the largest retail employer in Salisbury from 1968 until the new larger mall opened across town from it in 1990. So I would say being the largest retail employer for 22 years in a 50-100 mile radius is of GREAT historical importance!

<li><b>Keep</b> I am working on a documentary that focuses on the old Salisbury Mall and I assure you, there is more to this story than an old building on 80 acres of land in some mid-Atlantic town. I would be more than happy to edit the entry and include any and every detail I have been able to dig up in my last 4 months of research. For anyone who doesn't live anywhere near Salisbury, that mall has been the thorn in many people's sides for quite some time, especially since it's now considered an open invite for transiants and crime. I have a vast archive of photos, store listings, Daily Times articles, old ads and everything in between to ad, if need be. Some possible points of interest are that Miss America was on hand at the October 1968 opening. Only 16 stores were ready the day the mall opened. Pennys from the fountain were immediately marked as contributions to a local charity. There was a murder within the mall in the mid-70s and another in the early 90's, the latter seeming to be the beginning of the end for the establishment. The mall is comprised of two parts: the west and east sections. The west was the original and the east was added in 1976. To just drive around the empty parkiing lot (3300+ spaces, FYI) it's such a trip because this mall is literally useless and taking up so much land but the history of it is also very apparent. I am 26, I am fresh from college; this may not seem the most exciting topic in the world, but if a 26 year old can find the time to research and drive 2 hours a weekend to chronicle this old mall, I'm sure someone else will find it interesting, as well.Aside from an article I have contributed to Labelscar.com and a few photos, there is literally NOTHING about this mall online. It would be a disservice to delete this entry, leaving almost nothing for anyone to utilize as a source for information.User: Clauramoist10:25am, October 17, 2006 <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Clauramoist (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Clauramoist_1602.html" title="Special:Contributions/Clauramoist">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> while the unsourced personal recollections of Wikipedians may not be enough to determine the content of an article, they are persuasive as to the subjective value of whether an article should be kept. Wikipedia is a worldwide site, and as such, local content will be covered, and in some detail. This information is not always available to the public at large. Thus it's helpful to see the local memories of people who can speak informatively if not authoritatively on a subject, and provide some sense of the value of something. Now whether or not Malls qualify as notable, I don't know, but they're hardly worse than High Schools. Maybe there needs to be a WP:Malls? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:05, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Sorry, but Notability is absolutely subjective. It's inherent in the concept of the word, there are things we think are more or less important than others. That is why <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidents_of_the_United_States_41ff.html" title="Presidents of the United States">Presidents of the United States</a> is an article while Presidents of my local school is not. You should rewrite your attempt at defining policy to cover that it is less about personal thought and belief versus the feeling of a group's decision. As it stands, you're merely using your own writings to endorse your own position, not represent an accurate portrayal of the situation. Heck, even Jimmy Wales has said notability is subjective. <a href="http://writingshow.com/?page_id=91" class="external autonumber" title="http://writingshow.com/?page_id=91" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. But hey, I disagree with your attempting to post self-written thoughts as somehow subjectively more important than actual argument anyway. As I've said before, when you post like that, it's not actually encouraging. This doesn't mean I don't think you're well-intentioned, I just think you're doing it poorly. And actually we do have ways of knowing whether something is local memory. It's called looking at resourcs on a local subject. In this case, there are newspaper articles on the mall, all of which are consistent with the statements made here, so I have no reason to doubt them, but will AGF. It's also possible that there are local books on recent history, and I'm sure it would make you happy if they were cited, but as I said, your way of trying to get people to do that, just come across poorly to me. Perhaps it would be better if you restricted yourself to just making the same point once in an AfD instead of replying to everyone on it? Yes, I know you consider it important, but saying it so often in a single AfD diminishes the value of it. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:30, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wrong. Read what I linked to. Notability is not subjective. Notability is not determined by Wikipedia editors making subjective judgements, no matter what you think about the presidents of your local school.
<p><i>And actually we do have ways of knowing whether something is local memory. It's called looking at resourcs on a local subject.</i> — And yet you criticise when someone <i>asks</i> for such sources. Your argument lacks any logic and your position is self-contradictory. If you don't like the fact that we insist upon sources here (and if Argumentum ad Jimbonem is your thing, there's a very strong Argumentum ad Jimbonem for insisting upon sources — see <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Further_reading" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability#Further_reading</a>), once again I say that you will not find Wikipedia to be a comfortable place.

<li>Actually, I did read what you wrote and the fact of the matter is, I simply do not agree with your opinion, and I stated why. Notability is subjective. You can continue to represent your position the way you want, but I find it unconvincing and unpersuasive. What you're really disagreeing with is the importance of individual opinions as opposed to the group or worldwide opinion. I think rewriting your position statement with that in mind would be more accurate and persuasive. And no, I don't have an inherent problem with asking for sources, merely the occasionally chosen method of doing so. For example, I have a problem with complaining that there are no sources, acting like that there never can be sources, and thus claiming an article is unverifable. A lot of people use the term "unverifiable" when what they really meant to use is "unverified" and that's just bad for Wikipedia. It's annoying. It's also annoying when someone makes the same point several times in the same AfD. It's one thing to be talking with someone, it's another to effectively copy and paste the same information to people who may not even respond to you. I really do hope you recognize that it may not be the best way of doing things, and if not, I'll continue trying to persuade you. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:59, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wrong. If one is applying subjective criteria, one is not applying notability criteria. Once again: Read what I linked to. As for your unfounded assumption that people aren't going to respond in discussions (which implies that you have a low opinion of those people, note), I suggest that you pay more attention to what happens when one does <i>not</i> encourage editors, in particular new editors, to focus upon and to cite sources, and contrast that to what happens when one does. I also suggest that you consider that I and other editors have managed to engage novice editors in discussion and in productive work on citing sources here in this very discussion, resulting in improvements to the article since nomination, whereas you have not. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:50, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, I read what you wrote. It wasn't convincing. Sorry, and I'm frankly perplexed that you won't respond to my concerns. Notability is subjective, and what you're talking about is an individual opinion versus a number of people with opinions. I'm also confused as to why you think it's such a negative statement to say that people may not respond to you. That's hardly as negative as you make it out ot be, though honestly I haven't seen responses by most of the people you responded to, or any edits at all, so I'd say it's hardly unfounded. I'd say it's based on pretty solid evidence. But that wasn't even the point anyway, the point was that the methods was not effective, even if the intent was laudable. You can go on and on about encouraging editors, but if you don't recognize that it's important to consider what effect you're having, well, that could have unfortunate results. But really, rewriting that page you're so found of quoting about Notability would be nice. I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just saying you're presenting it poorly. You can do better. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:04, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've responded. You're, quite simply, wrong. Notability is not subjective.
<p><i>the point was that the methods was not effective</i> — Rubbish. I've asked you three times to actually read the explanation of why notability is not subjective. Now I ask you actually read this very discussion. I point out again that I and other editors have managed to engage novice editors in discussion and in productive work on citing sources here in this very discussion, resulting in improvements to the article since nomination, whereas you have not. When it comes to effectiveness of methods, that speaks volumes. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:58, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>No, you haven't responded to what I've said. Sorry. If you had, you'd have said different things, rather than repeat yourself. But hey, you don't want to recognize what I said, I can't make you. And since most of the people you did reply to with your C&amp;P reply haven't made edits, and have been tagged as possible sockpuppets, I don't think you can take any credit for anybody's actions here. The only consistent editor has been involved with this article from the beginning, and was already committed to it. Since they haven't done anything with any other articles, I'm not sure that there's much to take credit for, but if it makes you happy to claim it, go right ahead. But do remember, it's not good to toot your own horn. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:48, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>'<i>Comment</i> <b>It is not a good idea to publish your email, phone number or address here, because these comments may be picked up by spammers or mirrored on other sites.</b> Maybe the local library or historical society has clippings from papers when the mall was important which could be used to improve the article and establish its former importance.

<li><b>Delete</b> Personal testamonials here cannot establish notability. Multiple nontrivial published sources are needed. The articles cited still just say it is an eyesore and a hazard, has been boarded up 15 years, and should be knocked down and redeveloped.

<li><b>Comment</b> Personal testimonials by single purpose accounts are not very compelling, but this borderline based on some of the sources that <i>finally</i> have been produced after Uncle G stated exhaustively what was necessary here. I don't subscribe to <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> as it is a proposed guideline, but I suppose that if these sources are added to the article it at least meets <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and it may be of local importance, though I personally don't see much notability in the "...first enclosed climate controlled mall on the entire Delmarva Peninsula." It would be nice if there were a source that actually validated that this building has any kind of local historical significance, other than a blog, which isn't exactly a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:16, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Question</b>What could be included (aside from articles -- which I will post this evening) here that would validate this building's story beyond just another local mall-turned-dump? I took a class as an undergrad about folklore and the professor always stressed the importance of chronicling the past, especially when its future is in jeopardy. This mall is scheduled to be be razed by January 2007 and while some of you have pontificated the general banality of this subject, none of you, save Uncle G, have offered suggestions on what information could be provided in order for this article to be deemed valid. The novelty of Wikipedia is that it IS a venue for random information. If it wasn't, I wouldn't have been able to have found the original airing date's of "Mama's Family" (the syndicated version), where a crab apple comes from and exactly which Fleer baseball cards are considered worth money, all in one place.

<li>I have been working on research for months now and sadly, most of Salisbury Maryland's local paper is only on Microfilm so what I have is mainly what I have scanned from a second rate source. I will follow your advice and add as much as I have. This really isn't your run-of-the-mill mall. It isn't tucked on some roadside off a busy interstate with weeds growing up around it. It's literally in the middle of this town. There is a huge arena across the street. A major shopping center backs up to its parking lot. It's failure is mildly interesting but it's also relative to the area's commercial history. How much time is given before the article *may* be deleted? User:clauramoist

<li><b>Comment</b>, an AfD usually runs for about 5 days; sometimes longer based on how busy the closing admins are. Personally the thing I'd like to see is some evidence of historical contenxt here.

I had to make a choice ........... however, I have included 2 links so far, the first worked, the second from a Washington Post article from 1990 isn't formatting, and I followed the pattern for the previous articles. I have a number of articles from 1968 when it opened, 1976 when it was expanded, 1990 when the new mall opened and 1991 when there was a murder, and I want to make sure I'm doing this properly.User:clauramoist</li>

All the Google pages for the subject (in quotes) point back to this page or some derivative, eg Answers.com, etc. The article contends the product was introduced in 1933, in 1933, it's doubtful one could have even bought tortillas in Davenport, much less meat specifically for tacos.

<p><i>"An important thing to realise about AutoCAD is that it is not some kind of digital drawing board. A lot of inexperienced users approach the program as if it was MS Paint for engineers, and end up creating horribly thought out and disorganised drawings that can cause no end of strife and frustration for those who may later be required to work with the files. Not only can badly created drawings cause ulcers to other AutoCAD users, they make it a lot easier for design flaws to sneak into the process."</i></p>

<p>Do not, under any circumstances, just scribble down a line in a place that "looks" right. What kind of database user are you to be inserting 199.9813 when you mean 200? If you want one line to begin where a previous one ends, then ensure they contact at EXACTLY the same point. You can use the "Object Snaps" feature to make this work properly, and there is no excuse for creating drawings that contain elements that look like they line up until you zoom in to micrometer scales and discover why those polylines weren't joining correctly or those hatches weren't applying properly etc.</p>

<li><b>Merge</b>: I don't really understand this nomination. There's nothing "indiscriminate" about this list. The verifiability issues are easily remedied. Also those using "not encyclopedic" as a deletion criterion must have a subjective definition of that word which they're not telling us.

<li><b>Keep, and require that the nominator and supporters above reread <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> ten times each.</b> I think that some editors don't really understand what "encyclopedic" means, especially as it applies to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. Wikipedia isn't your typical encyclopedia, having already become the largest encyclopedia in the world and the one with the <i><b>widest scope</b></i>. The point is you should be able to find anything you are looking for on Wikipedia, or be directed to it. For example, we don't generally have recipe collections in this encyclopedia, but we certainly have links to them. And I didn't see the pro-deleters above mention anything about providing access of any kind to this useful list they want to delete, which one of them admits is highly useful. One thing Wikipedia is reknowned for is its lists. We have many thousands of lists on just about everything you can imagine. Many of those lists are about the most frivolous of subjects, yet they are deemed "encyclopedic". And here we have a list that travellers with pets may find quite useful. We have articles on travelling (and this is one of them). We have many articles on pets (and this is one of them). We have articles on rabies and a great many other diseases (and this is one of them). We have articles on customs regulations, and this is one of them. That's <i><b>four</b></i> encyclopedic subjects by which this article is differentiated from all the rest, narrowing its focus down to a very specific issue, and you say it is indiscriminate. How about these lists and the their underlying articles:

<li>Yes, damnit, it's a very useful list. But can you imagine Britannica, even if they had indefinite space, including something like this? Wikipedia is not a travel guide. This is a useful list purely for travellers. Surely the obvious solution is to include a link to this (i.e to the UK government site) at the bottom of the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet_passport.html" title="Pet passport">Pet passport</a> article? <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> AN INDISCRIMINATE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION.

<li>The "Britannica argument" holds no merit whatsoever on Wikipedia which goes way beyond other encyclopedias in scope. Wikipedia abounds with articles and lists that currently don't appear in Britannica or any other formal encyclopedia. Wikipedia is more informal, like <i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>, and includes lists such as the <i><b><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_that_most_frequently_use_the_word_fuck.html" title="List of films that most frequently use the word fuck">List of films that most frequently use the word fuck</a></b></i>, a very useful movie guide indeed (I've watched almost every movie on there, and will watch the rest when I get around to it).&#160;:) Britannica will probably never have articles like that!!!! But Wikipedia does. And the list in question isn't purely for travellers - see my comment below. &#160; <i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="purple">Th</font><font color="blue">e Tr</font><font color="#9ACD32">ans</font><font color="#FFCC00">hu</font><font color="orange">man</font><font color="red">ist</font> &#160;</a></b></i> 14:33, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>AfD failed</b>. In a mass nomination like this, every article involved must be tagged with the {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">afd</a>}} template, so that everyone involved in the article has the chance to have their say.

<li><b>Delete</b> Many hospitals are notable, and have articles, but even the best-known ones are mostly stubs. But categorizing a hospital as a hospital adds nothing, and listing hospitals as hospitals adds little. If I were looking for a hospital in a new city, I would Google to find hospitals and their ratings, so I can't see what purpose the state listings serves.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:27, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> lists by country, but not this particular list or lists by continent (it's better to use categorisation than superlists).

<li><b>Keep</b> Despite the meaningless rhetoric, lists and categories are not equivalent and do not -- and never can -- serve the same purposes. The fact that the nominator (and those voting delete, for that matter) doesn't even bother to refer to a supposed Wikipedia policy that bans lists, or articles with many red links, speaks strongly for the retnetion of this and other, similar articles. I don't see any of the "errors" that the nominator mentions. I do see many red links, which are NOT a justification to delete an article, serve as placeholders for future articles and will magically turn blue once the corresponding articles were created. The fact that lists CAN have red links is a point in their favor. If someone started a religion whereby adherents would vote to keep any article where the list vs. category argument is used, I'd sign up in a second. Any info on such a religion and details on what holidays are observed would be appreciated. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 11:41, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

There are many kinds of bad science that are far from pseudoscience. Pseudoscientists are usually lacking scientific credentials and lack a university setting, but bad scientists may have credentials and be at a university. Some use "bad science" as a term of art to discount things like <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> or statistical sampling to estimate the civilian death count in Iraq. Senator Inhofe said of global warming: 'Mann's results are "based on using end points in computing changes in an oscillating series" and are " just bad science." I repeat: "just bad science."' A large proportion of published research and textbook content qualifies as bad science. Bad science is a good title for an umbrella article encompassing an overview of all its branch articles. Someone comfortable with philosophy of science and <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">Epistemology</a> has to wrestle some heavy references to back up the text of such an article.

<li>A rough guide is that membership of the Order of Canada is roughly equivalent to a UK KBE, officership is equivalent to a baronetcy, and companionship is equivalent to a life peerage. The only medals worn "before" an OC medal are the Victoria Cross and the Cross of Valour. Being an officer in the Order of Canada is almost a guarantee that the individual is notable in his or her field. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic">Charlene.fic</a> 13:44, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>again, this whole discussion seems to be vs people not being aware of this Hamiltonians significance, which to me is just te argument to keep it. If you would help phrase why it can be disregarded in your fields, that would really improve the article. i have tried in the intro but naturally can not make a convincing case to irrelevance&#160;:). The subject itself will always stay short and precise but because of its implications (and differing interpretations as to validity), it should stay separate. andrej.westermann 17:09, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I simply do not understand why you want to create a separate article. Hamiltonians are indeed very important. They are important in classical physics, where they are certain functions of coordinates and conjugate momenta (and possible explicit time), and they can be used to obtain equations of motion as Hamilton's equations. They also have a geometric significance, as generators of time translations, using symplectic manifolds, Poisson brackets etc. All this is described in the article <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamiltonian_mechanics.html" title="Hamiltonian mechanics">Hamiltonian mechanics</a>. They are also very important in quantum physics, where they are operators that act on states and again are generators of time translations. They can then be identified with energy operators, for example in the famous time-independent Schrödinger equation<img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/b/d/abd6f0133c673fb04b1c7a477197d730.png" alt="H|\psi\rangle=E|\psi\rangle" />, where <span class="texhtml"><i>H</i></span> is the Hamiltonian (operator), <img class='tex' src="../../../math/6/0/5/605b44d27aad3e8e841b1dd43053faa1.png" alt="|\psi\rangle" /> is the eigenstate of this operator and <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i></span> is the energy, the eigenvalue. All this is described in the article <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamiltonian_%28quantum_mechanics%29.html" title="Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)">Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)</a>. I do not see what can you possibly say in a new article that is called "Quantum Hamiltonian" that is not already said in one of these two. -- <a href="../../../e/k/j/User%7EEkjon_Lok_8b74.html" title="User:Ekjon Lok">Ekjon Lok</a> 17:22, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>exactly the point. there is no need to state anything new but there is a need to state the differences you just mentioned in one article. they do well make the distinction themselves, however, for the layman, this distinction gets easily confused and i am still looking for a way to clear this. so far, this is the way and i have tried keeping links to it few and if possible only from the disambiguition page or the areas you mentioned.andrej.westermann 17:37, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I suggest reading good books on Quantum Mechanics. You can always use Wikipedia as a secondary reference, to clarify concepts that seem unfamiliar. Generally, the connection between classical Hamiltonian and quantum Hamiltonian is made via the "canonical quantization" formalism: the Poisson bracket is replaced by commutator (times some factors such as <span class="texhtml"><i>i</i></span> and <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/d/f/9dfd055ef1683b053f1b5bf9ed6dbbb4.png" alt="\hbar" />). Classically, Hamiltonian is just a function (in most cases it is just the energy). In quantum mechanics Hamiltonian is an operator. In both cases they can be viewed as time translation generators (classically by the Poisson bracket action, quantum-mechanically by direct action on state vectors, or by commutation on other operators). All good books on quantum mechanics usually describe this. -- <a href="../../../e/k/j/User%7EEkjon_Lok_8b74.html" title="User:Ekjon Lok">Ekjon Lok</a> 17:48, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Final final comment: if you really want to write an article on how Hamiltonians are used in classical and quantum mechanics, what are the connections, what are the differences and similarities, then it should not be called "Quantum Hamiltonian". It should be called something like "Hamiltonian in classical and quantum physics" or something similar. That might, indeed, be quite useful. -- <a href="../../../e/k/j/User%7EEkjon_Lok_8b74.html" title="User:Ekjon Lok">Ekjon Lok</a> 17:56, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For what it's worth, I consider the relationship between Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of a physical theory to be about the deepest topic there is in mathematical physics. If you can treat it with any remotely useful degree of mathematical accuracy within the constraints of a Wikipedia article, you're a better man than I am. I think I'll just skip the rant and point out that <a href="http://www.claymath.org/millennium/Yang-Mills_Theory/" class="external free" title="http://www.claymath.org/millennium/Yang-Mills_Theory/" rel="nofollow">http://www.claymath.org/millennium/Yang-Mills_Theory/</a> is an offer of a million smackeroos more or less for an explanation of how a sane Hamiltonian can emerge from a realistic Lagrangian.

<dd>This is illustrative of the problems with many specialized-field science articles on the encyclopedia at this time. At its best versions, it has duplicated the effort of the two existing articles discussed in above notes. At its worst, it has been disingenuous and factually inaccurate. The justifications given on the article's discussion page are particularly circuitous or nonresponsive. And, of course, the references are varyingly unacceptable (a toequest.com forum post), extraordinarily generic links that are functionally definitions, or wholly inapplicable to the topic discussed (William H. Rowan's original work). The encyclopedia has standards for math and science articles that are steeper than those for, say, popular culture, and this does not meet them.

<dd>Wikiproject Physics has largely concluded this author is, to use their words, "a crank or a prankster". This article and references to it have been systemically poor since inception, and have been all but exclusively the playground of a single-topic account (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_andrej.westermann_fbd0.html" title="Special:Contributions/andrej.westermann">andrej.westermann</a>) and a veritable host of sockish-seeming IPs (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.226.146.13_5835.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.226.146.13">84.226.146.13</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.227.60.147_4734.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.227.60.147">84.227.60.147</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.227.80.45_e5eb.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.227.80.45">84.227.80.45</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.227.129.102_e390.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.227.129.102">84.227.129.102</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_89.217.60.227_96fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/89.217.60.227">89.217.60.227</a>), perhaps from a semi-dynamic host.

<p>One of many <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netflix.html" title="Netflix">Netflix</a> clone sites. There is nothing particularly notable about this one. Was speedy deleted under A7, but its creator objected, and I felt that in the interest of fairness, we might as well open this up for debate: the fact that they specialize in Russian movies is something unique, enough to pass A7.

<li>Even though it utilizes the same Netflix business model (with some deviation, like "express" service), it deliberately avoids the Netflix content, trying to position itself as a mutual exclusive company content wise.
<p>I am using both companies for my "movies" needs, just because of the unique RussArt.com content. For more then 6 million Russian speaking people in US, RussArt.com is really a one of the few threads which they can use to preserve their culture.</p>
<p>RussArt also provides with extensive info about movies/TV serials which help to make a decision what to order next.</p>
<p>I am actually looking for another site like RussArt.com, but dedicated to exclusevly French movies, since Netflix does not satisfy my demand on them either, but cannot find it just yet....</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> To me it is very offensive that a mass culture giant <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netflix.html" title="Netflix">Netflix</a> dealing 90% in Hollywood production, shields honorable attempts to compete in cultural niches. Let's take a hypothetical site that, say, rents gay and lesbian movies. Well, <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netflix.html" title="Netflix">Netflix</a> does carry the Brokeback Mountain, so let's ban the site from everywhere because it's just another copycat. That's a poor approach, missing the points: (1) the gay and lesbian community is proud to have their own service, (2) there is much more for the visitors than just rentals - like gay and lesbian news, events, movie reviews from particular angle, etc.
<p>I vote for diversity - let's allow the Russian/Ukranian/Jewish/etc. American community to have their cinema portal RussArt.com, which also happens to rent DVDs like <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netflix.html" title="Netflix">Netflix</a> does, - listed.</p>

<li>I'm not voting second time, I'm just offering more information. You guys might not read Russian and in such case it's hard for you to see what I see. I spent some time on this site and see that DVD rentals is just a small part of it. It offers public forum, where anyone can contribute content, post reviews and comments. It has online games, challenging knowledge on russisn cinema and actors. It has tons of news articles about movies and actors, including biographies and anecdotes.

<li>Hi all. Ok, here is the thing. I'm Russian living in US for the past 10 years. I moved to US when I was 14. Even though, I speak, read and write almost perfectly in my native language, sometimes I come accross words that I never heard before. Believe it or not, when I search Google for the newly heard word, it often displays Wikepedia's page in the first few results. For the past month, it helped me learn 3 new words in my native language. Deleting this content would be a huge mistake.

<dd>Yes, that is what I said.

<li><b>Comment</b> Russian speaking people in US is a tiny slice of population (~ 2.6%), so social clubs and services for these people are barely notable in american society, meaning they just cannot be as notable as, say <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netflix.html" title="Netflix">Netflix</a>. Having said this, it is still 6-7 millions, which is a size of some European country. Notability notion, here, materializes a simplified democratic principle, - "the size does matter" and that the majority defines the ultimate truth, a.k.a. consensus. As related to RussArt.com article, - I am satisfied with the discussion and as long as "ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL" in the List of online DVD rental companies on Wikipedia, - we are in a concensus here&#160;:-).

<p>The result was <b>delete</b> - speculation about the motivation of the nominator doesn't matter when there are legitimate policy-reasons to argue for deletion. Those arguing for deletion, including the nominator, have done that, and the keep side hasn't come up with credible third party sources (not passing mentions) to refute them. Wikipedia is a website run by a non-profit entity, and speaking for myself I'm not being paid for this, so I'm not particularly concerned with 'conflicts of interest'. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 21:49, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The people have made significant news coverage in their own countries.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - hang on please!!!! It's not fair to just delete this article - I wrote this article to stop the squabbles about notability, because after all these people derive their notability solely from YouTube, not from anywhere else. All the people on this article have had significant media coverage as I have established by the references from news sources and other newspapers. I spent several hours sourcing articles that made these people notable. I don't think there is anyone else worthy of inclusion here - and I'm willing to keep deleting stuff unless it is notable so the spam argument has no relevance. YouTube has given people significant media coverage, and I was trying to establish this in an article. What's wrong with that? This was meant as a <b>replacement</b> for the standalone articles, not an article in addition and for the most part I merged those articles into this one. It's not fair to just delete all my work.

<li><b>Merge</b> to YouTube with a little pruning. The viral internet video phenoms are a critical part of YouTube's success (and billion-dollar price tag). Tracking the ones that have received substantial news coverage is helpful to readers, and I think more helpful than a boquet of small articles. I know editors here passionately hate the infiltration of internet cruft, and rightly so, but if the <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Washington Post</i> deign to mention something, I think we should humor them. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 07:04, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This is not a compromise I believe is beneficial - merging unencyclopaedic content to one article isn't always best in that it ignores the premise that it probably shouldn't be represented in the first place. This is less offensive than individual articles on these subjects, but I have to agree with Isotope that it's a matter of either they pass the guidelines and get an article or they don't pass them and get mentioned nowhere.

<dd>Please show me some good faith. I do not nominate articles for deletion simply because I haven't heard of the subject. I nominated it for the reason stated in the nomination - namely that there was no evidence of notability in the article according to the criteria specified in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Once some citations were produced, I was happy to change my mind. Incidentally, the onus should not be on an editor or user to do further research outside Wikipedia to verify an article; all citations should be provided within the article itself.&#160;—&#160;<a href="../../../t/i/v/User%7ETivedshambo_1e23.html" title="User:Tivedshambo">Tivedshambo</a>&#160;<small>(<a href="../../../t/i/v/User_talk%7ETivedshambo_577d.html" title="User talk:Tivedshambo">talk</a>)</small> 05:40, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The nomination didn't only state there were no citations of notability (an understandable argument), but it starts with "Just another failed internet company" which alot of editors might label POV. But the issue is not with you (I personally do beleive you made this nom in good faith), but that an afd for an iconic company article probably shouldn't have gotten this far, although with following WP:DEL policy it was allowed to do so. With the increasing global interest and scrutiny in Wikipedia as a reliable reference and this is now the 14th website in the world, something like this might be noted by a much larger amount of people than this discussion's contributors. As allowed, it was flagged for notability and went to afd in only 5 days after the article's creation. In my opinion, I think many would believe that in this case that shouldn't have happened as notability likely would've been settleled in a more reasonable amount of time before it got to this level. If there is a future debate on afd policy, this discussion would be a useful reference. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarriedtofilm_4bc3.html" title="User:Marriedtofilm">Marriedtofilm</a> 07:29, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Based upon my understanding of the rules for what books can have articles, the rules pretty well state that as long as it isn't self-published it can have an article. Had the book only been made available online, that would be one thing (Wiki hasn't to my knowledge reached consensus on what to do with e-books), but at the moment I'm giving it benefit of the doubt. Needs to be tagged as an upcoming book, however. I'll do that now.

<dd>Why mention just one specific incident unless you have an agenda? The files barely reference Landau and in no way support the contentions you have added to the page on Landu. A major extortion attempt? The "major" extortion attempt resulted in Landau getting a desultory amount for services renderedHe is, at best, a very minor figure in Preley's life and there is no need for an article about him. The extortion attempt was one of many so why list just that one? Why not mention how the files mention that internal memos suggest that J. Edgar Hoover not meet with Presley due to his long hair, clothes etc. Why focus on such a small, unimportant incident (all of 2 pages our of 663 pages) unless you have an agenda? The FBI memo suggest that Landau was mentally disturbed. In all, this "major" blackmail effort netted Landau about $400. <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochdale_5ee1.html" title="User:Lochdale">Lochdale</a> 02:38, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We are here talking about the Wikipedia article on Griessel-Landau. Thomas Fensch, the author of the book on the FBI files on Presley, says that the Griessel-Landau case was a "major extortion attempt". Therefore it takes up much space in his book, not only 2 pages as you falsely claim. Did you read the original files? I don't think so. There you can read, "By negotiation, Presley agreed to pay Griessel-Landau $200.00 for treatments received and also to furnish him with a $315.00 plane fare to London, England. Griessel-Landau agreed to depart to England on 25 December 1959 at 19.30 hours from Frankfurt, Germany. [But] Griessel-Landau did not leave as agreed, rather returned and demanded an additional $250.00, which Presley paid. A day later Griessel-Landau made a telephonic demand for 2,000 £ for the loss of his practice which he closed in Johannesburg, South Africa prior to his departure for Bad Nauheim to treat Presley." <i>...added 03:09–03:16 19 October 2006 by <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">User:Onefortyone</a></i></dd>

<li>If LJGL can be shown to have significance other than within a couple of pages of a <i>balanced,</i> reputable kilogram's-worth of Presley biography, let's see this significance.

<li>So you think the FBI files and a book dealing with these files are "NationalEnquirerPedia or HollywoodBabylonPedia". I see. This statement speaks volumes.

<dd>According to one of these accounts, Elvis was the victim of Laurens Johannes Griessel-Landau of <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannesburg.html" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, who was hired by the singer in <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Nauheim_8a12.html" title="Bad Nauheim">Bad Nauheim</a>, Germany, as an alleged specialist in the field of <a href="../../../d/e/r/Dermatology.html" title="Dermatology">dermatology</a>, but had made <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> passes at the singer and his friends. When on 24 December 1959 Presley decided to discontinue the skin treatments, Griessel-Landau endeavored to extort sums of money from the singer. According to the FBI files, Griessel-Landau "threatened to expose Presley by photographs and tape recordings which are alleged to present Presley in compromising situations." An investigation determined that Griessel-Landau was not a medical doctor. Finally, "By negotiation, Presley agreed to pay Griessel-Landau $200.00 for treatments received and also to furnish him with a $315.00 plane fare to London, England." After having "demanded an additional $250.00, which Presley paid" and a further "telephonic demand for 2,000 £ for the loss of his practice which he closed in Johannesburg", the blackmailer departed to England.</dd>

<p>If you created the page to avoid an edit war then why did you keep trying to reference Landau (linked to the article you had written) on the Presley page? Why does your new edit not mention that Landau was mentally unstable? The Presley had two women with him during treatment? Regardless, this is a trivial issue (other then making read through some very boring files) and is undeserving of both an article and a mention on the Presley page. <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochdale_5ee1.html" title="User:Lochdale">Lochdale</a> 01:53, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a crystal ball. This album doesn't even have a title yet. It hasn't been confirmed. The article itself seems to be speculation and original research: the author seems to have collected all of Kylie's singles that do not appear on other albums and put them together as a possible track listing. When the album is confirmed and/or released, it can have an article, but right now it simply doesn't merit one by Wikipedia standards and guidelines. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 17:58, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I have read about the track that the Scissor Sisters have written for Kylie and a News Limited article attached indicates that she has been recording see <a href="http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,20529221-5005381,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,20529221-5005381,00.html" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>. However, it is premature to have a standalone article on an album until we have a name and other details. For now, a mention on the <a href="../../../k/y/l/Kylie_Minogue_fac0.html" title="Kylie Minogue">Kylie Minogue</a> album that she is recording an album should be sufficient. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 06:01, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That source states: <i>No one's in a rush to do a whole album now. We're making progress, developing sounds, gearing up again</i>. Why would Wikipedia have an entire article based on that statement? It sounds as if work hasn't even begun. That statement makes the vast majority of the article pure speculation - a valid and verifiable article on the topic would merely state: "Kylie is making progress on her forthcoming album." This one goes into a rather lot of speculation. Why not just merge that line into the singer's article? <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 17:32, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Because this article will exist sooner rather than later.

<li><b>Comment</b> - under that rationale, you could have an article like this for any existing notable band or artist. I can't help but feel that would get messy. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 21:23, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's kind of faulty logic. There's no way of knowing if a band is going to hit it big.

<li>Not really faulty logic - every currently popular act and band that is not going to break up will have another album and is usually planning on studio time to put it together.

If you would like more information on this candidate, then you can check out the links on the article that will direct you to his campaign website! --Gtorresjr 18:40, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>DO NOT delete.</b> Dr. Sekhon is a Colonel in the United States Army Reserves. He is also the democratic candidate in the 2nd Congressional District of California. He is mentioned on the wikepedia page for Wally Herger and since Wikepedia serves as a site for people seeking information it only seems logical to include his information here so that voters can look him up and find information on him. I do not think that it is a controversial issue to include his bio and website info in this database. --User:Aks1015

<li>I just tried to edit the article to conform to the guidelines by inserting more outside, third-party verifiable sources to lend credence to Mr. Sekhon's notability and expand upon the scope of his contributions and work outside of this election, but the page cannot be edited. What do those editors who are advocating deletion recommend to make the article more valuable and to save it from deletion? The discussion on candidates and elections, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Candidates_and_elections" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Candidates_and_elections" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>] clearly indicates that the fact that a candidate has not yet been elected is not, in and of itself, grounds for deletion.--Khalil78 20:02, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with this last posting. I have several articles that talk about Mr. Sekhon's campaign as well as him being a community advocate, which would make his article safe from deletion. --Gtorresjr 20:05, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Khalil78, that is a <i>proposed</i> guideline. It has no particular relevance yet except as it applies to the established guidelines. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">This</a> is the currently accepted guideline for notability, and although it provides a link to the discussion it does not support the proposal. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 20:11, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Kafziel, according to the Notability Criteria as set forth in [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BIO" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BIO" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>], there are some alternative test that Dr. Sekhon's current article will meet. According to the Google Test layed out in [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Google_Test" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Google_Test" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>], Dr. Sekhon does appear on numerous "distinguishable hits." I can already predict your counter-argument in stating that such test is a <i>proposed</i> test and that there is no consensus on whether this google test is fully supported, I am working with the guidelines spelled out by Wikipedia. Thanks. --Gtorresjr 20:32, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, it's not even a <i>proposed</i> test. It's just an alternative way to check for your own information, and holds no weight in actual deletion discussions. Essentially, the reasoning is that you can buy your way into Google, but you can't buy your way into Wikipedia.

<ul>
<li>Ok, I just went and checked. Only 541 Ghits, and it the top 40, not a single independent news source providing any article covering this candidtate.

<li>Those that know and understand American Politics (which I am sure is discussed to some extent on this site), should know that once a person loses in his or her party's primary, that such person is no longer in the race and is not part of the General Election. Since Mr. Falzett is no longer in the race, this could be why people are not responding to Kafziel and Vectro's desire to delete Falzett's article. --Gtorresjr 21:53, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Gtorresjr, I would like to point out it takes very little effort to delete an article that is not notable. Even when people create multiple accounts so they can vote more than once, this is easily ignored due to the website's record keeping system. Do not think we are terribly inconvenienced by this article's passing. We still have time to weed out other innapropriate articles.

Our only fear should be that candidates would use Wikipedia to promote their campaigns.

It's of historical interest to see who the major candidates were, regardless of who wins. That yields insight into the policital climate and dynamics of the day.

<p>Article is about an unreleased film by a notable director. I originally nommed for speedy, but was contested because director is notable. Since the article states that copies are hard to find and that it was unreleased, details about the film are going to be difficult to verify. The film is already mentioned in the directors article.

<p>This article is about the Physical Sciences School of Jawaharlal Nehru University, not about 'Physical Sciences'. There is already an article called "Physical science" and a redirect "Physical sciences" (note capitalization).

<li>The problems with this article can be solved by first renaming it to <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jawaharlal_Nehru_University_School_of_Physical_Sciences_9323.html" title="Jawaharlal Nehru University School of Physical Sciences">Jawaharlal Nehru University School of Physical Sciences</a> (adjusting the resultant redirect) and then merging it into <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jawaharlal_Nehru_University_2e5e.html#Schools" title="Jawaharlal Nehru University">Jawaharlal Nehru University#Schools</a>.

<li>The first ref lists it in a footnote, and provides no information.</li>

<li>The third reference, on page 58 of 59, states that the 350 is an upgraded Scarab, and old-technology decoy, hardly the high-tech secret stealth plane the article talks about. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 22:13, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>one thing,TheArbiter-our class did not try so hard on this-our class is trying so hard on this. we won't stop until it is either deleted or we can keep it!support me!Sharku828 I agree with TheArbiter-not everyone may know that adams middle school even exists-like my family. we just moved this year and did not know about adams middle school. someone may be looking at the rubsd site on wikipedia and will see the link to adams site- then they can learn more about adams.it not like we are putting the entire adams website on wikipedia-and it is still being made. its kinda hard though-people keep vandalizing it.we have been working so hard on it at school-this is the first time making a web page for almost all of the class. please don't delete it.

<li>I sugest not merging the article with <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redondo_Beach_Unified_School_District_6949.html" title="Redondo Beach Unified School District">Redondo Beach Unified School District</a> because that article links to the pages about schools in that area, If someone had the time they could rewrite that article and put in all the schools mentioned into it. But I doubt anyone would because its fine right now... TheArbiter-- Try to make this more formal, look at some other middle school wiki's, this would help you understand how make this formal. If this doesnt have a major edit, i would say this should be deleted... Anyway, most school have their own website, if you want to make one about the middle school ask a teacher...</li>

<p>I think that our article is okay for the first time of our doing a wikipedia page...we are currently working on it, so it will get better. myself, i am making a part that has pictures of the classes and the campus.that was what "life at adams" was going to be-it was not done when it was deleted.Sharku828 01:29, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Let me just say that what is important is the consensus among all Wikipedians, not among schoolwatch this is a very <b>alarming statement</b> and not at all in the spirt of wikipedia goals.

<p>Something to say about the arguement above is the fact that to complete the <b>Redondo Beach Unified School District</b> page is the fact that <b>all</b> the schools would have to be merged to make the page complete, and that would make the page too long to be practical. thats one thing to think about. another is the fact that merging the page would take an extremely long time to merge it, and the page would seem awkward without the other schools, relating to the arguement as stated by myself above. to make the <b>rbusd</b> site seem complete, you would have to <b>make</b> a page for the schools that do not have a page, and merge the ones that do have a page, and as said, it would be too long to be feasible.Sharku828 17:46, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> There is no sourcing. The "related link" has the earmarks of a nearly dead site: a forum with 17 members, no articles, no active topics, a top download with 6 hits, etc...

<p>The result was: there's no dispute over the facts here (that he's a third-choice player for Atalanta), only over whether those facts make the guy notable, so this is one of those things that comes down almost entirely to opinion. And 4-2 is just short of the weight necessary to be defined as 'consensus'. <b>No consensus</b>, then. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 15:37, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I hope you're kidding. There's nothing more to say about this guy than "He is the third goalkeeper for Atalanta". He never played a pro match, and maybe he would never play in Serie A.

<li>In Italy, you don't register first team members, as it happens instead for UEFA competitions. Theorically, even a 15-years-old kid can play Serie A, if he has a regular contract with that club. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelo.romano_5e58.html" title="User:Angelo.romano">Angelo</a> 01:15, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>....and if he did so I would venture to suggest he would be notable enough for a WP article <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 07:21, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>...but in this case every single player signed by a Serie A team, no matter his age, should have an article in Wikipedia.

<ul>
<li>I think that any player who has <b>played</b> in Serie A should have an article. Players who haven't played a first-team match should be assessed individually based on how likely it is that they might play for the first team. Obviously Maldini's son would not fall into this category.... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 11:17, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, this is not the case. This guy named Ferrari is the third-choice goalkeeper, as he is the Primavera youth squad goalie (very common fact in Italy): but if you know football, you probably also know it's very unlikely for a third-choice goalkeeper to appear in a league match. For instance, <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valerio_Fiori_4413.html" title="Valerio Fiori">Valerio Fiori</a>, the third-choice goalkeeper for AC Milan since 1999, played only one Serie A league match, in 2002/2003. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelo.romano_5e58.html" title="User:Angelo.romano">Angelo</a> 11:32, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>But he is registered in the sense that he has a squad number (and the number 1, no less), no? <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtVandelay13_daad.html" title="User:ArtVandelay13">ArtVandelay13</a> 18:47, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, but there's no limit in squad number registrations in Italy; you can assign a free squad number to a player whenever you want, and there's no maximum limit of registered players by the way. They are announced weekly <a href="http://www.lega-calcio.it/ita/Varmagli.doc" class="external text" title="http://www.lega-calcio.it/ita/Varmagli.doc" rel="nofollow">here</a>; if you take a look there right now, you'll find out they are all unknown players.

<li>But the question is not so much what they can do, as what they have done. And Atalanta have seen fit to give him the number 1 shirt. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtVandelay13_daad.html" title="User:ArtVandelay13">ArtVandelay13</a> 22:51, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>We are a burgeoning poetic movement, soon to be as important as any that ever existed. I'm not sure how something can become "notable", but we've already covered a large area of North America, Australia and Europe with these broadsides. That's pretty dang notable. We are a real entity, a revolution in publishing and poetry, and since we are "underground" and do this under the cloak of subversiveness, we will not have any "non-trivial coverage in independent reliable sources". At least not yet. Delete us if you want. that's fine. but, we will be back. And, when you venture to your local bookstore (assuming you read books) and find one of our broadsides, will we then be legitimized? will we then be notable? -- The GPP. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.143.187.254 (<a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.143.187.254.html" title="User talk:209.143.187.254">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.143.187.254_a5e4.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.143.187.254">contribs</a>).</small>

<p>screw it. delete it. we (the GPP) need Wikipedia like polar bears need sweaters. as for Melchoir setting me straight on the whole article vs. self identity crisis, thanks bro. you must forgive me as us artistic types get so confused sometimes. i once wrote a poem about a bird i saw and i swear, for three weeks, i identified myself with that bird. i WAS that bird. i know NOW, that i am not this article, and that it is the article and NOT i that will be deleted. you don't know how relieved i am. infinite thanks. on a related note, does the sarcasm meet the civility code? if not, does Melchoir's smug jab? just a clarification on whether smugness and/or sarcasm is tolerated or not. if so, on either count, i'll definitely be back.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.143.187.254 (<a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.143.187.254.html" title="User talk:209.143.187.254">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.143.187.254_a5e4.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.143.187.254">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I'd argue against the deletion of this article. The group consists of a number of notable and prolific underground poets from Luis Berriozabal, Miles J Bell, christopher cunningham and others who are published widely on the net and in the small presses. Google the names of the members and you'll get a lot more than 39 hits. I'd also argue that Google isn't a good standard to judge whether a movement is 'notable.' A large number of poets are not internet savvy. Particularly because underground literature, which is a growing movement, works in direct opposition to traditional mainstream methods, you aren't going to find a lot of media coverage in the easy to find places like Google or newspapers. Is Wikipedia just a mirror of what Google thinks is important?

<p>I just checked the site and many members are notable in the small press poetry world. Some of the publishers involved have books exibited in the Museum of Modern Art and the Getty. Some of the poets are very widely read and published by some big New York poublishing houses. Look at the site and google the names. I say to let them stay.

brother, if that sarcasm was rude, and NOT civil, then we're in a world of hurt as a society. as for the smug jab; it was both, but I assume you knew that. the use of the word "theoretically" is sarcastic (and rude) and just as smug as anything i said...but I assume you knew that (again). LitLives is right. Gold help us. as for us not doing the organization any favors, what does that mean? hmmm.... there's no arguing against the deletion of this article with smug, sarcastic, rude people who don't even know (or acknowledge) when they are being smug, sarcastic and rude. theoretically, they should know the difference. delete it, already.

<dd>But it's so much fun to insult wikipedia! It's easy to pick apart, because at its core it's just a bunch of geeks in an old-fashioned usenet-style argument wankfest. Nothing important is being done here, unless you consider disinformation important. I do in many ways, so what wikipedia has become is amusing to me, but no one should take the entries here seriously. Anyone could go poke around for five minutes and find a dozen inaccuracies, but we all know that.</dd>

<dd>What's funny about the wikipedia cult's benchmark for what is "notable" is that the thing itself is only marginally notable. I know that many of you believe that you are doing Good Work, but you are delusional. You aren't editors - that's an insult to real editors - you have simply memorized a lot of someone else's rules, and you use your access to a computer to make sure a bunch of other people follow them. This is an anthill, and you are worker ants. When you drop dead the other ants will just eat you and continue marching.</dd>

<p>Irish Guy, With all respect, What you like and don't like does not matter. We do not need your support and would not welcome you into the group. We are CREATORS, not DESTROYERS. It seems that your big issue is proving that others are not "legitimate" while subverting the very same Encyclopaedia by changing history to show that Ireland is not part of the British Isles. Why, because YOU hate the British. That is territory for a blog, but a serious encyclopaedia. Can the information in this encyclopaedia be trusted as accurate? Well, that all depends on what "editor" changed it last to show his point of view is notw accurate. Not really an encyclopaedia in the real sense of the word. Also, the blog was posted when we were attempting to save the "article". We leave it there for our MANY, MANY members to see as an example of why we are doing this. Also, it will be nice when Wikipaedia cannot ignore the movement and they are forced to recognise it. It is kept up as history. We are a serious movement and are notable regardless of what "editors" at Wikipaedia can understand or not. Deletion af a one page "article" cannot change that.

<li>Wikipedia should consider enlisting persons with some sort of expertise in the subject matter of the article when assessing the significance of that article if there is any grey area in determining its "significance". In my own experience, one of the artist's that I published wrote an article about my small artist's press for Wikipedia. It was subsequently deleted, as it was seen as having been made solely to publicize that artist's efforts (which, perhaps, it was, as I can't know his motives). What I found very aggravating was that an argument over my press' "significance" became part of the Wikipedia record, when I certainly didn't ask for any such critique and had nothing to do with Wikipedia in the first place. In assessing this "significance", it seemed that the jurors' only understanding of the word "press" was a large commercial publisher. It seemed that noone who was responsible for making this decision knew anything about printmaking, the fine arts press, the small press, or any other relevant subject relative to the decision. Anyway, my point being, that to use a uniform yardstick for "significance", especially in areas related to the arts, wielded by people with little understanding of the various venues, means of distribution, and history of practitioners within those arts, will eliminate anything that is at all contemporary from Wikipedia. Only the most corporate, mass-produced, and ultimately insignificant products of contemporary culture will find homes here, because that's what will be most prominently displayed in Google. Polling a few folks who have no relation to the project, yet have some expertise concerning the small press and the poets involved, as to the significance of this particular movement would be the most sensible thing you could do. FimpressMarc, Fiji Island Mermaid Press</li>
<li>IrishGuy, your "forum" example is a prime indicator of how you so-called "editors" work: you make a decision based on INCOMPLETE information. the forum at the site is NO indicator of the movement's size; just look at our <b>2 month old</b> MEMBERSHIP RANKS for that info: 70 members. which is it? so you choose the evidence that supports your frail claim of NON NOTABLE and expect us to agree? plus, if you have any inclination, you can google some of the member's NAMES and find out exactly how notable we actually are. but you won't. and I stand by my ACCURATE assertion that you are a MST3K geek. check out my recent post at the blog where I compare you to the geek on the UK OFFICE. funny stuff. although I myself enjoy tom servo and crew on occasion..remember, we are about uniting artists and thinking, feeling people who seek a larger vision in re: art, poetry and human connections. so far you've evidenced none of these traits in your stubborn refusals, my rule monkey friend...&lt;---not rude, amused, see? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.215.167.172 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.215.167.172_b857.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.215.167.172">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>Of course Marc is right. And Irish Guy, I said that you had a slanted point of veiw towards the British as I have read many of your posts. You may not have said that you HATE them, but it is clear that you do. You also said that as you have more contact with GPP members, the less you are "attracted" to us (see your post above.) As far as the members that called you names, that was not me. I always sign my posts with my IP or my name. Finally, The GPP was started 60 days ago with 10 memebrs, we now have over 70. Some of those names are not only big names in the small press, but well known actors, Media personalities, etc. One of our members is an actor who is listed on your very site. The fact is that we do not need to make our membership roles open to Wikipedia to prove that we are an important organization. If there was an "Editor" from Wikipedia that was familiar with this type of poetry, you would have heard of us.</p>
<p>Finally, as marc stated, you do not have the knowledge to know what we are doing. That is not an attack, just a fact. Just like I would have a hard time judging who is a well known Irish majician and who is not. There are ewperts in that field who know who is and who is not. The point is that I would not assume to tell others that a personality or entry was not significant BECAUSE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT. Ask ANYONE in the small press poetry scene AROUND the globe and they know who we are. They know our movement, and they know many of the individual members. Many of our members are often published writers and are known throughout the world. By the way, please don't associate all comments from all members as mine and I won't associate all comments from other editors as from you.

<dd>Saying that I disagree with using the politically charged term <i>British Isles</i> to encompass Ireland which isn't British is nowhere near the same ballpark as saying that I dislike the British.

<li>IrishGuy, I'm sorry you've never seen MST3K, that show is funny as hell. anyway, enough of this garbage. WE INSIST YOU DELETE THIS PAGE AT ONCE. we're not gonna do it, YOU DO IT. and DO IT NOW. no further discussion. NOTHING ON WIKI IS EXPERT as it can be VANDALIZED. this is a waste of all of our time. we're real, and we exist and we're notable, and we're growing AGAIN at a <b>700% rate</b> so SCREW THIS, PLEASE. DELETION FOR THE GPP! it's What's Right, you silly geeks. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.215.167.172 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.215.167.172_b857.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.215.167.172">contribs</a>).</small></li>
</ul>
<p>To restate the request.... Please delete the page. We are not interested in being included in the Wiki project. I can safely way, Irish Guy, that I know that you do NOT get small press poetry. You may pretend that you do, but if you did, you would know who we were. The fact that you do not and rely on Google to see who we are, means that you do not know anything about the subject that you are claiming to want to control. That is all that need be said. I know that your type likes to argue. Frnakly, it has become very boring to me. I'll end this by saying that while you are making enemies, I'l be printing poetry and trying to CREATE. Again, in case youdid not get the point. Tell the folks at Wikidia to delete us. We do not need your website to be a movement that is notable and it probably works against us even being listed in a such a website.

<dd>I didn't put this up for AfD. I placed the importance tag on the article which you removed. That caused it to go to AfD. The guidelines state that the article must illustrate verifiable notability <i>within the article</i>. Hence, my placing the tag on the article for the authors to provide this information. That never happened. That means either your organization doesn't care enough, or there is no verifiable information to add. That is why my original statement in this AfD was: <i>importance tag was removed without any sign of notability being given within the article.</i> No, you cannot safely say anything about me as you don't actually <i>know</i> anything about me. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 21:37, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>IrishGuy, Please do what you want and go ahead and have Wikipedia delete the "article". I'm done fighting with you. I have been polite to you, yet you want to fight.

<p>Whoever wants to read this, I'm not sure who blanked it, but it was not me. Since you (IrishGuy)kept telling us that we were not notable enough to have an "article" on your "website", we decided that it was not worth it to argue with you and beg you to be on a site that would do us no good anyway. So, I guess one of the other members did it. We don't need the red tape. If Wiki decides that they want to have us listed, they know where we are.... In the mean time, we will subvert the corporate bookstores with fine literture and grow at a FAST rate as has happened in the last 60 days. Funny thing is that the 'bots' noticed that the article was deleted and restored it. Please, anyone in the GPP, let's let them delete it. I could care less if they remove it, but I say that we should let them remove it. It would really be funny if Wikipedia decided that IrishGuy was wrong and ignred his recommendation to remove us. Either way, I won't lose a wink of sleep either way. It is just fun to watch. Signed, as always... Bill/GPPBospress 21:06, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also to Wikipedia, I'm not very computer literate, but I see 387 google hits under "guerilla poetics project". These are references to our work from websites (many are NOT members) from all over the world. They know of the movement and the organization and are talking about what we have done and continue to do. If you google some of our member's names, you willl see tens of thousands of references, including some that have articles on your very site. "S.A. Griffin" is only one example. Google "justin.barrett", "Christopher Cunningham", "Hosho McCreesh", "C. Allen Rearick", "Glenn W. Cooper", "Bottle of Smoke Press" and you will see we are not expecting Wikipedia to be a crystal ball. You should see that these names are some of the biggest names in the small press poetry scene, bar none. I can give 30 or 40 morre names that would qualify, but I have only listed a few that are involved with this literary movement. All best,Bill/GPPBospress 21:20, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>SO IrishGuy, I guess that you don't trust your fellow "editor" Guy to report the links correctly? What wold make you think that he is wrong? Or are you just making the statement as a point of argument? The fact that you said "There is no reason at all to assume that 15 more links showed up on a couple of days." just shows that you have an axe to grind and everyone is wrong, BUT you. What would the original "editor" GUY have to gain by giving false information. The fact is that there were 15 more links in 5 days and as much as IrishGuy does not want to believe it, everyone else sees it for what it is. Just a guy with an axwe to grind. How sad...

<p>IG, 1) You called me a "poet", not an author. 2) You don't know my last name. If you did, you would see that I am not listed as an author, either. 3) There is not a page that lists "authors".

<li><b>Comment</b> The article has been deleted as a copyright violation. I have added the material on Hoch's 2001 and 2003 honors to the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancaster%2C_Wisconsin_d4ad.html" title="Lancaster, Wisconsin">Lancaster, Wisconsin</a> article. In my opinion, a State Coach of the Year is not notable enough to justify an entire article, but it definitely takes him out of the rank of ordinary high school coaches, particularly considering the size of Lancaster. His achievement is an important fact about Lancaster, Wisconsin and I'd like to thank User:Schmitz33 for adding the fact to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:02, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article is a neologism and presents the terms from a minor (and unreferenced) social theorist as a full-blown theory.
