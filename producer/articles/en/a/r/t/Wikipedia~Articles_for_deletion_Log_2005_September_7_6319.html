If the article were pared down to this one noteworthy fact and a paragraph or two of biographical information, I think it would be appropriate.

<li>Weak Delete: It's marginal, but the question that it fails, to me, is whether this is a proper <i>biography</i> rather than <i>incident.</i> Is this person, as a person, notable? Is a biography necessary/useful? It's close, but I'd say not. Instead, it seems to me that he is curious and that the article itself is actually about the eccentricities rather than the man. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:05, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Somewhere down the line, some day, someone will ask the question that nominations such as this beg: does it actually do any harm to an encyclopaedia of the size and scope of Wikipedia to include well-written articles on people of marginal interest or is that actually what makes this project worthwhile? If the idea was simply to create a rather inaccurate and poorly written version of Britannica, would half of us be here? Is it simply a vanity project for geeks and nerds who don't get out enough? I can't believe that. I believe we're here to create something grand, not just a collection of "useful" biographies or articles about what we personally feel is "notable" or "important". It's rather saddening that that view is not widely enough held that nominations such as this aren't just laughed out of the place. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:42, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's sad to me that there are still people trying to dissuade VfD nominees, that there are still people whose standard is merely that it is in coherent English. A beautiful essay on your MUD avatar is not encyclopedic. If you believe that we are here to <i>please ourselves,</i> then your vision of what a reference work is is fringe. I think we're here to be <i>of use</i> to researchers, to serve. The hypothetical someday when the hypothetical someone comes along who doesn't seek this person in the context of his SC argument but solely by <i>this particular variant</i> of his name is not sufficient to vote "keep." Euphony is a false god, and Wikipedia is not Everything2: it is not a project for self-expression. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 10:40, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Normally I would agree with you, but you didn't answer the question at all: What harm is there in having a well-written article on a subject of a borderline interest level? --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyan_Delaney_8333.html" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 19:43, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>My answer about harm is that, of course, harm isn't really the criterion. However, if pressed I <i>can</i> demonstrate it. The article establishes that this person is known by 2-3 names. His major activities are 1) a court case, 2) pounding at a keyboard. So, how is this information going to be retrieved? Where is it going to do some <i>good?</i> Secondly, how much of a context is he generating for himself? The court case is a court case and should be discussed in that place alone; how it was won by an untrained guy is marginal, and this biography doesn't give us any reason to believe that his victory is a <i>sign</i> of anything or part of his character or an attribute of his life -- he just did it (and none of the issues are mentioned). As for slapping a keyboard, that's what I refer to as fiction about fiction: it is an ephemeral event in an epiphenomenon of a series of conversations that have taken place. We don't feel like writing the biography of the chatterbox who goes to every departmental meeting and won't shut up: we want the biography of the guy who goes to the departmental meetings and sets policy or changes the elections. What I see here is a biography of a life that isn't given any reason and a memorializing of someone whose accomplishment is prolixity. The harm is that a common name space is primarily occupied by a largely irrelevant person. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:07, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Just because it does no harm does not mean it is necessary to include the information in Wikipedia. Sloan is an interesting character, but does he truly merit an article, particularly an article that contains so much pointless trivia about his life? There is a difference between "interesting" and "notable". How does an bio of Sam Sloan contribute to "creating something grand"? By your criteria Grace, we might as well start including people like Abdner Ashman because I'm sure someone, somewhere, feels that the World record holder for Ms. Pac-Man is a notable person...</li>
<li>I empathize with Grace Note's comments, but wonder if this opens the door for self-promotional biographies. Is the test for notability how colorful and fascinating of a biography that you can write about yourself? --<a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a> <big>ॐ</big> 21:19, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's a pretty safe this article is going to be kept based on the votes here.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> and <b>Cleanup</b> This is an odd article indeed: a bio of a notable (or at least borderline) person that's just overflowing with trivia, with a death of actual encyclopedic info.

<dd>Clarification: I don't mean to say that DirectNIC is not notable, or that using something like "Bouncy" to let you know that a stream is live isn't a good idea, just that "Bouncy" itself is not notable. I would have said merge, but the article (at the time that I listed it for deletion) didn't have hardly anything worth merging. The content there now could be a start for an article on DirectNIC (or similar.) By the way, 500 people knowing about it isn't really a phenomenon (and I'm one of those 500).

<li><b>Delete</b>. Has the phenomenon of 'bouncy' really taken off _that_ much? I can't say i'd ever heard of it until today. Bouncy could be perhaps mentioned in an article somewhere on wikipedia, but I don't think it needs it's own entry. Also, I don't really think 'bouncy' can possibly be applied as a general term to webcams, seeing as the article mentions it refers instead directly to the No Signal message on the monitor at the back of the webcam image. <a href="../../../k/y/e/User%7EKyelewis_5db9.html" title="User:Kyelewis">Kyelewis</a> 06:22, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

A handful of determined folks are managing to keep a large swath of the Internet viable while literally camped out on the 10th floor of a dead office building in a dead city. That's worth a page.

<p>I'm that "anonoymous user", now logged in from same IP. And I'm going to modify my vote again, to clarify: keep the content, move it to another page (I take it Wikipedia doesn't support page renames?). While the page title is wrong, the topic is encyclopedic; very few <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disaster_recovery.html" title="Disaster recovery">disaster recovery</a> events are captured in public sources at this level of detail, and Wikipedia's current base of material is painfully thin on this topic. Enterprises consider this proprietary information, leaving practitioners (myself included) in the lurch when it comes to third-party reference material. For example, I worked on a WTC-related recovery, learned a great deal, but can't publish. Grab this material while it's there, put it on another page, encourage more editors (that "to be deleted" banner is a stigma right now) and do it soon, while the sources are still available. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevegt_b569.html" title="User:Stevegt">Stevegt</a> 01:03, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Bouncy is not just a screensaver or a random collection of pixels. Rather, Bouncy refers to the ideology of normalacy in a time of extreme duress. As NOLA fell into lawlessness, as basic rules of civility werestripped away as quickly as were basic utilities, as the city was besieged by both water and fire while its residents fell over the breaking-point, the bold professionals at DirectNIC succeeded in keeping at least a little corner of the city connected to the world. Bouncy may refer to the screen saver that was the team's mascot, but for those thousands of us who were glued to the news and video feeds that came out of that small office, Bouncy was a symbol of the need to "do as we are doing" and stay the course.

<dd>I'm a little confused here. It looks like you blanked the text, but without putting up a copyvio tag, which complicates things. If it's copyvio, it should have a copyvio tag and go to the copyvio resolution page, rather than here in AfD. I'm not sure why you blanked the text, because that means that technically we are evaluating (for AfD purposes) a fundamentally empty article. Yes, the text can be recovered from the history, but we're supposed to be voting on the article as it presently exists.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> deleting good but different articles like this one is like trying to delete the heart of wikipedia. (by User:Bandraoi, who forgot to sign... inserted by Janke)</li>
<li>Keep: Trivial but valid. The term has fairly widespread coverage, although this is one of those articles that attracts the obsessive crowd, and the wiki- structure means that it can become a tangle in an instant. The term may be fan coined, but it has been used by the creators of the form (incl. <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Jones_f96e.html" title="Chuck Jones">Chuck Jones</a> in his autobiography, <i>Chuck Amock</i>). This differs, IMO, from the fictions about fictions and goes on to critical observation (when it isn't just degenerating into "list of funny stuff I've seen in cartoons"). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:21, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I wouldn't call this subject "trivial". These laws have been de facto "working rules" in animation for well over 80 years now - and just because they are funny, and make a Wikipedia article funny, isn't a reason for AfD, if you ask me. This is as serious as a treatise on a painter's tools, brushes, canvas, oils etc. But you are correct that this might grow uncontrollably - it sure needs to be watched.

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b>.</s> Re: "the person has been 'highly successful in their sport' (since a country is allowed only 3 entries per event)": Did the Jamaican bobsled team on which a Disney movie was based really consist of the twelve best bobsledders in the nation, or just a bunch of people who found it interesting; i.e. was there even a selection competition? There are several thousand athletes every Summer Games, and a few thousand more every Winter Games, most of whom will never gain enough widespread media coverage to merit articles in the English Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 19:49, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Reply: You're mistaken to keep looking only at an international basis. Also, the large athlete count includes many large teams (probably with bench warmers), and I would be happy to say that not every player in a team warrants inclusion. Your allusions to "English Wikipedia" is something I strongly object to. The *only* thing English in English Wikipedia is the language *we* the editors use. Notability requirements for inclusion are wholly unrelated to language. In fact, we should bend over backwards, to realize that as English speakers, it's harder to judge a non-English person's notability. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 22:30, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> I was working from some assertations I'd seen veteran editors make in VfD (now AfD) discussions. I just went looking through policy pages, and don't see much in the way of "must have notability among speakers/readers of English"; the closest I found is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Sources_should_be_in_English" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability#Sources_should_be_in_English</a>. Since there are no sources linked nor cited, I can't judge their language. "... defeated in the round of 32" tells me <i>not notable within the field of Olympic athletes</i>. I have no idea of his fame and significance in <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>. If earlier informed voters had given assertions that Ngernsrisuk was the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jordan_c952.html" title="Michael Jordan">Michael Jordan</a> of Thai badminton, I would have held my vote awaiting verifiable citations. As is, I'll skip language matters and rely on the basic <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies</a> point: "Has the person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in the specific field?" No change in vote, but I'm willing to be persuaded if someone provides the verifiable documentation required by WP's fundamental policy. I agree that editors and AfD voters are often too centered toward the USA or the "western democracies". <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 23:51, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: The quote you made is for dead people. For living people, who are athletes, the standard is "highly successful in their sport".
<ul>
<li>Actually, an easier standard: "Athletes who are widely known, widely acclaimed, or highly successful in their sport". Sam Vimes below has provided an event that Ngernsrisuk <i>didn't-quite-win</i> and a world ranking, with sources. I don't know how significant the Thailand Open is among the international badminton community or among the Thai general public, and I don't know how noteworthy 26th in the world is among either group. For comparison, I was recently 41st of 83 in the World <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplomacy_%28game%29.html" title="Diplomacy (game)">Diplomacy</a> Championship, with players from 8 of the 20 or so countries with active Diplomacy hobbies, but I'm not asserting notability for me. <b>Vote withdrawn</b>; I'll leave it up to people with more cultural context and who care more. I still don't think that Olympians are automatically notable even if they don't get past the round of 32 teams. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:44, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> This discussion has already taken place, and as far as I can tell the very person calling for a delete is the same person who vandalised both the Martin Williams entry and the Pagan Association entry. Pettiness and spite are not seen as valid reasons to delete pages. I do agree with the handfasting comment and have removed the link to this.

<li>Before you slander me further, I'll have you know that I have never visited the Pagan Association entry, and did not vandalise this article. I don't think either of you appear to be worth an article. That's why I put this article up for deletion.

<dd>Thanks for not telling me, you listed the page here for deletion, Cedar-Guardian! Very nice of you, but then your style is not my style, whatever... There are a lot of pages like the one we are talking about... "Delete, delete, delete... " but - what's the matter? Can somebody tell me precisely? It says <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a <b>mere</b> repository of links. And the policy page says why: "Excessive lists can dwarf articles and detract from the purpose of Wikipedia." Tell me what's wrong about having special pages for this purpose. And if you give reasons for deletions don't come me with "redundant" or "not notable." That's totally stupid here. Doesn't apply, think better. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMale1979_76fc.html" title="User:Male1979">Ben</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMale1979_96ca.html" title="User talk:Male1979">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Male1979_fd02.html" title="Special:Contributions/Male1979">C</a> 15:52, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</sub></dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Crossbreeding between neandertals and homo sapiens sapiens is at least controversial. It should not be presented as fact. The reality of genetic halflings itself seems doubtful. Not grounds for deletion as such, of course, but unless some supporting information can be found, I'd say delete this as an invention.</li>

<li>Sure. Most Wikipedians remove suspected linkspam on sight. The point I wanted to pin down is this. I read your original comment to mean that he <i>acknowledged</i> that the creation of <i>this article</i> was a conscious act of self-promotion. That's not quite true. He acknowledges systematically <i>linkspamming</i> Wikipedia, but does not actually acknowledge that <i>this article</i> is spam. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:54, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I assume Women's Basketball must have been a demonstration sport in the 1972 Olympic Games, as the first medals awarded in that event were in 1976 (according to <a href="http://www.olympic.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.olympic.org/" rel="nofollow">the IOC</a> anyway) <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 22:04, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>But I just checked David Wallachinsky's massive <i>The Complete Book of Olympics</i> which should have mentioned about 1972 if basketball was a demonstration sport, but it doesn't. This book lists all the teams that took part in Women's basketball between 1976 and 1992 - India isn't in any of them. I was suspecting that she could have taken part in 1980 when the big teams boycotted, that 1972 could be wrong and some copywriter might have taken the 1972 from Vece Paes and attributed it to Jennifer. That doesn't seem to be the case. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintin1107_b710.html" title="User:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> 00:14, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I do find it somewhat amusing that the only page I've ever had VFDed is one that gets put up after I've <i>corrected</i> it... It's pre-Usenet slang, and not significantly used there - couple of thousand hits - so nn usenet slang is a bit of a misrepresentation. Borderline as per Barno whether it's notable or not (though it's interesting to see that it spread into fanzines generally); if it is deleted don't see any reason not to transwiki it. It's not a term I'd particularly use, though I encounter it relatively often, but am loathe to claim notability through that... hrm. Hrm hrm hrm.</li>

It's specific Usenet and Internet-nerd slang and claiming that "excitement through the achievement of a free service" is unique of "sf fandom" is such a narrow view that it has to be viewed as pure and unadultarated POV. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 07:44, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note the sourcing provided in the current version of the article, in which the definition reads: <i>rush received from public recognition of a free contribution, probably derived from "ego boost"</i>. (<i>"Rush"</i> is not the right word, but "<i>excitement"</i>doesn't fit either. Nor does <i>"Pride"</i>fit the meaning.) I have not claimed that it was exclusively used in SF jargon, and I don't think anyone else said that either. I meant that it is in wide use in fandom and has been for many years, according to references around <b>fifty years</b>. To say that it is specific to Usenet could be considered to be a narrow view that if it does not exist on the internet, it does not exist. (I don't think anyone meant that either, but it could be taken that way.) Remember, many SF fans are also usenet/internet fans... Like me.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree. Almost 6 months ago, I personally added a link to TrueAggie.com (as its a housing resource for students) to the bottom of the Utah State University article. I'm an admin on TrueAggie.com, but DID NOT add anything other than one link to one article. In May this year and since then, one particular IP has consistently spammed the link usuaggies.com on to every article having to do with logan, utah or USU, and in the process aggrandizing itself within the articles by claiming to be a primary news outlet for students. Further, this same IP (and one other) consistently (every day or two this month so far) purges all references to trueaggie.com and puts links to usuaggies.com in its place. I believe its fine for references to usuaggies.com as well as trueaggie.com - by why is one side so biased? In no edits have I ever removed usuaggies.com links or references. I've edited it - correcting the fact that that site is not the secondmost media outlet serving USU, but that the comm departments own website does more than usuaggies.com and that usuaggies.com is a private editorial board. This article is, as mentioned above, vanity - and should be considered spam. The IP 216.190.35.218 and 66.219.228.90 should also be blocked as their users have violated several wikipedia policies in its users personal vendetta and promotional efforts. --ncmlnr August 4, 2005</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. While Ncmlnr is correct in several of his arguments they are not germane as to whether this article should be deleted. It was certainly poor etiquitte of whoever deleted the TA links and put the USUAGGIES.COM links in places that weren't topical. I sympathize with Ncmlnr and his frustrations. Both links should co-exist and are very relevent to USU. However, immature behavior on other pages of adding and eliminating links does not change whether this particular page is relevent to USU. It, like TA, is a site that is used by thousands of students. At other schools, such as byu, the domain byucougars.com or utahutes.com is owned by the University. This page is helpful in identifying what USUAggies.com is as well as who is (and is not) responsible for it. Further, the activities and discussions at USUAggies.com are helpful for outsiders looking to get a feel for what the political and social climate is like at Utah State. Also, FPO is making the allegation that this particular IP is a "competitor" (ie the owner of USUAggies.com or a contributor). While this is likely, the conclusion is at best circumstantial, and until a definate link can be made the allegation should be retracted. The action could have been done by anyone for any reason.--PDek August 4, 2005</li>

<li>PDek, I do agree with some of what you say, specifically that the article does identify what usuaggies.com is and isn't, and who by. I don't agree that what I discussed above does not pertain to this particular article. Wikipedia policy seems to say that a users editing history, etc., will be used to indicate intent of vandalism, spamming, etc. I posted the above facts to demonstrate that the same IP that created this article, also went on a link spree and vandalized articles by deleting other's additions. As a final note, one IP in question is registered as belonging to a DSL customer in Logan, Utah - a radio station and the admin of USUAggies.com works at a radio station&#160;:-). The other is registered to another ISP that is credited (by the admin of usuaggies.com himself) with providing the wireless broadband at the apartments that the admin of USUaggies.com manages and lives at. Hmmm...strong link? yes. Proof? not absolute.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe it should be under the self-promotion, vanity and spam guidelines of wikipedia. But, notice that I took no action myself to delete or remove (except once as an agreement to fpo that both should be removed if one was!) usuaggies.com links or this article, except voicing my own opinion and offering facts to this discussion and correcting info about the number and prominance of news outlets at USU within pertinent articles. Still DELETE --ncmlnr August 5, 2005</p>
<p>UPDATE - the admin of USUAggies.com called me today, and mentioned that he had no knowledge of the happenings on the wikipedia until recently, and has talked with the one (those?) who made all the changes. He believes that both sites contribute and should both be relevant to USU. I agree. I would recommend KEEPING if the article were written by a 3rd party or re-written, and the contributor did not show malice towards other sites / article content and others contributory edits. Such would negate the "historical edits" context, and make the arguement on the article itself as pdek suggested, not on the authors promotional, spam-like and even wiki-vandalism efforts. --ncmlnr August 5, 2005</p>

And I'll agree that the evidence seems to point to someone's efforts to promote usuaggies.com. This behavior is certainly inappropriate and the offending contributor(s) should be blocked if possible. However, the users are anonymous and not registered. Blocking IP addresses is very blunt way to solve the problem since it might block other users. Even so, I'm reluctantly in favor of blocking the offending IPs because the bad behavior is so consistent, systematic and spread across multiple pages.<br />

About deleting the Wikipedia USUAggies.com page: Is a small, private Web site really a legitimate subject deserving its own page? Should every similar Web site be entitled to its own Wikipedia page? Is USUAggies.com an important and notable part of university life at USU, or is it just a small, here-today, gone-tomorrow Web site? Should one user be allowed to liberally ad links to this small private Web site on all the pages dealing with Logan, Cache Valley, USU and many of the pages dealing with Utah? I don't really know the answer to these questions, but my gut feeling is that it's no more deserving of a separate page on Wikipedia than thousands of other, small private Web sites. On the other hand, the Wikipedia USUAggies.com page isn't the real problem, instead, it's the ongoing, blatant promotion and vandalism perpitrated a certain user. — <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaylett_1b3a.html" title="User:Maylett">Maylett</a> 03:55, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This is a <i>very</i> poor AfD nomination IMO. The BBS in question started in 1983 -- making it one of the earliest in the world, back when 300 baud was considered blazing -- and ran until 1999, quite a stunning longevity. Take a look at the first google hit <a href="https://lists.wi2600.org/pipermail/2600/2000-September/001370.html" class="external autonumber" title="https://lists.wi2600.org/pipermail/2600/2000-September/001370.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>.</li>

<dd>The fact that the nominator considered the inclusion of a phone number "advertising" when the BBS no longer exists makes me wonder if he actually read the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> --<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlogBuilder_0a63.html" title="User:BlogBuilder">BlogBuilder</a> 00:50, 8 September 2005 (UTC) I apologize as I'm relatively new here. I'm also the author of the article, though I realize that it may not warrant inclusion in wikipedia. I read through the criteria for VFD several times, and I don't see this as a particularly obvious case for deletion. Please do correct me if this is a stupid comment or if I'm violating the norms of wikipedia. Here's my rationale for why this article merits inclusion. Just because this person isn't well-known doesn't mean she isn't influential; in fact it is the decisions of the people behind the scenes who shape public discourse as much as those on the boob tube. While there's a great deal of public information about those in front of the cameras, there's a lot less information about those behind them, in part because of a bias against learning about the influential but non-famous. This is a serious information problem that I would hope we could correct. Over the next few days I'll track Google hits on this person's name. Should they increase dramatically I'll vote to keep this article.</li>

But the article and its external links don't even identify the controversial guest. I would expect more people to be interested in the guest himself than in the person who booked him. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 05:59, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- It is irrelevent whether their goals are a <i>pipe dream</i>, impossible, or that they are goals which would make them famous (if their efforts would in the future be considered important). A company's intent to some day make a settlement on mars does not make an article about that company encyclopedic, any more than a person stating they would like to travel to mars makes a biography about that person encyclopedic. <i>Is the company a well-recognized or popular name?</i>. If the company is not otherwise notable, it shouldn't have an article, <i>just because of its intent</i>, not until <b>the company's effort</b> or <b>attempt</b> has become noted, or enough of their efforts, their plans, method, etc has been publicized so that their very efforts have become a well-known or important subject: notable failures <b>are</b> encyclopedic, but 4Frontiers has neither succeeded nor failed.

This appears to be the most well-known person on <a href="../../../t/h/e/Laguna_Beach%7E_The_Real_Orange_County_aa90.html" title="Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County">Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County</a>, a national (albeit cable) TV show. From reading about this reality show, it's not a contest, and she's not a contestant. This isn't <a href="../../../f/e/a/Fear_Factor_7909.html" title="Fear Factor">Fear Factor</a> or a vote-off show. This reality TV show covers her life, and those around her, on an ongoing basis. She's lasted for more than just one season (which is the normal max for reality shows). There was no basis for the nomination whatsoever. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 05:34, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Abstain</b> Yes, there is a basis. I abstain insofar as I don't think reality show actors belong but that a recurring role on the show raises her above others. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 08:22, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. She is a star of a reality tv show and while many people might not like reality tv or its casts, it does make psuedo-celebrities out of people. In her case, a major cable channel, MTV, has chosen to chronicle her life for entertainment on television and even sells the series in dvd form. That certainly warrants a article on the person in question, imho. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriGold_7a2c.html" title="User:AriGold">AriGold</a> 14:55, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It seems to me that appearing once on late night TV is not by itself notable. How popular is this TV show?

I considered speedying this as an "article which consists only of attempts to correspond with the person or group named by its title" but decided it didn't quite meet that criterion. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:43, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
