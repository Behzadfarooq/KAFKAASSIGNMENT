<p>World's Smallest Record Label</p>
<p><br />
"Before I would just upload my stupid music to the internet. Now I make business card cds and force people to buy them." - Skeeter</p>
<p><br />
Here's My Card Records is a new label that exclusively releases business card cds. 5 minutes of music for $2.</p>
<p>As people's leisure time is quickly eaten away by the capitalistic hegemonic behemoth death machine leaving people with enough time to mow the lawn or do their laundry. That coupled with the complete oversaturation of all media has led to a bit of dilemma</p>
<p>The desired result of A (music) reaching B (music listener) is now close to impossible. Relying on the belief in an undergroud music utopia where quality rules over quantity just does not cut it any longer. Here's My Card Records operates on a formula that successful negates this dilemma. That formula is Quick and Cheap.</p>
<p>We at Here's My Card Records are always interested in hearing new music for potential release. We are willing to check out URLs to mp3s, but please keep in mind that Here's My Card Records is primarly an underground electronic music label, so please no trance.</p>

<p><b>Seed hibernation</b>, also called <b>seed dormancy</b>, is the ability of a <a href="../../../s/e/e/Seed.html" title="Seed">seed</a> to remain in <a href="../../../h/i/b/Hibernation.html" title="Hibernation">hibernation</a> when there is a lack of something they require (<a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunlight.html" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a>, <a href="../../../n/u/t/Nutrient.html" title="Nutrient">nutrients</a>, etc.) or in harsh conditions (extreme cold, extreme heat, hard ground, etc.). There is not a specific time limit in which a seed may hibernate; some seeds found in the arctic grew after an estimated 10,000 years. When conditions are right for the particular type of seed, they can come out of <a href="../../../h/i/b/Hibernation.html" title="Hibernation">hibernation</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germinate.html" title="Germinate">grow</a>.</p>
<p>Seeds display hibernation for very short periods of time every <a href="../../../y/e/a/Year.html" title="Year">year</a>. In <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autumn.html" title="Autumn">autumn</a>, seeds produced in <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer.html" title="Summer">summer</a> may have a chance to grow while the <a href="../../../s/o/i/Soil.html" title="Soil">soil</a> is still warm, but instead do not grow until <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring.html" title="Spring">spring</a>. The seeds have chemicals encoded into them that will not allow them to germinate until the soil warms up again, a sign of spring. This is called <i>after ripening</i>.</p>
<p>Seeds may go into hibernation for other causes. Many pines have adapted to forest fires that destroy trees by creating pine cones that open in extreme heat (<a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire.html" title="Fire">fire</a>) and release seeds coated with a material that will break down only in extreme heat. The seeds hibernate until this happens.</p>
<p>Seeds of the <i>Canna Lily</i>, and other plants, have a hard coating that must be broken down by contact with rough <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock.html" title="Rock">rock</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/i/Soil.html" title="Soil">soil</a>, etc. before they begin to grow. Until the shell is broken and water reaches the seed, the seed remains dormant.</p>
<p>Some seeds (especially those in a <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert.html" title="Desert">desert</a> <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environment.html" title="Environment">environment</a>), when released, must wait for rain before the seed is triggered out of hibernation and begins to germinate.</p>
<p>There are many other causes of dormancy. It is an unclear phenomenon; the limits of seed hibernation are still unknown, and many triggers have yet to be discovered.</p>

<p>Harriet Frishmuth is best known for her animated sculptures of dancing women, which were often used as fountain and garden statuary in the early 20th century. Although a native of Philadelphia, Frishmuth spent most of her childhood traveling and attending school in western Europe. When she was in her 20s, she studied for a brief period under August Rodin in Paris, then returned to the US and studied w/ several other sculptors, including Gutzon Borglum at the Art Students League. Unlike many other women sculptors of her time, Frishmuth was able to make anatomical studies from actual human bodies, which she saw during her weekly visits to the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York.</p>

<p>Melrose is a rural community located on the Eastern coast of Newfoundland (Lat: 48:28:35N Lon: 53:04:51W). Melrose has a rich history that is just waiting to be told. Once known as Ragged Harbour, legend tells it that this communtiy was soon visited by a great governor. While there are many Governors in the past who did great things for Newfoundland,an especially important Governor to Melrose's history was a man by the name of William MacGregor -- a Colonial and Dominion Governor from 1904 to 1909. Legend has it that this Governor is responsible for our community's name of Melrose! MacGregor was born in a town in Scotland called Townie, located near a second Scotish town known as Melrose. Liking the name Melrose very much,MacGregor called this charming community, Melrose. What is more, this tiny fishing community is home to a graveyard that dates back to the 19th century. In addition ot having a rich history, Melrose is also known for family fun. The Melrose Annual Farm Festival, for example, is a 2 to 3 day tradition that is great fun for the entire family; full of activities for the oldest right to the youngest. This festival celebrates our past and our furture with live music, great food and carnival games.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-01_2c4a.html" title="Edit section: Seamus(Seamie) O'Dowd">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Seamus(Seamie) O'Dowd</span></h2>
<p>Born 28/03/1968 Singer, musician (fiddle, guitar, harmonica, mandolin)</p>
<p><br />
Seamus O'Dowd began playing music at about eight years of age by taking up the fiddle and learning from his parents Shiela (Regan) O'Dowd and renowned fiddle player father Joe O'Dowd. He started going to competitions and music sessions making contact with and learning from other musicians. A few years later Seamus, along with his father , was a regular of the music sessions in a Sligo venue called the Trades Club where he could hear musicians from all over the world, other parts of Ireland and of course, from Sligo.</p>
<p>Seamus was also playing mandolin, fiddle and bodhran but it was through the guitar that he started to explore his interest in rock and blues. Sligo's diverse music scene enabled him to get involved with musicians from electric rock, acoustic bluegrass or country blues. Himself and Sligo bass player Donal Cunnane spent a few years playing in various rock and blues bands from Sligo, appearing on national radio and playing all over Ireland. By this time, mid to late 80's, Seamus used to play an odd gig with a traditional band with no fixed name yet. They were Shane Mitchell, Liam Kelly, Brian McDonagh and Michael Holmes who went on to be the backbone of the group 'Dervish'.</p>
<p>Shortly after, Seamus and fellow Sligo guitar/singer Gerry Grennan formed a duo that encompassed a wide range of acoustic music from bluegrass, Irish traditional and ragtime to blues and acoustic rock. They toured Ireland and Germany, sometimes as a trio with a mandolin/guitar player from Co. Roscommon called Brendan Emmett. Seamus learned to play the harmonica by this time and began to play more traditional Irish music. He joined a Celtic rock band called the D.T.'s, an energetic but short-lived band that took Sligo by storm with the piping of Jarlath McTiernan (Sligo) backed with a powerful electric band.</p>
<p>After the D.T.'s split up, Seamus started to organize music classes. In early summer 1998 he joined 'Dervish', but with the subsequent addition of Tom Morrow's fiddle playing to Dervish melodic front-line, Seamus began to play more guitar as well as harmonica and fiddle. He continued to play with them until 2005, when he decided to trade the international music scene for a more domestically based career, where he still gets to excercise his varied abilities as a support, session and accomplished solo musician. He has also become adept at musical production, which has been used to great effect most notably on Mary McPartlands CD 'The Holland Handkerchief', and on his own recent 'Headfull Of Echoes' CD.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Influences:</p>
<p>Early influences in Seamus musical life were his parents, exponents of the world renowned 'south-sligo' style of traditional music. He also got to learn from a group of Californian musicians living in Sligo, where he heard Appalachian, American folk and Irish music played by them. They were called Pumpkinhead and they consisted of four musicians, Sandi Miller(mandolin), Kathy Moore(Auto-Harp), Rick Epping (concertina, and a leading figure in Irish harmonica) and renowned singer/songwriter Thom Moore(voice and guitar). Thin Lizzy and the legendary Rory Gallagher, also made their mark. Another major influence is Scottish folk legend Dick Gaughan</p>

<p>Chris Maiden, a young man hailing from Swinton, South Yorkshire is a very "unique" induvidual. He currently spends most of his days as a student Graphic Designer And Photographer.</p>
<p>Twice winner of the Rotherham Garden Society, it would be very modest of us to say, Chris is a very respected young man throughout the community, as you can tell, he is a keen garderner, with very green fingers. In early 2006, a "scandal" involving Russian brides almost wrecked the young mans reputation as a respectable member of the community. Various other scandals involving his sexuality circulated his college.</p>
<p>A movie is in the making that documents the life of this amazing induvidual, set for a Summer 2006 release by the independant film makers Bradshaw&amp;McGarrigle, the early makings of the film have alreadly landed it a place at this years Cannes Film Festival in the Southern city of Lyon, France.</p>

<p><b>Apparent death</b>: In case of absence of heart beat (tactile / audio) and of breathing (movements / air flow) it is possible, that somebody believes, the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">death</a> occured. In some deplorable cases that assumption is false (if this happens to a doctor of medicine in F.Rep.GERM this could result in criminal prosecution). It is safer to continue <a href="../../../c/p/r/CPR_4e3f.html" title="CPR">CPR</a> until death signs show up (e. g. 20 minutes until <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livor_mortis.html" title="Livor mortis">Livor mortis</a> shows up or 10 minutes of <a href="../../../a/s/y/Asystole.html" title="Asystole">Asystole</a>).

<p>Saproxylic insects comprise a diverse, species-rich and dominant functional group that share a dependence on dead wood and the old trees that generate it (mature timber habitat). Recent research has highlighted their sensitivity to forest management, with managed or secondary forests generally supporting fewer individuals, fewer species, and different assemblages compared to old-growth or primary forests. This sensitivity is a product of their association with a habitat that tends to diminish in managed forests. Many species also have low powers of dispersal relative to human-induced fragmentation, making breaks in habitat continuity particularly harmful. In western Europe, many species are now regionally extinct. Information is largely lacking elsewhere, but similar ecological and management principles should apply. Measures taken to protect the habitat of hollow-dependent vertebrates may ensure the survival of some saproxylic insects, but unless their needs are expressly considered, there remains the risk that many others may be lost as forest areas shrink and management of remaining areas intensifies.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-01_2c4a.html" title="Edit section: [Philippe Herreweghe]">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">[Philippe Herreweghe]</span></h2>
<p>Philippe Herreweghe was born in Gent. In his hometown he combined studies at university (medical science and psychiatry) with a musical education at the conservatory, where Marcel Gazelle was his piano teacher. In the same period he started conducting and in 1970 he founded the Collegium Vocale Gent.</p>
<p>Very soon, Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Gustav Leonhardt noticed his extraordinary musical approach, and invited him and the Collegium Vocale Gent to join them in their recordings of the complete Bach cantatas.</p>
<p>Gradually, Herreweghe‚Äôs vivid, authentic and rhetorical approach of baroque music was praised everywhere and in 1977 Herreweghe founded another ensemble in Paris, La Chapelle Royale, to perform the music of the French Golden Age. Since then he started several other groups and ensembles with whom he managed to bring an adequate reading of a repertoire stretching from the renaissance to contemporary music; the Ensemble Vocale Europ√©en, specialised in renaissance polyphony and the Orchestre des Champs Elys√©es, founded in 1991 to bring alive, once again, the repertoire of the romantic and pre-romantic era on original instruments.</p>
<p>Together with these ensembles Herreweghe built up an impressiv and diversified dicography. Highlights are the recordings of Bach‚Äôs vocal masterpieces (St.Matthew‚Äôs and St.John‚Äôs Passion, the B-minor Mass and the Christmass Oratorio.); the major French motets by Rameau, Lully and Charpentier&#160;; the requiem masses by Mozart, Faur√© and Brahms; Mendelssohn‚Äôs oratoria ‚ÄúElijah‚Äù and ‚ÄúPaulus‚Äù; ‚ÄúPierrot lunaire‚Äù by Sch√∂nberg.</p>
<p>Philippe Herreweghe is frequentely invited as a guest conductor with ensembles like the the Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam, the Vienna Philharmonic, the Stavanger Symphony Orchestra, the Gewandhaus Orchestra from Leipzig and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1997 he also became the musical director of the Royal Flanders Philharmonic Orchestra. Furthermore, From 1982 till 2001 Philippe Herreweghe has been artistic director of the summer festival ‚ÄúLes Academies Musicales de Saintes‚Äù.</p>
<p>For his consequent artistic vision and perseverant commitment towards music Philippe Herreweghe received numerous signs of recognition. In 1990 the european musical press elected him ‚ÄúMusical Personality of the Year‚Äù. In 1993 Philippe Herreweghe and the Collegium Vocale Gent were appointed ‚ÄúMusical Ambassador of Flanders‚Äù. A year later he was granted the order of ‚ÄúOfficier des Arts et Lettres‚Äù, and in 1997 Philippe Herreweghe became Doctor honoris causa at the Louvain Catholic University. In France he was granted the title Chevalier de la L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur in 2003.</p>

<p>"There Are Many Flags" is a children's patriotic song, written by Mary Howliston. The song is performed in many elementary schools.</p>
<p>Here are the lyrics;</p>
<p><i>Verse 1</i></p>
<p>There are many flags in many lands, There are flags of ev'ry hue. But there is no flag however grand, Like our own Red, White and Blue.</p>
<p><i>Chorus</i></p>
<p>Then hurrah for the flag, our country's flag. It's stripes and white stars, too. There is no flag in any land, Like our own Red, White and Blue.</p>
<p><i>Verse 2</i></p>
<p>We shall always love the stars and stripes, And we ever shall be true. To this land of ours and the dear old flag, Our own Red, White and Blue.</p>
<p><i>Chorus</i></p>
<p>Then hurrah for the flag, our country's flag. It's stripes and white stars, too. There is no flag in any land, Like our own Red, White and Blue.</p>

<p>This is a collection of what other celebrities have said about <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>. AJ (singer; Backstreet Boys) He is what every artist looks up to...to be... one time become the next King of Pop. [source: Pro7; World Music Awards 2000]</p>
<p>Dr. Eugene Aksenoff Just last month I saw Michael Jackson again. He was in Japan with his children. Prince, his 15-month-old son, had high fever and cramp. Michael had not slept the whole night. He's really devoted to the children. [source: Reuters; August 1998]</p>
<p>Anastacia (singer) Actually, when Michael Jackson called, it was all leading up to the fact that when I did the show "The Cut", which was the star search kind of show, I was proposed to by a lot of record companies being interested in wanting me to sign with them. In the process of all those meetings and stuff, I was meeting with MJJ, so it was inevitable to meet the presidents of all of these labels because I was starting to get to that point. Michael Jackson was one of these people that I had to meet, as well as Tommy and Bob Jamieson and the presidents of all the great record companies, so it really was a professional situation. It wasn't like "I'm a really big fan and I want to have you autograph everything that I own", it was a phone call of admiration from a performer to a performer, as a president to an artist wanting to be signed, as an artist looking at what a label has to offer, it was that kind of conversation, but what a light conversation! He was laughing, I was laughing, we were having a great time. It was so wonderful to be able to speak to him. He's so inspiring and what a genius! Forever I'll remember that I got to speak with him on the phone. If I never get to meet him or even work with him in the future, it's the beauty of being able to be recognised by something like that. [source: Radio Undercover]</p>
<p>During an online chat Anastacia did at MSN she was asked which artist would be a dream come true for her to work with: "There's so many. I think any artist would be a dream, but it would fulfill a dream to be on the stage with Michael Jackson." [source: Anastacia]</p>
<p>David Arquette (actor) I remember when I first saw the Michael Jackson "Thriller" video. I couldn't believe that a guy would go out and put so much into a video, and the zombies and all that stuff. I believe it had a solo impact on my decision to be involved with the "Scream" movies. [source: MTV; March 2000]</p>
<p>Fred Astaire (dancer &amp; actor) You are a hell of a mover. Man you really put them on their asses last night. You're an angry dancer. I'm the same way. I used to do the same thing with my cane...You're a hell of a mover! [source: The day after seeing MJ perform at 'Motown 25']</p>
<p>Dallas Austin (songwriter/producer, worked on 'HIStory') Working with Michael is a different type of work. You're pressured timewise, but not by creativity or money. So you're left with mad freedom. You'd think he'd be very controlling, but if he likes you enough to work with you, he wants your expertise, not just another Michael Jackson record. "Heal the World" and "Stranger in Moscow" from the HIStory record are, like, the makeup of Michael. I think he's taken on the responsibility to make changes in the world. He's the only real superhero. Think about it. [source: VIBE magazine; June/July 1995]</p>
<p>Jennifer Batten (guitarist on several MJ world tours) He completely changed my life, you know, I was doing the L.A. club scene, just trying to make ends meet and BAM - I'm on a paid vacation around the world having just the time of my life playing in the biggest band in the world. And yeah, I'll always feel an intense gratitude and love for him for that. [source: Entertainment Tonight; July 16, 1997]</p>
<p>Tracy Bingham (actress) Question: What are you looking forward to tonight? Tracy Bingham: Actually, you know what...I have never ever met Michael Jackson. I love him. And just being in the same room as Michael Jackson is enough for me. So I can't wait to see him. [source: Pro7, World Music Awards 2000]</p>
<p>Rabbi Shmuley Boteach We talk about everything from love and relationships to spiritual healing. I have great admiration and respect for Michael. From what I gather, he is very unfairly represented. His kindness strikes me more than anything. He is extremely interested in spiritual things. I‚Äôve been to Michael Jackson‚Äôs home and I‚Äôve given him lessons from the Torah. It‚Äôs not that he is interested in converting. He just has avery admirable interest in learning. When I speak with Michael about Judaism, he just wants to hear more and more. It‚Äôs not that I am such a great teacher. It is his sincere curiosity. I don‚Äôt think you should judge Michael by his eccentricities. Who isn‚Äôt eccentric? [source: ABC News, CNN, WENN; October 1999]</p>
<p>BoyzIIMen (R&amp;B group) We share his concern for the children who have been innocent victims of war and, who have suffered because of the horrors of war, many of whom are without families, food or homes. We applaud Michael for his sensitivity and efforts. [source: Universal Records Press Release; July 1999]</p>
<p>Brandy (singer) Michael Jackson, he is just like; he is the king of it all. Everything that everyone's doing now, he's already done. He's opened a lot of doors for a lot of artists today. [source: VH1's special "100 Greatest Artists of Rock &amp; Roll"; May 1, 1998]</p>
<p>Garth Brooks (country singer) With that numbers stuff [record sales], you just have to take it with a grain of salt. Yeah, you feel proud, but the true guy in you has to say 'Come on ... You're not really on the level of the Beatles.' For me as a fan ... the Beatles, Michael Jackson, you can stick Elvis Presley in there, James Taylor, Billy Joel and 100 more guys in there that I think are on a level Garth will never get to 'cause I'm such a huge fan of these people. [source: Reuters; May 1998]</p>
<p>Naomi Campbell (supermodel/actress, appeared in 'In the Closet' video, 1992) Michael is very involved and on top of everything he puts his name on. He's shy and sweet, considering all he's accomplished, but he's a prankster. When I was doing the video, we had water pistol fights. He's a perfectionist. [source: VIBE magazine; June/July 1995]</p>
<p>Niel Rogers Chick Michael has always been one of those artists that I personally cannot believe. I can't believe how great he is, and I quite frankly have always been in awe of Michael's talent. [source: VH1's special "100 Greatest Artists of Rock &amp; Roll"; May 1, 1998]</p>
<p>Ice Cube (rap artist) [About the 'Thriller' video:] I was glued, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I would just sit there and wait days and days and days to see the "Thriller" video again. I couldn't wait to see it again from start to finish. [source: MTV; March 2000]</p>
<p>Macaulay Culkin (actor) In an interview published in the New York magazine, actor Macaulay Culkin described Michael Jackson as among his very best friends in the world. "We had very similar experiences in childhood. We're both going to be 8 years old forever in some place because we never had a chance to be 8 when we actually were." They first became friends when he was 9 and he and his family were invited to Neverland. Culkin said, "It was a child's dream, with every kind of soda in the world there, every kind of candy. A two-floor arcade, a carnival and a movie theater"</p>
<p>"Neverland is still the only place on earth where I feel absolutely, 100 percent comfortable." [Source: New York magazine May 7,2001]</p>
<p>Dalvin DeGrate (Soul/R&amp;B group 'Jodeci') Michael is my favorite artist. I formed my harmonies and melodies based on his music. [source: Billboard; April 2000]</p>
<p>Kevin Dorsey (HIStory tour assistant musical director) He is such an open person when it comes to his creativity, umm, he expects nothing of us that he doesn't expect of himself. [source: Entertainment Tonight; July 16, 1997]</p>
<p>Missy Elliot (rapper) I don't look at it as he is not the hottest thing any more - I look at what he's done as a groundbreaking artist who opened a lot of doors for black acts. Michael Jackson is still amazing to me. [source: Entertainment Weekly; November 1999]</p>
<p>Kenny Gamble (producer on the Jacksons' 'Destiny' album, 1978) When we took Michael in the studio tooverdub his voice, he had so many different ideas about songs, writing, and producing, I told him he could really record himself. He was very curious about a lot of things. He's a creative, spiritual, caring person. Nineteen eighty-one's "Rock With You" is the most what Michael's about. I really believe he and Quincy have a magic together. Michael is a miracle. [source: VIBE magazine; June/July 1995]</p>
<p>Genuwine (R&amp;B singer) If it weren't for Michael Jackson, a lot of us wouldn't be here. People talk all this junk about Michael, but he's cool with me. He opened a lot of doors for the rest of us. [I] knew what I wanted to do this the night I saw Michael Jackson on the 'Motown 25' TV special. He's the one that made me realize that was what I wanted to do. [source: September 1997]</p>
<p>M.C. Hammer (singer) Just a phenomenal artist, the [word] speaks for itself. You don't go much beyond Michael Jackson when it comes to performing and making good records. [source: VH1's special "100 Greatest Artists of Rock &amp; Roll"; May 1, 1998]</p>
<p>Mary Hart (co-host of 'Entertainment Tonight') It's a pretty awesome experience to watch him rehearse. He knows exactly what he wants and how to get it. He's very much in charge. [source: while visiting tour rehearsals in Pensacola, Florida; February 1988]</p>
<p>Heavy D (label executive, rapped on 'Jam,' 1991) I was in California the first time I heard Michael Jackson wanted to record with me. I was, like, Nah, no way, he's too big, it can't be true. Then I got a call from Michael's people at my hotel telling me he was interested. But I still wasn't believing it-I thought they were setting me up for a TV practical jokes show. So me and my partner go to the place, and while we were waiting we were talking and cursing up a storm-I was thinking that if it was a blooper show, they wouldn't be able to use it. Then Michael called and said he was on his way. When he got there he was just, like, `Hey, how ya doin?' Michael's just as regular as everyone else. We talked about all the normal stuff guys talk about. He's real smart. People forget that he's the most incredible entertainer we've seen in our lifetime. His name is Michael Jackson, not Super Michael Jackson. He makes mistakes just like all of us. My favorite Michael Jackson song is "Music and Me." It's an old one, about him and his music, his love for music, and the time they've had together. It's like a song that would be sung to a girl, but it's all about music. [source: VIBE magazine; June/July 1995]</p>
<p>Darrin Henson (choreographer) Question: Did you go to a dance school and if so...where? Darrin Henson: No, I studied all Michael Jackson's videos and that is how I got my moves.</p>
<p>Question: Darrin, has it been intimidating to work with people like Prince and Michael Jackson? Darrin Henson: No, Prince is a great dancer and a great person. He knows what he wants and can move great. Michael is also a great dancer. He loves to listen to the moves and then, in seconds, he is dancing just like you want. [source: Monday Night Backstage Chat at Voice of Dance; 2000]</p>
<p>Andy Hernandez (rock group 'Kid Creole &amp; The Coconuts') As a performer who believes in injecting high energy into a show, I can appreciate more than most what goes into the making of a Michael Jackson performance. The dictionary should contain another word that means 'great, superb, professional, energetic, entertaining' and that word should be 'michael-jackson'. [source: after attending a concert of The Jacksons in Philadelphia; September 1984]</p>
<p>Cynthia Horner (editor of 'Right On!' magazine) He's usually quiet and rather humble. However, it may sound strange to say but people feel energy drwaing from him, almost as though he's endowed with superhuman powers. People are usually so struck by him that they cannot even speak. Indeed, Michael weaves a magic spell over his fans. Michael seems to be more open and outgoing around children, especially those he knows very well. Michael Jackson on stage is as good as it gets! [source: after being backstage at a concert in London; 1988]</p>
<p>Leon Huff (producer on the Jacksons' 'Destiny' album, 1978) When Michael and his brothers first came to Philadelphia, Gamble decided to walk them from the hotel to the studio. As they were walking, they were rushed by a group of girls. The brothers escaped by going into a movie theater. Once they made it to the studio, these girls camped outside the studio-and this was for a six-month period. To see 100 girls laying outside a studio at 3 and 4 in the morning for Michael and his brothers was something else. My favorite Michael song? Nineteen eighty-seven's "Show You the Way to Go." [source: VIBE magazine; June/July 1995]</p>
<p>Jerry Inzerillo (US millionaire &amp; hotelier, long-time friend of MJ) While the artistry of Michael Jackson is so celebrated... his empathy is not recognized as much as it should be. [source: October 1997]</p>
<p>John Isaac (photographer) It's all lies. A lot of it, they just make up stories and that bothers me, and I am sure it bothers Michael so much. [source: Entertainment Tonight; July 15, 1997]</p>
<p>Janet Jackson (singer, MJ's sister) Some days ago he had someone send me an enormous basket, full of candles (he does it all the time) with, in the middle of it, two magnificient dogs. It was adorable! We have been brought up like that: We are trying to find our places but we adore each other. [source: press conference in Paris, France; August 25, 2000]</p>
<p>2001 - Janet Jackson spoke about brother Michael in two interviews that aired in spring of 2001: Prime Time Live, and MTV Icon. Janet speaks about her family, Michael as a father, and the life changing advice she received from brother Michael. We have excerpted portions of these interviews.</p>
<p>Jimmy Jam (producer/songwriter) Michael's the most intense person I've worked with. For him, everything is about the music and how to make it better. He also makes work a lot of fun. He's a kid at heart-his office is not like a normal office. He has all the kids' toys. A lot of times we'd be in session, in the middle of playing a video game, and he'd be, like, "Well, we got to do this. But go ahead and finish your game, though-I don't want to mess your game up. The thing about Michael is his talent. If you put Michael onstage without the explosions and the other dancers, he'll still command the stage. There's a song called "Childhood" on the new album, and I think for the first time, Michael has put a lot of his feelings on record. That song, for right now, defineswhere he's at-the way he feels about himself and the way people feel about him. [source: VIBE magazine; June/July 1995]</p>
<p>JC (singer, 'N Sync) I would love to record something with Sting or Seal. We all dream of recording a song with Janet or Michael Jackson. [source: dpa; February 2000]</p>
<p>Rodney Jerkins (music producer) I was a huge fan of Michael since I was a little kid, I followed his career...everything he's ever done........He is the best, there's no other artist at his level, and I worked with many, he is great to work with because he knows exactly what he wants. [source: April 1999]</p>
<p>I'm blessed to even be in the position to work with the greatest entertainer of all time. Just to be working with him is a phenomenon itself, you know, a dream come true. [...] You have people that grew up with Mike that wanna hear him do the "Off The Wall" and "Thriller" type stuff and we are gonna do that but at the same time I'm also trying to do things that kids of today, that don't know who Michael is, will understand. That he is the greatest.</p>
<p>Interviewer: So, does Michael come into the studio with a surgical mask on? Jerkins: No, no. Michael is probably more human than any of us at this party. And that's what a lot of people don't know of. You know, I really know Michael. [...] So it's my responsibility to - we don't want to change that - you know. Not just be a producer in the studio but also be the friend to Michael and say: "Michael, it's cool to come to this party here tonight. It's cool to hang out with me, you know. They are not gonna bother you if you hang out here." [...] I've taken him to places where ... you know parties .. and a lot of people are coming up to him and it gets hectic and I understand why he kind of stays in. But at the same time, you know, he is feeling more comfortable to even step out now. [...] He is a good person. He is not what everybody wants him to be. They want him to be a wacko. You know how it is once you are so successful. They have to find where they can pull you down. He's not like that." [source: The Doug Banks Show; February 2000]</p>
<p>Elton John (singer, songwriter) He is a very smart cookie, Michael. He knows what he wants, he knows what he is doing. I have nothing but admiration. Also, he is a very kind person. [source: VH1's special "100 Greatest Artists of Rock &amp; Roll"; May 1, 1998]</p>
<p>Quincy Jones (music producer) Introverted, shy and nonassertive. He wasn't at all sure he could make a name for himself on his own. Neither was I. [source: Life magazine September 1997 special issue - "Life Legends: the Century's Most Unforgettable Faces"]</p>
<p>Michael can go out and perform before 90,000 people, but if I ask him to sing a song for me, I have to sit on the couch with my hands over my eyes and he goes behind the couch. He is amazingly shy. What people forget about him is that for the first time, probably in the history of music, a black artist is embraced on a global level by everyone from eight to 80 years old. People all over the world, especially young people, have a black man as an idol. [source: VIBE magazine; June/July 1995]</p>
<p>R. Kelly (singer/songwriter/producer, worked on 'HIStory') [...] I grew up with the music of Michael and I've been inspired a great deal by Michael. To actually have him call me up, call my management, saying he wants me to do a song for him was a great inspiration for me to go forward in my career. And up to the day I met him it was like a big countdown. I think it's normal when you grow up to the music of someone that has been there so long and is so large. To meet this person and knowing that this person depends on me. When an artist calls a producer he makes himself dependent on him to become # 1, to get something that comes out as a track. At this time, Michael Jackson depended on me to make something come true for him.</p>
<p>I remember a funny thing about him. I had ordered Chinese food and had put up all these Walt Disney cups all over the studio because I knew he was a big kid. I knew that. Everyone knew that. And I also got my little dog because I knew he loved animals. I couldn't afford giraffes, but I did have a dog. It broke ice and we talked. And I went to the bathroom and my manager came with me, and I remember that I fell to the floor because I just couldn't believe it. But I got back up and straightened myself out because I realized that I had to be professional. [...] It's always great to work with someone who is wonderful because they bring you forward. Michael was very humble. He also didn't wanna change anything. Some artists want to change songs so that they like them, but I don't go for that. I don't want to destroy the magic. I don't like messing with the magic and what you risk to reach something is what you need to keep it. Michael figured this also. [source: VIVA; October 1999]</p>
<p>I thought it was funny when I told Michael Jackson I didn't want to fly, and he was giving me reasons why I should. I kept looking him in the eye, and I kept saying "uh-huh, uh-huh" and "oh, I see," knowing all the time that I would not be getting on a plane. Working with Michael was definitely not just another day at the office. [source: VIBE magazine; June/July 1995]</p>
<p>Question: So it was cool working with Michael? R. Kelly: I was so nervous, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to finish the project. When he first got to the studio, something weird came over me. Michael was another level, and it was a hell of a level to go to. But passion took over, and it put a shield around me and allowed me to be just a normal guy who felt like he worked with Michael all the time. Question: Was he really receptive, or was he, like, "No, muhfucka, I've been doing this for 30 years." R. Kelly: He was never that. That's why he's been here for 30 years. He was more humble than me-got up under my wing. He wanted to know what it was I wanted from him. And if he could give it to me. Question: How did that feel? R. Kelly: Everything Mrs. McLin told me was true: I was born for this. I was ready. I didn't know that until I met Michael. My teacher told me when I was 15 that one day I would work with Michael Jackson, that one day I'd produce him, and that Quincy Jones would come to me for songs, and Stevie Wonder. I haven't worked with Stevie yet, but she told me these things would happen, and to see them come to pass is amazing. [source: VIBE magazine; March 1996</p>
<p>Jonathan King Michael should have swept the board. But, this year it was the A&amp;M and WEA record companies' turn to win and that's why Sting and Paul Simon got their awards. But you should have seen the look on their faces aftre Michael stole the show when he sang 'Man In The Mirror'. It was a look of absolute pure sheer horror. They were transfixed ny his real talent and mortified when they compared it to their own stars. It comes down to a choice between the music industry and Michael Jackson - and I'd rather have Jacko any time. [source: Grammy Awards; March 2, 1988]</p>
<p>Ed Koch (former mayor of New York City) He really is the supreme theatrical dancer - like Fred Astaire. [source: NY Post; March 1988]</p>
<p>Sean Lennon (singer - son of John Lennon) If it wasn't for Michael Jackson, I probably wouldn't make music now. Thriller changed my life completely." [source: 'US' magazine; October 1998]</p>
<p>Vincent Mantsoe (South African dancer/choreographer) I have always been inspired by TV. There used to be a ballet on Sundays, and I used to watch the Fame series and, of course, all Michael Jackson's music videos. But most of all, I have always been intrigued by The Dance Theatre of Harlem's Dougla; somehow it really got inside me, my mind. [source: South Africa's Sunday Times; February 2000]</p>
<p>Ricky Martin (singer) I need to thank my teachers. I need to thank the legends of pop. I need to thank Elvis, the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Madonna. Thank you so much for being leaders and teaching me the beauty of pop. [source: Reuters; while accepting an award for his hit "Livin' La Vida Loca" at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards]</p>
<p>Whoa, talking about Mr. Jackson, all my respects. He definitely has a lot to do with my career. He's the legend; El Maestro, you know? From him, we learn a lot, and definitely he will always be a part of my life. [source: MTV USA; November 1999]</p>
<p>All that I know comes from Michael Jackson. [tv interview on channel RTL9; Dec. 2000]</p>
<p>Jaqueline Kennedy Onassis (former 1st lady of US, editor of Moonwalk) What can one say about Michael Jackson? He is one of the world's most acclaimed entertainers, an innovative and exciting songwriter whose dancing seems to defy gravity and has been heralded by teh likes of Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly. His public is perhaps unaware of the extent of his dedication to his craft. Restless, seldom satisfied, he is a perfectionist who is constantly challenging himself. To many people Michael Jackson seems an elusive personality, but to those who work with him, he is not. This talented artist is a sensitive man, warm, funny, and full of insight. [source: forward from 'Moonwalk']</p>
<p>Tatum O'Neal (actress) I never worked with Michael, but he and I had a really wonderful friendship when I was 12 and he was 17. He used to dance with me, we'd talk on the phone all the time, and he'd say how funny it was that I was 12 and I could drive and he was older and couldn't. Michael used to come to my house when I was living with my dad, and I remember him being so shy. Once he came into my bedroom, and he wouldn't even sit on my bed. But another time when he was over, he played the drums, my brother played guitar, and someone else played another instrument, and we had a jam session. I had the tape of it, but I lost it somewhere. When I was 12, he asked me to go to the premiere of The Wiz with him, and my agent at the time said it wasn't a good idea, maybe because they felt he wasn't a big enough star yet. He never talked to me after that. I think he thought I just canceled, but it wasn't me at all. I was a child doing what I was told. I want you to print that, because I don't think he ever knew that. I lost touch with him because of it, so I don't really know him anymore. But I love him; he's one of the nicest, most innocent people I've ever met. I love "She's out of My Life" because I think it describes our friendship at that time. [source: VIBE magazine; June/July 1995]</p>

<p>Prince (singer, songwriter) Asked by a reporter if he could take Michael Jackson in a fistfight Prince laughed and quipped "Michael's not a fighter, he's a lover."

<p>All over America, millions of peole look up to you as an example. Your deep faith in God amd adherence to traditional values are an inspiration to all of us, especially young people searching for something real to believe in. You've gained quite a number of fans along the road since I Want You Back, and Nancy and I are among them. Keep up the good work, Michael. We're very happy for you.

<p>Teddy Riley (writer, composer &amp; producer, worked on 'Dangerous' and 'HIStory' albums) I wrote 'Remember the Time' when Michael [Jackson] told me about falling in love with [Debbie Rowe], the woman he just married. I don't know why he didn't marry her the first time around. [source: Los Angeles Times&#160;; December 1996)</p>
<p>He's the greatest. Innovative. Black. [source: VIBE magazine; June/July 1995]</p>
<p>Jessica Simpson (singer) Question: Who would you most want to do a duet with? Jessica Simpson: Some of my favorites...I was thinking about this the other day. Michael Jackson would be the ultimate. I wouldn't mind Celine Dion or Shania Twain, either! [source: Zoog Disney; June 26, 2000]</p>
<p>Slash (Guns N' Roses guitarist, played on 'Dangerous' and 'HIStory') He's a fucking brilliant entertainer, a complete natural. He's the only guy I've ever met that's real-for that kind of music. I grew up listening to the Jackson 5. I used to love "Dancing Machine. We've been friends for a while, so he just lets me do what I want to do. I get a basic framework, and I just make up my part and they edit it. I wonder sometimes what it's gonna sound like, [Laughs] but every time, they do a great job. He's very shrewd. He's got a great, sarcastic sense of humor. People always ask me, "Is he weird?" Well, he's different. But I know what it's like to be weird, growing up in the music business. I have to admit working with Michael Jackson is different than working with your basic, gritty rock 'n' roll band. One time when I went to play for Michael, he walked in with Brooke Shields, and there I am with a cigarette in one hand, a bottle of Jack Daniel's in the other, and my guitar hanging low around my neck. And he doesn't care. That's not the way he is, but I don't have to change for him. He accepts me for what I am. [source: VIBE magazine; June/July 1995]</p>
<p>Steven Spielberg (film director) Michael Jackson, the star, is a phenomenon. The hat, a single glove, white socks and black loafers. He is mysterious. Theatrical. The consummate performer. From the way he moves, to the Neverland he's created as his home, it's as if he's an illusion. The Michael Jackson I've had the pleasure of knowing for 13 years is without affectation, and is not an illusion. It must be hard for Michael to know how much the world wants to knwo him, to be like him, to consume him. He's wisely created his own world in which to preserve the most honest parts of his identity. Those are the parts we love the most. Michael has heightened sensitivity for the crying needs of this world. Through his Heal the World Foundation, he works to preserve this planet's most precious resources - children, and the environment. He feels much of the same responsibility a parent feels - his children are all of our children. Michael brings so much to so many, he is one of the world's most precious resources himself. Guided by his creative forces of passion, joy, work and genius, Michael has gone aftre his dreams and shared them with all of us. I can't wait to see where he chooses to take us next. [source: HIStory booklet]</p>
<p>Elizabeth Taylor (actress) Everything about Michael is truthful. And there is something in him that is so dear and childlike - not childish, but childlike - that we both have and identify with. [source: Talk magazine; October 1999]</p>
<p>Michael Jackson is, indeed, an international favorite for all ages, an incredible force of incredible energy. In the art of music, he is a pacesetter for quality of production, in the vaguard for high standards of entertainment. What makes Michael more unique may be the fact that all of his accomplishments, his rewards, have not altered his sensitivity and concern for the welfare of others, or his intense caring and love for his family and friends, and especially all the children of the world over. He is filled with deep emotions that create an unearthly, special, innocent, childlike, wise man that is Michael Jackson. He is so giving of himself that, at times, he leaves very little to protect that beautiful inner core that is the seence of him. I think Michael appeals to the child in all of us. He has the quality of innocence that we would all like to obtain or have kept. I think Michael is like litmus paper. He is always trying to learn. He has one of the sharpest wits, he is intelligent, and he is cunning - that is a strange word to use about him, because it implies deviousness and he is one of the least devious people I have ever met in my life. Michael is highly intelligent, shrewd, intuitive, understanding, sympathetic, and generous to almost a fault of himself. He is honesty personified - painfully honest - and vulnerable to the point of pain. He is also very curious and wants to draw from people who have survived. People who have lasted. He is not really of this planet. If he is eccentric it's because he is larger than life. What is a genius? What is a living legend? What is a megastar? Michael Jackson - that's all. And just when you think you know him, he gives you more... There is no one that can come near him, no one can dance like that, write the lyrics, or cause the kind of excitement that he does. When I hear the name Michael Jackson, I think of brilliance, of dazzling stars, lasers and deep emotions. I think he is one of the world's biggest and greatest stars, and it just so happens that he is one of the most gifted music makers the world has ever known. I think he is one of the finest people to hit this planet, and, in my estimation, he is the true King of Pop, Rock and Soul. I love you Michael. [source: HIStory booklet]</p>
<p>Usher (R&amp;B singer) I study legends because I want to be a legend - Frank Sinatra, Fred Estaire, LL Cool J, Michael Jackson. That's who inspires me. [source: USA Today; October 9, 1997]</p>
<p>Hype Williams (video director) The choreography [in Thriller] is tremendous. It's a new appreciation of how dance can move a music video. He wasn't just a tremendous artist, tremendous performer, it was amazing how ingenious was he to foresee that music video could be anything you wanted in the beginning. [source: MTV; March 2000]</p>

<p><br />
Will Smith About Michael Jackson In an interview with Teen Hollywood (August 2002), American actor Will Smith, who portrays Agent Jay in 'Men in Black II,' was surprised to find himself intimidated by Michael Jackson's physical presence on the set. "The persona that is created of Michael Jackson is very different when you're in a room with him, when you're talking to him. He's very funny. He actually fights. I was surprised. He's like a blue belt in Tae Kwan Do or something. I'd just done 'Ali,' and I felt that Michael Jackson might be able to hurt me. That dude looks sharp. He's a fast mover. You see how somebody could dance and move that good and do those spins. That takes strength man."</p>

<p>Neverland</p>
<p>All over the walls of my room are pictures of Peter Pan. I've read everything that Barrie wrote. I totally identify with Peter Pan, the lost boy from Never Neverland." (Michael Jackson)</p>
<p><br />
The first time Michael saw the beautiful valley of Santa Ynez, 150 kilometers away from Santa Barbara in California, was in 1983 during the production of the video "Say Say Say" with Paul McCartney. In 1988 he could buy the "Sycomore Valley Ranch" in neighbourhood to Ronald and Nancy Reagan. A new name was quickly found - Neverland Valley Ranch inspired from one of his most beloved books Peter Pan. Michael made the ranch to a kind of paradise. It's a full scale amusement park with Ferris Wheel, The Wipeout, Bumper cars and Sea Dragon. And it's also a colourful park with thousends of flowers, statues, little forrests and lakes. In a zoo you can find many animals like monkeys, lions, white tigers, elephants and many cats, who are living in the yalley. There is also an private film theater and, of course, Michael's house. Some people wonder about this "childishness". But Michael claims, that he compensates his own lost childhood. "Well, it brings out the child that lives in everybody. I love rides and things like that and I share it with the children." But he not uses all this only for himself and his own children. Every three weeks the parks opens the doors for ill or underpriviledged children.</p>
<p>Car bumpers enjoy!"People wonder why I always have children around, because I find the thing that I never had through them, you know Disneyland, amusement parks, arcade games. I adore all that stuff because when I was little it was always work, work, work from one concert to the next, if it wasn't a concert it was the recording studio, if it wasn't that it was TV shows or interviews or picture sessions. There was always something to do." "We have children that come who are - who intravenously - they are very sick, bedridden."</p>
<p>In Neverland "I'm trying to imitate Jesus in the fact that he said to be like children, to love children, to be as pure as children, and to make yourself as innocent and to see the world through eyes of wonderment and the whole magical quality of it all and I love that. And we'll have like a hundred bald headed children, they all have cancer, and they're all running around.</p>
<p><br />
What Michael is thinking about art</p>
<p>I am committed to my art. I believe that all art has as its ultimate goal the union between the material and the spiritual, the human and the divine. I believe that to be the reason for the very existence of art. (1993)</p>
<p>Songwriting is a very frustrating art form. You have to get on tape exactly what's playing in your head. When I hear it up here in my head, it's wonderful. I have to transcribe that onto tape. "The Girl is Mine" wasn't completely what I wanted, but it's very nice. But "Billie Jean" is there. I worked so hard on that. I worked for three weeks on the bass lick alone. (1999)</p>
<p><br />
What Michael is thinking about family</p>
<p>I love my family very much. I wish I could see them a little more often than I do. But we understand because we're a show business family and we all work. We do have family day when we all get together, we pick a person's house, it might be Jermaine's house or Marlon's house or Tito's house and everyone will come together in fellowship and love each other and talk and catch up on who's doing what. (1993)</p>
<p><br />
What Michael is thinking about Cartoons</p>
<p>I'm a collector of cartoons. All the Disney stuff, Bugs Bunny, the old MGM ones. It's real escapism, it's like everything's alright. It's like the world is happening now in a far away city. Everything's fine.</p>
<p>I like Batman a lot... If I could choose one, it would be Morph, from the X-Men. He can become anything ... He constantly transforms himself. I think he can even teleport, which is interesting and exciting to me. He's not as popular as the others, but that makes him exciting. (1995)</p>
<p>I love movies my dream is to make films, not only act and sing but to produce them as well. And I love animation. (1995)</p>
<p><br />
What Michael is thinking about himself</p>
<p>I do disguises for different reasons. I like to study people - be like the fly on the wall. Even if it's two old ladies sitting on a bench or some kids on a swing. Because I don't know what it's like to fit in an everyday life situation. (1999)</p>
<p>One time I was in a record store, completely disguised, and these girls were pulling out my album, talking all about me. I was literally next to them. It was wonderful. I loved it. But if I go out as myself, I can't have fun. People always say, "Why don't we just go to a party?" Soon as I step in, the party's over -for me. It's a party for them, but they are all putting their cards on my face, saying, "Remember me? I met you four years ago at‚Ä¶" and I say, "I don't remember." So I can't enjoy the experience. They play all my songs. I didn't come to hear my music. And everybody starts chanting "Dance!" "Well, I want to see YOU dance for a change." (1999)</p>
<p>I'm never pleased with anything, I'm a perfectionist, it's part of who I am. (1993)</p>
<p>I believe in my work, like I said, I have great confidence in my dreams. When I have a great idea I have an iron will. (1995)</p>
<p>It's sad to get caught up in the past. That's why I don't put awards in my house. No gold records, no Grammys. They are in storage. I don't like to be puffed up with pride, 'cause i'd feel like I don't have anymore things to reach for. And that's not true. (1999)</p>
<p>Well, I usually am happy. I don't let anything get me down, no matter what. I like to hear the sound of water and birds chirping and laughter, you know. I love all the real natural, innocent things. I would never go to a party or a club. I did that when I was a kid, and I don't care to do it anymore. (1999)</p>
<p><br />
What Michael is thinking about being on stage</p>
<p>When we do a concert, and there's like a hundred thousand people out there, and you see a sea of people singing there, all in unison, holding up candles, and, you go, wow! You know it's, it really makes your heart happy and that's what really makes me feel like everything's OK. (1995)</p>
<p>I wouldn't say I was sexy! But I guess that's fine if that's what they say. I like that in concert. That's neat. (1983)</p>
<p><br />
What Michael is thinking about music</p>
<p>To be honest, my first love and appreciation for music was classical, in kindergarten. I used to listen to Tchaikovsky every day. The great writing of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, and many others. I love the showtunes. (1995)</p>
<p>We never had music or dance lessons in our house, ever. We were a family that sang all the time. We watched television. We would entertain ourselves... We would take all the furniture out of the living room and dance. I think you're pretty much born with a gift and you are compelled to create. That is what I have always felt. I remember making up songs when I was really little. I remember when I was little there was rain outside and we would make up songs. Janet and I would have a songwriting game while we washed the dishes...while we were cleaning. I think most kids don't do that these days. It was our destiny. (1995)</p>
<p>The process [in creating a ryhythm] is creating a vocal rhythm to a click track - which is a sound, a timed beat. And you're doing these mouth sounds to that beat. These sounds can be looped according to how you sample it in the computer again and again. This is your foundation for the entire track - everything plays off this. It's the rhythm, like the beatbox rhythm. Every song I've written since I was very little I've done that way. I still do it that way. (1995)</p>
<p>Music started with nature. Music is nature. Birds make music. Oceans make music. Wind makes music, Any natural sound is music. And that's where it started.. You see, we're just making a replica of nature, which is the sounds we hear outside. (1999)</p>
<p>I just try to write wonderful music; and if they love it, they love it. I don't think about any demographic. The record company tries to get me to think that way, but I just do what I would enjoy hearing. (1999)</p>
<p>I think the best work is coming, but I would like to go into other areas, not keep doing album after pop album. (1999)</p>
<p><br />
What Michael is thinking about ignorance</p>
<p>I'm prejudiced against ignorance. That's what I'm mainly prejudiced against. It's only ignorance and it's taught because it's not genetic at all. The little children in those countries aren't prejudiced. I would like for you to put this in quotes, too. I'm really not a prejudiced person at all. I believe that people should think about God more and creation. ... Look at the many wonders inside the human body-the different colors of organs, colors of blood-and all these different colors do a different thing in the human body. It's the most incredible system in the world; it makes an incredible building, the human being. And if this can happen with the human body, why can't we do it as people? And that's how I feel. And that's why I wish the world could do more. That's the only thing I hate. I really do. (1984)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
What Michael is thinking about religion</p>
<p>I believe in the Bible and I try to follow the Bible. I know I'm an imperfect person... I'm not making myself an angel because I'm not an ngel and I'm not a devil either. I try to be the best I can and I try to do what I think is right. It's that simple. And I do believe in God. (1984)</p>
<p>I pray every night. I don't just pray at night. I pray at different times during the day. When I see something beautiful, whenever I see beautiful scenery - like when I'm flying or something - I say, oh, God, that's beautiful. And I always say little prayers like that all through the day. I love beauty. (1984)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
What Michael is thinking about animals</p>
<p>I find in animals the same thing I find so wonderful in children. That purity, that honesty, where they don't judge you, they just want to be your friend. I think that is so sweet. (1993)</p>
<p>God created animals and they are loving, they are beautiful. I feel the way anthropologist Jane Goodall does, or any of those naturalists. I don't find my interest in animal weird or strange at all. (1999)</p>
<p><br />
What Michael is thinking about drugs</p>
<p>In the field I'm in, there is a lot of that and it gets offered to me all the time. People even go as far as to just... stick it in your pocket and walk off. Now, if it was a good thing, they wouldn't do that... I mean, would somebody drop something beautiful in my pocket and just walk off? But I don't want to have anything to do with any of that. I mean, as corny as it sounds, but this is how I really believe: Natural highs are the greatest highs in the world... Who wants to take something and just sit around for the rest of the day after you take it [drugs], and don't know who you are, what you're doing, where you are? Take in something that's gonna inspire you to do greater things in the world. (1984)</p>
<p><br />
What Michael is thinking about politics</p>
<p>I never get into politics. But I think music soothes the savage beast. If you put cells under a microscope and you put music on, you'll see them move and start to dance. It affects the soul.... I hear music in everything. (1992)</p>

<p>Weather World is a fifteen-minute weather program from the Department of Meteorology's Weather Communications Group at the Penn State University. It airs live on weekdays at 5:45 PM on the Pennsylvania Cable Network.</p>
<p>The first incarnation of the program came after Dr. Charles Hosler heard a particularly terrible forecast. The program was produced from the Steidle Building basement on the University Park campus and broadcast by WFBG in Altoona. The show began broadcasting on WPSX-TV (now WPSU-TV) upon its creation in 1965. Three more versions of the show followed in proceding years, the third being the current incarnation, which was conceived in 1983.</p>
<p>The program had been produced and broadcast by WPSX-TV and distributed to other Pennsylvania PBS stations interesting in airing the program. In 2004, though, WPSX decided to cease production of Weather World. Several months went by before the show reappeared, this time on the Pennsylvania Cable Network where it currently airs.</p>
<p>Weather World is produced by students and the Weather Communications Group at Penn State in the Walker Building television studio.</p>
