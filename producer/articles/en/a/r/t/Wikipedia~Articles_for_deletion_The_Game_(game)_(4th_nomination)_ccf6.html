<p>The page has been recreated but is not the same as previously deleted versions. For one thing, there is now a source of some sort.

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. The ad source is the same given in the last AfD; the one where someone wrote the link to the Wikipedia article on a board.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the main point to address is Sam Blanning's; he may be right that the newspaper article is partly based on the old Wikipedia article. First of all, we don't know if that's true or not. In the given article, Wikipedia is not mentioned. We have no reason to believe that Wikipedia is the <i>only</i> source of that material, in which case I would agree that it would not be a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. As has been pointed out, it's easy to convince yourself that people know what The Game is and play it by doing a web search: that may not be good enough for Wikipedia, but it's good enough for a newspaper article. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 17:51, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's only one additional source which does not make it verifiable, it was recreated way outside of policy (this should have been taken back to DRV not recreated and sent here) and it's just another excuse of a reason by a group that will do anything including sockpuppetry, meatpuppetry, and blatant violation of consensus to delete and policy regarding deletion to get this article on Wikipedia. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 18:28, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not going to comment on the sockpuppetry matter other than to note that there were many editors (such as myself) who had nothing to do with that, so to label it all as part of some "group" is highly misleading and unproductive. Now, I'm highly curious where in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> it says that "one additional source which does not make it verifiable" or something to that effect. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:36, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not the additional source that's my main issue, it's the fact that people are using one source as a way to justify the entire article's recreation against consensus and against policy without even going through it the proper way and it seems nobody really cares about the fact that we are being walked over by the people at Savethegame . org in their quest to get this article recreated at any cost and in the process are making a mockery out of Wikipedia. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 18:39, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete, delete, delete.</b> This article was already deleted as a result of a recent AFD, then put through a Deletion Review. The only supposed "source" for this was a small newspaper article that looks suspiciously similar to the WP article that was deleted. It was brought up during the DRV and was taken into account by the admin who closed it. Their decision was to <i>keep deleted,</i> and protected the article from recreation.<br />
However, the protection was removed and the article recreated <i>by the very same user/admin who initiated the DRV in the first place!</i> I can't be the only one who sees a problem with that, and I noted it on the article's talk page.<br />

<li>I really don't think it's fair to say it was "shot down" in the deletion review. The only comment made on it after it was brought up was by the closing admin. And I see no reason why a newspaper article should be considered unreliable just because it's not sourced. I know of virtually no newspaper articles that are. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 21:17, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fair enough, I changed my reasoning accordingly. The reason the source of the article is important (at least to my understanding) is that there was some talk on Talk:The Game (game) about whether the article used WP as a source. I'm not sure I buy it myself, but that is one of the arguments being used against the newspaper article. At any rate, these are things that need to be brought up in another DRV. Quoting directly from <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>: "Deletion Review is also to be used if significant new information has come to light since a deletion and the information in the deleted article would be useful to write a new article." This is what should have been done in this situation, instead of going against a just-closed DRV and restoring the article. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanG_1aea.html" title="User:BryanG">BryanG</a> 21:31, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Even if Deletion Review were the correct place to take this discussion, it seems to be pretty policy-obsessive to vote for deletion now solely based on that.

<li>I don't feel I'm being policy-obsessive here. The fact is that both the most recent AfD and the DRV have been closed as "delete". I believe it sets a dangerous precedent if we allow users to ignore two successive debates and recreate a substantially similar article just because one source has been found. That's exactly what DRV exists for, as I noted above. To answer your question, I would probably say that the article is non-notable and vote to keep the article deleted anyway, so my vote stands. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanG_1aea.html" title="User:BryanG">BryanG</a> 23:07, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> The article has stirred up a huge amount of interesting discussion, but it boils down to the question of whether we should accept something that is real, despite it not being widely documented in traditional source material.

It reminds me of the politically incorrect elementary school "gay tests" and "retard tests" where whatever answer you gave "made" you gay or retarded. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 17:23, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep.</b> I wanted a source, and one has been found. I wish it were in English because the majority of our readers can't read Dutch, but I trust the translation and I trust the newspaper. I do hope that someone contacts the author of the newspaper article to ask what sources he/she used in writing it... doing so will either confirm that we're now referencing ourselves circularly or will provide us with more sources for our own article. Until we can prove without a doubt that the author used our article to write his/hers, I'm going to assume he/she didn't, and hopefully that's not shooting myself in the foot. If the result is keep, it will require a fair bit of policing, I'm sure, to keep the original research and general cruft out, but the promise of cruft in the future is not a valid reason for deleting the article now. —<a href="../../../s/e/q/User%7ESeqsea_4341.html" title="User:Seqsea">Seqsea</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/q/User_talk%7ESeqsea_914c.html" title="User talk:Seqsea">talk</a>) 20:47, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>The content of the article is uniquely hard to pin a source down to. Meme phenomena tend to lack the publicity or scholarly research that an article on a current event or the astrolabe would. Specifically, addressing Gsham's point, it's a bit elitist to disregard any attempt at justification solely because the article doesn't happen to be in English. If it is really of that much concern, then maybe have it translated by someone? Or check the qualifications on the publisher itself? If it's a newspaper issue, and if it can't be translated, then see if the source is a credible one. Reiterating: Memes are regional, cultural, etc. phenomena. Just because the New York Times has not piped in an opinion does NOT mean that the information is either any less true or any less informative than any other regional quirks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, certainly, if the article was blatantly dumb, then it merits deletion. However, I can testify that this actually is a true meme. I've talked to people across the state that play this 'game' just as myself and my friends do.

<li><b>Comment</b> I tried searching usenet for +"think about the game" +lose. I figured those would be in all versions of the game; I didn't find <i>any</i> of the results referring to this game. The only post I can find definitely relating to it is one from April 17, 2005 that links to the WP page. There's one from February 20, 2006 that states "You made me lose The Game" which might refer to it. I think it's important to find references that predate the article's first creation on WP. When was that? The first VFD was posted 30 Sep 2004. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 07:11, 16 April 2006 (UTC) On April 6, 2004 195.92.67.75 added a description of the game to the disambig page <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Game_def0.html" title="The Game">The Game</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Game&amp;diff=3086150&amp;oldid=3086062" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Game&amp;diff=3086150&amp;oldid=3086062" rel="nofollow">diff</a>.

<dd>Actually it can be, as someone posted a scan of it on the talk page, but you're not missing anything. It is next to useless with respect to WP:V, as it does not explain how it got its information (which newspapers <i>do</i> generally do when they have a source, contrary to Ssbohio's claim, even if it's unnamed "senior government officials") and we're forced to resort to "they probably know what they're talking about". It seems to score some points in the notability game, though, but personally I don't play it, hence my own continued deletionist stance. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 23:06, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

Would you feel better if the article said "we heard about it from all the annoying idiots who keep playing the game and announce 'I lost' in the middle of lectures" or "we kept hearing friends talk about it?"

<li>I've tried hard to see each side's point on this, since I am uninvolved in this particular article, having had no edits or previous votes. Until I read the article here in Wikipedia, I hadn't heard of this "game." As a fourth attempt at deletion, I'm having a hard time seeing a consensus to delete. Further, when a source is provided to overcome the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> issue, those in favor of deletion argue against the verifiability of the newspaper story, despite any evidence that calls its verifiability into account. Secondary sources fall within <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and to presume the story unverifiable because it contains no explicit sourcing (in keeping with newspaper tradition) doesn't <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> on the part of the keep faction. If the newspaper story is dubious (for reasons grounded in fact), then this article can't rely on it for sole support.
<p>In the end, having read the discussions here, at DRV, and in the talk page, I have to come down in favor of <b>keep</b>ing the article. I can't see where a consensus for its removal has been demonstrated, and the fact that it has been ruled a <b>keep</b> in AfD twice, but <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forum_shopping.html" title="Forum shopping">forum-shopped</a> back to AfD by those favoring deletion, then <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forum_shopping.html" title="Forum shopping">forum-shopped</a> again into DRV by those favoring keeping the article, only to end up back here again. This has taken on an unpleasant aspect through all these actions, and I find it hard to believe that a true consensus in favor of deletion could be reached.

Is it not an evidence that the article is probably interesting to many people? Maybe we should put the question of its agreement to the letter of the policy aside (as it seems that people disagree about it). If it is an interesting article, and it does not contain any false information, what is the harm of keeping it? Frankly I do not understand "strong deletionists".

I first heard about it up at Georgetown University where I go to school, and when I went to the University of Florida to visit some friends they knew about the game.

<li>There are hundreds, even thousands, of hits on google for this. This does not make the article any more or less verifiable. What it does, however, do, is make it (in my opinion) notable. There's also the numerous people here on Wiki from across the world who say they've played it. Of course, I'm not sure what the person who put this up for deletion is intending to get at with notability, since it's a bit of a nebulous concept (at least as I'm reading it). The person who sent this to AfD explaining what they mean by declaring this article non notable would help. Of course, as far as I can tell, notability isn't specifically Wikipedia policy.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, there's the matter of NFT, but I think that if we resolve Verifiability, then NFT becomes a moot question. Which, of course, brings us back to the original question (the one causing so much discussion): Is this verifiable? Which leads me to ask, what (if anything) makes this article unfit? Admittedly, I'm not an expert on Wiki Policy, but could someone point out to me what makes this new article unverifiable? I understand hesitancy to use an article printed in a language many do not speak, but the policy on Reliable Sources states that English sources are prefered when possible. This seems like a juncture in which English sources are not possible. Further, the article goes on to state</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Where editors use their own English translation of a non-English source as a quote in an article, there should be clear citation of the foreign-language original, so that readers can check what the original source said and the accuracy of the translation."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suspect that no one will be heavily quoting the article, but even if they were, since this is intended as a source, it will surely be linked. Further, Kernow has raised some interesting points, both here and on the talk page, about the reliability of the (or any) source, and cases in which primary sources are acceptable.</dd>

<dd>AFD is a touchy process, and has become more and more inatricate as time goes on.

<dd>Actually meat-puppetry is more important - i.e. someone asks their friends to come vote for it. However, it is also significant in that it is not a democratic vote - it is a collective rumination on the article in relation to policy. We logically should expect more experienced users to have a thorough grasp of the regulations and to be able to orient their votes based on previous AFDs they've participated in. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavril2020_6819.html" title="User:Davril2020">Davril2020</a> 18:21, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks to everyone for the clarification.

<li><b>keep</b> I knew about this game from experience about 2 years ago. I checked Wikipedia then to see if we had an article on it. Sure enough, we did. That was good enough for me then. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> has a flaw. Wikipedia is not allowed to be the first source to report on a fact; we have to wait until some other source that is deemed a verification source has already reported on it. We should not have to wait until there is a single "good enough" source. Having some number of Google hits should be good enough to say "yes, this is verifiable", even if none of those hits are good enough on their own to merit verifiability. What that "some number of hits" should be may need to be left up to interpretation. In the case of The Game, it certainly exists, there is sufficient Google hits to document the information and therefore verify the article. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 13:40, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong speedy delete with extreme prejudice.</b> Besides being a recreation of deleted content (which it is, references to unknown-sourced Belgian newspapers be damned), it still doesn't hold up against <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (which is, lest we forget, the entire reason the article was eventually deleted in the first place and the reason it didn't come back after <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>). Furthermore, if this page is deleted I would like to see it locked against all editing (not just from non-logged-in users, and except possibly certain admins) to prevent an article which <i>went through due process in AfD, due process in DRV, was deleted, and is now up for a FOURTH DELETION</i> from being recreated again. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinitawowi_fe97.html" title="User:Kinitawowi">Kinitawowi</a> 14:42, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>The article has never been deleted through the standard process; it was deleted over a lack of consensus by an admin who used WP:V to trump the AfD discussion <strike>and who later said in the DRV that he regretted his decision</strike> (I think I got him confused with Ashibaka).

<li>No one has ever given me a good reason why the newspaper article does not count. Is it because it isn't in English? That is an obviously spurious claim. Is it because it is subscriber only? Also unfounded. Is it because it doesn't cite it's source? What? Most newspaper articles do not nor books. Small subscription base? It has around 8% of the subscription base of the Wall Street Journal Online. It isn't exactly small. Kotepho 15:22, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
