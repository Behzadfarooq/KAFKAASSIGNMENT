<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-10_60a0.html" title="Edit section: Kelly Connor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kelly Connor</span></h2>
<p>Since Kelly Connor has been a little girl, there have been three constants in her life: the Lord, family, and music. She was born in northwestern Ohio where she started piano lessons at age six, began performing at age nine, and started teaching piano at age fourteen.</p>
<p>Kelly is a refreshing talent with an impressive resume. She has been performing in Christian music circles for over twenty years. Her musical ability reaches beyond the boundaries of a beautiful voice and touches the heart. Kelly debuted on the national scene through her release of sound tracks, "THE WEDDING COLLECTION," for WORD, Inc. and a record of love songs for Christians, "Heart Of The Matter." This collection of love songs for Christians was selected album of the month in January 1993, by WORD, INC. These songs reveal only a glimpse of what her vocal richness can bring to the quality and variety of music you have come to respect from iMPACT and WORD. Kelly's unique vocal skills give new identity to this collection of familiar love songs. WORD, Inc. has used Kelly on various projects as well as studio work. She has done nearly two hundred demos in high and low keys for WORD, INC. Kelly was nominated in 1994 for the DOVE AWARD for best new artist, best new album, (THE HEART OF THE MATTER) and album art work.</p>
<p>Her success and experience are not limited to only these love ballads. Her recordings encompass a variety of styles, from contemporary to traditional, from inspirational to jazz. Still her music carries a message of love, hope and sincerity to those who attend her concerts and listen to her recordings.</p>
<p>Kelly's second national release, "My Heart Is His," was released on Song Painters Records in the spring of 1995. It was #1 in the summer of 1994 in the Dallas, Fort Worth, and Denver areas. It also received heavy air play in Alaska, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Florida. It has received national and international air play on Pat Boone and Bill Pearce's syndicated radio programs. It is carried nationally on the SKYLIGHT SATELLITE NETWORK.</p>
<p>Kelly appears in the "GAITHER'S CHRISTMAS VIDEO" and has appeared in concert with the GAITHER VOCAL BAND. She has also appeared in concert with THE TALLEY'S, BUDDY GREENE, JIM COLE, ALLISON DURHAM SPEER, PAT BOONE, MID SOUTH, SINGING AMERICANS, GOSPEL HARMONY BOYS, and others. Kelly has shared the stage with speakers DR. CHARLES STANLEY, ZOLA LEVITT, NICKY CRUZ, OLIVER NORTH and BEN KINCHLOW.</p>
<p>Active in local Christian radio and television, Kelly was host, producer and talent coordinator of her own Christian music show on WTLW television. WTLW has often used Kelly as anchor and host for their telethons, co-host of their local magazine program, (Turning Point) and writing, performing, producing jingles and theme music.</p>
<p>Christian schools (Lima Baptist Temple, Temple Christian School, Toledo Christian School, Shalom Christian School) invite Kelly to give a concert for their students. She appeared in November 1994 at the Association of Christian School International (ACSI) in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>Kelly gave several concerts in May 1995 at HOSANNA '95 in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>Kelly has performed with the LIMA SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA and has the "charts" and the talent to work with the larger churches that have orchestras.</p>
<p>She is currently working on several vocal projects, one of which is a personal vocal cd entitled "Dying Moments." The other projects are currently being recorded and will be available for purchase winter of 2006 or early in 2007.</p>

<p>The Technical Requirements Checklist or the TRC is a set of video game guidelines developed by Sony Corporation for software producers in effort to standardize code procedures as well as restrict overtaxing of its video game platforms. Recent concerns include battery overconsumption in the Sony portable PSP and backwards compatibility for Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 games in the upcoming Playstation 3 release. This, however, is a very difficult situation as developers have already completed many flagship games for the PSP that are graphic intensive and violate the battery use policy. This is a complicated matter because the flagship games are vital to the sales of the PSP unit. Backwards compatibility is highly significant, as it is a major selling point for the PS3 unit.</p>

<p>Bob Harvey Genre: Rock Biography Bob Harvey is usually known, if at all, for a brief stint in a band with whom he never recorded. That band, however, was a big one: the Jefferson Airplane. Harvey was their original bassist, playing a standup acoustic bass for a few months in their first lineup in 1965. He has actually played and recorded with a few other groups, though it's as a Jefferson Airplane trivia question that his name pops up.</p>
<p>Harvey first recorded as a banjo player with country singer Les Overstreet. In 1963, living in the San Francisco Bay Area, he co-founded the bluegrass group the Slippery Rock String Band, in which he played standup bass. It was as a folk musician that he met Marty Balin, then part of another folk group, the Town Criers. When he heard Balin was forming a folk-rock group in early 1965, he successfully auditioned for the bass position. Already in his early thirties, he was considerably older than the rest of the band; perhaps more problematically, his acoustic bass didn't fit in with the electric presence of a rock group. He did buy an electric bass around the beginning of autumn 1965, but shortly afterward he was replaced by Jack Casady, right before the Jefferson Airplane began recording for RCA.</p>
<p>Harvey went back to the Slippery Rock String Band and sang lead on their only record. In the late '60s, he was in the Holy Mackerel, a band which also featured singer/songwriter Paul Williams. But Harvey left before their obscure album was finished, although one of his songs, "Wildflowers," was included. He then went into acting, journalism, and civil service. In 2001, a band Harvey had formed in the late '90s with Brian Fowler, San Francisco Blue, put out the CD Idiot's Vision, pressed in a limited quantity of a thousand copies and issued by Cranium Music in New Zealand. ~ Richie Unterberger, All Music Guide</p>

<p>An annoying obxious snob usually present at the JJB message board. She spends most of her days posting really ugly clothes that she believes are awesome because they cost thousands of dollars. Then she tries to proove to everyone that she's not lying. Why? Who knows. If you were really that rich, would you really feel the need to show it off on an American message board then spend hours defending yourself? She never posts her picture because she's probably horrid. On one of her dresses it said size 10 but she claims to be 5' 8" and 115 lbs. She's size 10 because she has a big boobs ("all natural of course"). Right.</p>
<p>But you know, we're all just super jealous of her because we're poor people that shop at AE and aeropostale.</p>

<p>Dr Jon Jenkins is a member of the Legislative Council in NSW Australia.</p>
<p>Jon's Inaugural Speech after being elected to Parliament.</p>
<p>I am told that the purpose of this speech is to introduce myself and my purpose to this honourable House. However, as this is the last parliamentary session of the year and there is a large amount of legislation to consider, I understand the desire to be brief.</p>
<p>My life, although rather short in terms of years, has been an unusual and interesting one and is difficult to summarise quickly. I am sure that someone placed the ancient Oriental curse on me at birth: "May you lead an interesting life!"</p>
<p>My direct ancestors, a stonemason and a convict in the first fleets, were mixed with most of the races on this earth, including possibly some indigenous races. In short, like many good Australians, I am of mixed race. But, like all mixed breeds, we are a pretty tough lot.</p>
<p>Environmental issues run deep in my family. Jenkins House on Jenkins Hill takes pride of place in Lane Cove River National Park, a significant part of which was a gift from my great-grandfather to the people of New South Wales. My father, a veteran and an amateur entomologist, has bred and released many rare species of butterflies and their food plants for most of his 84 years. My involvement with conservation groups, such as the Platypus Conservancy, predates my involvement with politics.</p>
<p>My family also has a very rich political history. My uncle Eric Lambert, together with Hardy, was a founding Communist activist and author of such weighty tomes as The Twenty Thousand Thieves and The Veterans. That association continues in this era with my older sister, herself a dedicated socialist, academic and author. I think she describes herself as an existential anarchist. Perhaps someone on the Left can explain what that means to me one day. Conversely, my father was an original One Nation supporter. So you can imagine what the post-Christmas political discussions were like in our household. I thought the middle road was the safest, but of course everyone has issues with me!</p>
<p>My own early childhood was far from ideal: a traumatic start as a ward of the State, following nightmare custody battles to the only child of a single father. I was always interested in science and, in particular, natural sciences and medicine. A motor vehicle accident, and 1½ years in hospital and several years recovering, convinced me that clinical medicine was not a career for me. Further, as a direct result of the accident, and continuing disabilities, I needed a more sedentary vocation than molecular biology/virology for which I originally spent 10 years training. Further studies in computer science allowed me to combine my interests in the form of viral coat protein analysis structure prediction and later virtual surgery and 3D imagery construction. I have worked in private industry and at universities and I also have my own—or at least I did until I came here—education consulting business. Until recently I was at the Bond University on the Gold Coast, and I have offered my resignation to the university. However, they have declined and have asked me to stay on in an adjunct position, which I am very proud to do.</p>
<p>Currently, I live on the beach on the North Coast of New South Wales with my beautiful wife and the two best children one could ask for. I should also mention that we have a mongrel, or should I say a mixed-breed kelpie dog! My general interests include the natural sciences, medicine and medical education. I also have an obvious interest in road safety and related issues. I am an avid water polo player, a member of our local surf club, and try to surf, especially with my children, whenever possible. I have travelled across this country many times, including to our most remote and beautiful places.</p>
<p>Members, and Madam President, some of you may ask why I have come to this place. To leave my research and the exciting opening of the first private medical school in Australia, which I went there to be involved with many years ago, has caused some considerable soul searching on my part. I have given up a full-time continuing academic position and private consulting to come here in the glare of much adverse publicity, and under probably extreme scrutiny, only for an uncertain future! I will also have to leave my beautiful beach sunrises and the best surfing secret on the coast! But hardest of all was the decision to leave my family for long periods. I take this opportunity to thank my wife for allowing me to pursue this effort.</p>
<p>Well, I can assure you it is not for the remuneration and there is no pension at the end of my period in this House. Rather, I have come here for a reason. I have a passion for the environment and its protection and preservation. My firm belief is that our precious natural resources and heritage have not been managed properly. I could go on in this House with endless examples of that, and I am sure you have all read of them in the papers. I would like to use one example, that is, the recent fires in our southern border areas. The fault for the damage to both property and wilderness lies squarely with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the influence of the fanatical environmentalists within the organisation and its quangos, such as the National Parks Association.</p>
<p>The recent cataclysmic fires in the New South Wales Victorian border area have confirmed the fallacy of wilderness areas. It seems possible that at least two of our most rare species may be further endangered and many others are now, or soon will be, in serious trouble due to the resulting vastness of the scorched earth. Even today, two-thirds of one of our most beautiful parks has less than 30 per cent groundcover. There is little spring food or shelter for our precious endangered animals. The scorched earth was a direct result from fuel loads of more than 100 tonnes per hectare, many times the recommended maximum for that type of forest. Following rains in the area then caused large-scale erosion and, combined with ash, have caused fish kills in the local headwaters of small streams and have rendered some of Canberra's dams effectively unusable.</p>
<p>This was all predictable and was in fact predicted 10 years ago. As every inquiry has found, including the recent Commonwealth parliamentary inquiry, and as commonsense told us, it is a simple undeniable fact that if the parks had been managed properly this level of devastation may not have occurred. This is far too detailed and complex a problem to discuss at length but I am happy to further this discussion at any time with anyone and at any place. Perhaps one might read the Commonwealth report: "A Nation Charred" and Peter Clack's book Firestorm: Trial by Fire before they come to see me.</p>
<p>This irrational and outdated fundamentalist ideology within the National Parks and Wildlife Service was commented on at some length by the retiring head of the service, Mr Brian Gilligan. I applaud him for his bravery. Note that I have met many people in the National Parks and Wildlife Service who also see this problem. The fundamentalists certainly have a foothold, but there are many thinking and rational people within the service who can see the detrimental effect this ideology is having on our natural heritage.</p>
<p>To get to the point: proper fire and feral management requires access, and access requires roads. The fundamentalist fanatics have prevented access to many of our precious parks by causing the closure of the majority of roads and tracks. As a simple and expected result, these tracks have become overgrown and inaccessible, and this has prevented the management, use and enjoyment of the vast majority of our precious parks. Except in small, protected and geographically isolated areas, such as parts of Tasmania or some islands, it is too late to leave nature to itself: there are too many external influences that we have introduced and we need to be managing at both the macro and micro level now.</p>
<p>The ravaging of our parks by feral animals, weeds and fire will be repeated over and over and over and over again until there are no parks to protect. And the fanatical environmentalists and other irrational, unthinking apparatchiks will be directly responsible.</p>
<p>Tasmania is facing a potential crisis, which could be the acid test of the reign of logic over the ideological madness: the fox has been found in Tasmania. How will they manage the fox in this pristine area without road access? What of emerging threats like the cane toad, the fire ant and the devastating mesquite? How will we deal with these without access? In the case of converted State Forests the existing roads have been used by heavy machinery for as much as 100 years, and probably as much as 100 before that by bullock teams hauling out logs. All of a sudden when an area becomes a national park the first thing they do is close the roads, effectively preventing access.</p>
<p>And so we ask the question: why have the roads been closed in our national parks? There is no rational or scientific reason for these closures, it is just the unthinking quasi-religious guilt of the ecofundamentalists: "Man and his machines are evil. We don't want you in our parks". The closures have and will continue to have devastating effects for our natural resources and heritage.</p>
<p>I remember wanting to go and join the protests in Tasmania to save the Huon, and I still think it was right to save those ancient forests. I considered myself a Greenie because I understood the precious and irreplaceable nature of the environment from both points of view: as a simple person looking up at nature, and also as a scientist studying the smallest sub-atomic particles to the complex and ill-understood interactions of our small blue planet to the unfathomable expanse of the universe. Now I have to confess I am an anti-Greenie.</p>
<p>So how is it that the environmental movement has become so perverted? The Government itself should not escape scrutiny or blame in this matter. Either by tacit approval or at the very least a simple lack of due diligence it has allowed this penchant of the instruments which have charge of our heritage and natural resources to occur. And I will continue to remind the Government of this in this House. I refuse to allow the cult of the environment to treat our natural heritage as some unholy, untouchable shrine in front of which we have to prostrate our guilt-racked bodies as we pass the locked gates! Our natural heritage is ours, and our children's, to protect, to manage and to enjoy.</p>
<p>And here is the crux of one of the main issues: if we cannot enjoy our natural resources, our natural heritage, we will not care for them. And this is what is happening: our national parks are a closed sacred cow that we are not allowed to enter, and so have become uncared for and, in many cases, hated places! Do not mistake me, I am not one of the believers that monetary value is the key to ensure survival, although I can see the logic. Rather, to spend time with friends and family in some of nature's most wonderful places is beyond all monetary and political value. I acknowledge that it is possible to love a place to death but, as usage demands and as more people start to impact on the environment, the solution is management, not banishment.</p>
<p>Many places have controlled access, and this has been very successful. But the ranting of the fanatical fundamentalist Luddites continues to cause the blanket closure of our parks.</p>
<p>One of the last places accessible to me and my family locally was Mebbin State Forest—now Mebbin National Park. This is not pristine forest; it has been logged for possibly in excess of 150 years, both by mechanised means and by bullock teams. Mind you, they knew how to log in the old days—they took timber, but they left enough for the next generation. Mebbin contains some very special places of both natural and historic value. This place certainly is not in the category of places being loved to death. It receives, on average, perhaps half a dozen vehicles per day on the main access road, but more on the weekends and less during the week. The forest was crisscrossed by many named roads, which had been in constant use for more than a century.</p>
<p>Except for one area—appropriately named Bog Onion Road—there was no significant erosion, and the roads were accessible to most conventional vehicles, although some had four-wheel-drive-only sections. There was no reason to close any roads, with perhaps the one named exception. But, come the conversion to a national park, and all but the main loop road were closed! For me, this was personally devastating and was what really tipped the balance from someone who had been apolitical until that point in time to suddenly becoming political. These roads were not closed for any scientific reason or on any logical basis, but simply on a whim. Now that this place where my family and friends have spent many hours is effectively closed to us, many of the roads have already grown over and are now inaccessible for fire and feral management.</p>
<p>This follows the same precedent set by all the other parks in this region. Meetings with and submissions to the local park management have been a futile waste. I make a prediction: As the fuel loads build, cataclysmic fires will occur in this region in the foreseeable future. The animals that manage to survive the initial furnace will have no cover to hide from the feral cats, foxes or birds of prey, and the subsequent rains—we can get up to 20 inches, or 500 millilitres, in a single day—will cause massive erosion.</p>
<p>The issue is not really about access. The issue is about the attitude to the management of "your" parks. I know that when the attitude and management are corrected access to "our" parks will be restored. There will be no reason to lock people out! I quote the comments of a self-alleged guardian of the environment by the name of the Hon. Bob Brown made in a recent interview on Radio National:</p>
<p>"… it's about managing the environment; it's not about locking them out."</p>
<p>I admit that I am quoting him somewhat out of context, but the principle is the same: it is about management.</p>
<p>Now that I have reinforced the environmentalists' dislike of me and the Outdoor Recreation Party, I will try to mend some bridges. I will state for the record that I actually agree with many aspects of the green agenda. How could I not, having been trained in the scientific arts? As for my own politics, those on the right will probably say I am a left-wing radical; those on the left on the Government side will probably call me a right-wing fascist. I suppose I would consider my own politics to be a little bit left of centre on most issues.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of being a single-issue party is that I do not have to toe the line on party ideology—simply because there is none! Each issue is decided on its merits. In fact, was that not our forbears' very intention for this House? So I make a promise to this House: I will always try to listen to all sides, and debate the issues logically and with the quiet forethought, compassion and wisdom of one who has led an interesting life.</p>
<p>However, on issues on the environment I will be uncompromising, loud, aggressive and persistent. In doing this I realise that the business of Parliament must of necessity be one of compromise and agreement. Unlike some, I accept the pragmatic nature of a working democracy as the best possible solution to government, and I put my trust in the basic honesty and passion on both sides of the political coin. I also state that I believe that this House is a House of review, not a House of obstruction, and that in the general sense the Government is elected to govern and should be allowed to do so.</p>
<p>However, I reserve the right to deny support for legislation which, either by accident or design, would have an adverse impact on the constituency as a whole. And I further reserve the right to suggest improvements or amendments to legislation that might increase its efficacy or protect those who otherwise might be adversely affected. I look forward to robust and thorough debate on the many challenging issues in this House. I will at all times try to be honest to myself, to this House and to the people of New South Wales. I thank honourable members for their indulgence on this occasion.</p>

<p><b>Born:</b> 1965, Melbourne</p>
<p>Before Peter Alexander was known as Australia's "Pyjama King" he worked in fashion store, Sportsgirl in 1981. Here he learned the business of selling, buying, designing, wearing and merchandising clothes. Before this he had no background in fashion.</p>
<p>"No one in my family was involved in fashion. I completed my HSC (Higher School Certificate) and didn’t do any tertiary study. In 1982-83, I worked in a nightclub and then I got a part-time job as a sales assistant at Sportsgirl. As soon as I worked there, I enjoyed the energy, the creativity, the marketing and fashion. Sportsgirl trained me in visual merchandising. I learnt a lot about marketing and fashion, but nothing about manufacturing – because everything was manufactured overseas – and nothing about business. With that knowledge, I decided I wanted to do something in fashion, despite the fact I had no real skills." Peter Alexander</p>
<p>He was inspired to do something in fashion. He relised there was not much choice for women when it came to pyjamas and asked around to see what women his age (22-23) were wearing to bed. It turned out that they wore mens pj's because they wanted something different. He got a friend to help him with his idea.</p>
<p>"She was in the fashion industry. I told her my idea and asked if she could help me find a pattern-maker and some fabric. We looked in the Yellow Pages and found a pattern maker. I took the pyjamas that I’d bought in Hong Kong and got the pattern made from that and then she took me to see fabric wholesalers. I bought five metres of this, five metres of that. We went to a factory and said: “We just want to get a sample run done; we’ll order thousands in the future.” That was a bit presumptuous because we didn’t even have orders at that point, but we got the samples made. I then went around to the stores and tried to sell the pyjamas."</p>
<p>In 1986 he made pyjamas for friends.</p>
<p><br />
He is dyslexic. "It was a real learning disability and, as a consequence, I didn’t do well at school. I still can’t spell very well and my handwriting is terrible. I struggled damatically through my school years and did remedial classes to help. I knew I was intelligent; I just didn’t fit into the school system. I believed it was just a matter of finding my niche."</p>

<p>Joshua Montel was born on March 27th, 1987. He lived in Staten Island, New York for the first year of his life, and then moved to Marlboro, NJ, where he has lived since. He was born to Peter Montel, a school teacher, and Deirdre Schwimmer, a pharmacy technician. Two years later his younger brother Matt was born. Josh also has an older half-brother from his father's previous marriage. For pre-nursery, he attended the Day Care center located next to Jersey Shore Medical Center. Joshua's intelligence could already be seen at an early age, by his ability to comprehend and use the small amount of spanish he was taught by one of his teachers. He started kindergarten at Shalom Torah academy, where he quickly befriended many people, and took a liking to his new surroundings. In second grade, he met his best friend Jon Lafond, though at the time they were only friends. Josh also had his first "serious" girlfriend in second grade, which lasted for about a year. While he was in third grade, the roof of the school blew off during a storm, and the students were required to learn in small offices next to the school. It was extremely uncomfortable. Third grade was also the time Jon and Josh became best friends. In fifth grade, Jon and Josh worked closely together, starting mischief that would continue throughout the lives. While required to write stories for their english teacher, they would sit by the desk and watch the teacher play with her feat, as they tries various things ranging from moving her shoes to putting pieces of paper in them, to see if she would notice. They also co-starred in Charlie and the Chocolate factory, splitting the role of Willy Wanka. It was in 6th grade that Josh realized his dream of one day becoming a veterinarian, and it is a goal he is pursuing to this day. The 6th grade was Josh's last year in Shalom Torah since his parents decided the education he was getting was not sufficient enough to prepare him for the outside world, so at the end of the year, he was enrolled for public school, along with his brother Matt. Public school was a big change for Josh. He went from a class of about 20, to a class of about 500.</p>

<p>The ABVP was started soon after independence with the objective of channelising students' energies in the task of national reconstruction by a group of students and teachers who drew their inspiration from the RSS, the premier nationalist organisation of the country. Its growth process was slow and sporadic in the first few years but it picked up after Prof. Yeshwantrao Kelkar, a lecturer in Bombay, became its main organiser in 1958. He was its real architect and builder. As a consequence of singe-minded devotion of Prof. Kelkar, who passionately tried to build up this organisation till his death in 1987, the ABVP is what it is today.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of the Parishad lies in the fact that it has emerged as a stable organisation of floating population of students. Perhaps no social organisation has its members changing so quickly and regularly as the ABVP has. Despite this handicap, the ABVP has gained strength day by day. In all probability, the ABVP is the only example of its type throughout the world. Another unique feature of the oraganisation is that though it is a student organisation in every respect, the teachers also take an active part in its functioning. Ever since its inception teachers have been deeply involved in building up the organisation and they comprise the permanent component of the membership.</p>
<p>What distinguishes the ABVP from other organisations is the fact that it is a full-fledged and regular student organisation which has evolved a distinct philosophy and role for a student organisation and which organises multifarious activities to fulfill its objective of national reconstruction. So far as ABVP's contribution in the national life is concerned it can be said with pride that apart from organising a lot of constructive and meaningful activities and helping to solve the problems related to student and educational field, the Parishad has played an important role in highlighting and solving larger problems of the country. The thoughts and ideals of the ABVP on educational change can prove as valuable assets for any educational ministry or department. Be it the issue of terrorism in Kashmir or of infiltration of foreigners into Assam and border states, or the issue of reservation and Mandal recommendations or the gigantic task of integrating north-eastern citizens with those of the other parts of the country or the problem of unemployment and economic reconstruction of the country or the fight against social inequalities or the calamity of earthquake in Marathwada, the ABVP has never been found wanting both on the plains of thinking and action. The ABVP today has a cadre of socially committed workers who are capable of undertaking any challenging task.</p>
<p>The coming days would witness a more active, meaningful and effective participation by the ABVP in the task of national reconstruction and the country and its citizens would feel proud of such a role of the ABVP.</p>

<p>filming starting in september</p>
<p>Variety caught up with new Alien vs. Predator 2 directors Greg and Colin Strause who revealed what we can expect from the Fox sequel. "AVP2," written by Shane Salerno, is scheduled to begin shooting in September for an August 10, 2007 release.</p>
<p>"We really want to take it back to the original 'Alien' and 'Predator' films and make a serious, gritty horror film," Colin Strause said.</p>
<p>"We want to take it back to its roots, without losing sight of the human struggle," added Greg Strause. "That's what made the originals so good."</p>
<p>Davis Entertainment's John Davis and Robbie Brenner are producing. Davis Entertainment also produced the first film in the franchise, as well as "Predator" and "Predator 2."</p>

<p>The World Cup is still a few hours away, more than a month before we know what name is engraved on the bottom of the trophy against 2006......my wife and I have already had our first disagreement. I know there will many such before the night of July 9, by then the madness should end, I hope. We decided earlier that we will not have an idiot box at home, so our little daughter could focus on her school work, imbibe reading and indulge in physical activity. A logical choice, given her attraction for everything animated.</p>
<p>The decision stood till the evening of the seventh of June. But then, the players all arrived in Germany, and the heat of occasion started to tell on me. So, the TV had to come, but with it came the wife's fury. Over time, you learn to douse those flames, though inexplicably you cannot douse your passion for the game.</p>
<p>India isn't your typical Football country, yes the boys play the game in Kolkata, Goa and Kerala and let us not forget our seven sisters in the North East. But the impact of the game could be best explained by the average sports enthusiast tuning into recorded highlights of a 1976 cricket match while Mohan Bagan and Dempo fight out the Durand Cup final, live on TV.</p>
<p>The World Cup though is different. It draws people from the fringes, some out of passion, most out of a need to seem cool and acceptable. By now, everyone has learnt that Brazil is the heart of the game and Europe its mind, with Argentina some place in between. Ronaldinho, all of them hope will run around with Ronaldo, Carlos and Cafu, Adriano and Cicinho shooting holes through opposition defences, netting goals by the dozen.</p>
<p>If they were to be right, we would rather hand the trophy to Brazil this evening and go into collective slumber. Thank God, the cup isn't in Italy, the referees aren't game for a fix and the cup final is an open contest between 32 of the best teams in the world. Breathe easy, sit back in your armchair and brace yourself for the uncertainty of sport. It is going to be a ride to remember, so hold tight at the bend and stay glued to the action.</p>
<p>And if you do not find the time to pray, please don't feel guilty, Football is divine.</p>

<p>A CMOS imager is a solid state imaging device (commonly referred to as an i.c. or "chip”) that is created using an (semiconductor) industry standard Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) process.</p>
<p>Solid state imaging devices convert photons (light) into electric energy in a spatially coherent manor. These devices are at the heart of all digital imaging products, digital still cameras, camcorders and cell-phone cameras.</p>
<p>Until the last five (or so) years all of these devices were of a type called CCD’s (Charge Coupled Device), however CMOS imagers are now beginning to replace CCD’s in these products due to numerous cost and technological advantages.</p>

<p>Our sources report that during the last year N. Zisimos has been living alone in a neighbourhood with a bad reputation,in the west part of Athens called "Old red district". There, he has transformed an apartment in a dungeon, the "Temple", as he calls it" ,used for varius illegal activities,like orgies, animal sex etc. In addition to that Mr(!) Zisimos has declared that in the next gay parade,that will take place in Athens,he intends to be the main attraction, although he was not willing to clarify ,how exactly he will achieve that. 195.167.52.4 13:06, 9 June 2006 (UTC)The BatMobil195.167.52.4 13:06, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Il termine “crucco” è un adattamento italiano del serbocroato “kruch”, che significa pane. La parola risale alla seconda guerra mondiale, quando i soldati italiani la utilizzarono per soprannominare gli abitanti della Iugoslavia meridionale con cui venivano in contatto. Per questo motivo, quella regione veniva chiamata anche “terra crucca”. In un secondo tempo il termine, anche nella forma “cruco”, venne applicato dai soldati che combattevano in Russia e poi dai partigiani ai soldati tedeschi (nella foto, un gruppo di paracadutisti pluridecorati dell'esercito della Germania posa con Adolf Hitler). Come aggettivo, “crucco” fu riferito, in senso dispregiativo, a tutto ciò che era tedesco. Ora è sinonimo anche di persona testarda.</p>

<p>The Teachers Guild of New South Wales was founded in 1891 by a group of leading educators who wanted to standardise the registration of teachers and private schools. It is the oldest teachers' body in New South Wales, predating both the education unions and the various Heads organisations. The Guild helped to develop curriculum standards and syllabuses, and operated the Teachers' Central Registry, which helped qualified teachers to find work in approved schools.</p>
<p>Following World War II the Guild developed a diploma course to assist with the formal qualification of teachers for independent schools, and this led to the establishment of a Guild Teachers College. The College later amalgamated with the Sydney College of Advanced Education in the early 1980s.</p>

<p>Does temperature affect Acid-Base Reactions? My project is about varying temperatures of the acid (vinegar) in chemical reactions. I like this project because I like just about just about anything that blows up. I think it will help the world by teaching chemists what not to mix at hot and cold temperatures. For example; a 15 year old who is home alone mixes 5 gallons boiling battery acid and 5 pounds of heated lye. A big boom rocks the house and shatters all the windows. His “lab” is in ruins and the 15 year old is crying, he should have read my report!</p>
<p><br />
Research Paper</p>
<p>For thousands of years people have known that vinegar, lemon juice and many other foods taste sour. However, it was not until a few hundred years ago that it was discovered why these things taste sour; because they are all acids. The term acid, in fact, comes from the Latin term acere, which means sour. While there are many slightly different definitions of acids and bases, in this lesson we will introduce the fundamentals of acid/base chemistry. In the seventeenth century, the English writer and amateur chemist Robert Boyle first labeled substances as either acids or bases (he called bases alkalies) according to the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acids taste sour, are corrosive to metals, change litmus (a dye extracted from lichens) red, and become less acidic when mixed with bases.</li>
<li>Bases feel slippery, change litmus blue, and become less basic when mixed with acids.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Boyle and others tried to explain why acids and bases behave the way they do, the first reasonable definition of acids and bases would not be suggested until 200 years later.</p>
<p>In the late 1800's, the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius proposed that water can dissolve many compounds by separating them into their individual ions. Arrhenius suggested that acids are compounds that contain hydrogen and can dissolve in water to release hydrogen ions into solutions.</p>
<p>Now that you know the history, let’s get to the hard, cold data. Bases have a pH higher than 7. Bases are slippery and bitter and have the ability to turn litmus blue. It also yields hydroxyl ions when dissolved in water. Bases always conduct an electric current. They can also act as a proton accepter and can donate a pair of electrons to form a covalent bond. Bases have these following proprieties a. Bases release a hydroxide ion into water solution b. Bases neutralize acids in a neutralization reaction c. Bases denature protein d. Bases taste bitter e. Bases conduct an electric current</p>
<p>Acids are sour and have a pH of less than seven on the pH scale. Acids have the ability to turn litmus blue. It also yields hydroxyl ions when dissolved in water. Acids always conduct an electric current. They can also act as a proton accepter and can donate a pair of electrons to form a covalent bond. Acids have the following proprieties: a. All acids taste sour. b. Acids make a blue vegetable dye called "litmus" turn red. c. Acids destroy the chemical properties of bases d. Acids conduct an electric current. e. Upon chemically reacting with an active metal, acids will evolve hydrogen gas (H 2)</p>
<p>Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. Years ago, a mathematician named Boltzmann figured out that the kinetic energy of a system such as this was distributed in a predictable way. Even though the individual objects continually exchanged kinetic energy with each other, there was a predictable result to how the kinetic energy was distributed.</p>
<p>He discovered that the varying values for kinetic energy occurred with predicable frequency. The distribution of the kinetic energy values based on his work is now known as the Boltzmann Distribution. When graphed, it produces a classic curve. This curve is in the form of a bell-shaped distribution. Here are some more definitions for kinetic energy a. Kinetic energy is an expression of the fact that a moving object can do work on anything it hits; it quantifies the amount of work the object could do as a result of its motion. The total mechanical energy of an object is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy. b. Kinetic energy is energy of motion. The kinetic energy of an object is the energy it possesses because of its motion. c. Kinetic Energy is equal to ½ mv2 o (m=mass and v=velocity/2 squared, or Half of mass and velocity squared.</p>
<p>An element is a substance composed of atoms having an identical number of protons in each nucleus. Elements cannot be reduced to simpler substances by normal chemical means. At first people thought fire, water, air, and earth were the only elements, we now know better, here are more elements</p>
<ul>
<li>Chemical element, the class of atoms with the same number of protons in the nucleus</li>
<li>Electrical element, any device with terminals at which it may be connected directly with other devices. It can also mean an antenna furnace (either parasitic or active). In circuitry, it can be used to specify a portion of an integrated circuit that contributes directly to the IC's operation</li>
<li>Picture element, better known as a pixel on a display device</li>
</ul>
<p>Enthalpy is a thermodynamic function of a system, equivalent to the sum of the internal energy of the system plus the product of its volume multiplied by the pressure exerted on it by its surroundings. It is also called heat content. (Thermodynamic means a characteristic of or resulting from the conversion of heat into other forms of energy: in other words, it is a change in energy) The Octet rule is, in chemistry, the statement that when atoms combine to form molecules they generally each lose, gain, or share leaving electrons until they attain or share eight; also called Lewis rule of eight.</p>
<p>Hypothesis</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that the greatest amount of gases will be released if a hot acid and a cold base are mixed or vise-versa. The least amount of gases will be released at cold temperatures for the acids and the bases.</p>
<p>Email me at graham66@gmail.com if you want the rest of the paper</p>
<p>Gases are filling up the balloon The vinegar and baking soda are reacting and releasing carbon dioxide</p>
<p>In this case, a good amount of gas is released, but the balloon is far from popping.</p>

<p>Pablo Cruz and the third World Assassins was formed in 2006 by guitarist/vocalist/percussionist, Osvaldo de Ballester and long time friend Guillermo Miguel Moreno. Growing up in the harsh political and oppressive conditions of south America both members were able to escape by playing music on the coast of Argentina. Both members met at en early age as they attended the same highschool, they began playing on the streets Buenos Aires, slowly getting recognition of local musicians and at the same time saving money for their aspirations in the music world. In 2004 Osvaldo and Miguel left their native home for a much cooler location, Canada. When they arrived in Canada the two made St. Catharines their home and have been writing, recording, and playing the local circuit ever since. The north allowed them to further develop their skills as well it gave them acces to recording equipment which would act as their most powerful tool for laying down their magical music. In 2005 with the release of their debut album in North America, "Las manos de dios", the members decided to add three more members to the band in order to allow for a fuller sound in their live performance. Ryan Baker, Lester Mclaughlin (formerly in "Rage Against"), and Alonzo Lopez (co-producer Satana, No Dice, Monorail Pileup) brought a dynamic to the band that was like no other, their professionalism as musicians and their understanding of the latin/rock/blues/electronic music allowed the band to perform and write effortlessly. The band is currently finishing up a tour of south america, including shows in Brasil, Guyana, Chile, Argenina, Colombia, and even Cuba. For tour dates check out the site LOCOPOLLOS.com/tourdates. When the band concludes their tour of south american tour they will be playng some charity shows in Africa and Asia. They will be returning to St. Catharines to their home studio to write and record their new album which will be set for release summer 2007.</p>

<p>Rihab Charida is a Palestinian activist living in Sydney, Australia. She is a member of the Socialist Alliance, and has written a number of articles for their newspaper, The Green Left.</p>
<p>Rihab has appeared on Australian television. She previously hosted a The Palestine Hour program on Channel 31, a Sydney-based community TV station, however this channel no longer exists. She has also been a guest on SBS's current affairs debate show Insight. During an Insight episode discussing the question "What is terrorism?", Rihab made the following statements:</p>
<p>RIHAB CHARIDA, PALESTINIAN ACTIVIST: I think in regards to terrorism generally, whether it's in Palestine or anywhere else, the root cause of terrorism is oppression and anybody that's genuinely interested in stopping terrorism, whether it's in Palestine or in Northern Ireland or in, you know, Sri Lanka or wherever it is, anybody who is genuinely interested in getting rid of suicide bombings or any attacks, must be opposed to the reasons why suicide bombings happen to begin with. Suicide bombings are a direct result of oppression and occupation. JENNY BROCKIE: But does that make them justifiable? RIHAB CHARIDA: It basically - let's not forget that occupation under international law is illegal. Resisting occupation is legal under international law. Let's just go to international law. Resisting occupation... JENNY BROCKIE: So are you saying that you do think the suicide bombings are justifiable? RIHAB CHARIDAI: I say yes, because the Palestinians have tried for many years other means of fighting, you know, their cause.</p>
<p><br />
Rihab has travelled to the West Bank a number of times, and has written about her experiences, which she describes as helping the local Palestinian population "resist Israeli occupation".</p>

<p>KASHF-UL-MAHJUB is the monumental work of the great Sufi Teacher, Al-Hujwiri, who in his saintly function has been known as Data-Gang-Buksh. It presents the science of direct apprehension, functioning as if there were no ego-self interposed between God and His creation.</p>
<p>The science of direct apprehension is also called Kahsf or insight by the sufis.</p>

<p>Richard Lorne (Dick) Spooner was born in 1940 in the Northwestern Ontario town of Sioux Lookout. After his family resided briefly in Robinson Lake and Nakina they arrived in Port Arthur, now the northern side of Thunder Bay, on his third birthday. That was early September 1943.</p>
<p>Dick received his education in Port Arthur and, ten years after high school, enrolled in the Communications Design Course at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto.</p>
<p>In 1972 Dick graduated with honours from OCA majoring in illustration, graphic design and photography. With new visual processing skills to negotiate with, Dick joined the Thunder Bay CKPR-CHFD TV team in July 1972.</p>
<p>After five years in television Dick moved on to advertising agency challenges and graphic and print sales for local printing firms.</p>
<p>Since his teenage years Dick has developed regular followers who enjoy his illustrations and graphic designs. The list of patrons have grown throughout the years and even more so since graduating from art college and adding the hands on experiences of television, print and photography.</p>
<p>Dick's life experiences are both business and creative as shown by him being a partner in a photo studio and a photo lab and handling business accounts at an ad agency and a printing firm.</p>
<p>Dick's trademark works feature Northwestern Ontario landscapes and the visual positioning of the city of Thunder Bay as a foreground to a land etched by ice age glaciers.</p>
<p>"My first limited edition print was a pair of line drawings of the CNR and the CPR Railway Stations." To local people the railway station and the railway itself was the link to the rest of Canada from their remote position in the interior of a vast country. Ships that entered our country three thousand kilometers away have now become part of our history and our visual identity. "Rocky rugged shorelines make a dramatic backdrop for a marine illustration".</p>
<p>Dick's first colour limited print featured a gathering place. In October 1989 Dick released a limited edition, full colour print, entitled 'Bay Street'. It was a watercolour of the Hoito Finlandia Club Building. This subject struck a nostalgic cord with local residents and ex pat Lakeheaders all across the country and indeed far beyond our borders.</p>
<p>Since that time prints 'Outward Bound', 'Cornerstones Of Yesterday', 'Mile Zero (The Pagoda)', 'Winter Of '96' and 'Quedoc' have completely sold out.</p>
<p>"Northwestern Ontario is an incredibly vast area. We as individuals evolve differently than those of other parts of the country where three or four generations grow up with thousands of people per square mile. It's fifteen hundred km from the near north City of Sudbury to the westernmost Ontario town of Kenora. We have the modern amenities, the big box stores, the electronics, symphony orchestras and movie theatres but thousands of us can still be at our cottages within an hour and on Lake Superior in our boat within half an hour. Thanksgiving out here should be a week long!"</p>

<p>Yamaha Fz750 1985-1991 was Yamahas entry into the comppetive middleweight sports bike market. The FZ750 marked a considorable jump in technolagy and performance for Yamahas motorcyles. Yamaha whose reputation had been built on its high performance 2 stoke competion machines where as yet to make a high performance 4 stroke road machine. Though never amonst the top seller list the features of the Fz750 can be found on almost all high performance Jpaanese motorcycles today. in fact the basic desgn remains unchanged over twenty years later.</p>
<p>The Fz750 engine though based on the tried and tested formula of the unit construction, all alluminium, transverse mounted four cylinder, four stroke it was a major departure from the standard engines of the time. The engine featured water cooling to the head and barrel and the twin cam cylinder head contained 20 valves. The 5 valves per cylinder design (3 inlet and 2 exhaust) has since become a Yamaha trademark and endowed the machine with at the time where excelent torque, power and fuel economy. The complex casting of the head is constructed in two parts with the head containing the combustion chamber roofs seperate from the cam box (the engine is a genuine overhead cam, not a high cam like most Japanese engines). The valve where operated directly from the chain driven cams via bucket followers. Despite the large valve train the inlet tracts are almost directly staight to the four downdraft 36mm mikuni carburators. The inclided cylinder head placed the carburators (and large airbox) inside what would convventionally be the fuel tank while, giving the machine a lower centre of gravity it had the disadvantage of lenghtening the wheelbase and the high carburators required an electically driven fuel pump.</p>
<p>The chassis was slightly more convional. The steel double cradle frame contained two upper frame rails passing around the outside of the the head and not over it like on a conentional frame. The suspension consisted of the tradional telescopic forks and a single shock attached via a rising rate linkage.</p>
<p>For the 1987 season the engine was enlarged by increasing the bore and stoke and housed into what was then becoming the standard for sports bikes of an all alluminium alloy frame the machine became the FZR1000. It was begining of the end, while soldiering on until l991 advances in chassis, wheel, tyre and suspeanion design had relegated the FZ750 to the sports tourer end of the cataloge. The model was finally discontinued in 1991 and the last discounted bikes cleared from the dealer floors in 1992.</p>
<p>For all its inovations and its pure sports marketing tag the Fz never quite made the top grade in the sports market, but the lack of any fundemental problems and its inherrent reliability, build quality and practicality means machine can be still seen in everyday use today.</p>

<p>Partial Unbirthing</p>
<p>Partial Unbirthing (adult head insertion into the vagina) is a fetishism that is extremely rare and probably one of the rarest of all human sexual activities. It is a curious paraphilia usually considered a true fetishism. The definition of a fetishism has changed over the years and has moved away from only requiring inanimate objects for sexual gratification to today's view that a great many varieties of less common sexual activities concentrating on body parts and even sexual organ size are now considered fetishes. Partial Unbirthing is a Fetishism in this newer and broader sense of the word. In the actual practice of this it is not a form of Vore and is only practiced by a very few devoted adult couples. One reason for this is that to be mutually enjoyable and erotic, it requires that the vagina must stretch to enormous size which requires a consenting, cooperative, and extended effort between the sexual partners -- just to start doing it. This of course is only possible where the woman has an extremely huge opening of her pelvis. Such a Justo Major Pelvis (also called "Giant Pelvis") is where the minimum pelvis size is enlarged in every direction by a factor of 1.5, or more, and it is only present in less than one in a thousand adult women.</p>
<p>Women of average size sometimes hugely stretch their vaginas for purposes of greater stimulation or more intense orgasms. Also some women have a fullness fetish that is sometimes called a "bulk intromission" fetish. With gradual repeated stretching they occasionally stretch almost to the walls of their pelvic bone opening (approximately the size of a newborn's head). Those that do this are quite rare. It is easy to see that the ratio comparing an adult head size to a newborn head size (a 21 inch circumference to a 14 inch circumference) is a 3 to 2 (or 1.5) ratio -- making the adult head size this 1.5 ratio times the 14 inch newborn head size. This ratio is just the exact same linear 1.5 ratio that a pelvis of "minimum" Justo Major size has compared to an average 11 inch wide pelvis. For a woman with a Justo Major pelvis of 1.5 ratio to vaginally stretch to adult head size would be like the average woman with an average size pelvis stretching to newborn head size or like this average size woman being vaginally double fisted by a man who has fairly large hands.</p>
<p>A well known government Hispanic study included the anthropometry of nearly 5000 adult women and anthropometric calipers measured the largest pelvis at 19 inches biiliac width (side-to-side bone width). This made her 19 inch wide pelvis have a 1.73 ratio when compared to the average size pelvis of 11 inches width. This is even a larger size pelvis than a pelvis of "minimum" Justo Major size (that requires at least a 1.5 ratio). If a woman with a pelvis of this very large size were to do the same vaginal stretching to near her bone opening size, she could then vaginally take inside a huge 24 inch adult head. That size head would be 24 minus 21 inches or 3 inches larger than the 21 inch circumference adult head that the pelvis of the 1.5 ratio Justo Major size could potentially stretch around. The larger size 19 inch wide pelvis would require a lesser degree of stretching to be comfortable when taking inside a 21 inch (much smaller size) adult head. This degree of comfort might be comparable to a woman of average size being vaginally double fisted by hands of considerably smaller size, or even being fisted by just one large hand. A less common but larger one in five thousand Justo Major pelvis has a size to potentially make partial unbirthing easier. The 19 inch wide one in 5000 Justo Major pelvis was indeed a huge and rare size.</p>
<p>The above illustrates how rare a sufficiently large pelvis would be in order that gradual and often repeated vaginal stretching practice might comfortably reach a partial unbirthing size. The rarity of the fetish is further compounded by how few such women with this huge pelvic size would be motivated by the fantasy and potential stimulation to devote the weeks or sometimes months of stretching practice with no assured guarantee of success. Also the rarity of her adult partner, who would work with her in many repeated sessions to help her gradually stretch, and who wanted to do partial unbirthing in a safe, erotic, and mutually enjoyable manner has to be considered. When the pelvis is less than Justo Major size (or &lt; 1.5 times the 11 inch average width), with the exception of small midget heads, such a fetish could never even be considered -- as bone will not stretch. Only a very few confirmed instances of this are even known.</p>
<p>It is estimated that less than one in a million sexual partners have done partial unbirthing making it a very very rare human sexual activity.</p>

Entendemos por información el transmitir de manera objetiva y con apego estricto a la verdad de los acontecimientos que marcan la marcha de la sociedad. Para tal efecto ATV cuenta con un Código de Ética interno y a su vez ha suscrito el Código de Ética Unificado de la Industria de la Televisión. Tenemos un sistema de autorregulación que se materializa a través de advertencias que emitimos antes de la emisión de nuestros programas, indicando para qué tipo de público es apto el contenido a ser transmitido.</p>

<p>Valores que deseamos preservar: El mas importante valor que deseamos preservar es el de la unidad de la familia, concebida esta como un núcleo natural en el que se desarrolla el ser humano y como una fuente de valores supremos como el amor, la educación, y la honestidad. Otro valor de suma importancia y que se prioriza en ATV es la libertad en todo el sentido de la palabra, ya que este es un atributo inherente al ser humano. Un aspecto importante de este valor es la libertad de expresión que es el baluarte de la democracia y que se practica irrestrictamente en ATV, lo cual está reflejado en el prestigio y aceptación de nuestro noticiero.</p>

<p>Since Kelly Connor has been a little girl, there have been three constants in her life: the Lord, family, and music. She was born in northwestern Ohio where she started piano lessons at age six, began performing at age nine, and started teaching piano at age fourteen.</p>
<p>Kelly is a refreshing talent with an impressive resume. She has been performing in Christian music circles for over twenty years. Her musical ability reaches beyond the boundaries of a beautiful voice and touches the heart. Kelly debuted on the national scene through her release of sound tracks, "THE WEDDING COLLECTION," for WORD, Inc. and a record of love songs for Christians, "Heart Of The Matter." This collection of love songs for Christians was selected album of the month in January 1993, by WORD, INC. These songs reveal only a glimpse of what her vocal richness can bring to the quality and variety of music you have come to respect from iMPACT and WORD. Kelly's unique vocal skills give new identity to this collection of familiar love songs. WORD, Inc. has used Kelly on various projects as well as studio work. She has done nearly two hundred demos in high and low keys for WORD, INC. Kelly was nominated in 1994 for the DOVE AWARD for best new artist, best new album, (THE HEART OF THE MATTER) and album art work.</p>
<p>Her success and experience are not limited to only these love ballads. Her recordings encompass a variety of styles, from contemporary to traditional, from inspirational to jazz. Still her music carries a message of love, hope and sincerity to those who attend her concerts and listen to her recordings.</p>
<p>Kelly's second national release, "My Heart Is His," was released on Song Painters Records in the spring of 1995. It was #1 in the summer of 1994 in the Dallas, Fort Worth, and Denver areas. It also received heavy air play in Alaska, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Florida. It has received national and international air play on Pat Boone and Bill Pearce's syndicated radio programs. It is carried nationally on the SKYLIGHT SATELLITE NETWORK.</p>
<p>Kelly appears in the "GAITHER'S CHRISTMAS VIDEO" and has appeared in concert with the GAITHER VOCAL BAND. She has also appeared in concert with THE TALLEY'S, BUDDY GREENE, JIM COLE, ALLISON DURHAM SPEER, PAT BOONE, MID SOUTH, SINGING AMERICANS, GOSPEL HARMONY BOYS, and others. Kelly has shared the stage with speakers DR. CHARLES STANLEY, ZOLA LEVITT, NICKY CRUZ, OLIVER NORTH and BEN KINCHLOW.</p>
<p>Active in local Christian radio and television, Kelly was host, producer and talent coordinator of her own Christian music show on WTLW television. WTLW has often used Kelly as anchor and host for their telethons, co-host of their local magazine program, (Turning Point) and writing, performing, producing jingles and theme music.</p>
<p>Christian schools (Lima Baptist Temple, Temple Christian School, Toledo Christian School, Shalom Christian School) invite Kelly to give a concert for their students. She appeared in November 1994 at the Association of Christian School International (ACSI) in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>Kelly gave several concerts in May 1995 at HOSANNA '95 in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>Kelly has performed with the LIMA SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA and has the "charts" and the talent to work with the larger churches that have orchestras.</p>

<p>The Technical Requirements Checklist or the TRC is a set of video game guidelines developed by Sony Corporation for software producers in effort to standardize code procedures as well as restrict overtaxing of its video game platforms. Recent concerns include battery overconsumption in the Sony portable PSP and backwards compatibility for Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 games in the upcoming Playstation 3 release. This, however, is a very difficult situation as developers have already completed many flagship games for the PSP that are graphic intensive and violate the battery use policy. This is a complicated matter because the flagship games are vital to the sales of the PSP unit. Backwards compatibility is highly significant, as it is a major selling point for the PS3 unit.</p>

<p>Bob Harvey Genre: Rock Biography Bob Harvey is usually known, if at all, for a brief stint in a band with whom he never recorded. That band, however, was a big one: the Jefferson Airplane. Harvey was their original bassist, playing a standup acoustic bass for a few months in their first lineup in 1965. He has actually played and recorded with a few other groups, though it's as a Jefferson Airplane trivia question that his name pops up.</p>
<p>Harvey first recorded as a banjo player with country singer Les Overstreet. In 1963, living in the San Francisco Bay Area, he co-founded the bluegrass group the Slippery Rock String Band, in which he played standup bass. It was as a folk musician that he met Marty Balin, then part of another folk group, the Town Criers. When he heard Balin was forming a folk-rock group in early 1965, he successfully auditioned for the bass position. Already in his early thirties, he was considerably older than the rest of the band; perhaps more problematically, his acoustic bass didn't fit in with the electric presence of a rock group. He did buy an electric bass around the beginning of autumn 1965, but shortly afterward he was replaced by Jack Casady, right before the Jefferson Airplane began recording for RCA.</p>
<p>Harvey went back to the Slippery Rock String Band and sang lead on their only record. In the late '60s, he was in the Holy Mackerel, a band which also featured singer/songwriter Paul Williams. But Harvey left before their obscure album was finished, although one of his songs, "Wildflowers," was included. He then went into acting, journalism, and civil service. In 2001, a band Harvey had formed in the late '90s with Brian Fowler, San Francisco Blue, put out the CD Idiot's Vision, pressed in a limited quantity of a thousand copies and issued by Cranium Music in New Zealand. ~ Richie Unterberger, All Music Guide</p>

<p>An annoying obxious snob usually present at the JJB message board. She spends most of her days posting really ugly clothes that she believes are awesome because they cost thousands of dollars. Then she tries to proove to everyone that she's not lying. Why? Who knows. If you were really that rich, would you really feel the need to show it off on an American message board then spend hours defending yourself? She never posts her picture because she's probably horrid. On one of her dresses it said size 10 but she claims to be 5' 8" and 115 lbs. She's size 10 because she has a big boobs ("all natural of course"). Right.</p>
<p>But you know, we're all just super jealous of her because we're poor people that shop at AE and aeropostale.</p>

<p>Dr Jon Jenkins is a member of the Legislative Council in NSW Australia.</p>
<p>Jon's Inaugural Speech after being elected to Parliament.</p>
<p>I am told that the purpose of this speech is to introduce myself and my purpose to this honourable House. However, as this is the last parliamentary session of the year and there is a large amount of legislation to consider, I understand the desire to be brief.</p>
<p>My life, although rather short in terms of years, has been an unusual and interesting one and is difficult to summarise quickly. I am sure that someone placed the ancient Oriental curse on me at birth: "May you lead an interesting life!"</p>
<p>My direct ancestors, a stonemason and a convict in the first fleets, were mixed with most of the races on this earth, including possibly some indigenous races. In short, like many good Australians, I am of mixed race. But, like all mixed breeds, we are a pretty tough lot.</p>
<p>Environmental issues run deep in my family. Jenkins House on Jenkins Hill takes pride of place in Lane Cove River National Park, a significant part of which was a gift from my great-grandfather to the people of New South Wales. My father, a veteran and an amateur entomologist, has bred and released many rare species of butterflies and their food plants for most of his 84 years. My involvement with conservation groups, such as the Platypus Conservancy, predates my involvement with politics.</p>
<p>My family also has a very rich political history. My uncle Eric Lambert, together with Hardy, was a founding Communist activist and author of such weighty tomes as The Twenty Thousand Thieves and The Veterans. That association continues in this era with my older sister, herself a dedicated socialist, academic and author. I think she describes herself as an existential anarchist. Perhaps someone on the Left can explain what that means to me one day. Conversely, my father was an original One Nation supporter. So you can imagine what the post-Christmas political discussions were like in our household. I thought the middle road was the safest, but of course everyone has issues with me!</p>
<p>My own early childhood was far from ideal: a traumatic start as a ward of the State, following nightmare custody battles to the only child of a single father. I was always interested in science and, in particular, natural sciences and medicine. A motor vehicle accident, and 1½ years in hospital and several years recovering, convinced me that clinical medicine was not a career for me. Further, as a direct result of the accident, and continuing disabilities, I needed a more sedentary vocation than molecular biology/virology for which I originally spent 10 years training. Further studies in computer science allowed me to combine my interests in the form of viral coat protein analysis structure prediction and later virtual surgery and 3D imagery construction. I have worked in private industry and at universities and I also have my own—or at least I did until I came here—education consulting business. Until recently I was at the Bond University on the Gold Coast, and I have offered my resignation to the university. However, they have declined and have asked me to stay on in an adjunct position, which I am very proud to do.</p>
<p>Currently, I live on the beach on the North Coast of New South Wales with my beautiful wife and the two best children one could ask for. I should also mention that we have a mongrel, or should I say a mixed-breed kelpie dog! My general interests include the natural sciences, medicine and medical education. I also have an obvious interest in road safety and related issues. I am an avid water polo player, a member of our local surf club, and try to surf, especially with my children, whenever possible. I have travelled across this country many times, including to our most remote and beautiful places.</p>
<p>Members, and Madam President, some of you may ask why I have come to this place. To leave my research and the exciting opening of the first private medical school in Australia, which I went there to be involved with many years ago, has caused some considerable soul searching on my part. I have given up a full-time continuing academic position and private consulting to come here in the glare of much adverse publicity, and under probably extreme scrutiny, only for an uncertain future! I will also have to leave my beautiful beach sunrises and the best surfing secret on the coast! But hardest of all was the decision to leave my family for long periods. I take this opportunity to thank my wife for allowing me to pursue this effort.</p>
<p>Well, I can assure you it is not for the remuneration and there is no pension at the end of my period in this House. Rather, I have come here for a reason. I have a passion for the environment and its protection and preservation. My firm belief is that our precious natural resources and heritage have not been managed properly. I could go on in this House with endless examples of that, and I am sure you have all read of them in the papers. I would like to use one example, that is, the recent fires in our southern border areas. The fault for the damage to both property and wilderness lies squarely with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the influence of the fanatical environmentalists within the organisation and its quangos, such as the National Parks Association.</p>
<p>The recent cataclysmic fires in the New South Wales Victorian border area have confirmed the fallacy of wilderness areas. It seems possible that at least two of our most rare species may be further endangered and many others are now, or soon will be, in serious trouble due to the resulting vastness of the scorched earth. Even today, two-thirds of one of our most beautiful parks has less than 30 per cent groundcover. There is little spring food or shelter for our precious endangered animals. The scorched earth was a direct result from fuel loads of more than 100 tonnes per hectare, many times the recommended maximum for that type of forest. Following rains in the area then caused large-scale erosion and, combined with ash, have caused fish kills in the local headwaters of small streams and have rendered some of Canberra's dams effectively unusable.</p>
<p>This was all predictable and was in fact predicted 10 years ago. As every inquiry has found, including the recent Commonwealth parliamentary inquiry, and as commonsense told us, it is a simple undeniable fact that if the parks had been managed properly this level of devastation may not have occurred. This is far too detailed and complex a problem to discuss at length but I am happy to further this discussion at any time with anyone and at any place. Perhaps one might read the Commonwealth report: "A Nation Charred" and Peter Clack's book Firestorm: Trial by Fire before they come to see me.</p>
<p>This irrational and outdated fundamentalist ideology within the National Parks and Wildlife Service was commented on at some length by the retiring head of the service, Mr Brian Gilligan. I applaud him for his bravery. Note that I have met many people in the National Parks and Wildlife Service who also see this problem. The fundamentalists certainly have a foothold, but there are many thinking and rational people within the service who can see the detrimental effect this ideology is having on our natural heritage.</p>
<p>To get to the point: proper fire and feral management requires access, and access requires roads. The fundamentalist fanatics have prevented access to many of our precious parks by causing the closure of the majority of roads and tracks. As a simple and expected result, these tracks have become overgrown and inaccessible, and this has prevented the management, use and enjoyment of the vast majority of our precious parks. Except in small, protected and geographically isolated areas, such as parts of Tasmania or some islands, it is too late to leave nature to itself: there are too many external influences that we have introduced and we need to be managing at both the macro and micro level now.</p>
<p>The ravaging of our parks by feral animals, weeds and fire will be repeated over and over and over and over again until there are no parks to protect. And the fanatical environmentalists and other irrational, unthinking apparatchiks will be directly responsible.</p>
<p>Tasmania is facing a potential crisis, which could be the acid test of the reign of logic over the ideological madness: the fox has been found in Tasmania. How will they manage the fox in this pristine area without road access? What of emerging threats like the cane toad, the fire ant and the devastating mesquite? How will we deal with these without access? In the case of converted State Forests the existing roads have been used by heavy machinery for as much as 100 years, and probably as much as 100 before that by bullock teams hauling out logs. All of a sudden when an area becomes a national park the first thing they do is close the roads, effectively preventing access.</p>
<p>And so we ask the question: why have the roads been closed in our national parks? There is no rational or scientific reason for these closures, it is just the unthinking quasi-religious guilt of the ecofundamentalists: "Man and his machines are evil. We don't want you in our parks". The closures have and will continue to have devastating effects for our natural resources and heritage.</p>
<p>I remember wanting to go and join the protests in Tasmania to save the Huon, and I still think it was right to save those ancient forests. I considered myself a Greenie because I understood the precious and irreplaceable nature of the environment from both points of view: as a simple person looking up at nature, and also as a scientist studying the smallest sub-atomic particles to the complex and ill-understood interactions of our small blue planet to the unfathomable expanse of the universe. Now I have to confess I am an anti-Greenie.</p>
<p>So how is it that the environmental movement has become so perverted? The Government itself should not escape scrutiny or blame in this matter. Either by tacit approval or at the very least a simple lack of due diligence it has allowed this penchant of the instruments which have charge of our heritage and natural resources to occur. And I will continue to remind the Government of this in this House. I refuse to allow the cult of the environment to treat our natural heritage as some unholy, untouchable shrine in front of which we have to prostrate our guilt-racked bodies as we pass the locked gates! Our natural heritage is ours, and our children's, to protect, to manage and to enjoy.</p>
<p>And here is the crux of one of the main issues: if we cannot enjoy our natural resources, our natural heritage, we will not care for them. And this is what is happening: our national parks are a closed sacred cow that we are not allowed to enter, and so have become uncared for and, in many cases, hated places! Do not mistake me, I am not one of the believers that monetary value is the key to ensure survival, although I can see the logic. Rather, to spend time with friends and family in some of nature's most wonderful places is beyond all monetary and political value. I acknowledge that it is possible to love a place to death but, as usage demands and as more people start to impact on the environment, the solution is management, not banishment.</p>
<p>Many places have controlled access, and this has been very successful. But the ranting of the fanatical fundamentalist Luddites continues to cause the blanket closure of our parks.</p>
<p>One of the last places accessible to me and my family locally was Mebbin State Forest—now Mebbin National Park. This is not pristine forest; it has been logged for possibly in excess of 150 years, both by mechanised means and by bullock teams. Mind you, they knew how to log in the old days—they took timber, but they left enough for the next generation. Mebbin contains some very special places of both natural and historic value. This place certainly is not in the category of places being loved to death. It receives, on average, perhaps half a dozen vehicles per day on the main access road, but more on the weekends and less during the week. The forest was crisscrossed by many named roads, which had been in constant use for more than a century.</p>
<p>Except for one area—appropriately named Bog Onion Road—there was no significant erosion, and the roads were accessible to most conventional vehicles, although some had four-wheel-drive-only sections. There was no reason to close any roads, with perhaps the one named exception. But, come the conversion to a national park, and all but the main loop road were closed! For me, this was personally devastating and was what really tipped the balance from someone who had been apolitical until that point in time to suddenly becoming political. These roads were not closed for any scientific reason or on any logical basis, but simply on a whim. Now that this place where my family and friends have spent many hours is effectively closed to us, many of the roads have already grown over and are now inaccessible for fire and feral management.</p>
<p>This follows the same precedent set by all the other parks in this region. Meetings with and submissions to the local park management have been a futile waste. I make a prediction: As the fuel loads build, cataclysmic fires will occur in this region in the foreseeable future. The animals that manage to survive the initial furnace will have no cover to hide from the feral cats, foxes or birds of prey, and the subsequent rains—we can get up to 20 inches, or 500 millilitres, in a single day—will cause massive erosion.</p>
<p>The issue is not really about access. The issue is about the attitude to the management of "your" parks. I know that when the attitude and management are corrected access to "our" parks will be restored. There will be no reason to lock people out! I quote the comments of a self-alleged guardian of the environment by the name of the Hon. Bob Brown made in a recent interview on Radio National:</p>
<p>"… it's about managing the environment; it's not about locking them out."</p>
<p>I admit that I am quoting him somewhat out of context, but the principle is the same: it is about management.</p>
<p>Now that I have reinforced the environmentalists' dislike of me and the Outdoor Recreation Party, I will try to mend some bridges. I will state for the record that I actually agree with many aspects of the green agenda. How could I not, having been trained in the scientific arts? As for my own politics, those on the right will probably say I am a left-wing radical; those on the left on the Government side will probably call me a right-wing fascist. I suppose I would consider my own politics to be a little bit left of centre on most issues.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of being a single-issue party is that I do not have to toe the line on party ideology—simply because there is none! Each issue is decided on its merits. In fact, was that not our forbears' very intention for this House? So I make a promise to this House: I will always try to listen to all sides, and debate the issues logically and with the quiet forethought, compassion and wisdom of one who has led an interesting life.</p>
<p>However, on issues on the environment I will be uncompromising, loud, aggressive and persistent. In doing this I realise that the business of Parliament must of necessity be one of compromise and agreement. Unlike some, I accept the pragmatic nature of a working democracy as the best possible solution to government, and I put my trust in the basic honesty and passion on both sides of the political coin. I also state that I believe that this House is a House of review, not a House of obstruction, and that in the general sense the Government is elected to govern and should be allowed to do so.</p>
<p>However, I reserve the right to deny support for legislation which, either by accident or design, would have an adverse impact on the constituency as a whole. And I further reserve the right to suggest improvements or amendments to legislation that might increase its efficacy or protect those who otherwise might be adversely affected. I look forward to robust and thorough debate on the many challenging issues in this House. I will at all times try to be honest to myself, to this House and to the people of New South Wales. I thank honourable members for their indulgence on this occasion.</p>

<p><b>Born:</b> 1965, Melbourne</p>
<p>Before Peter Alexander was known as Australia's "Pyjama King" he worked in fashion store, Sportsgirl in 1981. Here he learned the business of selling, buying, designing, wearing and merchandising clothes. Before this he had no background in fashion.</p>
<p>"No one in my family was involved in fashion. I completed my HSC (Higher School Certificate) and didn’t do any tertiary study. In 1982-83, I worked in a nightclub and then I got a part-time job as a sales assistant at Sportsgirl. As soon as I worked there, I enjoyed the energy, the creativity, the marketing and fashion. Sportsgirl trained me in visual merchandising. I learnt a lot about marketing and fashion, but nothing about manufacturing – because everything was manufactured overseas – and nothing about business. With that knowledge, I decided I wanted to do something in fashion, despite the fact I had no real skills." Peter Alexander</p>
<p>He was inspired to do something in fashion. He relised there was not much choice for women when it came to pyjamas and asked around to see what women his age (22-23) were wearing to bed. It turned out that they wore mens pj's because they wanted something different. He got a friend to help him with his idea.</p>
<p>"She was in the fashion industry. I told her my idea and asked if she could help me find a pattern-maker and some fabric. We looked in the Yellow Pages and found a pattern maker. I took the pyjamas that I’d bought in Hong Kong and got the pattern made from that and then she took me to see fabric wholesalers. I bought five metres of this, five metres of that. We went to a factory and said: “We just want to get a sample run done; we’ll order thousands in the future.” That was a bit presumptuous because we didn’t even have orders at that point, but we got the samples made. I then went around to the stores and tried to sell the pyjamas."</p>
<p>In 1986 he made pyjamas for friends.</p>
<p><br />
He is dyslexic. "It was a real learning disability and, as a consequence, I didn’t do well at school. I still can’t spell very well and my handwriting is terrible. I struggled damatically through my school years and did remedial classes to help. I knew I was intelligent; I just didn’t fit into the school system. I believed it was just a matter of finding my niche."</p>

<p>Joshua Montel was born on March 27th, 1987. He lived in Staten Island, New York for the first year of his life, and then moved to Marlboro, NJ, where he has lived since. He was born to Peter Montel, a school teacher, and Deirdre Schwimmer, a pharmacy technician. Two years later his younger brother Matt was born. Josh also has an older half-brother from his father's previous marriage. For pre-nursery, he attended the Day Care center located next to Jersey Shore Medical Center. Joshua's intelligence could already be seen at an early age, by his ability to comprehend and use the small amount of spanish he was taught by one of his teachers. He started kindergarten at Shalom Torah academy, where he quickly befriended many people, and took a liking to his new surroundings. In second grade, he met his best friend Jon Lafond, though at the time they were only friends. Josh also had his first "serious" girlfriend in second grade, which lasted for about a year. While he was in third grade, the roof of the school blew off during a storm, and the students were required to learn in small offices next to the school. It was extremely uncomfortable. Third grade was also the time Jon and Josh became best friends. In fifth grade, Jon and Josh worked closely together, starting mischief that would continue throughout the lives. While required to write stories for their english teacher, they would sit by the desk and watch the teacher play with her feat, as they tries various things ranging from moving her shoes to putting pieces of paper in them, to see if she would notice. They also co-starred in Charlie and the Chocolate factory, splitting the role of Willy Wanka. It was in 6th grade that Josh realized his dream of one day becoming a veterinarian, and it is a goal he is pursuing to this day. The 6th grade was Josh's last year in Shalom Torah since his parents decided the education he was getting was not sufficient enough to prepare him for the outside world, so at the end of the year, he was enrolled for public school, along with his brother Matt. Public school was a big change for Josh. He went from a class of about 20, to a class of about 500.</p>

<p>The ABVP was started soon after independence with the objective of channelising students' energies in the task of national reconstruction by a group of students and teachers who drew their inspiration from the RSS, the premier nationalist organisation of the country. Its growth process was slow and sporadic in the first few years but it picked up after Prof. Yeshwantrao Kelkar, a lecturer in Bombay, became its main organiser in 1958. He was its real architect and builder. As a consequence of singe-minded devotion of Prof. Kelkar, who passionately tried to build up this organisation till his death in 1987, the ABVP is what it is today.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of the Parishad lies in the fact that it has emerged as a stable organisation of floating population of students. Perhaps no social organisation has its members changing so quickly and regularly as the ABVP has. Despite this handicap, the ABVP has gained strength day by day. In all probability, the ABVP is the only example of its type throughout the world. Another unique feature of the oraganisation is that though it is a student organisation in every respect, the teachers also take an active part in its functioning. Ever since its inception teachers have been deeply involved in building up the organisation and they comprise the permanent component of the membership.</p>
<p>What distinguishes the ABVP from other organisations is the fact that it is a full-fledged and regular student organisation which has evolved a distinct philosophy and role for a student organisation and which organises multifarious activities to fulfill its objective of national reconstruction. So far as ABVP's contribution in the national life is concerned it can be said with pride that apart from organising a lot of constructive and meaningful activities and helping to solve the problems related to student and educational field, the Parishad has played an important role in highlighting and solving larger problems of the country. The thoughts and ideals of the ABVP on educational change can prove as valuable assets for any educational ministry or department. Be it the issue of terrorism in Kashmir or of infiltration of foreigners into Assam and border states, or the issue of reservation and Mandal recommendations or the gigantic task of integrating north-eastern citizens with those of the other parts of the country or the problem of unemployment and economic reconstruction of the country or the fight against social inequalities or the calamity of earthquake in Marathwada, the ABVP has never been found wanting both on the plains of thinking and action. The ABVP today has a cadre of socially committed workers who are capable of undertaking any challenging task.</p>
<p>The coming days would witness a more active, meaningful and effective participation by the ABVP in the task of national reconstruction and the country and its citizens would feel proud of such a role of the ABVP.</p>

<p>filming starting in september</p>
<p>Variety caught up with new Alien vs. Predator 2 directors Greg and Colin Strause who revealed what we can expect from the Fox sequel. "AVP2," written by Shane Salerno, is scheduled to begin shooting in September for an August 10, 2007 release.</p>
<p>"We really want to take it back to the original 'Alien' and 'Predator' films and make a serious, gritty horror film," Colin Strause said.</p>
<p>"We want to take it back to its roots, without losing sight of the human struggle," added Greg Strause. "That's what made the originals so good."</p>
<p>Davis Entertainment's John Davis and Robbie Brenner are producing. Davis Entertainment also produced the first film in the franchise, as well as "Predator" and "Predator 2."</p>

<p>The World Cup is still a few hours away, more than a month before we know what name is engraved on the bottom of the trophy against 2006......my wife and I have already had our first disagreement. I know there will many such before the night of July 9, by then the madness should end, I hope. We decided earlier that we will not have an idiot box at home, so our little daughter could focus on her school work, imbibe reading and indulge in physical activity. A logical choice, given her attraction for everything animated.</p>
<p>The decision stood till the evening of the seventh of June. But then, the players all arrived in Germany, and the heat of occasion started to tell on me. So, the TV had to come, but with it came the wife's fury. Over time, you learn to douse those flames, though inexplicably you cannot douse your passion for the game.</p>
<p>India isn't your typical Football country, yes the boys play the game in Kolkata, Goa and Kerala and let us not forget our seven sisters in the North East. But the impact of the game could be best explained by the average sports enthusiast tuning into recorded highlights of a 1976 cricket match while Mohan Bagan and Dempo fight out the Durand Cup final, live on TV.</p>
<p>The World Cup though is different. It draws people from the fringes, some out of passion, most out of a need to seem cool and acceptable. By now, everyone has learnt that Brazil is the heart of the game and Europe its mind, with Argentina some place in between. Ronaldinho, all of them hope will run around with Ronaldo, Carlos and Cafu, Adriano and Cicinho shooting holes through opposition defences, netting goals by the dozen.</p>
<p>If they were to be right, we would rather hand the trophy to Brazil this evening and go into collective slumber. Thank God, the cup isn't in Italy, the referees aren't game for a fix and the cup final is an open contest between 32 of the best teams in the world. Breathe easy, sit back in your armchair and brace yourself for the uncertainty of sport. It is going to be a ride to remember, so hold tight at the bend and stay glued to the action.</p>
<p>And if you do not find the time to pray, please don't feel guilty, Football is divine.</p>

<p>A CMOS imager is a solid state imaging device (commonly referred to as an i.c. or "chip”) that is created using an (semiconductor) industry standard Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) process.</p>
<p>Solid state imaging devices convert photons (light) into electric energy in a spatially coherent manor. These devices are at the heart of all digital imaging products, digital still cameras, camcorders and cell-phone cameras.</p>
<p>Until the last five (or so) years all of these devices were of a type called CCD’s (Charge Coupled Device), however CMOS imagers are now beginning to replace CCD’s in these products due to numerous cost and technological advantages.</p>

<p>Cristian Paduraru produce and remix electronic music. Since 10 February 1980, Cristian Paduraru grew in ROMANIA, mainly Bucharest. Feeling attracted by melodic dance music since childhood. As a teen Cristian started going to clubs (mainly "Studio Martin"). One of Cristian for projects was "Fire In Water" it included LIVE performances. In the begining of 1996 he was able to buy his first keyboard. The style of the project was deep techno.</p>
<p>In 1998 Cristian received 1st place in the "New TALENT Festival" (electronic section) and in 1999 received 1st place in the "Klub Bizzare" contest from Atomic Tv for best house. It's obvious that he has an artistic gift. Praise goes to the One who gave him life and gifts... His philosophy, in the 90's was that "Music is the best drug," fullfilling the need for excitement. In the new millenium he got in touch with the Word of God and have the philosophy that "LOVE IS THE MESSAGE".</p>
<p>His wife, ERIKA, has brought him fullfillment and balance. After the 90's era of live performances, the new millenium comes with dj performances, and Cristian decided to work mainly in the studio. For a while, between 2000 and 2004 concentrating on advertising and movie sountracks. In 2005 he decided to offer his services worldwide, so he gathered tunes on the actual trend and invites YOU to enjoy the tracks. He feels GOOD when his tunes are bringing a good feeling to others...</p>

<p>Our sources report that during the last year N. Zisimos has been living alone in a neighbourhood with a bad reputation,in the west part of Athens called "Old red district". There, he has transformed an apartment in a dungeon, the "Temple", as he calls it" ,used for varius illegal activities,like orgies, animal sex etc. In addition to that Mr(!) Zisimos has declared that in the next gay parade,that will take place in Athens,he intends to be the main attraction, although he was not willing to clarify ,how exactly he will achieve that. 195.167.52.4 13:06, 9 June 2006 (UTC)The BatMobil195.167.52.4 13:06, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Il termine “crucco” è un adattamento italiano del serbocroato “kruch”, che significa pane. La parola risale alla seconda guerra mondiale, quando i soldati italiani la utilizzarono per soprannominare gli abitanti della Iugoslavia meridionale con cui venivano in contatto. Per questo motivo, quella regione veniva chiamata anche “terra crucca”. In un secondo tempo il termine, anche nella forma “cruco”, venne applicato dai soldati che combattevano in Russia e poi dai partigiani ai soldati tedeschi (nella foto, un gruppo di paracadutisti pluridecorati dell'esercito della Germania posa con Adolf Hitler). Come aggettivo, “crucco” fu riferito, in senso dispregiativo, a tutto ciò che era tedesco. Ora è sinonimo anche di persona testarda.</p>

<p>The Teachers Guild of New South Wales was founded in 1891 by a group of leading educators who wanted to standardise the registration of teachers and private schools. It is the oldest teachers' body in New South Wales, predating both the education unions and the various Heads organisations. The Guild helped to develop curriculum standards and syllabuses, and operated the Teachers' Central Registry, which helped qualified teachers to find work in approved schools.</p>
<p>Following World War II the Guild developed a diploma course to assist with the formal qualification of teachers for independent schools, and this led to the establishment of a Guild Teachers College. The College later amalgamated with the Sydney College of Advanced Education in the early 1980s.</p>

<p>Does temperature affect Acid-Base Reactions? My project is about varying temperatures of the acid (vinegar) in chemical reactions. I like this project because I like just about just about anything that blows up. I think it will help the world by teaching chemists what not to mix at hot and cold temperatures. For example; a 15 year old who is home alone mixes 5 gallons boiling battery acid and 5 pounds of heated lye. A big boom rocks the house and shatters all the windows. His “lab” is in ruins and the 15 year old is crying, he should have read my report!</p>
<p><br />
Research Paper</p>
<p>For thousands of years people have known that vinegar, lemon juice and many other foods taste sour. However, it was not until a few hundred years ago that it was discovered why these things taste sour; because they are all acids. The term acid, in fact, comes from the Latin term acere, which means sour. While there are many slightly different definitions of acids and bases, in this lesson we will introduce the fundamentals of acid/base chemistry. In the seventeenth century, the English writer and amateur chemist Robert Boyle first labeled substances as either acids or bases (he called bases alkalies) according to the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acids taste sour, are corrosive to metals, change litmus (a dye extracted from lichens) red, and become less acidic when mixed with bases.</li>
<li>Bases feel slippery, change litmus blue, and become less basic when mixed with acids.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Boyle and others tried to explain why acids and bases behave the way they do, the first reasonable definition of acids and bases would not be suggested until 200 years later.</p>
<p>In the late 1800's, the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius proposed that water can dissolve many compounds by separating them into their individual ions. Arrhenius suggested that acids are compounds that contain hydrogen and can dissolve in water to release hydrogen ions into solutions.</p>
<p>Now that you know the history, let’s get to the hard, cold data. Bases have a pH higher than 7. Bases are slippery and bitter and have the ability to turn litmus blue. It also yields hydroxyl ions when dissolved in water. Bases always conduct an electric current. They can also act as a proton accepter and can donate a pair of electrons to form a covalent bond. Bases have these following proprieties a. Bases release a hydroxide ion into water solution b. Bases neutralize acids in a neutralization reaction c. Bases denature protein d. Bases taste bitter e. Bases conduct an electric current</p>
<p>Acids are sour and have a pH of less than seven on the pH scale. Acids have the ability to turn litmus blue. It also yields hydroxyl ions when dissolved in water. Acids always conduct an electric current. They can also act as a proton accepter and can donate a pair of electrons to form a covalent bond. Acids have the following proprieties: a. All acids taste sour. b. Acids make a blue vegetable dye called "litmus" turn red. c. Acids destroy the chemical properties of bases d. Acids conduct an electric current. e. Upon chemically reacting with an active metal, acids will evolve hydrogen gas (H 2)</p>
<p>Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. Years ago, a mathematician named Boltzmann figured out that the kinetic energy of a system such as this was distributed in a predictable way. Even though the individual objects continually exchanged kinetic energy with each other, there was a predictable result to how the kinetic energy was distributed.</p>
<p>He discovered that the varying values for kinetic energy occurred with predicable frequency. The distribution of the kinetic energy values based on his work is now known as the Boltzmann Distribution. When graphed, it produces a classic curve. This curve is in the form of a bell-shaped distribution. Here are some more definitions for kinetic energy a. Kinetic energy is an expression of the fact that a moving object can do work on anything it hits; it quantifies the amount of work the object could do as a result of its motion. The total mechanical energy of an object is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy. b. Kinetic energy is energy of motion. The kinetic energy of an object is the energy it possesses because of its motion. c. Kinetic Energy is equal to ½ mv2 o (m=mass and v=velocity/2 squared, or Half of mass and velocity squared.</p>
<p>An element is a substance composed of atoms having an identical number of protons in each nucleus. Elements cannot be reduced to simpler substances by normal chemical means. At first people thought fire, water, air, and earth were the only elements, we now know better, here are more elements</p>
<ul>
<li>Chemical element, the class of atoms with the same number of protons in the nucleus</li>
<li>Electrical element, any device with terminals at which it may be connected directly with other devices. It can also mean an antenna furnace (either parasitic or active). In circuitry, it can be used to specify a portion of an integrated circuit that contributes directly to the IC's operation</li>
<li>Picture element, better known as a pixel on a display device</li>
</ul>
<p>Enthalpy is a thermodynamic function of a system, equivalent to the sum of the internal energy of the system plus the product of its volume multiplied by the pressure exerted on it by its surroundings. It is also called heat content. (Thermodynamic means a characteristic of or resulting from the conversion of heat into other forms of energy: in other words, it is a change in energy) The Octet rule is, in chemistry, the statement that when atoms combine to form molecules they generally each lose, gain, or share leaving electrons until they attain or share eight; also called Lewis rule of eight.</p>
<p>Hypothesis</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that the greatest amount of gases will be released if a hot acid and a cold base are mixed or vise-versa. The least amount of gases will be released at cold temperatures for the acids and the bases.</p>
<p>Email me at graham66@gmail.com if you want the rest of the paper</p>
<p>Gases are filling up the balloon The vinegar and baking soda are reacting and releasing carbon dioxide</p>
<p>In this case, a good amount of gas is released, but the balloon is far from popping.</p>

<p>The Department of Special Research, or DSR, is a fictional "off-the-books" division of the <a href="../../../f/b/i/FBI_73d2.html" title="FBI">FBI</a> on the television show <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alias_%28TV_Series%29_6aae.html" title="Alias (TV Series)"><i>Alias</i></a>. It was created during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> to investigate <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> interest in the <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occult.html" title="Occult">occult</a>. After the war, it recieved a charter to investigate the paranormal, including <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remote_viewing.html" title="Remote viewing">remote viewing</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parapsychology.html" title="Parapsychology">parapsychology</a>, and other fringe sciences.</p>
<p>One of the subjects the DSR researches is the work of <a href="../../../1/5/t/15th_century.html" title="15th century">15th century</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophet.html" title="Prophet">prophet</a> <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milo_Rambaldi_dd96.html" title="Milo Rambaldi">Milo Rambaldi</a>. In the first season of <i>Alias</i>, the DSR arrests <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Bristow_5380.html" title="Sydney Bristow">Sydney Bristow</a> because the image of a woman bearing an uncanny likeness to her was revealed on the page of a Rambaldi manuscript. "The Prophecy," as it is called, refers to the woman as Rambaldi's "Chosen One," who will "render the greatest power unto utter desolation." With the help of <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Bristow_d0a1.html" title="Jack Bristow">her father</a> and handler <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Vaughn_50cb.html" title="Michael Vaughn">Michael Vaughn</a>, she escapes DSR custody and (apparently) disproves the prophecy by climbing <a href="../../../m/t/2E/Mt._Subasio_9a0b.html" title="Mt. Subasio">Mt. Subasio</a>. According to the prophecy, the chosen one "will have had her effect, never having seen the beauty of [Rambaldi's] sky behind Mount Subasio." The DSR accepts this, and begins investigating the possibility that Sydney's mother, <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irina_Derevko_fa63.html" title="Irina Derevko">Irina Derevko</a>, is the chosen one.</p>
<p>In the third season, it is revealed that the DSR has its own top secret storage facility for Rambaldi artifacts, called Project Blackhole, which is located in the <a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevada.html" title="Nevada">Nevada</a> desert. It is also revealed that FBI assistant director and former director of the Joint Task Force on Intelligence, Kendall, is not really FBI, but Director of Project Blackhole.</p>
<p>In the fourth season, the DSR sends a team of agents to Sovogda, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, to prevent <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elena_Derevko_ce51.html" title="Elena Derevko">Elena Derevko</a> from fulfilling her interpretation of one of Rambaldi's prophecies. All but one agent are killed by the so-called "Infected," before the team of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorized_Personnel_Only_1035.html" title="Authorized Personnel Only">APO</a> arrives, and that agent dies after their arrival.</p>

<p>Pablo Cruz and the third World Assassins was formed in 2006 by guitarist/vocalist/percussionist, Osvaldo de Ballester and long time friend Guillermo Miguel Moreno. Growing up in the harsh political and oppressive conditions of south America both members were able to escape by playing music on the coast of Argentina. Both members met at en early age as they attended the same highschool, they began playing on the streets Buenos Aires, slowly getting recognition of local musicians and at the same time saving money for their aspirations in the music world. In 2004 Osvaldo and Miguel left their native home for a much cooler location, Canada. When they arrived in Canada the two made St. Catharines their home and have been writing, recording, and playing the local circuit ever since. The north allowed them to further develop their skills as well it gave them acces to recording equipment which would act as their most powerful tool for laying down their magical music. In 2005 with the release of their debut album in North America, "Las manos de dios", the members decided to add three more members to the band in order to allow for a fuller sound in their live performance. Ryan Baker, Lester Mclaughlin (formerly in "Rage Against"), and Alonzo Lopez (co-producer Satana, No Dice, Monorail Pileup) brought a dynamic to the band that was like no other, their professionalism as musicians and their understanding of the latin/rock/blues/electronic music allowed the band to perform and write effortlessly. The band is currently finishing up a tour of south america, including shows in Brasil, Guyana, Chile, Argenina, Colombia, and even Cuba. For tour dates check out the site LOCOPOLLOS.com/tourdates. When the band concludes their tour of south american tour they will be playng some charity shows in Africa and Asia. They will be returning to St. Catharines to their home studio to write and record their new album which will be set for release summer 2007.</p>

<p>Rihab Charida is a Palestinian activist living in Sydney, Australia. She is a member of the Socialist Alliance, and has written a number of articles for their newspaper, The Green Left.</p>
<p>Rihab has appeared on Australian television. She previously hosted a The Palestine Hour program on Channel 31, a Sydney-based community TV station, however this channel no longer exists. She has also been a guest on SBS's current affairs debate show Insight. During an Insight episode discussing the question "What is terrorism?", Rihab made the following statements:</p>
<p>RIHAB CHARIDA, PALESTINIAN ACTIVIST: I think in regards to terrorism generally, whether it's in Palestine or anywhere else, the root cause of terrorism is oppression and anybody that's genuinely interested in stopping terrorism, whether it's in Palestine or in Northern Ireland or in, you know, Sri Lanka or wherever it is, anybody who is genuinely interested in getting rid of suicide bombings or any attacks, must be opposed to the reasons why suicide bombings happen to begin with. Suicide bombings are a direct result of oppression and occupation. JENNY BROCKIE: But does that make them justifiable? RIHAB CHARIDA: It basically - let's not forget that occupation under international law is illegal. Resisting occupation is legal under international law. Let's just go to international law. Resisting occupation... JENNY BROCKIE: So are you saying that you do think the suicide bombings are justifiable? RIHAB CHARIDAI: I say yes, because the Palestinians have tried for many years other means of fighting, you know, their cause.</p>
<p><br />
Rihab has travelled to the West Bank a number of times, and has written about her experiences, which she describes as helping the local Palestinian population "resist Israeli occupation".</p>

<p>Richard Lorne (Dick) Spooner was born in 1940 in the Northwestern Ontario town of Sioux Lookout. After his family resided briefly in Robinson Lake and Nakina they arrived in Port Arthur, now the northern side of Thunder Bay, on his third birthday. That was early September 1943.</p>
<p>Dick received his education in Port Arthur and, ten years after high school, enrolled in the Communications Design Course at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto.</p>
<p>In 1972 Dick graduated with honours from OCA majoring in illustration, graphic design and photography. With new visual processing skills to negotiate with, Dick joined the Thunder Bay CKPR-CHFD TV team in July 1972.</p>
<p>After five years in television Dick moved on to advertising agency challenges and graphic and print sales for local printing firms.</p>
<p>Since his teenage years Dick has developed regular followers who enjoy his illustrations and graphic designs. The list of patrons have grown throughout the years and even more so since graduating from art college and adding the hands on experiences of television, print and photography.</p>
<p>Dick's life experiences are both business and creative as shown by him being a partner in a photo studio and a photo lab and handling business accounts at an ad agency and a printing firm.</p>
<p>Dick's trademark works feature Northwestern Ontario landscapes and the visual positioning of the city of Thunder Bay as a foreground to a land etched by ice age glaciers.</p>
<p>"My first limited edition print was a pair of line drawings of the CNR and the CPR Railway Stations." To local people the railway station and the railway itself was the link to the rest of Canada from their remote position in the interior of a vast country. Ships that entered our country three thousand kilometers away have now become part of our history and our visual identity. "Rocky rugged shorelines make a dramatic backdrop for a marine illustration".</p>
<p>Dick's first colour limited print featured a gathering place. In October 1989 Dick released a limited edition, full colour print, entitled 'Bay Street'. It was a watercolour of the Hoito Finlandia Club Building. This subject struck a nostalgic cord with local residents and ex pat Lakeheaders all across the country and indeed far beyond our borders.</p>
<p>Since that time prints 'Outward Bound', 'Cornerstones Of Yesterday', 'Mile Zero (The Pagoda)', 'Winter Of '96' and 'Quedoc' have completely sold out.</p>
<p>"Northwestern Ontario is an incredibly vast area. We as individuals evolve differently than those of other parts of the country where three or four generations grow up with thousands of people per square mile. It's fifteen hundred km from the near north City of Sudbury to the westernmost Ontario town of Kenora. We have the modern amenities, the big box stores, the electronics, symphony orchestras and movie theatres but thousands of us can still be at our cottages within an hour and on Lake Superior in our boat within half an hour. Thanksgiving out here should be a week long!"</p>

<p>Yamaha Fz750 1985-1991 was Yamahas entry into the comppetive middleweight sports bike market. The FZ750 marked a considorable jump in technolagy and performance for Yamahas motorcyles. Yamaha whose reputation had been built on its high performance 2 stoke competion machines where as yet to make a high performance 4 stroke road machine. Though never amonst the top seller list the features of the Fz750 can be found on almost all high performance Jpaanese motorcycles today. in fact the basic desgn remains unchanged over twenty years later.</p>
<p>The Fz750 engine though based on the tried and tested formula of the unit construction, all alluminium, transverse mounted four cylinder, four stroke it was a major departure from the standard engines of the time. The engine featured water cooling to the head and barrel and the twin cam cylinder head contained 20 valves. The 5 valves per cylinder design (3 inlet and 2 exhaust) has since become a Yamaha trademark and endowed the machine with at the time where excelent torque, power and fuel economy. The complex casting of the head is constructed in two parts with the head containing the combustion chamber roofs seperate from the cam box (the engine is a genuine overhead cam, not a high cam like most Japanese engines). The valve where operated directly from the chain driven cams via bucket followers. Despite the large valve train the inlet tracts are almost directly staight to the four downdraft 36mm mikuni carburators. The inclided cylinder head placed the carburators (and large airbox) inside what would convventionally be the fuel tank while, giving the machine a lower centre of gravity it had the disadvantage of lenghtening the wheelbase and the high carburators required an electically driven fuel pump.</p>
<p>The chassis was slightly more convional. The steel double cradle frame contained two upper frame rails passing around the outside of the the head and not over it like on a conentional frame. The suspension consisted of the tradional telescopic forks and a single shock attached via a rising rate linkage.</p>
<p>For the 1987 season the engine was enlarged by increasing the bore and stoke and housed into what was then becoming the standard for sports bikes of an all alluminium alloy frame the machine became the FZR1000. It was begining of the end, while soldiering on until l991 advances in chassis, wheel, tyre and suspeanion design had relegated the FZ750 to the sports tourer end of the cataloge. The model was finally discontinued in 1991 and the last discounted bikes cleared from the dealer floors in 1992.</p>
<p>For all its inovations and its pure sports marketing tag the Fz never quite made the top grade in the sports market, but the lack of any fundemental problems and its inherrent reliability, build quality and practicality means machine can be still seen in everyday use today.</p>

<p>Partial Unbirthing</p>
<p>Partial Unbirthing (adult head insertion into the vagina) is a fetishism that is extremely rare and probably one of the rarest of all human sexual activities. It is a curious paraphilia usually considered a true fetishism. The definition of a fetishism has changed over the years and has moved away from only requiring inanimate objects for sexual gratification to today's view that a great many varieties of less common sexual activities concentrating on body parts and even sexual organ size are now considered fetishes. Partial Unbirthing is a Fetishism in this newer and broader sense of the word. In the actual practice of this it is not a form of Vore and is only practiced by a very few devoted adult couples. One reason for this is that to be mutually enjoyable and erotic, it requires that the vagina must stretch to enormous size which requires a consenting, cooperative, and extended effort between the sexual partners -- just to start doing it. This of course is only possible where the woman has an extremely huge opening of her pelvis. Such a Justo Major Pelvis (also called "Giant Pelvis") is where the minimum pelvis size is enlarged in every direction by a factor of 1.5, or more, and it is only present in less than one in a thousand adult women.</p>
<p>Women of average size sometimes hugely stretch their vaginas for purposes of greater stimulation or more intense orgasms. Also some women have a fullness fetish that is sometimes called a "bulk intromission" fetish. With gradual repeated stretching they occasionally stretch almost to the walls of their pelvic bone opening (approximately the size of a newborn's head). Those that do this are quite rare. It is easy to see that the ratio comparing an adult head size to a newborn head size (a 21 inch circumference to a 14 inch circumference) is a 3 to 2 (or 1.5) ratio -- making the adult head size this 1.5 ratio times the 14 inch newborn head size. This ratio is just the exact same linear 1.5 ratio that a pelvis of "minimum" Justo Major size has compared to an average 11 inch wide pelvis. For a woman with a Justo Major pelvis of 1.5 ratio to vaginally stretch to adult head size would be like the average woman with an average size pelvis stretching to newborn head size or like this average size woman being vaginally double fisted by a man who has fairly large hands.</p>
<p>A well known government Hispanic study included the anthropometry of nearly 5000 adult women and anthropometric calipers measured the largest pelvis at 19 inches biiliac width (side-to-side bone width). This made her 19 inch wide pelvis have a 1.73 ratio when compared to the average size pelvis of 11 inches width. This is even a larger size pelvis than a pelvis of "minimum" Justo Major size (that requires at least a 1.5 ratio). If a woman with a pelvis of this very large size were to do the same vaginal stretching to near her bone opening size, she could then vaginally take inside a huge 24 inch adult head. That size head would be 24 minus 21 inches or 3 inches larger than the 21 inch circumference adult head that the pelvis of the 1.5 ratio Justo Major size could potentially stretch around. The larger size 19 inch wide pelvis would require a lesser degree of stretching to be comfortable when taking inside a 21 inch (much smaller size) adult head. This degree of comfort might be comparable to a woman of average size being vaginally double fisted by hands of considerably smaller size, or even being fisted by just one large hand. A less common but larger one in five thousand Justo Major pelvis has a size to potentially make partial unbirthing easier. The 19 inch wide one in 5000 Justo Major pelvis was indeed a huge and rare size.</p>
<p>The above illustrates how rare a sufficiently large pelvis would be in order that gradual and often repeated vaginal stretching practice might comfortably reach a partial unbirthing size. The rarity of the fetish is further compounded by how few such women with this huge pelvic size would be motivated by the fantasy and potential stimulation to devote the weeks or sometimes months of stretching practice with no assured guarantee of success. Also the rarity of her adult partner, who would work with her in many repeated sessions to help her gradually stretch, and who wanted to do partial unbirthing in a safe, erotic, and mutually enjoyable manner has to be considered. When the pelvis is less than Justo Major size (or &lt; 1.5 times the 11 inch average width), with the exception of small midget heads, such a fetish could never even be considered -- as bone will not stretch. Only a very few confirmed instances of this are even known.</p>
<p>It is estimated that less than one in a million sexual partners have done partial unbirthing making it a very very rare human sexual activity.</p>

<p>Misión: Ser un medio de comunicación que proporcione entretenimiento e información de calidad para nuestros televidentes reales y potenciales de tal manera de producir y distribuir contenidos con altos estándares comunicativos. Entendemos por entretenimiento el derecho que tiene toda la población de disfrutar de un sano esparcimiento a través de nuestros espacios de programación de los diversos géneros, ya sea de producción nacional o importada con criterio altamente selectivo. Entendemos por información el transmitir de manera objetiva y con apego estricto a la verdad de los acontecimientos que marcan la marcha de la sociedad. Para tal efecto ATV cuenta con un Código de Ética interno y a su vez ha suscrito el Código de Ética Unificado de la Industria de la Televisión. Tenemos un sistema de autorregulación que se materializa a través de advertencias que emitimos antes de la emisión de nuestros programas, indicando para qué tipo de público es apto el contenido a ser transmitido.</p>
<p><br />
Visión: Ser el canal de mayor audiencia, para de esa manera ser un vehículo de comunicación eficiente para los mensajes comerciales de nuestros anunciantes y así crear las condiciones para que sus inversiones sean rentables en términos de respuesta de mercado, todo esto en la perspectiva de constituirnos en una empresa sólida y de respeto frente a la sociedad.</p>
<p>Valores que deseamos preservar: El mas importante valor que deseamos preservar es el de la unidad de la familia, concebida esta como un núcleo natural en el que se desarrolla el ser humano y como una fuente de valores supremos como el amor, la educación, y la honestidad. Otro valor de suma importancia y que se prioriza en ATV es la libertad en todo el sentido de la palabra, ya que este es un atributo inherente al ser humano. Un aspecto importante de este valor es la libertad de expresión que es el baluarte de la democracia y que se practica irrestrictamente en ATV, lo cual está reflejado en el prestigio y aceptación de nuestro noticiero.</p>
