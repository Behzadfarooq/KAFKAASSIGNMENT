<li>Actually, I wanted to delete the article because it lacked content. Additionally, if you check out his contributions, he's made a bunch of equally stunning single-sentence school stubs, and deleting one will encourage him to put effort into the other articles that he writes. My comment was intended to reply to <a href="../../../y/0/u/User%7EY0u_cdd9.html" title="User:Y0u">Y0u</a>'s comment suggesting the original creator be encouraged to expand it. He's being encouraged. He isn't expanding.

<li>I don't know that he expects anything of the sort. While his stubs are minimalist, we're discussing *this* article, which is actually rather good. Let's not delete it just because the guy who wrote it wasn't interested in expanding it.

<li>Railway stations are notable due to the fact that those currently in existence provide mass transit services. Suburbs are notable in that they are geographical locations. In my experience, we don't always keep bridges, nor do I personally think we should. While education is inherently notable, the building where learning occurs is not. -<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 19:09, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>First off, I hadn't seen my earlier vote so I apologize for that. Secondly, that's not a personal attack, that's a fact.

<li>How does this "group" work?

<li>It's contentious certainly, but that doesn't make him wrong for raising the point. In fact, it's the reason many people vote to delete school articles; it's also the reason the group he mentioned votes to keep them. -<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 01:59, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>There's that word again: "group". Another word I've seen is "cabal". All seem to be rationalisations of the fact that people who want to delete schools aren't able to do so. I think the hit rate is somewhere around 2%, quite extraordinary when you consider that VfDs in general have a very high chance of succeeding. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:07, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You asked for proof of a "group" that makes it their mission to "save" school articles regardless if they are notable or not. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GRider/Schoolwatch" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GRider/Schoolwatch" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>].

<li>Your false assumption is quite insulting. If I vote to keep a school it is because I firmly believe it is notable. Schoolwatch and other similar programs have had nothing but a positive impact on the articles it lists, in my opinion. —<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadman1_1309.html" title="User:Radman1"><b>RaD Man</b></a> (<a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadman1_76e9.html" title="User talk:Radman1"><i>talk</i></a>) 04:18, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your analysis simply appears to examine voting patterns and assign membership of a putative group on that basis. But the only thing linking those whom you assign to a group is that, for their various reasons, they do not share with you the belief that notability criteria apply to schools and they vote consistently to reflect that lack of agreement with you. You cannot infer group membership from shared opinion. Indeed to make matters worse my opinion, to take an example, has changed a great deal over time. Go back to November/December and you'll find that I was of the opinion that listing schools in Wikipedia was wrong, and I even listed one or two for deletion myself. I changed my mind. That is permitted. I didn't apply for membership of any group, I just changed the way I vote. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 09:56, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Just thought I'd point out that this statement, "they do not share with you the belief that notability criteria apply to schools and they vote consistently to reflect that lack of agreement with you" proves exactly the point I made earlier. They don't analyze individual schools or articles on merit but rather the fact they are schools. By that logic all grocery stores, bars, and 7-Eleven locations should be kept as well.
