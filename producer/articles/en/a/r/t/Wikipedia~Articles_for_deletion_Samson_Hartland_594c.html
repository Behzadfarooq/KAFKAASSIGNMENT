<p>Local, non-notable political figure.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - the facts of his parents' deafness and his youth on election put him <i>just</i> over the line, I think.

<li><b>Reluctant Keep</b> the article is still rife with <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> violations but he passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, I think, as a city councillor for a territorial capital (and possibly deputy mayor, I can't figure this part out), with some additional notability about youngness and whathaveyou. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 12:57, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Marginal keep</b>, but I'm convinced solely by the claim that he was the youngest person elected to the city council of a Canadian capital. I think this barely--barely--nudges him into notability. And that's only if you buy the notion that there's something special about the city also being a provincial capital. If this was revised to dial down the <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> and to place that claim up front, I'd be inclined to let it pass. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagana_c6a0.html" title="User:Pagana">Pagana</a> 19:17, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very Weak Keep</b> - He seems a little notable. He just makes it with youngest person to be elected to a Canadian capital. But some of the other stuff could be taken out like the theatre part.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Written by one user, named "Hartland". Not sure any of his accomplishments are notable enough for WP. - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 20:54, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. Whitehorse is a city of less than 20,000, and Hartland has been a city councilman for only 6 years. That he's the answer to a trivia question doesn't vault him over the edge IMO. But who knows, he has such a bright future that we might be making a page soon about Samson Hartland, MP. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 20:59, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>North of 60, City size vs importance changes drastically.

<li><b>Medium Delete</b>. How does he meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> exactly? His position is non-notable, he is non-notable. His age and his parents' deafness adds nothing to his notability. --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 20:34, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> I'm not sure that his claim to notability (youngest person elected to a city council of a Canadian capital) is truly notable or even verifiable. (Who keeps such records and how far back are they kept?) I don't like the idea that the originator of the article may have been treading on <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> or <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>. <a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_76b1.html" title="User:AED">AED</a> 15:55, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for everyone's feedback. I noticed the article has gone through some hefty editing in the last couple of days. If you don't think an elected politician (which having read notability requirements led me to believe this article was acceptable) to a capital city, and the youngest no less (not verifiable via internet) doesn't pass the sniff test, I'd honestly be surprised. I have numerous scanned magazine articles (Profit Magazine, MacLeans, Realm Magazine), newspaper articles and television interviews - and yes they are about me. I didn't realize I required so much verification, but if you want it...just ask. Or just do a google search. I had the theatre section there so people could cross reference with <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Deaf_Theatre_da9a.html" title="Canadian Deaf Theatre">Canadian Deaf Theatre</a> on WP, but if you don't believe that should belong either...As for the deputy mayor question, when you sit on a City Council, everyone alternates deputy mayor responsibilities (when the mayor is absent) at community functions and council meetings themselves. As Whitehorse's deputy mayor I have chaired Whitehorse City Council meetings and greeted HRH when he visited Whitehorse during his northern tour in 2001. Hope this helps you during your deliberation.Hartland</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - hard one this. The city politican doesn't do it. The Canada's Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award might have but it was a provincial award and there is no indication of how the business has since progressed. Obviously a coming guy who will, I'm sure, break through the notability threshold in time. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 02:13, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - can't help feeling that the prime motivator is vanity. Sorry. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox">Mallanox</a> 19:14, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>My motivation is youth. I work with plenty both through my involvement with the Junior Achievement Program of Canada and Rural Partnership Program of Canada. We lack youth leadership in Canada, and mentors to look up to. That was my prime motivation. If the notability is non-encyclopedic, I can accept that. Thank you for allowing me to address this point.--Hartland 00:56, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
