<li>Well, I'm a recent Ottawan, I've only been here for five years, and to me, Little Italy's business district is Preston Street, like the Glebe's is Bank and Westboro's is Richmond, but Preston St isn't equivalent to Little Italy. Take St Anthony's, for instance, on Gladstone -- it's part of Little Italy, sure, but part of Preston Street? Even the Preston St. Business Improvement Asssociation <a href="http://www.prestonstreet.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.prestonstreet.com/" rel="nofollow">calls the area</a> Little Italy. There's so much more to be said about the area than the street anyhow, from the first Italian immigration to Ottawa until the present. You go to a restaurant on Preston, but you live in Little Italy. (The city seems to call the BIA "Preston Street" and the neighbourhood either "Corso Italia" or "Little Italy".)

<li>But why is the road so busy? This is not the busiest road in Ottawa because of some unique feature it has. It is the busiest road because of how the road network is designed. I think you touched on a major flaw in these road articles. A discussion on why and how it became such a busy road would create an interesting and useful article. Instead, Wikipedia editors have chosen to create thousands of short articles on very narrow and very generic topics. How is this road (I mean the actual road itself, aside from its name and geographic place) any different from the other million paved roads on this planet?

<li>As I've explained on recent Toronto street debates, I've always been of the opinion that city streets should only have articles if they have demonstrable historic or cultural significance far beyond their mere existence. Being a busy street doesn't cut it; being a yellow line in the MapArt city atlas doesn't cut it. By my reasoning, Ottawa streets that legitimately deserve articles would include Bank, Laurier, Sparks, Sussex and Wellington. But if going into exhaustive detail on a road's speed limit and how many <i>lanes</i> it has is the only way you can expand a road's article beyond two sentences, then you're dealing with a road that doesn't belong here. In a nutshell, my bottom line criterion for a road article is <i>is this a street that a person who's never been to this city and isn't a map junkie might still conceivably have heard of?</i> For Bank, Sparks or Sussex, the answer to that question is obviously yes, but for Woodroffe, it's no. I have to go with the <b>delete</b> on this one. And it's not Ottawa-bashing, either, because I want the majority of the Toronto street articles sh*tcanned too. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 16:22, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete:</b> If it were up to me, I'd likely delete the whole category of Ottawa roads and others like it. Separate articles for various, non-notable roads in every city in the world is silly. If there's nothing more important to say about a road other than "it's congested" or "the speed limit is this, and it changes to that," it fully meets the criteria of being non-notable. If there's a real story behind a road, something that separates it from millions of other similar roads, fine, it's notable, but a recitation of speed limits and number of lanes is just pedantic trivia.

<li><b>Comment</b>: You guys keep saying it's non notable, but how can you say that without knowledge of the city in question? Woodroffe is the <b>main street</b> in Nepean!

<li><b>Some more comments</b>: I'd also like to say that there are a lot of links to the Woodroffe Article from other pages, and that means there is deffinately a need for the page, and shows that it is certainly a notable road. Plus, I remember we put some Ottawa roads on VfD maybe a year ago, and they were kept. Why the change of heart? We got the go ahead to make articles on Ottawa's major streets, and now there is a turn against it?

<li>Life isn't fair. Perhaps that disclaimer on the edit page on how your work can be edited without mercy should include a bit on "your work may be deleted without mercy if no-one cares on which street you buy milk". If there are plenty of links to the street, then maybe see if there's any interesting information from those articles that could go in this article, but the simple fact is that it doesn't matter if a billion pages link to it - if there's nothing interesting to say about the street, it's not notable! -- <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 10:34, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>And as several others among us keep saying, being a major road within one city is not a criterion that warrants an encyclopedia article. If you want Woodroffe to be kept, give us good reasons why a person who's <b>never even visited Ottawa in their life</b> might still need to know something about Woodroffe.

<li>I agree entirely. However, "that topic is just as out of place here as this one is" isn't a valid reason for inclusion. Come on, guys. You have yet to even attempt to challenge my belief that being a major city arterial doesn't automatically make a street encyclopedia-worthy; you're resorting entirely to distracting tactics that don't address my statement. All I'm asking for is a direct answer (without appealing to the Pokémon argument) as to why a run-of-the-mill city arterial should be important enough to merit an article that tells me nothing more than its speed limit and number of lanes, given that we're already turfing a bunch of Toronto streets of at least equivalent importance to Woodroffe. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:00, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Bearcat, what is your opinion on individual highway articles?

<ul>
<li>So are Warden and Broadview, and I voted to can those. I've already gone into some detail earlier in this discussion on what I consider to be some of the key guidelines for determining the encyclopedia relevance of a city street; provincial or state highways are a very different issue, because they're a different thing serving a different purpose, maintained by a higher level of government, marked on larger-scale maps, much smaller in number, much more clearly linked to historical and encyclopedic contexts, etc. Traffic counts are <i>not</i> the determining factor; even a completely unimportant minor street in a major city is probably going to have a traffic count higher than <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_provincial_highway_101.html" title="Ontario provincial highway 101">Highway 101</a>. All you've done so far in response to my concerns is to continually repeat that Woodroffe is a major arterial, as if I didn't know that (I lived in Ottawa for six years, for heaven's sake). What I still haven't seen is one good reason <i>why</i> that fact should be important enough to merit an encyclopedia article, one good reason <i>why</i> I should abandon my current criteria for including vs. deleting city streets. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:00, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>What I am trying to get at is, Woodroffe Ave. is very similar to a highway in that it connects Barrhaven, (and points beyond) with the rest of the city. It also serves as part of the Transitway. -- <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarl_Andrew_5969.html" title="User talk:Earl Andrew">talk</a> 00:54, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And what I am trying to get at is that I don't think that's a particularly encyclopedic function which would justify a city street having an article. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:49, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please remember the context in which these articles are presented. Roads are not Pokémon characters; each Pokémon exists independently of the other and there are actual differences between them (not that I know anything about Pokémon) while all roads are basically identical and exist as a system (network). Why would people in Ottawa want to see an article about this street (I say that while ducking and assuming the article conforms to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">policies</a> banning business directories, travel guide, indiscriminate collections of info). What can you say about a road that conforms to these policies, is on-topic and will not be repeated a hundred thousand times in other articles. An Ottawan would be better served with an article on the community's road network as a whole. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 01:05, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, just for the hell of it I looked her up on Lexis/Nexis.

<p>In June '05 there was already a discussion on this. It survived, tentatively, but... There is no such concept as a 'Floating-rate bond' in the bond markets. Yes, there are bonds that have floating rate coupons, but these are universally known as Floating Rate Notes (I know, just one of those quirks of a the markets). As you'll see there's quite a substantial entry there. My suggestion would be to just have this entry redirect to the FRN entry.</p>

<li>Mr Boucher, <i>anyone</i> can be published by vanity press. <i>I</i> could get a book published tomorrow, that doesn't mean I'm going to write an article about myself! (Well, I couldn't actually, because I haven't got any money. But the theory holds.) In order to prevent Wikipedia from becoming <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate repository of information</a>, we have to have certain standards about what we include and what we don't. Sure, those standards aren't perfect, but they're all we've got, and they don't include authors whose only works, regardless of their merit, are published by vanity presses. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 01:56, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Fair point, and thank you for clearing that up on the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Boucher_b03a.html" title="Chris Boucher">Chris Boucher</a> article. "Vanity" is a confusing term — it doesn't mean an article's author created it out of vanity (though I admit that's what I thought you'd done), but that the subject of the article is not notable enough to be written about in an encyclopaedia that takes itself seriously. By the way, you may have noticed that the other people contributing to the discussion here have all signed their entries (click the "sign" icon in the toolbar, or type four tildes). Part of the signature is a link to each user's <b>user page</b>, on which they can put whatever they want, including biographical details. I encourage you to move the contents of the Chris P. Boucher article to your own userspace. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 01:56, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's fine. But I'll no longer have a user page, as I have no interest in belonging to your narrow-minded group. Luckily as a non-member I can still edit pages. I'll restrict my use of this "Wikipedia" to occasionally visiting the Chris Boucher page and deleting the attribution of my novel to another writer. You can all rest easy now that you've deflected another assault on your "serious" standards! Thanks, Chris Boucher

<li>The talk page has some very interesting things indeed to say about the origins of this page.

<li><b>Conditional Keep</b>. Currently the page is original research, and as such all the assertions should be removed. However, if they were, there was a story to the games, and it may be notable enough to include in Wikipedia. Hence, my condition is that someone spends a lot of time non-original-researching it.

<li><b>Re</b>. Yes I agree, but the stuff used to fill the gap in the article is completley fanfic (and some of it contradicts the game and info from the game developers, if I may add), it's based on nothing from the game. For example, <a href="http://www.planetcnc.com/features/essays/rastory/" class="external text" title="http://www.planetcnc.com/features/essays/rastory/" rel="nofollow">here is a good story about the same game</a>. In it the author bases the gap filler on actual stuff in the game.

Not every two word combination is worthy of an article in wiktionary. 255 unique hits for the exact term in google doesn't make something a real term. I suspect any combination of the word "rape" with another common word, will bring up plenty of similiar "hits" in Google. The word "rape" is (sadly) one of the many words some porno sites "stuff" in their keywords, to get hits. There are 255 web sites hoping to get customers looking for this, but that doesn't mean it's a real term (or expression). Without even opening the sites (which I'm not about to do), you can see from the Google snippets, that there are random words packed in for <a href="../../../s/e/o/SEO_d889.html" title="SEO">SEO</a> reasons, which don't even form sentences. A term must be used regularly in proper sentences before it can even rise to the level of a "dicdef". --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 10:12, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I did just now, and I see between a dozen and two dozen uses of the term non-randomly in context. That really amounts to very little. Also, we don't include ever properly used adjective/noun pair, so why would we we have a rarely used slang term (which uses a verb as an adjective). Is there a hot shower, fast shower, slow shower, quick shower, bad shower, good shower, etc... Now a few like "cold shower", might have such massive/widespread usage, that they're included as special cases. But, that takes an extra degree of usage. I assert such a term requires *more* than what would be required if we're talking of a single real word. In fact, a real word, requires no Google hits. Dictionaries are not there to provide every combination of words one might use. It's there to provide a list of words, and definitions, which users may combine themselves. Let's hope the good folks at wiktionary don't send this sucker back as "not a dicdef transwiki to wikipedia ". --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 13:04, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: My google got 14 hits after excluding the very similar hits, a porn ad, ambiguous usage (e.g. is sitting in the shower crying the same thing?), and where the term had to be immediately explained on a web chat forum (i.e. it was not generally known). Is that in line with your findings? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 13:13, 20 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It doesn't get many google hits, but it does get <i>some</i>, enough to indicate it might be in active use, so it should be given to wiktionary to let them decide if it meets their criteria or not. Dictionaries need to provide definitions of <i>idioms</i>, where a two-word combination does not mean the sum of its parts. The meaning of "rape shower" is non-obvious, unlike "quick shower" etc. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 13:27, 20 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you saying to simply make a mention of the term to people in wiktionary, or are you talking about going ahead and actually creating a dicdef entry in wiktionary. An actual dicdef should only be made *after* the term is verified. It's wrong to create something, with the intent of sparking a discussion on it. So, maybe, I'm not clear on what you propose. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 14:48, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

This is my first day using Wikipedia, so all this is very new to me. Sorry for any misunderstanding I may have caused the community due to my actions. My initial assumption was that pages could be created under the encyclopedia under any topic at all, but didn't even know about the user space until recently. Now that I know about it, I'd rather make it a user space too. How do I go about doing this? Do I leave it to the admins or must I do something on my behalf? Thanks for the support, much appreciated. <a href="../../../a/d/m/User%7EAdmorphit_343e.html" title="User:Admorphit">Admorphit</a></p>

<li>It doesn't contain the care that the other UTFs do, supporting only the 4 planes that are currently in use (as is done in UTF-18) seems like something that no serious unicode implementer would ever accept and could have easilly been worked arround by allowing UTF-16 surrogates for those ranges. UTF-9 isn't exactly well designed either as it does not allow simple searching to be used safely.<br />
Sure this isn't as outlandish as mplamps but i still don't think its serious.<br />

<ul>
<li>Well, technically it means that somewhere out there are about 135866 pages that replicate those 134, which means something in and of itself. Not arguing about its notability, though, just the 'Google not showing nothing' thing.&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode">Anetode</a> 11:23, 20 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, you're sort-of right, and sort-of wrong. The real problem, is some web servers have an infinite namespace. Meaning, that every time Google requests a path from a domain, it gets a "valid" response, and content is returned (but it's the same page, over and over). There's no duplication whatsoever on the original web site, but Google "counts" each and every url, which produces the same result. Depending on how a site makes it's links this can produce absurd hit counts. It's like a teacher taking attendance, and every time the teacher calls a name, the same kid yells "present", no matter what name is called. As well, Google will even count urls it never even *attempted* to fetch, simply because there was a link to them, and the linking text had the magical keyword. These snippet-free url's literally don't exist, but do get counted. In fact, here's what's funny, domains with non-existent/invalid TLDs get counted (probably not in this case) --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 12:37, 20 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Once again, Google never displays more than 1000 results, and the 134 unique ones are sorted out of the 1000. For example, a search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=sjgames&amp;lr=&amp;start=130&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=sjgames&amp;lr=&amp;start=130&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">sjgames</a> (Steve Jackson Games) finds 134 unique hits (of 450.000), and a search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=mistress&amp;lr=&amp;start=880&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=mistress&amp;lr=&amp;start=880&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">mistress</a> finds 885 (out of 11.200.000). If you don't believe me, find me a keyword which receives more than 1000 unique hits. - <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Rosoft_96ed.html" title="User:Mike Rosoft">Mike Rosoft</a> 06:00, 21 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, your twisting things. The first thousand, contains URLs from the same web sites, as those past the first thousand. The sites near the end tend to be the non-unique ones (redundant with earlier one). So, if the hit count is well below one thousand, it's likely those past the 1000-point were just redundant; and your distinction is a meaningless point, not to be worried about. Now, if it gets close to the 1000-mark (say 900+), then sure, there could well be more than a 1000 real hits. Also, you ignore, that Google counts as hits, URLs that are invalid, and that it never even *tried* to fetch. The snippet-free listings, tend to be at the end, and would presumabley be in the post-1000 group. Anything past the last verified, unique hit in Google's results, is pure speculation. No approach will find all web pages, since Google doesn't even get all web pages. The purpose of a Google test is to get a *verified* count. The fact the actual count could be higher, is always true, and pointless to mention. I've seen a case, where over 1,000,000 hits came from a *single* domain, which shows how worthless the non-unique hit count is. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 06:49, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I didn't nominate it because I wasn't sure if linux distros automatically warranted an article, but that not being the case, ditch it...I got 126 "real" google results (makes it much easier when you go 100 results per page)...the 100,000+ result is just repetition it seems <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHanson_59b8.html" title="User:PaulHanson">Paul</a> 13:08, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Just counting search result totals is not enough. It is important to read the pages that the search finds. Moreover, whilst Linux distributions do not automatically warrant an article, the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> guidelines for commercial products can be reasonably employed to determine whether a distribution meets the notability criteria as if it were a commercial product. Furthermore, the notability litmus test for software that I outlined in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_ExamDiff_%28second_nomination%29_044c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/ExamDiff (second nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/ExamDiff (second nomination)</a> is whether people, independent of the author, have written non-trivial works of their own that focus upon the software in question.
<p>Actually reading the pages that the search finds, I find independently written news coverage of this distribution in three separate news publications, including one of India's national newspapers. This satisfies both the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> criteria for a product and the software notability criterion that I outlined. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:17, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yes, obviously, one has to do more than count results. Of the stories linked to, just 2 are English. Both of these are "independent" but, in reading them, it's fairly clear no analysis was done, and the author merely reported what they were told on technical matters. So, these articles were trivial. Given that the size of the enterprise isn't what garners notability, I think what we need to find, is if this distro is a substiantially different and unique product. If SLYNUX is one of group, of barely differnt distros, it's not worthy of a topic. If it's Windows-like interface is special, and noted, that may make it unique (though it's hardly the first to make such a claim). The issue with GNU license is, is one can take another's GNU Linux distro, make small changes, and call it your own. Not all of these warrant articles, since not all are truly unique entitities. So, I'm still on the fence. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 18:47, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Obviously, the original hit count in Google was wildly silly and absurd. But, I'm going to make my decision based on something different from that, and different from the technical signifance of the product (which isn't supported). I think there's a human interest story, which was covered, and is probably notable, at least in India. If the same thing was made by a 30-year old from <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_Valley_c36d.html" title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a>, it probably wouldn't be worth mentioning. Also, I think as articles related to this are created and put up on AFD, they can quickly be re-directed to this one point (e.g. Kishore Prakash (AFD), MarileSoft (speedied), and Sarath Lakshman (no attempt yet)). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 07:33, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi, I'm Murray-Mint, Network Administrator at CLUK. Just to add my point of view. The article was added to Wikipedia by some of our attendees as a nice gesture towards us. Although it is nice to think we have our own Wikipedia entry, in all honesty, it's not needed. Wikipedia is not for advertising and we already have a link on the <a href="../../../l/a/n/LAN_Party_80db.html" title="LAN Party">LAN Party</a> page. Verdict: <b>Delete</b>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's just one of many brands, which use the same medicinal ingredient, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benzoyl_peroxide.html" title="Benzoyl peroxide">benzoyl peroxide</a>, which already has an article. So, I don't see anything special. I wouldn't call this a dicdef, but it's just not notable. I wouldn't do a a re-direct, since it's got other ingredients, and isn't literally the same thing; I suppose they can always change what they put in it. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 14:11, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. <i>If</i> the article goes into too much detail, it needs to be pared down, not deleted. The official rules are indeed available, but are much, much less helpful to the layman than this article is. I believe this article is perfect for <i>describing</i> how Magic is played; it's not in any way an "instruction manual". The 117 pages you mentioned are an instruction manual. The fair use issue is a legitimate concern, but simply is not valid support for the deletion of the article; only for deletion of some or all of the card images.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> So are we going to start posting the rules for every game in wikipedia? I'm fairly ambivalent to having separate pages like Sorry! rules or Candyland rules. I understand the main article for MtG is much longer than the articles for either of those games, but still...</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If there is sufficient content for an article--separate of the game page itself--is there any reason why we shouldn't? Sorry! just doesn't have enough rules, history, and just plain <b>content</b> to make it worth splitting up into separate articles. Magic does.</dd>
<dd>To use a different parallel: one or two articles seems to be plenty for <a href="../../../l/u/g/Lugbara_mythology.html" title="Lugbara mythology">Lugbara mythology</a>. You think that based on that, we should condense, say, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> into a single article, too? ... clearly, there is just vastly more content on some games (or religions) than others, which translates to more articles. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> 19:06, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can see both sides of the argument, so no vote on this one. The image usage may create a very legitimate fair use issue though.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:51, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>MTG rules are convoluted, complicated, and changes to them have been controversial. They have evolved over time and have an interesting history. One cannot really say the same thing for Sorry! or Candyland. A better comparison would be <a href="../../../p/o/k/Poker.html" title="Poker">Poker</a>, which has many sub-articles on gameplay. A very nice encyclopedic article can be written about MTG rules, and I think we already have one (that could perhaps use some editing). Concerns about image fair use are not relevant here and should be taken up at <a href="../../../p/u/i/WP%7EPUI_d69d.html" title="WP:PUI">WP:PUI</a> if an editor so desires. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 18:59, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The "Wikipedia is not instructive" thing is somewhat overstated. For example, it is right that the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pancakes.html" title="Pancakes">Pancakes</a> article, for example, contains what amount to recipes for the food, even though this is - technically - not allowed because of the policy you quote. This page is a valuable resource for many people, and is encyclopaedic, just as the <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gin_rummy.html" title="Gin rummy">Gin rummy</a> article contains the insturctions for how to play the game. This is just an extension of that. Also, I think your Fair Use comment is not true. I think Fair Use could very reasonably be asserted for all the images. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> 22:10, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, although I can see how edits might be necessary. To be honest, as the person who created this page, I was trying to removal a substantial section of the main article and put it on a separate page. It sort of blew up from there. On the other hand, I think the comparison with <a href="../../../p/o/k/Poker.html" title="Poker">Poker</a> is a entirely valid, so it really may not be as much of a problem as it seems. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaim_ed93.html" title="User:Khaim">Khaim</a> 01:41, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think you can easily verify the existence of your car. We only have your word to believe. That's the main problem with vanity pages, the verifiability of matierial, or boasts of achievements. I have no real problem otherwise. It's very easy to verify a public institution, but less so for private property, where notability comes in as a qualifier. For a public institution, the argument of notability doesn't apply. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 20:39, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> - Spangel is a legitimate term used to name a specific relationship between two fictional characters within a popular fandom. There are numerous web sites and livejournals dedicated to the fan fiction written exclusively about the intimate relationship between vampires Spike and Angel. This relationship has been referenced by the creator of the characters, Joss Whedon, in both print interviews and "Angel" season 5 DVD commentaries, as well as writers and co-producers of the show. It was made 'cannon' in the episode "Power Play". Anindoorkitty 23:50, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus (thus keep)</b>. Not an easy decision, but the policy says: when in doubt, don't delete. I count 7 delete votes (including the nominator), most of which have short motivation, apparently based on the opinion that no game fansite is encyclopaedic. On the other side, we have 4 keep votes (excluding the anonymous ones but including the rather new user Beerdude26), of which two merge and one perhaps merge. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 22:13, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Halflife2.net was influential in the development of Half Life 2, one of the most popular games of all time. -Miccy</p>
<p>If you don't like it, don't come here, but the fact is that Halflife2.net was infact a huge gateway to the revealing of critical key information for the game halflife2, and deserves just as much right to be here as other seemingly irrelevant articles. --- Wolfman</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> All personal tastes aside, her popularity is limited to those who know the movies of the labels she works for (all three of them are essentially run by the same person). Given that restriction she's a niché star at best, being one of the most recurring actresses in the films (having had many of these films named after her). I'm pretty undecided here, because being one of the most recurring actresses of a notable "underground" (or rather not-so-mainstream) porn label might not entirely meet the criteria for notability. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmodai_1a4e.html" title="User:Ashmodai">Ashmodai</a> 14:08, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep:</b> Just my opinion, of course, but I don't mind individual articles on high schools. Each high school has a broad and long-lasting influence on communities and alumni.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm voting out of principle, here, even though I imagine it won't make a blind bit of difference. I suspect Wikipedia's signal/noise ratio is declining, and articles like this contribute to that. But I can also see that there are a lot of no doubt well-meaning people who think that schools should be in Wikipedia. Sadly, after schools it will be courthouses, and then malls ( both already here, I'm ashamed to say ), and then local churches and temples, and graveyards, and, no doubt, post offices. I've already voted to delete a street and a university student drop-in centre today, but I can see the way the tide is running.

<li>I don't know, but it sounds like it's not. The article talks of currently living in mainland China (Guangdong). However, Jaing Mei Qi seems to be <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwanese</a><a href="http://su.ntu.edu.sg/e-zine/aug05/CAC%20Event.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://su.ntu.edu.sg/e-zine/aug05/CAC%20Event.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> and has travelled abroad. It sounds like "Jaing Mei Qi" easily qualifies for inclusion (provided adequate sources are provided). However, its not clear who the subject of this article is about, and if they qualify. Hopefully, those in the know, can provide some relevant links, here and in the article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 06:24, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Welcome to Wikipedia. As DES said, we need evidence according to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> that he meets at least one of the criteria there. These include having a song or album make a national chart, having completed a national tour, having recorded at least a couple of albums for a major record label, having won a major award or been a member of a significant group. If you or someone can change the article showing that he has achieved any of these things preferably with some proof, I would vote to keep. At the moment, I would vote to delete. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 00:07, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
