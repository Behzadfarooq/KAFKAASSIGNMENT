<li>No, it will not. If an article about a "Protestant pastor pedo" <i>who received the same amount of press attention</i> is swept under the rug, <i>then</i> it will indicate the same thing. Like it or not, notability is a criterion taken into account for articles, and like it or not, individual cases of pedophilia, no matter how reprehensible, aren't reaching the levels of infamy achieved by the Roman Catholic sex abuse scandal. I Google "Paul Shanley" and get 116,000 hits. I Google "Roy Gordon Lawrence" and get ... ten. The first of which is Wikipedia's own article. Plus... when you say Paul Shanley has "a whole article" on him, you're referring to <i>two paragraphs and one external link</i>. How many paragraphs are we devoting to Roy Gordon Lawrence?

<dd>You have a point there, but the difference between Shanley and Lawrence is that Shanley was a little more notable, and was a "prominent figure" in a greater Boston scandal (and we just love scandals), whereas Lawrence, although according to allegations is as equally troubled, is a little less notable. It is the first I'm hearing of him anyways, and I'm close enough to Ottawa. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Jay_e6f4.html" title="User:Master Jay"><font style="background:black"><b><font color="white">Jay</font></b></font></a><b><font style="background:gold">(<a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Jay_a66f.html" title="User talk:Master Jay">Reply</a>)</font></b> 00:41, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak <s>keep</s> delete and strong Cleanup</b>. Needs some NPOVing as noted above, including axing a several-hundred-word paragraph. Appears substantially documented, but I haven't dug into whether effects and reporting were widespread, whether the case had important influence on broader investigations, and so forth.

<li>(I apologize if editing in wrong place) - my official notes were put in the Talk page for that article. JzG is correct in that this is a difficult one. There are some factual things here. Roy Gordon Lawrence was charged, and served prison time. Those articles did appear in the paper. Most of the history (as in things 10+ years ago), though questionable POV, are true... the biggest criteria of db-attack are the comments regarding recent history (that Roy Gordon Lawrence is going to reoffend, won't admit to certain things, unrepentant, that he formed his own church, etc.) These things are 100% POV. The author can make statements to back up his POV, but there are other POVs (contraty to the authors POV) which can be backed up. Bottom line... this has "future battleground" written all over it. I just don't see its value or place on Wikipedia. Even just looking at the history of Roy Gordon Lawrence --Does Wikipedia want to become a criminal records database? This screams of an attack page, under the guise of public informance. This isn't about pedophilia (and indeed such is horrible!), this is about creating a soapbox and trying to taint the image of people associated with Roy Gordon Lawrence today (10+ years after the crimes) .. which in this case includes a local church that Roy Gordon Lawrence attends. Surely Wikipedia is not the place for this? Andyru</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> If Saddam Hussein claims to have sworn off massacres and poison gas attacks, does that mean that Wikipedia (or at least Christian WP editors) "should forgive" him and therefore should delete articles about his verified past activities? I'm not saying this person's history is equivalent to Saddam's; I'm just saying we should use WP's standards of verifiability and importance, rather than deleting the article because its side effects may include the unhappy consequences of this person's own actions. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 19:19, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Point well made Barno! I would reluctantly admit that there is valid argument where the article could be kept to the "historical" elements of Roy Gordon Lawrence's past in a NPOV format. (Though, I do believe even that would result in a bit of a battleground with the Author.) The main reason this was tagged as db-attack is that this author is well known for the spreading of "dirt" on Roy Gordon Lawrence in many forums (distribution lists, letters, now Wikipedia, etc.). It is done under the guise of public informance (akin to a "sex offender registry" ... "who's in your neighborhood" ... "he current lives here" ... "he goes to church there" scenario).</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Per <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, nobody except the Wikipedia owns an article once it's submitted.

<li><b>Delete</b> The author is using this article as a soapbox to mount a savage attack on a man that he victimized. Granted, Mr. Lawrence has an unsavory past. However, the author is intent on using any medium as a soapbox to attack Mr. Lawrence with allegations about more recent behavior that are untrue and designed to destroy him. Even if the article is cleaned up, will the History page still show the original article that is clearly libelous? <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Kosiam (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kosiam_a39c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kosiam">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

Pure motives? Then why start having children sleeping over in 2004 - and this is verified by numerous articles in the press - never challenged - and the press confirmed by quotes from Elders and Clerk of the new church where he teaches - that he did have kids sleeping over and these Elders told the reporter he was cured!
