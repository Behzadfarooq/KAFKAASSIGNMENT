<p>Does a totally obscure online RPG made by a one man dev team, using <a href="../../../b/y/o/BYOND_490a.html" title="BYOND">BYOND</a> software deserve a wikipedia article? Why don't we make an article for every homebrew game out there on the internet? Since when is wikipedia a directory for everything to have ever existed? A lot of effort has obviously been put into this article, there is more information here than there is on it's original website where it belongs. Their current website however, does tell us they have 18 players. <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 00:44, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. EIGHTEEN PLAYERS!? Look at the forums, 211 members so far, it may not be huge, but it is NOT 18 members. While I do admit that the game may not be huge, it is growing and effort has been put into this article (As you said) and I myself am planning to add more to the article, I feel that this should stay, although that is just me and I feel biased. - <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdie_9cbf.html" title="User:Mrdie">Mrdie</a>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Ranked number 10 on BYOND is not notability, I doubt being ranked number 1 on that network is notability. It's like saying your flash cartoon was number 1 on newgrounds, it's meaningless, and that's a great <i>first edit</i> <a href="../../../g/p/a/User%7EGparent_b9b8.html" title="User:Gparent">Gparent</a>. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 13:49, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. SS13 has no need to "make it big". It has problems already with morons who can't role-play and sit there killing everyone. Feh, I don't even care.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>: I must say that this article does indeed have more information about the game and it's aims than the website does. As previously stated this should be on the game's website. As is the nature of the game's community, I suspect that the information on here will not make it to the website. It is good, but sadly mis-placed. Stephen Badger 10:15 September 11 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: WP is not a web guide. The game would need to be significant, not just popular. The "Osama in a Blender" sort of thing gets a lot of hits and then is forgotten. In this case, it's an online game that isn't even finished, so, to have an article here, we have to be a crystal ball *and* a game site *and* a web guide. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:10, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - That's like saying that Red Shift is only of interest to utter scientific nerds. Even if SS13 doesn't affect our life, it's still a growing game and there's a wikipedia article to describe it.

<p>This is a friggin' internet encyclopedia! If you think Space station 13 is too small for this site, you are a snob...</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't particularly like the "Recommended games" links in the <a href="../../../b/y/o/BYOND_490a.html" title="BYOND">BYOND</a> article, looks too addy. I would recommend listing the top 10 BYOND games in an objective manner on the BYOND article without the flurry of external links. They barely change. We don't need the promotion. As for the article itself. <b>Delete</b> if we delete forums for having too few members a game with 11 players online and a 211 member forum really isn't enough. A quick description in BYOND is fine, though and I would like to see this info on their website. (WP isn't a webhost). - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:53, September 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Does it matter?</b>* I feel, being one of the chief Administrators and developers for Space Station 13, that I should step in and say a few words. First of all, nobody really cares weather this article exists or not. I don't care, nor do a lot of the community for SS13. However, there is the problem with the morality of the whole idea of deleting this wikopedia addition. This website is here purely for the sole purpose of providing it's users with information on more than what the standard encyclopedia offers. This means users can also add their own defintions of anything they want.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why do you all go completely made over a insignificant post that hardly takes up any space at all? Maybe if NASA or another national space assosciation launched a Space Station, labled #13, that would be good reason to delete this addition, in order to make room for a more official addition. Otherwise, the name isn't required for anything else, and therefore your argument is fruitless.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Don't start with this advertising crap, because if I wanted to, I could find at least 50 additions advertising products. Such an insignificant addition shouldn't be 'worried' about in such a way. Do what you want, it doesn't bother me, the original creator of SS13 nor does it bother any of the important members of the SS13 community. - AZA
<ul>
<li>Then those 50 articles should also be deleted. Please nominate them ASAP. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 07:06, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think this is a matter of inclusionism/deletionism. I nominated this article for deletion, not because it was badly written or incorrect, but because I feel that wikipedia should not just cover arbitrary topics of little encyclopedic worth. I think the article would be a lot better, and do <a href="../../../b/y/o/BYOND_490a.html" title="BYOND">BYOND</a> and their games a lot more justice if it was hosted on a dedicated online games/BYOND wiki. I believe if we let "harmless" articles like this exist, they will multiply, and wikipedia will just be a bloated useless web directory. One pop up advertisment isn't that harmful, but a 50 popups on a page are. If you really didn't care about the fate of this article, why has so much been said about it by the ss13 team? - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 21:37, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - It is not the only argument, but we don't think it merits being deleted because similar articles about games such as Half-Life 2 exist, and HL2 is irrevelant to the course of the universe and world events too <a href="../../../g/p/a/User%7EGparent_b9b8.html" title="User:Gparent">Gparent</a> 23:56, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - He is comparing HL2 to Space Station 13. Let's get some perspective here, HL2 was one of the most anticipated games ever, used an experimental delivery system, covered not only in the specialist gaming press, but garnered attention in mass media as well. It will spawn countless mods, official add on packs and will be remembered by many. Space Station 13 is a small online game, with a tiny community, made using commercial tools by a bedroom group, more people are likely going to see the article then are going to play the game. Course of the universe?

<li><b>Comment</b>. I expected that kind of answer. I was talking to the guy above that says that SS13 doesnt change anything in the world and stuff. I dont see how Half-Life 2 compares to the laws of physics. I can see the Source Engine having an entry, but Half-Life 2&#160;? A couple of other games use the engine too, it's not extraordinary. Why not have a half-Life 2 wiki instead&#160;? The hack could be described it, the millions of mod his predecessors have spawned. Thing is, the SS13 entry isnt really harmful, and I dont know why we should remove it unless you really hate the game/games in general. <a href="../../../g/p/a/User%7EGparent_b9b8.html" title="User:Gparent">Gparent</a></li>
