<li><b>Comment</b> At least I'm making an effort to save the page at all. Instead of paragraph after paragraph on why the article needs to go, why not put that effort into helping save the thing? Considering WV's population, Grafitti's 30K circulation is understandable. The paper is just like any other indie paper in larger cities that cover the music and arts scene. But in this case it covers the entire state. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 03:42, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The Daily Atheneaum, the WVU newspaper is a reliable, verifiable source. But without archives online. The Dominion Post charges just to read <i>anything</i> from their web site. I do not have the time to go scour the microfilm archives at the WVU library. The campus radio station is on the case. Give them a chance to help out. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 03:49, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>DarkAudit, the burden of proof for this is not on me but on those that wish to keep the article. I do no see any value in it nor do I see anything that meets <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> in my google searches. It's not on me, someone voicing an opinion here in AFD, to add anything to the article, and as a wikipedia editor you know this. You also are aware, or should be aware, of the main wikipedia policies and the many guidelines, and hence you should have known that the sources provided are not acceptable per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which is explained more in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. A reasonable person who is not from that area can not easily find information readily available about this place of business. As you are asking a radio station to help, this indicates to me that even someone interested in this club is having a difficult time finding reliable sources. Now this afd runs for another 4 days. That should be enough time to find a chapter in a book, a national/international newspaper or magazine that has a feature length article primarily about the club, or a national news network that has carried a story primarily about the club (not the owner). Please remember that a place of business could have dozens of articles in local newspapers, but that does not mean it is notable. What makes this club any more notable than any other indi club in the US or even the World? We need sources that pass wikipedia's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>/<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> policy. So far, none provided do. This isn't personal, so please do not feel this is an attack against you, the club, the owner, or the city. I'm not saying that the club isn't important to those that enjoy going to it, nor am I saying it isn't a part of the community's history. What I am saying is nothing about this club makes it notable (there is a local club that has hosted even bigger named acts than this club yet it is not notable either) --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a><sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bschott_2362.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bschott"><font color="green">view my history</font></a>)</sub>/<sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 10:29, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Notability isn't the issue here. The article was kept on those grounds the first time. The sources are what's being challenged now.

<li><b>Comment</b> - if the article has already been kept as notable, according to your argument above, then an AFD would not appear to be the proper way to handle a problem with soruces.

<li><b>Keep</b> sourced sufficient to survive AfD, editor committed to improvement, notiality established by role in regional music scene.

<li><b>Comment</b> After <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7ECharlotteWebb_8dbe.html#123_Pleasant_Street_Again" title="User talk:CharlotteWebb">consulting</a> with the Admin posting this nomination I sent notices to all Users contributing to the prior AfD on this article. I do not believe that this is sufficient, however, to remedy the situation. <i>I request that the comments of all editors from the previous AfD be considered as part of the record of this AfD.</i> To do otherwise would be profoundly unfair. Notice to the Users is not adequate because: 1)the tight time constraint imposed by the AfD, and 2)The chilling effect on expression which is caused by upsetting the first Consensus. It would amount to blatant "do over." Please consider this a formal request to incorporate these comments<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 19:43, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> This current re-do AfD is the product of a flawed <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDeletion_Review_0a7e.html" title="WP:Deletion Review">WP:Deletion Review</a>. <a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">The initiator of the DR</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">the sole User responding in the DR</a> misapplied the process and did not seem to understand the nature of "Consensus." The Consensus is a process that requires gaining the acceptance and agreement of the parties participating in a discussion. Although Consensus need not bring on board every participant, it is not a question of "having the better argument." <i>You have to convince others.</i> If you fail to do this your arguments may be "superior" in your own mind but they did not prevail. A process in which a User replaces the views of the participants with her own is not Consensus. It is at best arbitration. At worst it is whim. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlotteWebb_d424.html" title="User:CharlotteWebb">The Admin closing the original AfD</a> was correct in finding a Consensus of "Keep."<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 19:43, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
