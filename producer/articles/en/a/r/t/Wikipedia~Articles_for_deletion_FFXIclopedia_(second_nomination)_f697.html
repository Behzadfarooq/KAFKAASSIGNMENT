<dd>Why would this page be marked for deletion, but something like <a href="../../../w/o/w/WoWWiki_90d8.html" title="WoWWiki">WoWWiki</a> is not - this page was actually a copy/paste of the <a href="../../../w/o/w/WoWWiki_90d8.html" title="WoWWiki">WoWWiki</a> page. FFXIclopedia contains more articles than WoWWiki does and probably has a much larger user base. FFXIclopedia has nearly 100,000 unique visits a month and should be recognized for that. I do believe that FFXIclopedia meets the first criteria specified on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, at least as well as WoWWiki does. This is not an advertisement. Wikipedia is probably the last place an FFXI gamer would go to find how to complete quests/missions or find other factual information about Final Fantasy XI. FFXIclopedia is already referenced in numerous places on Wikipedia - see <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_XI_4c8e.html" title="Final Fantasy XI">Final Fantasy XI</a> for example. Wikipedia has borrowed information from FFXIclopedia in numerous cases - see <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_XI_character_classes_243d.html" title="Final Fantasy XI character classes">Final_Fantasy_XI_character_classes</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vana%27diel.html" title="Vana'diel">Vana'diel</a>.

<dd>The issue here is notability, not number of articles. WoWWWiki simply appears to be more notable overall.

<dd>I'm not sure how the notability of FFXIclopedia is even in question. Please, feel free to browse the site, look at the number of users, etc... the information that is in FFXIclopedia is amongst the most accurate for Final Fantasy XI. As I said, Wikipedia itself has used it as a resource already. It seems the community has already spoken. Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you are talking about. --<a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaniman_fb34.html" title="User:Ganiman">Ganiman</a> 20:53, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: What I'd like to see from the "keepers" is specific examples of how exactly this website passes <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. It was <i>claimed</i> on the talk page (and copied above) that it does pass criteria 1, which states "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself," but where's the proof? Also, if Wikipedia has in fact used it as a resource in the past, then it should be a <i>citation</i> in that/those article(s). What we need to focus on here is whether it merits its own article. Provide sources here folks.

<li><b>Comment</b> Seeing as <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is a guideline and not a policy, there is no need for it to pass notability. And the fact that you get 26,700 hits from google when searching for "site:FFXIclopedia" it is notable enough to be added. As well as it being a great resource for FF information. What I would like to see from the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionist" class="extiw" title="m:Deletionist">Deletionists</a> is a reason why this does not merrit it's own article when it has so many articles, and has that many hits on Google?

<li><b>Comment</b> Alexa traffic rank is 48,379. WoWWiki, on the other hand, has a rank of 5,737. Also, searching for FFXIclopedia using "site:FFXIclopedia" yields 7 <b>unique</b> results. Searching for just "FFXIclopedia" (in quotes) yields 71 <b>unique</b> hits. All the other hits are either repeats, individual articles in the wiki, or message boards and irrelevant sites - therefore, the 27,100 number is <i>invalid</i>, and this site fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. --<b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Coredesat</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat">talk. o.o;;</a></small> 09:16, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, if you throw that out, then you still have the search engine problem. It fails the search engine tests miserably. The site obviously isn't that popular if it's only gained a few Google and Yahoo hits in the last year or so (it was deleted for lack of notability stemming from the search engine test). Subjects here must have <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> notability. With only 7 or 71 Google hits and only a few more Yahoo hits, there isn't any. --<b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Coredesat</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat">talk. o.o;;</a></small> 10:05, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> My significant-other is quite notable to me, but I certainly wouldn't start a Wikipedia article about her, so saying "this site is notable to me" isn't a compelling argument.

<li><b>Comment</b> I want to address three points: First, in response to claims that the wiki is not a web directory, I give you this page: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_wikis.html" title="List of wikis">List of wikis</a>. If the wiki is so strict as to have a page exclusion based upon the "non-web-directory" criteria, then what is the point of that page. That page is intended to list notable wikis. FFXIclopedia.org is a noteable wiki. The inclusion in the wiki is not to just add another directory listing, but to give recognition to a notable wiki. Second, to those using Alexa as a basis for comparison between WoWwiki and FFXIclopedia, your premise is inherently flawed. The user base of WoW is almost 100x that of FFXI. Thus any traffic for a database used for WoW will outstrip any traffic for a database for FFXI. It's like comparing the population of New York with the population of Rhode Island and saying that Rhode Island doesn't deserve recognition as a state because it doesn't have enough people. The fact is that FFXIclopedia has more data about its game, then WoWwiki has about WoW. FFXIclopedia is a more notable website for FFXI, than WoWwiki is for WoW. Finally, for the FFXI game, FFXIclopedia is one of the premier websites. The fact that it is wiki based makes it even more noteable. It is the only user-driven database for the FFXI game out there. It is the most dynamic and the most up to date. In comparison to traffic of other FFXI websites, FFXIclopedia ranks near the top. Thus, in summary, it is notable because it is one of the largest FFXI sites on the web, it is wiki based, and it is the only user driven website for FFXI. - Mierin (FFXIclopedia administrator) <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rolks (<a href="../../../r/o/l/User_talk%7ERolks_5082.html" title="User talk:Rolks">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rolks_0631.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rolks">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

A Premiere Community has been official recognized by the game operator as a site helpful to the user and one that is recommended for usage. Currently only five communities (Englsih Communities) rank as Premiere. But I have to say, I haven't found the FFXIclopedia among those.</li>

<dd>That being said, as a gamer of FFXI, this Wiki is indeed one of the best and most reliable sources on FFXI. Due to it being a wiki it integreates better than every other page for FFXI all the different games aspects. Depending upon what is needed and usefull it serves as a mere database with lost of different information and is logical connected to each other, but it also serves as a consie game guide or walkthrough for quests.</dd>
<dd>Other pages for FFXI have their strength either in Walkthroughs or in mere Databases, the FFXIclopedia has both strengths and others. It isn't perfect, but it is indeed a very important tool for FFXI gamers, used by many.</dd>
<dd>I do play FFXI, I do use the FFXIclopedia as my primary source of information on various things. Do do not play WoW and before this discussion I had heard of various WoW pages, but never of WoWWiki. --84.184.85.201 06:53, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> Just to have asked; Do you not find the article interesting? Do you not "learn" anything about the subject? That is why I never understand <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionist" class="extiw" title="m:Deletionist">deletionists</a>, instead of looking at the content of the article you automatically run for the delete button when you find nothing on Google or Alexa about it. This article isn't a stub, it's full of content; allright, it needs cleaning, but so do many articles on Wikipedia. Someone pushing <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">random article</a> and landing on this article might find it interesting. Is that not the reason we are here? To collect all the information of the world. You may argue that it's not notable, and I would have understand why you would want it removed if it was a silly little stub of two lines with no information about the subject matter. But this article does not fall under that. And it even promotes Wikipedia, by showing everyone that free and available information that can be edited by anyone is good. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 21:01, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> I am a user of the disputed wiki FFXIclopedia, and I have made minor edits/changes to it as well. If I can demonstrate other, high traffic FFXI-related sites linking to the wiki and referring to it's content - is that enough&#160;? If another site or author makes certain statements about the wiki, does that meet the criteria&#160;? Will that satisfy the Verification criteria&#160;? There is quite a bit of work to be done to clean up the article, and I want to know what it will take before I take the time to do it. --Eue 21:22, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> Okay, after taking a closer look at the pages in question, I think I know what the problem was. I have removed the part of the article referring to the history of the web site. I am still prepared to hunt down external references to FFXIclopedia - the issue with a totally third party source is, that our site is considered authoritative amongst people who actually play the game - meaning almost any links thru search engines will be circular (i.e., they will link right back to us, as someone has already pointed out). Please keep discussing, and let me know what else needs to be done. --Eue 22:06, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<b>Keep</b> Okay, I have been able to find Alexa ranking for the site&#160;: as it relates to Final Fantasy XI-related websites, FFXIclopedia is 4th most popular. The only three sites that are more popular are ffxi.allakhazam.com (which is a general-purpose MMORPG database/forum), ffxi.somepage.com (another general-purpose MMORPG database/forum), and www.playonline.com (the official website for Final Fantasy XI). Generic Alexa ratings or Google searches are not very clear, because of the requirement WP:WEB and WP:NOT seem to need more than just a raw statistic. This particular reference, however, is a categorised search&#160;: It is a top five site, when people are searching Alexa specifically for Final Fantasy XI. I have added this source to the article, and now can state that the article now meets WP:NOT. Also, I have read into the standards for pop-culture sites and propose that people bear that guideline in mind as well&#160;: insofar as many pop-culture sites will not have the formal press acknowledgments..... in either case, I am more than willing to keep trying, but the Alexa ranking <b>within the subject matter at hand</b> clearly shows the web site is notable.

<p><b>Comment</b> I'm done arguing this. You seem bound and determined to delete this regardless of what we say regarding notability of the site. Within the FFXI community, FFXIclopedia is notable. I have no clue where this verifiability requirement, or Kunzite's requirements for awards and recognition came from. You all seem to want to place real high standards for this site to meet, and no matter what standards we meet, you all seem to raise the requirements higher. So just delete it.</p>
<p>Our main contention was that if WoWWiki and Guild Wars Wiki are included, then FFXIclopedia should be included as well. Using Alexa, FFXIclopedia is 4 out of 55 sites. However, WoWWiki is 5 out of 45 sites and the Guild Wars Wiki isn't even in the top 10. Yet, both WoWWiki and Guild Wars Wiki are somehow considered notable enough for a Wikipedia entry, but FFXIclopedia is not. Ironically, I called FFXIclopedia a premier site, and AbsoluteDan shot down this statement saying Square Enix doesn't list it as a premier site. But looking at the Alexa rankings, two of the sites listed as premier by Square Enix do not even make the top ten, and FFXIclopedia is listed higher than two other "premier" sites. I don't know how much more proof of notability and suitability for Wikipedia entry you want.</p>
<p>As a minor note, it should be noted that we are only having this discussion because the Wikipedia itself has a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_wikis.html" title="List of wikis">List of wikis</a> in which notable wikis are listed. FFXIclopedia is also notable because it is a wiki.</p>
<p>FFXIclopedia, within the FFXI universe, is more notable than WoWWiki and Guild Wars Wiki are within their own universe. That is my arguement; Eue, Gahoo, and Havok have provided my support. If that is not good enough for you, nothing more we say will be. Just delete it. It's what you realy want to do, so just delete it. But you should also delete the WoWWiki and Guild Wars Wiki too. --Rolks 17:20, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> I'd like to add one more note before this page meets it's doom. We've put up more of a fight to keep this page than WoWWiki and GuildWiki have combined. Both of those pages have been stubs and remain stubs. They were not challanged nearly as much as FFXIclopedia has been, yet pages like <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girlfriend.html" title="Girlfriend">Girlfriend</a> are allowed to exist. (Seriously, take a look at that page; Wikipedia is not supposed to be a dictionary right? All I see there is definitions of the word and there is nothing notable about it - that crap belongs in Wiktionary, not Wikipedia). Seriously, what is one more page in Wikipedia? So much crap and misinformation is allowed to live here, and people with the most page edits or whatever are allowed to be self-proclaimed Wikipedia police and do what they feel based on the mood they happen to be in that day. As I've said, the entire process is laughable, and I'm starting to believe the editors at FFXIclopedia make better arguments and more sound decisions than the editors at Wikipedia. Delete this page, it's what you want, and no matter what we say, for whatever unknown reason, Dan is going to win, but at least be fair and be thorough and search wikipedia for even more bogus articles and mark them for deletion. --<a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaniman_fb34.html" title="User:Ganiman">Ganiman</a> 18:03, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> I agree this is all pretty absurd. One of two things should happen. 1) The more complete history of the FFXIclopedia is added back in with pretty charts and pictures so that it is not a stub-ish entry and actually provides some interesting background on what is without question a notable site in the FFXI community. There would more than likely be no way to verify the facts in the article, but it could have the unverified stub. Or 2) The stub-ish entry is left without the unverified stub. Since the facts the article in that form are self-verifying. I would think that something that seeks to be an encyclopedia would rather have an interesting article with a historical account than the stub-ish article, but I will defer to the larger contributors as to what is preferred. --Gahoo 19:33, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
@AbsolutDan&#160;: The Pop-culture note I referred to was the final part of WP:RS - which states that while the site must have a verifiable source, it is understood that "due to the subject matter, many may not be discussed in the same academic contexts as science, law, philosophy and so on. Therefore, the most reliable material available is expected, but sources for these topics should not be held to as strict a standard." I propose that the site be regarded as a pop-culture site for these purposes.</p>
<p>Also, regarding you dispute of the Alexa source&#160;: the content of the other sites in the category are tangent to the fact that Alexa categorized the site in the first place. It is not, therefore, the reliability of the other sites in the category, but the reliablity of Alexa that grants the criteria needed to verify that FFXIclopedia is notable.</p>
<p>As far as people being very concerned about the high number of forum posts and blogs related to the subject&#160;: that is the nature of a pop-culture subject. Particularly with Final Fantasy XI, which is a Japanese game with international participation&#160;: there are only three English-language publications that are specific to the game, and the only regular press coverage for the game are press releases for the actual game itself (and its expansions). All English-language information or references to Final Fantasy XI <b>in general</b> derives from forum posts and blog entries. That is, until FFXIclopedia was started. But the community of people who play the game have traditionally used forums to spread information. Also, the wider press coverage in English is not very broad, since Sqaure Enix relies on word of mouth and the Final Fantasy name to sell the game; the "hard news" or third party review of the site that the deletionists have been demanding simply will not be there for any web site dealing with this subject matter.</p>
<p>Again, where it concerns the <b>subject at hand</b>, Alexa demonstrates that the site is the 4th most popular site. That meets WP:NOT. I propose that other concerns be relegated to the pop-culture provision of WP:RS - that very accurately describes the kind of site/reference/article we are dealing with here.</p>
<p>@ Havok - I believe someone may have added the stub back to the article to try to save it.... I have removed a large section of material that did not focus on the factual presentation/description of what the site is and why it is important (or, more to the point, why it is importnat enough to be in Wikipedia). --Eue 20:04, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The fact that the site is outdated is because the TV show that it's based on ended a while ago and there has been little new information to update it with. A site being updated on a daily basis still makes no difference. It's still the most popular site on the alexa list and has a rather popular forum that is posed in on a daily basis. This site is non-notable. It fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> it should be removedand converted to a link or section on the game page. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 18:30, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
