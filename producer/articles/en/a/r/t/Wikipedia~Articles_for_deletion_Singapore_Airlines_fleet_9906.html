<p>This nomination accompanies the Singapore Airlines flight numbers nomination. The fleet is not noteworthy enough in itself to need its own article.

<li>Where does the source belong to? SOME of the information, what do you mean? I have a feeling that you are trying to pin-point at our articles. Wikipedia has so many unencyclopedic articles, and this informative encyclopedic information is nominated for deletion. This does not fall in the criteria of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information. So let's just withdraw this AFD, instead of making a big fuss here. Could we all discuss this at the talk page instead of bringing it to AFD and the article will be gone forever. --<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerenceong1992_0ff6.html" title="User:Terenceong1992">Ter</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerenceong1992_0ff6.html" title="User:Terenceong1992">nc</a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User_talk%7ETerenceong1992_1c6d.html" title="User talk:Terenceong1992">e Ong</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_New_Year_greetings_9e91.html" title="Chinese New Year greetings">恭喜发财</a>) 17:09, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>A few things: first, where's this talk page you reference? The article's discussion page hasn't even been created. Secondly, the "Wikipedia has so many unencyclopedic articles" argument is old, tired, and doesn't work - you're an AfD veteran, you should know that by now. If you know of other unencyclopedic articles, you're free to AfD them yourself. Lastly, since this is not the type of information one would find in an encyclopedia or almanac, how is this not an indiscriminant collection of information? -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThesquire_8265.html" title="User talk:Thesquire">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thesquire_ea24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thesquire">contribs</a>)</small> 17:41, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>You seem to be taking this as a personal attack. If you looked at my edit history you'd see that I've been going through airport and airline articles to clean them up. When I got to the SIA article I noticed a lot of unencyclopedic information. No one is belittling the myriad of contributions you've made to other articles about Singapore.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Singapore is one of the truly important global carriers and this discussion of their fleet is fascinating.

<ul>
<li>Please note that I looked at this user's last 2000 edits and found none to any articles related to Singapore. However, I did discover that the user frequently goes to Afd pages to vote keep and then make comments like this. Furthermore, spending a year developing an informative presentation does not qualify material for inclusion in Wikipedia. Original research quite often takes more than a year, and that is explicity against policy. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">Dbinder</a> 01:45, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What is your point? Must I have edited this article to vote? Or are you saying that only editors who work on Singaporean topics can participate here?

<li>It's really not hard to look at someone's edit history. It took me all of 2 minutes. I didn't say you have to have participated in the Singapore project to vote. I was referring to your reason for your vote, which is ridiculous. Your statement that you "could spend hours digging into something like this" implies that you have some level of interest. Yet, not once have you even made a minor edit to a Singapore-related page. It also appears to be a trend that you vote keep and say how important an article is when you have no prior involvement in the subject. If you had voted keep because you believe it belongs in Wikipedia, then that would have been fine, but don't pretend to be overly interested in something you're not. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">Dbinder</a> 12:51, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">Dbinder</a>, your attempt to discredit my vote by branding it <i>ridiculous</i> is in very poor taste. As you are an authority given the "<i>two minutes</i>" you spent studying my last two thousand edits, you probably know that I edit articles purely at random. Your analysis would further show that my edit list articles do not reflect any particular interest. I would also submit that they do not reflect the articles that I read. They do not, by definition, show how I spend the hours of my day. Of course, your interpretation may be different, given that you spent "<i>all of two minutes</i>" on the issue, although in my defense I would say it took me somewhat more than "<i>two minutes</i>" to make those edits.</dd>
<dd>I did not ask if you were an authority on the airline industry. I did not ask if you were an expert on Singapore. I do not know if you are an airline executive with a grudge or an unemployed student with too much time on his hands. I do not know what articles you edit, or if you do any editing at all. I am also not going to ask to see the books you take out of the library. However, I stand fully by what I said. Airline fleets interest an enormous amount of people. SIA interests an enormous amount of people. If this was not true, I would have a hard time explaining the +100,000 google hits for the topic <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22SIA%22+fleet+&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=beW&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22SIA%22+fleet+&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=beW&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>
<dd>I do not believe that editing an article makes one an expert. I am unsure that there is a correlation between editing an article and knowledge.

<dd>Your comment does nothing to refute my claim. The fact that the subject is interesting to a large number of people is not what the debate is about. The question is whether a series of tables about an airline's fleet belongs in an encyclopedia. Finally, your sarcastic comments are not appreciated. If you interpret my questioning of your motives for voting here as a personal attack, then I apologize, but responding in kind is counterproductive. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">Dbinder</a> 15:25, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I do consider your questioning of my motives to be a personal attack, although I will accept your apologies. However, I am not here to refute your claims about my interests. Please also refrain from lecturing me about which comments are productive. I have not found your approach here to be productive. I did not find your attack to be productive.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> An article on the fleet of a major international airline is encyclopedic (as far as a wiki encyclopedia - not paper - goes) and, as far as I'm concerned, reasonably interesting too.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I have yet to see a fleet table that requires an article. If you read the intro it sounds like an advert for the airline. There is a discussion going on about what needs to be in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Airlines_c0f3.html#Fleet_Data_revisited" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Airlines">fleet table</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> As per below comment, it is ridiculous to believe that an article like this should be seen as setting a standard across all airline pages. Just as <a href="../../../a/i/r/Category%7EAirline_destinations_a311.html" title="Category:Airline destinations">Category:Airline destinations</a> does not contain an article for every single airline on this planet, it is ridiculous to set standards on how much information wikipedia can offer for specific topics of interests. The fleet table may be standardised to improve on aesthetic appeal and for ease in comparisons. Its standardisation does not have to be related to this particular article, however, for both can obviously co-exist as it already does so for SIA.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 17:36, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Better to leave that to the aviation websites. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:12, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikisource hosts previously published materials, not editor compiled lists. Perhaps some of this material would qualify, but do not delete because you are anticipate it being kept at Wikisource.--<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB"><font color="#F4A460">Birgitte§β</font></a> ʈ <a href="../../../b/i/r/User_talk%7EBirgitteSB_b59e.html" title="User talk:BirgitteSB"><small><font color="#778899">Talk</font></small></a> 14:49, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I may be biased as the main contributor to this article, but that others similarly point out that SIA is considered a major player in the international aviation industry scene enforces the point that article like these should not be deleted based on the feasibility of having similar pages for <b>all</b> airlines. This article's existance does not entail that, and it never had that intention to. Individuals are entirely at their liberty to add similar pages to any other airline they deem feasible to do so. Secondly, this page is not difficult to maintain as claimed, for airlines generally do not see changes in their fleets any faster than otherwise imagined, especially when we are talking about SIA who buys exclusively wide-bodied aircraft, which are high-value planes usually taking months, if not years, to change hands. Last but not least, "listcraft", wikisource, and all that kind of stuff do not exactly apply here, when it seems neccesary to constantly emphasise that this is a <b>helper article</b> to prevent the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Airlines_77f1.html" title="Singapore Airlines">Singapore Airlines</a> page from becoming a monster article. I would certainly question the existance of all articles in <a href="../../../a/i/r/Category%7EAirline_destinations_a311.html" title="Category:Airline destinations">Category:Airline destinations</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airline_call_sign.html" title="Airline call sign">Airline call sign</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Boeing_777_operators_fc66.html" title="List of Boeing 777 operators">List of Boeing 777 operators</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/World%27s_busiest_airports_by_passenger_traffic.html" title="World's busiest airports by passenger traffic">World's busiest airports by passenger traffic</a>, amongst plenty of other similar articles. Deletionists will probably have a field day listing all of them for deletion if "listcraft" and "indiscriminant collection of information" are their sole criterion. I have yet to see anyone actually explaining why this is an "indiscriminant collection of information" btw.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 14:21, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Not an interesting article. Too much bland statistical information, and I can't see how it could be improved. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESingopo_d907.html" title="User:Singopo">Singopo</a> 15:31, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am surprised that personal "interest" is also a criteria for deletion. "Bland" statistics have a place in wikipedia, for they form the basis for more in-depth analysis. And that, of coz, is one example of a major room of improvement for this article, along with other possibilies for expansion (not neccesarily using statistics alone).--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 17:31, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
