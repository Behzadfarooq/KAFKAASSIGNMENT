<p><b>Delete.</b> I have no idea what in the h— this is all about. The fan club’s website says that they admire the guy (Mike Lorek) because he “can perform amazing feats such as making a Chinese man’s face out his stomach by squeezing the fat together with his fingers.” I wish this were a speedy but I can’t come with the basis. If someone else can, please do. •<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 02:24, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> It's interesting but not suprising that you chose to simply write this off as vanity and a, "puppetfest", rather then actually stating some valid issues with the entry. I'm actually suprised this wasn't accused of a, "puppetfest", sooner but you can't ignore some of the points being made about the entry, and the pointing out that some of the the comments against the entry weren't made, "in good faith". Policies are in place for a reason and this should be taken seriously.Ognit Ice 18:13, 2 December 2005 (UTC) <small>No edits from this user prior to <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_30.html" title="November 30">November 30</a> 2005</small></li>

<p><b>Keep</b> Growing up as a poor Jewish child in downtown Philadelphia, I hope that this entry is not deleted. This entry has made me come to realize that the Mike Lorek Fan Club is probably one of the best and most noteworthy clubs in The United States. I feel it should stay on here to help other people discover this wonderful organization that tries to help so many underprivileged Jewish children. <small><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.166.172.57 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.166.172.57_ff6c.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.166.172.57">contribs</a>).</small></small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b> What kind of hypocrite would come on here and say someone has too much time on there hands for creating an article when there on here criticizing it? It's ludicrous to say that someone has a limited social life when 1)You don't know them and 2)Your ONLINE bashing someone. Take a look in the mirror before you criticize someone. Does it make you feel better about yourself for bashing a legitimate organization that has its own .com and domain name? This organization has built a strong reputation over the years and has been nothing but benficial to its community. If you think it makes you some kind of a hero to come on here and try and clean up what you deem crap, it doesn't. If you want to "clean up" the internet, theres plenty of pointless weblogs and pornography sites you can waste your time picking on. To quote Bob Dylan, "don’t criticize what you can’t understand." This page does not break any of the rules, and atleast there not hypocritically criticizing people for using, "The Free Encyclopedia that anyone can edit".<a href="mailto:IcePro88@yahoo.com" class="external text" title="mailto:IcePro88@yahoo.com" rel="nofollow">IcePro88</a> <small><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.255.30.84 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.255.30.84_7444.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.255.30.84">contribs</a>).</small></small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b> I suppose I should take time out of my busy social life to support a fine local establishment that is under the unfair criticism of some misinformed blokes that should do a little research before they start casting judgments. This local establishment has helped our community time and again. For instance, they hold an annual car show that is always entertaining and brings the community together. Who cares if they decide to poke fun at their mascot's bizarre talents and have a little humour to lighten things up? They're a great bunch of guys who are a local asset and if that's not "notable" enough to be part of this database, I don't know what is... maybe whoever reviews this stuff should concentrate on some of the more questionable entries and let this genuine cause alone?<a href="mailto:chrsmitty@yahoo.com" class="external text" title="mailto:chrsmitty@yahoo.com" rel="nofollow">ChrisMyth</a>--207.255.30.84 03:54, 30 November 2005 (UTC) <small>Second vote from this IP address.</small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b>I don't really know what to say to convince those that want this page deleted that it should not be deleted, BUT this organization is actively involved in the community and deserves to be recognized on Wikipedia.

<b>Keep</b> To know that such a great organization is under fire like this really shows me what this world is coming to. We allow pornography on the internet but the Mike Lorek Fan Club should be banned from all knowledge databases? This is a sad and shameful thing to see. I personally know that the Mike Lorek Fan Club takes care of those around them and tries to bring POSITIVE influences to the area with annual car shows in Sidman, PA, participating in annual events such as the Easter Seals Softball Tournament held in Roxbury, and assisting in the Le Dance Academy's Yearly performance in Windber, PA. They support the local Forest Hills football team by making an appearance at the community Pep Rally and going to the games. They support the local diners with their weekly "Wing Nite" night held all over the area. How could anyone wish for such an organization to be removed from recognition on Wikipedia? This organization is a breath of fresh air to the community, local- and internet-wise and anyone who wants to see this database removed obviously prefers gloom and downtroddenness over positive and upbeat knowledge and activities!</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Why are you people always trying to take away the freedom of speech in this country and the freedom of assembly? The MLFC is a perfectly legitimate organization determined to place emphasis on our fundamental freedoms while not subjecting anyone to forms of degradation nor using any forms of elicit discrimination. The group is a highly respectable organization in the community of Johnstown, and it is determined to florish and help create a utopian society. Without groups like the MLFC, our society will reach a cataclysmic low in morale and become socially impotent. Would you like to cause the demise of society? If so, then vote yes to delete this.

<p><b>Keep</b> I don't understand what all the fuss is about? It sounds like this fanclub is a legimitate regional organization working towards a positive goal. I also believe that the process of deletion is being handeled innappropatly. The policy of vanity articles states:</p>
<p><i>The user who created the article is most often a new, or newer user. If there is nothing particularly offensive about the page, please be kind to the newbie. Suggestion: before beginning any deletion procedures on a vanity article, it is sometimes found that by simply politely informing the creator of the article that this appears to be a vanity article, and by pointing him or her to this page first, that the author him or her self will sometimes easily agree to the deletion him or herself, thus saving much waste of time and energy on the parts of all concerned parties.During any debates regarding vanity article that are listed at articles for deletion, disparaging comments may fly about the subject of the article/author (often presumed to be the same person) and the author's motives. These may border on personal attacks, and may discourage the article's creator from future contributions. Remember to please always assume good faith.</i></p>
<p><i>Usually, vanity articles are not recreated after being deleted. It is believed that the majority of vanity article creators forget about their vanity articles and do not revisit at all; this is evident in that they rarely defend the article during the deletion debate.</i></p>
<p>All I found were imflamatory comments directed at the members of this orginization and critizing their personal lives. I strongly believe that these comments cannot simply be taken "in good faith." This organization has a legitimate reason to be on the wikipedia. Don't judge them by your own standards. --128.118.51.117 16:03, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> As the Vice-President of the Mike Lorek Fan Club (MLFC), I am sickened that people want to take the MLFC out of Wikipedia. Obviously, we are in the end times. The people of this world that want to take away the good (MLFC) and relish in darkness are trying to get their way. The MLFC has been not only a spark of light in the Johnstown, PA community, but it has been a true inferno. We are like Bat Man, we help out when you least expect it. We don't need thank you's or cash donations---we just like to see people smile. If we were able to put a smile on one Jewish kid's face, then I know that we've done our job! We don't discriminate against any gender, race or creed----we are out to help the people of this great world. We have raised money to help people find homes, jobs, food and clothing by the money that we raised w/ the softball tournament that we were in over the summer of 2005. We are not a bunch of immature people that are out to have a good time. We are a UNIT that is out to make the world smile, one face at a time. ---Harrison vote <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 136.183.156.248 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_136.183.156.248_0ac6.html" title="Special:Contributions/136.183.156.248">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p><b>LEAVE IT BE</b> As president of this fan club I want to say that this great support for our club shows me and should show everyone else how much it truly means to us all. Even if we were to get deleted from this page it would be Wikipedia's great loss and not ours. We know we have true fan club that's a real tangable thing and not some made up waste of an entry like maybe the Kuchera Fan Club would be. If Wikipedia won't accept us maybe Webster's will. This is the United States of American and we belong in here for all the world to discover and enjoy!!! Send us your weirdos, your crazies, your poor, your sick, your has beens, your never was's, your unpopular wastes because there is a little Mike Lorek Fan Club in all of us.....::::leaving the room humming the Star-Spangled Banner:::::: -President Hutsky</p>
