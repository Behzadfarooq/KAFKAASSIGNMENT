<p><b>Delete</b>:Whole lists of nobility. Each with a description. Many are irrelevant to the wikipedia concept and very few entries on Google. Wonder whether the format of the page has to change or whether we have to delete also the linked sites on each of the nobility. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltesedog_6843.html" title="User:Maltesedog">Maltesedog</a> 20:10, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well the scope of this afd was because there are various links to various title holders to other pages of Wikipedia. Maltese nobility is of no importance in Malta apart to the title bearer which is proud of his inheritance! I mean, is there the need to give so much important to people which are not really famous after all in Malta? Ask how many people know them! Very few i'm afraid. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltesedog_6843.html" title="User:Maltesedog">Maltesedog</a> 19:34, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Just because "very few" are famous in Malta doesn't detract from the fact that Maltese nobility such be recorded... I refer to my earlier comments and would reiterated Wikipedia is enhanced by having a reference to Maltese nobility. <a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhyddfrydol_22ef.html" title="User:Rhyddfrydol">Rhyddfrydol</a> 20:16, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Well I didn't mean to imply that there should be a reference to Maltese nobility. But is there the need to enter into deep detail on each and every noble in Malta through the various articles linked therein in the main reference? Well if you live in Malta you would understand me. Nobility leaves no impact and hardly anyone knows about it, i'm afraid.
<ul>
<li>You should be careful what you edit for deletion. History in all formats is important for Malta. Please try and remember that. It clearly shows your stupidity. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The nobility is per definition a notable group in society, and most families of the higher nobility are at least somewhat notable or have some notable members. Looking at the articles makes it clear that many of these families once played a significant economic and political role in the history of the island. That this may no longer be the case is no reason to delete them from historical memory. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 17:07, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>A Strong Keep</b>. The Maltese Nobility played an important part of the Maltese history in the past. May not play any part today but thats like so many countries today. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a></li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Tancerville. Personal opinion difers, and one should respect it. It is not a matter of stupidity. I still insist, that the article contains a great deal of unnecesary information, so at least somethings have to be removed if not deleted completly. The stupid are those who call other stupid. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltesedog_6843.html" title="User:Maltesedog">Maltesedog</a> 12:23, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Opinions of people are not the same, I agree, but when you have everyone stating to keep then that should send a strong message to you. If you reduce the details it becomes unnecessary to leave it there. Each peice of data contains necessary information of history. Perhaps some wording can be changed but the peice as it stands should be kept as a whole. When you mentioned that the younger generation are not aware of the Nobility, I feel your misleading people, as if you remember studying Maltese history, it was full of Nobles leading the charge for Malta to become where it stands today. A primeminister was also a member of the Nobility. Lord Strickland was also a Count of Catena. This is vitual information that shouldnt be forgotten. Much of our politicans were members of the Nobility. One of our Maltese EU members of Parliament is a member of the Nobility. (Attard-Montalto is the Baron of San Paolino). Past or Present, the Maltese nobility is with us. Socialist or Nationalist, the nobility are involved in either politican parties. Beware and learn but also be proud of who you are. Dont try and hide what the Maltese truelly are. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a>11.27 pm 13th September 2005 (EST)</li>

<li>Tancerville - you have personal interests in keeping the article, and your view on the matter is biased. It is true that the Mr. Attard Montalto is of noble birth, however his work is purely of a political nature, and has no connection with his noble ancestary. Rest assured that I'm not hiding in any way what Maltese truly are. I insist that the article should be amended, removal of copyright work and list format if not deleted completly. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltesedog_6843.html" title="User:Maltesedog">Maltesedog</a> 11:49, 14 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is absurd. Nobility are inherently notable - Maltese or otherwise, past or present. It is absolutely absurd of you to "insist" anything - that is exactly what the AfD process is about. Interest of Maltese nobility to Maltese today is irrelevant to encyclopedic entries about nobility. There is already overwhelming concensus to <b>keep</b> this article, irrespective of your constant "insisting". Wikipedia is not about hashing out whether or not Maltese consider their nobility important.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 08:28, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I know little about Maltese history. Whether or not the Maltese nobility are important today, it does no harm in having an entry on them in Wikipedia. They exist, and their existence informs us of the continuity of Maltese society, if nothing else. Perhaps someone could add a section explaining the role they played in the past. Even without such a section, it seems an innocuous article. <a href="../../../g/w/i/User%7EGwimpey_8c96.html" title="User:Gwimpey">Gwimpey</a> 00:28, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Its not a question of copyvio but a question whether they should be left in this format in wikipedia or not. The other article has nothing to do with this one in question - in fact 4 persons in total voted fo its deletion <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltesedog_6843.html" title="User:Maltesedog">Maltesedog</a> 06:07, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Modern nobility who have no authority are not inherently notable. However, this list is broader than a single person, so I have no problems with this article, as it is quite possible for groups of people to be notable even if the individuals that compose it are not. However, Wikipedia is not a place for personal vanity, so I've moved the acknowledgement to the talk page where it belongs if any place. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 13:58, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b> An encyclopedia is a reference work, and I am glad to have such lists (also of the Grand Masters of the Templars, Hospitalers, and Teutonic Knights, for example) available to check against. Besides, consider what masses of information we have on the <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobite_peerage.html" title="Jacobite peerage">Jacobite peerage</a>, all of which is legally nonexistent.
