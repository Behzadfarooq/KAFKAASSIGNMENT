<dd>If an admin opens a new AfD, while specifically noting that "<i>Debate is currently going on in three separate places, so hopefully we can collect it all here,</i>" I'm going to go with the admin. His action has rendered the DRV moot. As for pulling AfD tags off articles, you can get blocked for that sort of thing. There's even templates about it (e.g. {{<a href="../../../d/r/m/Template%7EDrmafd4_6365.html" title="Template:Drmafd4">drmafd4</a>}}). --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 23:41, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I used that tag because (a) as a courtesy to the admins because it provides them with quick links to relevant pages (while <b>not</b> actually labeling anyone as a "vandal" in the text of the page) and (b) because removal of AfD tags is considered vandalism by Wikipedia policy (see "avoidant vandalism" on <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>; age of account and number of edits has nothing to do with it. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 00:35, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Glad you noticed: that's the work that should have been done to begin with. I now know more about both candidates than I ever wanted to know about either of them. Sometimes it's just easier to do it yourself, I guess. Nonetheless, process should have been followed by those who wanted the article: why did *I* have to be the one to write, reference and clean up all those articles? As for process, I wonder if the article will really be deleted is she loses? These guidelines need to be examined: Farrell now has an article, while two other candidates in the same election who haven't achieved notability don't, and one was AfD'd. There is still nothing notable in Farrell's own article, which can't be covered in the election article, so I don't really understand why we bother with process, guidelines, AfDs, and so on.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think people are missing the point. She gets lots of local coverage, apparently, which is often sufficient for inclusion. But the fact she's repeatedly been on the front of the NY Times, one of the 1) most highly circulated newspapers on Earth; 2) distributed globally, and at the least available in virtually every corner of english speaking North America; 3) merits her article to stay. Lets not also forget that the NY metro region is one of the most populated areas of the entire country/world. Being notable in the New York area means you're due for a Wikipedia entry, simple due to volume of population: simple fact. Or, as they say, if you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere... · <font color="#0518A7"><b>XP</b></font> · 23:56, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>On the contrary, the amount of coverage typically garnered by a competitive house candidate is significant, as in this case.

Very few such candidates will fail <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, since they are "major local political figures who receive (or received) significant press coverage."

Farrell's article was deleted via community consensus on AfD regarding notability, and recreated outside of a DRV or establishment of notability, and outside of the guidelines in place at the time.
