<dd>The point is not in claiming the school doesn't exist, the problem is that in order to avoid spam-links on biographies creating external links to the EGS, some anons have created this EGS page in order to link it internally to all biographies: the end result is SPAMMING!!! If I asked for deletion although this has already been asked before, it is because it is getting tiring to see on the first line of all biographies of famous "hype" philosophers &amp; artists "This guy teachs at the European Graduate School". Who cares? <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:No Advertising</a>. This is the problem, not the question whether this school exists, whether it's good or not, whether it's a public or a private school, in Switzerland, in Italy or in Turkey. Some solution needs to be found for this spamming; if this page is not deleted, maybe by banning the users who keep on spamming. BTW, <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEuropeangraduateschool_9e7f.html" title="User:Europeangraduateschool">User:Europeangraduateschool</a> has created itself a page a few days ago, as a new spam attempt? Is Wikipedia going to be used as a platform for unscrupulous and cynical schools? (this is what this spamming gives as opinion on that school, whatever the reality is). <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanta_Sangre_6a34.html" title="User:Santa Sangre">Santa Sangre</a> 22:09, 11 June 2006 (UTC) Beside it is totally dishonest making this list of alleged teachers without giving precisions: these people might have been for two hours on the campus and they are listed as if they teach there. Note that attempts to correct this have been reverted by anons. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanta_Sangre_6a34.html" title="User:Santa Sangre">Santa Sangre</a> 22:12, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> We are posting this message to establish open dialogue with Wikipedia and render a permanent resolution regarding Wikipedian assaults upon European Graduate School and the legitimacy of its Wikipedia entry. As European Graduate School is essentially committed to openness, we find great harmony with the central aims of Wikipedia. It is from such perspective that EGS is concerned with the abuse of openness that certain users of Wikipedia display in continuing to attack our institution and its Wikipedia entry. We are concerned not only for our ourselves, but the implications of such abuse upon the internet at large, and Wikipedia in particular. Specifically, such abuse within one of the leading internet sites, especially one promoting open and egalitarian philosophy, can easily (and unfortunately) indicate the necessary implementations of restraints on freedom of communication to ensure the continued availability of high quality reputable knowledge against the growing maelstrom of misinformation (thereby fundamentally and permanently altering the egalitarian nature of cyberspace).</li>
</ul>
<p>European Graduate School believes those committed to the founding values of the internet should take this threat to such openness seriously.</p>
<p>To these ends we would like to establish the following points:</p>
<p>1. European Graduate School has already won the debate regarding the legitimacy of its Wikipedia article during the initial assertion towards deletion of the Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>2. The accusation of abuse regarding the listing of European Graduate School faculty is unfounded. Santa Sangre is simply wrong that EGS appears in the first lines of our faculty biographies in Wikipedia - one need only look to Sangre’s own list to verify this for oneself .. while their faculty status with European Graduate School is mentioned in their Wikipedia biographies the primary teaching institutions of Jean-Luc Nancy, Claire Denis, Giorgio Agamben and others is clearly listed first. The Wikipedia European Graduate School entry simply provides a list of its notable faculty as do the entries of such larger institutions as New York University .. NYU Notable Persons: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_York_University_People" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_York_University_People" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_York_University_People</a></p>
<p>3. The accusation that European Graduate School information is independently unverified is unfounded: a simple Google search can establish this fact. In addition to the external links provided by the previous entries (including mention in Wired magazine blog and DJ Spooky’s website), there are many other examples of independent reference to European Graduate School.

<p>(Note: We thought it appropriate to include below a recent photograph of Jean Luc Nancy with his 2006 student cohort at the Saas-Fee campus of European Graduate School. As one can see in the photograph, ensuring the quality of Wikipedia articles is important to Jean-Luc as well as EGS, and stimulated some vigourous intellectual exchanges during this summer residency. EGS students are excited to continue these discussions within Wikipedia - in fact two students have already expressed their personal opinions in the previous discussions.)</p>

<p>4. In keeping with its committed open philosophy, European Graduate School invites meaningful dialogue with Wikipedia to resolve issues with the EGS Wikipedia entry. The university is currently considering the release through Wikipedia, under Creative Commons license, holdings from its extensive image and video archives - a catalogue including photographs, exclusive European Graduate School lectures and seminars by notable EGS faculty.

<dd>"while their faculty status with European Graduate School is mentioned in their Wikipedia biographies the primary teaching institutions of Jean-Luc Nancy, Claire Denis, Giorgio Agamben and others is clearly listed first.": the point is if it is relevant AT ALL to include the EGS on these people's page.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'm not convinced that this school actually exists. I couldn't find anything verifiable about it, and one thing that struck me as odd was that when I was searching for stuff about it, I could find anyone who said that they hated this school, that it sucked, that they couldn't stand it, etc. Real schools usally evoke such feelings - both from the rivalry/competition of other schools and the stress and distress that they can put on their students and faculty. So if this school is real then it must be the most well-liked school (by its students and faculty and other schools) of any school in the whole history of the world! And if this were the case then it would have recieved a lot of media attention and it wouldn't be so hard for us to ample verifiable evidence of its existance. <a href="../../../e/n/p/User%7EENpeeOHvee_d3f3.html" title="User:ENpeeOHvee">ENpeeOHvee</a> 04:27, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I ran a multi-decade <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> newspaper and magazine database search (which covers English, German and French language publications) - while there are perhaps <s>40-50ish</s> 20-30 articles which mention the EGS in some way (usually as a brief reference in describing a person's background) there are veeeeeery few articles which actually <i>describe</i> the EGS (Perhaps this more traditional media outreach channel is something the EGS press office should focus its efforts on rather than the new-fangled wikipedia avenue?). The best English one I could find was a brief <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Times_ea99.html" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a> profile which is, as the article itself admits, almost entirely blurby quotes (e.g. by faculty inc. <a href="../../../d/j/_/DJ_Spooky_a3de.html" title="DJ Spooky">DJ Spooky</a>) taken directly from the the EGS website.

<dd>I think some people affiliated with the school have been a little too devoted to self-aggrandizement, sure. But look at the links the EGS account gives for external faculty/personal pages of Ronell, Zizek, Greenaway and DJ Spooky. Those links by themselves are more than enough to verify that highly notable people are (loosely) affiliated with the school. None of those are hosted by EGS. I wince a bit at the jargony stuff about "openness", "collaboration", "the net" and all that. I wouldn't necessarily argue against the propositions that the school is "self-important" or "goofy", but it's pretty obviously not a hoax. The defunct journal <a href="http://www.jstor.org/journals/01622870.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jstor.org/journals/01622870.html" rel="nofollow">October</a> had some of that quality, but also published some really good work (by some overlapping names). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 22:56, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Ronell, Zizek, and Greenaway pages are simply entries that link to the EGS website for whatever reason, but have no content on EGS itself.

<dd>If it's a hoax, it's a hoax that Ronell, Zizek and Greenaway are participating in; that would actually be more notable than is a small school of recent incorporation... but that would be a different type of article. In any case, it's not a hoax. Google shows 122k hits, for gosh sake. EGS itself comes up first, and WP is second; but not scrolling very far we get neutral mentions like: <a href="http://schools.gradschools.com/graduate-schools/European-Grad-School.html" class="external free" title="http://schools.gradschools.com/graduate-schools/European-Grad-School.html" rel="nofollow">http://schools.gradschools.com/graduate-schools/European-Grad-School.html</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/Top/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities/Europe/Switzerland/European_Graduate_School/" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/Top/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities/Europe/Switzerland/European_Graduate_School/" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/Top/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities/Europe/Switzerland/European_Graduate_School/</a>, <a href="http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/European+Graduate+School" class="external free" title="http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/European+Graduate+School" rel="nofollow">http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/European+Graduate+School</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> <b>I formally disclaim</b> that "all my edits" are about EGS. You may have a quick look at my contributions to verify this. I apologize for what may have been perceived as "uncivilized manners" that don't respect Wikipedia rules, I am not familiar with all of them and I have very strong suspicions against this school, which are founded on the spam I've observed on Wikipedia biographies (as I've said over &amp; over; I repeat that when I first heard of the EGS on Wikipedia, I had the same attitude as "Lulu" who thought it strange that I consider the internal link to be "spam" - someone had deleted it for that reason -. A few weeks later I understood the user's annoyal and the reason for its removal, and I see that Internet research does not provide any external sources on the notability of this school. If we were to include all private schools no matter how notable they are and how limited the sources on them are, we would be effectively transforming Wikipedia into a "Trojan horse" for advertising. Furthermore, I am surely not the only one to find it profoundly dishonest to put such an awesome lists of "teachers" without providing proof that they were there &amp; precisions on their presence (if they were there one hour once, two hours twice, all year long, etc.) Finally, the anonymity of the users who've edited this page &amp; who've repeatedly profited from the fact that it was a low-traffic page (surely something they hope to get higher, basing themselves on internal spam — and maybe external advertising for Wikipedia, so the Google hit rise? We are starting to get familiar with techniques to boost one's site's popularity, and Wikipedia certainly is a powerful platform for this) by deleting NPOV modifications made by astoundished users as me does not encline one to put anymore trust. It is also symptomatic that with this second deletion <i>someone</i> has considered it necessary to create a EGS page. To end with what I began in this disclaimer, I firmly ask to Lulu to stop his ad-hominen attacks against me (falsely saying that main of my edits are related to the EGS) and his intimidation on my talk page. This does not encline me to believe in Lulu's neutrality, although I certainly do believe on his good faith (which seems not to be his case if one is to believe his own user page&#160;; I'm not sure if Lulu has understood that presupposition of good faith is like "presupposition of innocence": the matter is not what you believe about another user ("when it is evidently self-absent" - how do you judge that mate?) but the fact that, <i>whatever you believe</i>, you should maintain <i>as an a priori rule</i> that this user is doing things with good faith; i.e. he is presumed innocent until judged guilty.) Therefore, I would be thankful for Lulu to not condemn me before having suited me, if such is his intent (see the threats on my talk page).

<dd>I can't really make sense of your claim, Trialsanderrors, that the article topic "fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>]". If you don't think it's a hoax, presumably you think it's a school. There's a stub right there, no? An AfD isn't a vote on the specific content that's in an article currently, but on whether the topic itself is notable. If some particular fact purported in the article seems unverifiable, remove that fact, not the topic itself. Still, even if some information is sourced to EGS official sources, that isn't necessarily unacceptable. I haven't looked, but I'm pretty sure a lot of the information on <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a> comes from the uni's own materials. Or to pick something more modest, the article on <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holyoke_Community_College_81df.html" title="Holyoke Community College">Holyoke Community College</a> (a school near me, with which I've never had any affilation beyond driving past) is pretty obviously taken almost entirely from the college's own website. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 02:21, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's a bit of a common fallacy around here to point at other questionable articles in order to lend credence to the one at hand. If the HCC article is swiped from the school website, the entry schould at least be tagged with a POV tag. Also, technically it doesn't matter who edits the article, we also can't write an article based on our own impressions, DJ Spooky's weblog or a Flickr page. My point is quite simply: If you followed WP policies on using only reliable sources (no school website, no blog entries, no future publications), what would you be able to put in the article? AfD's are there to allow editors to establish that WP guidelines are fulfilled. So far the only ones I've seen try to do this are Bwithh, ENpeeOHvee and me. And we pretty much came up empty. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 16:51, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The European Graduate School sincerely thanks those participating in this discussion. As previously expressed we are always open for meaningful/ constructive critique, and are committed to transparency of information regarding our institution and its Wikipedia entry. This forum is designed to openly engage the Wikipedia community in questions about European Graduate School, including its participation in open access to knowledge initiatives, media programmes, and its educational pedagogy. We refer Wikipedians to general search engines and the official EGS website for answers to rudimentary questions (including accreditation, courses and degree plans); video lectures, webcasts, as well as independent newspaper articles and blog entries (particularly those of Bruce Sterling and DJ Spooky); and invite the public to contact year-long faculty members directly for answers to questions of a more specific nature. European Graduate School believes that free and open discussion about itself and its impact upon postmodern media landscapes will not only strengthen our reputation but develop new democratic standards of excellence in the field of communications at large.</li>

<p>The European Graduate School Wikipedia entry is recently subject to various sorts of abuse, which generally (and unfoundedly) question the authenticity and quality standards of the institution. The EGS administration feels these issues were repeatedly resolved according to Wikipedia’s policies. While we admit that the EGS entry is far from perfect, its is our institutional policy not to edit the Wikipedia entries of our institution and its faculty. Of course members of the European Graduate School community are free (as any Wikipedian) to independently edit any Wikipedia articles, and the reasonable person can easily understand the impossibility of strictly regulating the private behaviour of 600+ adult students from around the world.</p>
<p>As an established yet still growing university, European Graduate School welcomes all thoughtful contributions towards the improved quality of its educational programmes and interfaces with the academe. We value the recent Wikipedia discussion about our educational model as an engaging example of the practical issues involved with developing and preserving a philosophy of openness in cyberspace. Again, sincere thanks to all the participants in that conversation.<a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEuropeangraduateschool_9e7f.html" title="User:Europeangraduateschool">Europeangraduateschool</a> 12:25, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is <b>not a "forum"</b> to "engage the Wikipedia community in questions about EGS". If you would stop using your official business <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspeak.html" title="Newspeak">newspeak</a> (which quite clearly identifies yourself as a marketing or public communication type of person) and stop saying "white" when you hear "black", you would acknowledge the fact that we are discussing:
<ul>
<li>if your institution is notable enough to be included here</li>
<li>if we have independent sources (doesn't seems so, but you seem to be keen on making photos as quick as you can, such as this photo of Dj Spooky where you ask him to engage in the Wikipedia debate - that's fair game...), which doesn't seems the case. I won't give you any advice on public relations, but if you muse on that you might need some, I'll be pleased to be your guest... Not that I'm a "fashion maker", but it seems that you do have some troubles which might benefit from amateur, external views&#160;:)</li>
<li>if what you're doing is not actually spam &amp; auto-promotion, both on Wikipedia &amp; through Wikipedia (spamming Wikipedia with EGS links boost your Google hit, you do know that, don't you?)</li>
<li>The creation of your own user page, while perfectly acceptable on a general way, is highly suspicious due to its timing. Your disclaimer are also highly suspicious, you do know that the problem of "newspeak" is that the few sceptics out there read "black" when we see "white" (a method surely acquired from Salvador Dali's paranoiac-critic method, which you are surely familiar with, and others innovative ways of reading that some persons have developed over the age, in particular when confronted to official censorship - you surely are familiar with Leo Strauss' founding works on "suspicious reading" also)... So, when we see that you state that "its is our institutional policy not to edit the Wikipedia entries of our institution and its faculty" and then put the responsibility on your alumni, when no one has ever accused you of self-editing <i>and</i> when almost only anonymous users have contributed to the EGS page is quite suspicious, don't you think? If not, close your school &amp; read again Freud (instead of Sun Tzu and other commercial hype readings), that might be useful for your futures endeavours.</li>
<li>Last but not least, in the same sense that I've politedly requested from Lulu not to stop considering that I edit on good faiths (we are not in a Stalinian trial here, although I've speaken of "paranoiac" methods, do not read more than what I write), I would ask you not to make unfounded accusations such as "The European Graduate School Wikipedia entry is recently subject to various sorts of abuse, which generally (and unfoundedly) question the authenticity and quality standards of the institution.", which, if you stop using your newspeak &amp; really were "keen on Wikipedia", you would have simply called "vandalism". Although this nomination may failed to achieve its aim (stopping your spammming &amp; establishing your unnotability), I am quite surprised to see your reaction, which have only confirmed my fears. You are definitely using Wikipedia for commercial purposes, you're probably not the first, nor the last one, but since you seem to be one of the main source on the Internet about your school, I would require from you to precise and prove that EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE GENIUSES HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN TO YOUR SCHOOL. PS: in the era of images, it is quite doubtful to present "photos" as "proof". We would expect more from a school which keeps inviting "critical theorists".

<dd>This is definitely getting into "paranoid conspiracy" territory by Santa Sangre. I think there's some cruft in this discussion, actually, but I've never taken a photo of EGS. I've never been to EGS or taken a course from them. In fact, I've never been in Switzerland (seems like a nice place, but I haven't been there). I've never posted any photo relating to EGS, even one taken by someone else; nor have I ever edited the EGS WP article. About the closest I come to any connection is that I have met a couple of the guest faculty EGS has had (but I never talked about EGS with them; can't see why that would have come up, and probably they were guest faculty later than when I met them). And yet apparently I'm part of this same global conspiracy to advertise for this school, or hoax, or plot, or whatever Santa Sangre's latest fantasy of its nature is. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 17:18, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

So, writing that the EGS is <i>the University of Valais</i> is highly misleading. It is a small private school in a remote skiing resort that calls itself a <i>universtity</i>. It may do so, but it has nothing to do with 'real' (and all public) universities of Switzerland (<a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Lausanne_9cfc.html" title="University of Lausanne">University of Lausanne</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Geneva_af8a.html" title="University of Geneva">University of Geneva</a>, <a href="../../../e/p/f/EPFL_a0c9.html" title="EPFL">EPFL</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/h/ETHZ_9c58.html" title="ETHZ">ETHZ</a>...) and nobody in Switzerland considers such schools as universities (this why canton of Valais itself writes it has got no university, which is common knowledge in Switzerland). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Mongenet_1ce6.html" title="User:Marc Mongenet">Marc Mongenet</a> 10:58, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Here is an English page from the Rectors' Conference of Swiss Universities that talks a bit about Swiss graduate instiutions which backs up Marc Mongenet's point:"<a href="http://www.crus.ch/engl/study.html#study_2" class="external text" title="http://www.crus.ch/engl/study.html#study_2" rel="nofollow">The following are considered as institutions of higher education: the Graduate Institute for International Studies (Institut universitaire de hautes études internationales IUHEI) in Geneva, the Graduate Institute for Advanced Public Administration (Institut de hautes études en administration publique IDHEAP) in Lausanne, the Graduate Institute Kurt Bösch (Institut Universitaire Kurt Bösch, IUKB) in Sion and the Graduate Institute of Development Studies (Institut universitaire d’études du développement, IUED) in Geneva. <b>In addition to the institutes of higher education mentioned above, there are a number of private colleges which offer courses based on the Anglo-Saxon system. The studies and examinations offered by these colleges are not recognized in Switzerland.</b> Some of these colleges may even offer courses which are not serious. We therefore advise anyone interested in following such a course to make careful initial investigations into the problem of recognition.".</a> This does not mean that EGS is not notable, of course - and where does anyone claim the EGS is the University of Valais? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 12:19, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not an expert but I remember LBS sneaked in before they closed the registration to non-US schools.

<li><i>Domain record activated: 26-Sep-1997</i></li>
<li><i>According to the Cooperative Agreement between EDUCAUSE and the U.S. Department of Commerce, all .edu names in existence as of October 29, 2001, are "grandfathered."

<li><b>KEEP</b> I'm about to enter my third year with EGS and while they may have a tendency for self-promotion, it's a very new school that first has to gain credibility through its faculty until it has enough graduates out there to speak on its behalf. When we all showed up at this dreamy alpine village, we still thought it was a hoax, but it wasn't. It's a truly challenging and nonconventional environment. It's not perfect, but it certainly does exist.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> (Disclaimer: I am a philosophy student and I did talk to a few EGS students. I have also registered at Wikipedia to read and discuss this article. My final decision and disclaimer: I am planning to study there.) The school is very real - several editors have pointed that out already. (I could confirm that with a simple phone call to the accrediting organization - the Swiss canton Valais.) Another phone call to the tourism information in Saas-Fee (<a href="http://www.saas-fee.ch/de/contact.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.saas-fee.ch/de/contact.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.saas-fee.ch/de/contact.cfm</a>) has confirmed the "real" existence.

<p>As long as they all teach there; as long as the pictures the school has added on its pages are real I am fine. Here in Germany I would never have a chance to meet and study with these people (not sure about the US) - but the Swiss school suits me fine. There are even videoclips listed at the faculty pages of European Graduate School (<a href="http://www.egs.edu/main/videolectures.html" class="external free" title="http://www.egs.edu/main/videolectures.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.egs.edu/main/videolectures.html</a>) and the photos listed at the individual resource pages are quite amusing ... but they are certainly fake&#160;:) They must be ... (The video clips are either really good animations or Giorgio Agamben, Claire Denis, Chris Fynsk, Peter Greenaway, Agnes Varda, Alain Badiou, Chantal Akerman, Jean Baudrillard, Yve Alain Bois, Victor Burgin, Shelley jackson, Claude Lanzmann, Victor Vitanza, Michael Schmidt, Sandy Stone, Martin Hielscher, and DJ Spooky really teach there.) Another professor or guest speaker has discussed EGS and its faculty on his personal blog (Caveh Zahedi <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004354/" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004354/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004354/</a> , Blog&gt;<a href="http://www.cavehzahedi.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.cavehzahedi.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cavehzahedi.com/</a> - <a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/caveh/" class="external free" title="http://blogs.indiewire.com/caveh/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.indiewire.com/caveh/</a> ) - he personally met some other filmmakers including the Quay Brothers ( <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093025/" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093025/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093025/</a> ), Claire Denis ( <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0219136/" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0219136/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0219136/</a> ), DJ Spooky and Jean Luc Nancy. Either EGS can really mind control all these thinkers and artists and influence their blogs, websites and relationships - or ... The student blogs and statements are of the usual type, some are good others are less enlightening ... Im not worried about that - actually i would be more worried if such entries wouldnt be there&#160;:) (Please check: Elizabeth Albrycht <a href="http://ringblog.typepad.com/corporatepr/" class="external free" title="http://ringblog.typepad.com/corporatepr/" rel="nofollow">http://ringblog.typepad.com/corporatepr/</a> , Paul Tulipana <a href="http://www.paultulipana.net/egs/" class="external free" title="http://www.paultulipana.net/egs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.paultulipana.net/egs/</a> , Alexander Klemm <a href="http://www.alexanderklemm.ch/?European_Graduate_School:Ph.D._Program" class="external free" title="http://www.alexanderklemm.ch/?European_Graduate_School:Ph.D._Program" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexanderklemm.ch/?European_Graduate_School:Ph.D._Program</a> , and editor lotu 5 <a href="http://deletetheborder.org/node/591/" class="external free" title="http://deletetheborder.org/node/591/" rel="nofollow">http://deletetheborder.org/node/591/</a> ). Now add the few newspaper articles and the AfD smells bad faith and has been started by one very "determined" editor with a certain agenda - the educational model of EGS and the faculty it offers can certainly pose a challenge for other minds and institutions. So far most comments are pro keep - Im looking forward to similar discussions in Switzerland next year. Thank you for this discussion.Philophil</p>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. Whether some info is useful or not is besides the point (in fact, some categories of useful information automatically get excluded from Wikipedia such as How-To's, Quotations, Recipes, etc.). This is just listcruft. Doesn't belong in what is an attempt at an <b>encyclopedia</b>. Arguments that "harmless" articles should be kept even if they don't really belong in an encylopedia overlook the accumulative harm this does to Wikipedia's claim to being an authoritative encylcopedia. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 20:50, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a contested PROD. I tagged it for PROD because it's a webcomic that doesn't assert notability. Basically, the article doesn't tell us why we should care or why Wikipedia should have an article on it when it's already on the web. Erik the Rude 01:30, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I understand the early votes to delete the initial stub-like entry that I posted, and I've worked to correct those issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since then, it looks like the votes have been more divided, but, since I'm not entirely sure how the final decision is made, I wanted to respond to some of the issues. Please forgive any wiki-ignorance ("wikignorance"?) I may be displaying: With all due respect to the person who took the time to write a five-letter argument for deletion without even specifying the relevant points, none of the reasons on that page seem to be non-subjective reasons for deletion. 1) Wikipedia is not a dumping ground for random information -- Basically, as I understand it, this is the notability argument, which has been referenced before. First, Wikipedia does include entries about webcomics, which means that at this point any decision about the notability of any given webcomic is purely subjective. There does not appear to be any hard and fast rule as to what makes one webcomic notable and another not. Second, I believe that the inclusion of the information about the strip's "Hippie and the Black Guy" origins do add notability to the article. While the initial relevance cited in the entry regarding its controversial nature at UM may have been largely local in nature, Wikipedia includes numerous entries that are largely local in their relevance, and it also informs the current webcomic, which, by nature of being a webcomic, is not geographically limited. Further, regarding the reference to the Google count, "Hippie and the Black Guy" had much larger presence on the web at the time, including being named in top humor site on the web lists and being reviewed by Excite.com Reviews, but, as is to be expected, many of these lists and materials created a decade ago are not online. (Which I felt meant they should not be included in the entry, but does not mean that they should not be taken into consideration in regards to notability.) Arguably, the strip might have been a better candidate for an entry at that time, but obviously the fact that it predates Wikipedia by six years would preclude that. In fact, the fact that the webcomic has been online continuously for 11 years is arguably somewhat notable (though I'm saying that it just one factor in its notability -- I'm not arguing that in itself is enough).</p>
<p>2) Wikipedia is not for uncited material -- Granted, the entry does not include a references section; but many, many Wikipedia entries do not. In addition to the obvious citation to the Hatbag homepage, the article also refers to the three collections, which informed the entry; The Daily Mississippian, which published materials about the comic; and Web sites which reviewed the strip.</p>
<p>3) Wikipedia is not a place to publish your point of view -- The entry cites both positive and critical views of the webcomic.</p>
<p>4) Wikipedia is not a place to publish your new ideas -- If this "rule" is meant to be relevant to the Hatbag entry, the only connection I can see is regards to citation, which I addressed under point two.</p>
<p>5) Wikipedia is not censored -- This is why it would have been nice if the five-letter voter had explained his reasoning. I don't see any way in which this "rule" applies in this case; so am assuming it does not.</p>
<p>6) Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy -- Ditto.</p>
<p>7) Wikipedia is not a democracy -- Ditto, other than that I hopes that means that when the time comes for a decision on the article, those who make the decision will consider these factors and judge objectively.</p>
<p>8) Wikipedia is not a blog service -- Ditto five and six.</p>
<p>9) Wikipedia is not a message board -- Again, ditto.</p>
<p>10) Wikipedia is not a free advertising space -- I was about to say ditto, but would note that this entry is not simply a brief note about Hatbag, with the additions made in response to early "delete" votes, it is now the single most definitive resource on the strip, as befits Wikipedia. It combines information from a variety of sources into an article more informative than anything anywhere else.</p>
<p>I hope this addresses the issues that have been raised about this entry. Thank you for your consideration. Pumpkinshirt 19:19, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, there <b>are</b> hard and fast rules for what makes a webcomic notable. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is where you can review the criteria. It should also be noted that creating articles about yourself and/or your own exploits is strongly discouraged as per the <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> guideline. <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubSeven_abca.html" title="User:SubSeven">SubSeven</a> 20:01, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thank you for pointing that out. While those rules do not necessarily seem to be universally applied, by those rules, then, yes, as noted above, the entry does meet the qualifications for notability on the basis of newspaper coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the entry covers not only the web comic, but also its print predecessor, which would not fall under the WP:WEB guidelines.</p>
<p>And, yes, I was unaware of WP:AUTO when I started the entry, and did not realize I was committing a faux pas. That misstep taken, however, the policy does not appear, in and of itself, to be grounds for deletion, it just frequently leads to violation of other rules which are. Thus far, there seem to have been no allegations of violations of those rules, but, if any problems are cited, I will be glad to correct them. Thanks for the feedback.Pumpkinshirt 20:21, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I apologise for not taking time in explaining my vote. I don't use the WP:ENC argument normally, but I like the page and it's straight forward. But my general point is, Wikipedia is an Encyclopedia, I don't think an encyclopedia should include an entry on Hatbag. Every webcomic has origins, it doesn't make it a notable entity. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 20:26, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - That just seems very subjective. Wikipedia already includes entries on comic strips, so one can't make the argument that comics strips don't belong in Wikipedia. Certainly, Hatbag probably won't make it into Britanicca or World Book anytime soon, but if Wikipedia limited itself to things that would, it would be, well, Britanicca or World Book. As it is, there are many things on Wikipedia that are probably not in many other encyclopedias -- I doubt, for example, that Britanicca has an entry on <a href="../../../l/e/g/Lara_Croft_Tomb_Raider%7E_Legend_fada.html" title="Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend">Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend</a>, which you do seem to believe belongs in an encyclopedia, or that World Book has much to say about <a href="../../../s/i/n/SiN_Episodes_4a17.html" title="SiN Episodes">SiN Episodes</a>. 68.62.201.74 21:30, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - It is not subjective. The <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">notability guidelines for web content</a> have been linked here repeatedly. <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubSeven_abca.html" title="User:SubSeven">SubSeven</a> 00:38, 17 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - Indeed. And had I been talking about the notability policies, that would be a relevant point. Perhaps I could have been more clear -- I was responding to the statement "Wikipedia is an Encyclopedia, I don't think an encyclopedia should include an entry on ..." and, regardless of what replaces the ellipsis, that is a subjective statement. It is also one that is obviously belied by any number of Wikipedia entries that would not appear in any traditional general-interest encyclopedia. 68.62.201.74 01:02, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

"progressive rock and progressive metal e-zine" gets only 11 total Google hits; "babyblaue" gets 207,000, which is a huge number, except that only <i>THIRTY</i> of these are unique hits. Combined with the fact that neither of these sites have WP articles (babyblaue doesn't have a page on the German WP, either), I'm convinced that these web sites/magazines are completely trivial. There are no other claims of notability for the band (aside from saying how amazing and original they are). For full disclosure, "Solstice Coil" does get 18,100 total and 263 unique Google hits, but I doubt there's even room for expansion in this article to make it pass <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 02:21, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

This is primarily due to the fact that things labeled as fancruft are often poorly written, unreferenced, unwikified, and non-neutral - all things that lead to deletion. Such articles may also fall foul of Wikipedia's policy against creating "indiscriminate collections of information". Well-referenced and well-written articles on obscure topics are from time to time deleted as well, but such deletions are controversial. It is also worth noting that many articles on relatively obscure topics are featured articles."</i> Think about what that says.

<dd>Dear Agent. My statement was in no way intended to be passive-aggressive or incivil--only concise. If you wish to stand by your accusation I should kindly like to know why. Also, please <a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EAssume_good_faith_cd17.html" title="WP:Assume good faith">Assume Good Faith</a> when monitoring the tone of other editors. Thanks. But, back to the argument itself: Admittedly, <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">Wikipedia:Fancruft</a> is not an official policy. But, there is also no official policy against it. The essay, which is on official Wikipedia namespace, suggests that most deleted "fancruft" articles are poorly written. This one is certainly not.

It's not. I feel like your opposition here is more against the medium (i.e. watching television) as somehow less reliable than others.

<li><b>Comment</b>, For example: my new article is: there are four thousand books in my local library... I've counted them. This is a verifiable fact... all you have to do is go there and count them yourself. Naturally, this would be thrown out as OR. If the subject of this article is *notable*, then a reliable source has presumably already done the cataloguing and you are just citing the result. As far as I'm aware, this is not the case. As for the "precedent" set by the articles you listed... they have not set any precedent. This argument is trotted out whenever anyone AFDs an article with fans: that there are other articles like it (or worse). This is an unjustifiable argument given the way that Wikipedia works. We can only examine each article on its own merits. You are essentially claiming that "we" must AFD and delete other articles first. The fact remains that the subject of this article has no notablity in the wider world to justify it's own article. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 14:48, 12 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> A very poor analogy. Counting books is an act of research, and by coming up with 4,000, you are introducing information that was not previously available. What I did was "collect and organize" information that is broadcast and re-broadcast nationally in the U.S., meaning that the information was <b>definitely</b> already available. The fact that I took specific instances of the provided information is simply a part of the "collecting and organizing." Further, "you have to go down there and count them yourself" means that it's not verifiable because it takes an act of research to verify it. With the citations I provided, it does not take an act of research (e.g. counting), merely re-examing the primary source -- the same way you can verify that a college has 4,100 undergraduates by looking it up in a book and saying "Aha, there it is, he's right," you just need to "look up" in the episode that Elaine couldn't get tickets to <i>Means to an End</i>.<br />
<br />
I suppose in the end this comes down to a judgment call of whether this is a "list or repository of loosely associated topics." I submit that it is not, and it seems that you and I have nowhere else to go in our disagreement on this matter. I have clearly demonstrated that this is not original research -- you can ignore the policy statements at <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> if you want, but the quotation I provided above states in no uncertain terms that what I did is prototypical source-based research and is certainly welcome in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 15:16, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, there's nothing "poor" about it. It is exactly the same. You are generating new information (read the OR guidelines) on a non-notable subject. A trivial "list of" references with a theme. I repeat: this article is original research... just because you collected each individual reference from a verifiable source (DVDs presumably) does not change that. The process of compiling an aticle on this subject is OR. You need to find a reliable source that has already done this cataloguing. Even if you do that, you've still got the problem that it is not suitable for its own Wikipedia article (under WP:NOT), and that it has no notability outside of Seinfeld. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 15:38, 12 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It's a bad analogy because it's totally unrelated. Identify for me the elements in this article that do not appear in the episodes of <i>Seinfeld</i>; if there are none, then it is impossible that I am "generating new information." This article does not make any new argument about the list of fictitious films as a whole, it merely catalogues them. I fail to see anywhere in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> that lists need to have already been categorized as such by an outside source.<br />

<li><b>Comment</b>, you created an article on a subject (fictional refs etc etc in Seinfeld) the specifics of which do not exist elsewhere as a reliable source. You then you went out and did research by checking every Seinfeld episode and documenting the occurances. It is 100% original research. If it is not original research, then whose research are you quoting here? The answer is: you did it yourself. We can dance around this subject all day... but the simple fact is, that this article is original research and should be deleted on that basis alone - and even if you were successful in confusing the issue enough to avoid deletion on the basis of OR, it violates WP:NOT. As I said right at the beginning of this... if you want to conduct such research, fine, no-one is stopping you. Just don't do it on Wikipedia because it violates one of the basic rules of the place. It's no good trying to reinterpret the rules and rules-lawyer in order to get around it. Just move it to a more suitable place, where the rules for inclusion are not those of an encyclopedia. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 19:45, 12 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> WP:NOR clearly states that "film, video or photographs" are examples of primary sources. The guideline goes on to say, as <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> pointed out, that "research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged." So it's "research," yes, but not <i>original</i> research. Instead, it is research of a type that the guideline specifically <i>encourages</i> editors to engage in. --DavidK93 21:03, 12 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, You haven't read my argument. The OR guidelines are talking about the encyclopedic cataloguing of notable subjects that already exist. The subject of this article did not -- at least, not in any reliably sourced form. "List of fictional/theatres etc etc" was created for this article. If you want to write an article on the television show <i>Seinfeld</i> (there is one, but play along), then you go out and collect all the reliably sourced information about the show and then write an article that is made up of <i>other people's</i> research, and cite them as sources in the article. Do not invent the subject of an article, and then do original research to fill it. If this article is not OR, then whose research is it citing? - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 21:13, 12 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> You continue to ask "whose research is it citing," which presumes right away that we have to cite <i>a secondary source</i>, which I am obviously not using. I am using a primary source. It really seems to me that you're the one confusing this issue: instead of pointing out exactly what passages of WP:NOR I'm violating here, you just keep repeating "this is original research" and not going any farther. Until you can say "WP:NOR says not to do <b>this</b>, and you did <b>that</b>," then you can't seriously expect me to just believe that I did original research.<br />
<br />
I see your argument in the sense that I had to be the one to think of creating an article called <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_films_in_Seinfeld_e83d.html" title="Fictional films in Seinfeld">Fictional films in Seinfeld</a>, but that's simply the nature of a list (the article should be moved to "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_films_in_Seinfeld_045a.html" title="List of fictional films in Seinfeld">List of fictional films in Seinfeld</a>"). Look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_based_on_the_Bible_30e8.html" title="List of films based on the Bible">List of films based on the Bible</a> or countless others in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_films_48f7.html" title="Category:Lists of films">Category:Lists of films</a>. I'm not linking these to try an argument from precedent as I did earlier, only to show you that you're obviously the only one who has this unique interpretation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. No else thinks it's original research to list a bunch of films about the Bible; if they all independently profess to be about the Bible, then we put them together in a list. You still have not fulfilled my request to point out which particular passage of WP:NOR states that we can't make lists of this type -- probably because <b>it isn't considered original research</b>. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 21:42, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, <i>that is the nature of a list</i> -- no it is not. A list of films directed by Steven Speilberg is not original research since I can quote half a dozen books where I can obtain that list when OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE THE RESEARCH, and then I used their research to make an article citing them as a source. Whether that list suitable for Wikipedia is a further argument... but it is not original research. This article, on the other hand, is very definitely orginal research... because you created the subject and did the research yourself to fill it. I have repeatedly explained this, and you repeatedly miss the point. You give an example of a list of films about the Bible -- where did the research for that list come from? If it came from the writer of the article... then it is original research. If it came from a book... from research done by someone else... then it is not OR. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 21:57, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not going to rehash the same point any more: <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> does not prohibit what you are describing. Rather, you seem to have a novel interpretation of the original research policy that no one else seems to share (for example: of the ten "delete" votes so far, only two mention original research: yours and the one by Angus McLellan who dubbed it "per Motor." In fact, your original vote didn't even mention original research, it appeared as an objection in later comments). Your interpreation would delete the great majority of material at <a href="../../../d/y/n/Category%7EDynamic_lists_c72d.html" title="Category:Dynamic lists">Category:Dynamic lists</a>, lists to which "revisions and additions are welcome," meaning that they aren't already listed at some exterior source as belonging to that list, they just need to verifiably meet the criteria. Should this type of material qualify as original research, I should think that one of the other <a href="../../../s/t/a/Special%7EStatistics_969e.html" title="Special:Statistics">1,602,256</a> editors would have pointed it out by now and deleted it straightaway.<br />
<br />
We seem to be talking past each other: I can't understand why you don't see it my way, and I'm guessing that you feel likewise.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I will thanks... since you have yet again failed to address the problem. My interpretation is not <i>novel</i>. You have invented your own (seemingly spurious) subject and then done your own research by watching the episodes. That is original research and goes against Wikipedia policy. Plain and simple. How about this: List of episodes in which George sneezes? Go ahead... I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to justify that one too. The rest of your post is yet more "if X hasn't been deleted, why should this be?". If it makes you feel better... I don't actually expect this article to be deleted for a couple of reasons a) despite the claims made about the AFD process, it is actually a vote. AFDs are closed as "keep" all the time on the basis of a vote tally and not the discussion. b) You solicted votes (check your contributions). - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 00:42, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I disagree with your "list of films directed by Steven Speilberg" example. It's true that there are "half a dozen books where [one] can obtain that list," but any such book is a <i>secondary</i> source. If you consulted such a book, you would presumably find that they have cited the movie itself. They learned that a given film was directed by Steven Spielberg because they saw it in the credits of the film, the <i>primary</i> source. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> is correct that you seem to be demanding that all sources be secondary sources, which is not consistent with WP:NOR. --DavidK93 20:03, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, I am not demanding that all sources be secondary (but Wikipedia generally prefers them)... what I am saying is that the very subject of this article was invented by Dylan, and then researched by him. This is original research in a way that many lists are not. It is also against <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, since it is a list with a spurious theme... it is an indiscriminate collection of cruft... and should be deleted on both counts. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 22:29, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I think you are looking at the letter of the law, in this case the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and not he spirit of the law. The <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> was created so that we don't have individuals who call themselves "authorities" on a subject giving un-factual information. For instance, I start an article about Nuclear Fusion because I think it has something to do with an atom and splitting it, and I present that information as factual. That is where the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> comes into play, as that would not be appropriate. But the rule wasn't put into place to stifle research. The very idea that someone would do research is inherit in creating an article. It's the very nature of Wiki. But, as I said earlier (or later, I don't know where this falls in relation to my other comments), but Wiki is constantly evolving. And while I agree with you Motor, as this isn't what would be considered a subject that belongs in an encyclopedia, it is that fact that make it an appropriate subject for Wiki. It is one of the best things about this site, the fact that it contains so much information on such a wide verity of subjects. I appreciate how Dylan gathered this information and made a page that is easy to understand and navigate. To delete his work, because it falls within the "gray" area of what is Original Research or what is encyclopedic in nature, would only stifle the creativity that Wiki is based off. In fact, this discussion is another great thing about Wiki, the fact that so many people with so many different backgrounds and opinons have come together to create a site that one day could rival Google.<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReignofjerm_9209.html" title="User:Reignofjerm">Reignofjerm</a> 15:56, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Strong Keep</b></s> <b>Comment</b> The simple fact that this article and it's deletion sparks such discussion shows exactly how much the show has embedded itself into our lives. Their are certain pop culture facts that should be cataloged, just like the Oxford Dictionary in 2003 added hip-hop words like "bling-bling" and "jiggy" to it's list of definitions to keep up with the chaging culture in America. Seinfeld is one of the few shows (MASH, 60 Minutes) that changed the way we look at TV, and as such, rather or not you agree with it's import, should be enough to warrent keeping such an article. Also, I think that Wikipedia re-writes itself constantly, and has become an important repository for information. To delete an article that walks the fine line between Wiki's deletion policy would be a step back and not a step forward. Just as IMDB has Trivia on it's site for each movie. They realize that if you are to call yourself a true source of data on a subject, you should have all the data you possible can get on said subject.<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReignofjerm_9209.html" title="User:Reignofjerm">Reignofjerm</a> 21:23, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, with policies for that purpose.

<li><b>Comment</b>, That is very slippery argument Motor. Princeton University defines an enclyclopedia as "....a reference work (often in several volumes) containing articles on various topics (often arranged in alphabetical order) dealing with the entire range of human knowledge or with some particular specialty." Yes, "...the entire range of human knowledge". No one is suggesting turning Wiki into a "dumping ground" for usless information. But making that argument only goes to limit the boundaries of Wiki. Who is to call information useless? I stumbled upon this article and made an edit a couple of months ago because Wiki has become the very first place I go whenever I need any kind of information. Also, to call a peice of information "spurious" just because there isn't another place on the internet that you can get that information is also limiting. Why can't Wiki be the first place this information is kept on the internet. There isn't a copy of my birth certificate on the internet, does that make my birth "spurious"? No, the fact that I'm alive shows that reasoning to be specious. Thus, arguring that an article be deleted just because the transcripts aren't available online is unreasonable.<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReignofjerm_9209.html" title="User:Reignofjerm">Reignofjerm</a> 21:33, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

The page has been repeatedly used to spread lies fabricated to ruin the image and peace in the church. These lies are simply untrue and we would appreciate if this page were deleted and similar pages claiming to give information about The Winfield Reformed Church or of our pastor be deleted in the future. If you have any problems or questions, feel free to call the church and we would be happy to speak with you. Thank you. Clsechao 03:05, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. If all asserted facts are true, he would be notable. I suspect, but can't prove, a hoax. Born in 1800, he was the right age to be a powder monkey in the war of 1812. But that would make him over 60 during the Civil War, yet he is supposedly a veteran of that war also. That would be noteworthy. So why can't I find any references to him on a google search, having tried three different combinations of search terms?

<li><b>Keep</b> This is the SECOND time this article has been put it up for deletion. It survived once. It should survive again. It IS notable, notably in DISTANCING the legitimate version from the well-known hoax. It is a valid proposal that has merits against the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Tax_c6cb.html" title="Flat Tax">Flat Tax</a>, and other tax proposals. It is also a valid proposal that has merits against the Moneteray Reform Act, and other monetary reform proposals. It is based on a published book. It is cited by several sources, and not just the nesara.org page. Further, it is informative to those interested in knowing what the difference is between the hoax version and the NESARA Institute's version. There is a link on both the <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_bc4d.html" title="NESARA">NESARA</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_conspiracy_theory_ff93.html" title="NESARA conspiracy theory">NESARA conspiracy theory</a> linking both to the other so as to present the information seperately, clearly, and distinctly. I am not from NESARA, I do not work for NESARA. I just happened to find out about it while reading a news article about it, and also by reading an interview with its author, by a notable news source. I believe that to delete this article would violate the founding principles of wikipedia - namely it would mean deleting NOTABLE information from the public view. Those unfamiliar with the topic often don't take the time to look into it before forming their own opinions about it, especially since the hoax version is so noticiable, and has already "poisened the well" in its receipt by those in Congress. With the death of the author last May, it has been even harder to fight the credibility issues the hoax version has created for the NESARA Institute. This article helps then to give people an OBJECTIVE view of Dr. Barnard's legislative proposal, as compared to other reform proposals that already are notable for inclusion in wikipedia. I ask that the administrator consider the fact that a real NESARA exists as opposed to the fake hoax one - one that doesn't even look like the original but attempts to steal the name of the original. I also ask that the administrator consider the fact that the public wants objective information about the non hoax version of NESARA. This article is also not original research, any more than <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Tax_c6cb.html" title="Flat Tax">Flat Tax</a> is. It is just as notable as other tax reform proposals that have been listed on wikipedia. I agree the article needs clean up, but to delete it altogether would be unfair to the effort at seperating the two NESARAs for the public view, and the intention of the editors of both <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_bc4d.html" title="NESARA">NESARA</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_conspiracy_theory_ff93.html" title="NESARA conspiracy theory">NESARA conspiracy theory</a>. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 14:45, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am the author of this piece. I have already made a few edits to it to negate several of the comments about it. I will do more in the next several weeks to make it worthy of inclusion. The term neo-pantheism is needed to cover the versions of pantheism that are sprouting up and to differentiate them from the classical Pantheism of Spinoza. Most of these modern outlooks are atheistic and the use of the term of pantheism to describe themselves is consequently questionable as historically Pantheism has been theistic in its cosmic view. This is a point that needs more discussion. Also a bit more description of the present forms of neo-pantheism would be appropriate and would broaden its coverage. I did not coin the term but found it being used in Christian articles to describe new age viewpoints that are not theistic. This also needs to be addressed so those looking for an explanation of what neo-pantheism is can get one. I will need till the end of June to do the research needed to edit this to the standard Wikipedia deserves.I pledge am honest effort to do this. Commentors - please reevaluate July 3.</p>
<p>Reason the page should be deleted MAurelius 19:59, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Reasons for proposed deletion: This article is the hyped summary of a personal philosophy by a single individual, written by that individual. If this kind of thing is accepted, then everyone on the planet will insert their private philosophy into Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Outside of the WIKI entry, the concept is propounded on a set of webpages in related domains, all of them owned by a single individual, the person who authored the article.</p>
<p>It makes claims regarding originality that are not valid. Eg: "Consequently it [neo-pantheism) has a much broader base than most Pantheisms in that it is a composite of many prevailing philosophies both pantheistic and otherwise. As such, it is a more complex and complete philosophy.</p>
<p>It has no "notability."</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm inclined to say <s><b>keep</b> but rewrite</s>.

<li>Kudos for finding those quotes. However, adding the prefix "neo" to just about any trend in art or ideas is a very common practice and unless the addition comes to be widely known as having a defined meaning, it remains arbitrary, variable and idiosyncratic. The article as presented is not a study about the development of this term or of groups of people adhering to this term. It is the presentation of a single variant by a single individual, promoted only within the last couple of months by that same single individual, on a set of web domains owned by that same individual, and following the idiosyncratic definition of that single individual, eg to quote from it:</li>

<dd>"neo-Pantheism is currently only applicable to the version being proposed to congeal these different viewpoints in to one comprehensive paradigm. Consequently it has a much broader base than most Pantheisms in that it is a composite of many prevailing philosophies both pantheistic and otherwise.

<li>The core problem is this: there is no discernible set of beliefs known (outside of that one individual's website) as "neo-pantheism." There are two modern books in print about pantheism - Paul Harrison's Elements of Pantheism and Michael Levine's Pantheism. Neither one even mentions neo-pantheism. Therefore this topic fails the "notability" test - there simply isn't anything to include in an article about "neo-pantheism."</li>

There are lots of neo-pagan, and neo-whatever ideas that should be included, but this article as now written doesn't merit a stand-alone: insufficient notability, in sufficent external support. Pare it way down, put the surviving lines in pan-theism, and then if the author or others want to expand it in NPOV form with proper referencing, it could grow enough to merit its own article.

<li><b>Delete</b> Buffy the Vampire Slayer has had an impact on popular culture, leading to greater notability for all of the aspects of the subject, even by non-fans. I do not think this show has reached a similiar level of influence. Besides, as these article stand, there is very little context.

<li><b>Delete all</b>. Reverse crystalballism. Forget that the show that they are associated with is notable. Association with the notabile is not a basis for notability of the thing itself.

<li><b>Keep, But Merge</b> These pages should be merged into a single page, as some (particularly '10 minutes to doom' and 'the trial' (which doesn't have a page yet)) are of massive importance to the series due to tying up plot ends and giving important character development. As the audio is finished for many of these and have been released in a 'radio drama' format on DVD, they have technically still been released to the public officially and should be considered important and cannonoligical (I likely spelt that wrong) <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDevilmaycare_a5f0.html" title="User:Devilmaycare">Devilmaycare</a> 10:15, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, 'The Trial' revealed lots of important information on Zim's past, how he killed two of his former peoples leaders, and well as the events leading up to his rampage in the first episode. 'Nubs of doom' introduced a new character that was to appear in a lot of episodes (he also appeared in the last episode show, as they finished that before cancelation). The others arn't really notable, but should have a page for the little factiods such as; 'The return of keef' informs us that keef had survived in the 'bestest friend' episodes, when everyone thought he dies at the end of it and 'Day of da Spookies' shows a secondry character becoming a major character from that point onwards ('Invader Skoodge' moves in with Zim to help him).

The subject of this article, at the moment, has no presence outside of newgrounds and a few mentions on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">personal websites</a>. It has no notablity, and it fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. It is basically a description of some flash animations that someone saw and decided to describe in a Wikipedia article.

<p>I originally proposed this article for deletion because it did not assert the notability of the subject. The creator of the article subsequently removed the tag and added a section called "notability," which states that Vanessa Loya graduated high school at the age of 15 and is working on a double major at the University of Arizona. I congratulate Miss Loya on her accomplishments, but this is a non-notable/unencyclopedic biography, if not an autobiography. <b>Delete.</b> <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoel7687_4b33.html" title="User:Joel7687">Joel7687</a> 05:47, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is an interesting situation. We are going to delete an idea of a possible type of democracy simply because there is no standard term for it -- or so it seems. The idea is that voters in small groupings elect a delgate to represent them in some higher level assembly. For example, Native Americans elected a chief who represented them in inter-tribal assemblies. What is this type of democracy to be called? In Russia, workers in factories elected delegates who met in inter-factory councils. What are we to call this type of democracy? These seem to be two example of some type of -- what shall we call it? "representative" democracy. But it isn't the usual type of representative democracy, its a peculiar type of representative democracy that doesn't seem to have a handy name. It has been proposed to call it "delegative democracy" or "bottom-up democracy" -- but, obviously, there is resistance to using these phrases. So, what is the genus of which soviet and Native American tribal federations are species? Does this mean that if we can't come up with a name, the idea can't be expressed? And does it mean that if you can't name it, it doesn't exist? A situation out of 1984?Skovoroda 20:56, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you would take the time to read our policies as they have already been presented to you, you would know why this is happening. The short of it is this: we do not publish original research here. I've said this before: do the work, get it published in a peer-reviewed journal, and then come back here and report on it. In short, if it isn't verifiable, it doesn't belong here. If you can't get your work published and you still want to write essays on Democracy, start up a nice blog somewhere (else). <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 01:42, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, you make the incorrect assumption that we're trying to suppress information we don't want to see here. Nothing could be further from the truth (note: I am very pro-democracy and run the <a href="http://d2.stevemagruder.com" class="external text" title="http://d2.stevemagruder.com" rel="nofollow">Democracy 2.0 website</a>, so why would I want to suppress articles related to democracy?) When any added content is in dispute, the party that added said content is asked to provide proof of encyclopedic relevance. Your arguments here in text convince nobody because frankly, we aren't looking for arguments and we cannot take your word for it anyway--that's why we ask for sources that prove the existence of the concept as is described in the article in question. And this policy applies to *everyone*, so to be fair, please play by the rules like everyone else must do. Further "arguments" are a waste of textual space and will be ignored. — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><span style="color:white; background-color: green;">&#160;<b>Stevie is the man!</b>&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 04:21, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article by Guillermo O’Donnell, “Delegative Democracy,” Journal of Democracy 5 (January 1994), pp. 55–69, uses the term "delegative democracy" in a peer-reviewed journal, and there are very many references to it -- so, at least his usage should be reported on. And since there is some ambiguity in the use of the phrase, an attempt should be made at disambiguation.</dd>

He's a senior Helen Kellogg professor at Notre Dame, and the paper(s) he's written on this seem to have some currency with political science seminars and papers, etc. If someone knows enough about O'Donnell's notability and wants to create an entry for him, including a section on his "delegative" work, feel free, and have "delegative democracy" redirect there. Or if it has generated a wide body of other work and notability, a new article could be created under this title. But as I noted somewhere, O'Donnell has <i>nothing</i> to do with the rest of the current article, which can be deleted. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 22:12, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

To show what can happen in less than 6 months, look at these from a selective enrollment school here in Chicago: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Payton_High_School|from" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Payton_High_School|from" rel="nofollow">June 11, 2006</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Walter_Payton_College_Prep&amp;oldid=32032567|stub" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Walter_Payton_College_Prep&amp;oldid=32032567|stub" rel="nofollow">from Dec 20, 2005</a>. For many Wikipedians, a magnet school in a <i>global city</i> like Chicago (or New York, or Paris, or ...) is going to immediately seem more notable than one in Aydin, Turkey, but if we're going to have a real encyclpedia of knowlegde, we shouldn't trust our first hunches, as per <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">WikiProject Countering Systemic Bias</a>. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua">Interlingua</a> 20:08, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. Among the established users here (i.e. who have numerous other contributions apart from contributing to this debate) the consensus is quite clear.

The site in question is non-commercial, very popular, and is in opposition to the commercial Big Brother website. In fact the site is so popular, Australian Big Brother contestants are forbidden to mention it because it is significatant opposition the the offical Big Brother site. I am EXTREMELY suspicious that this is called for deletion only hours after it first appeared. I created the first draft in 15 minutes &amp; I'll be adding additional content in coming days.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> In regards to the person who said that this isn't a well known site, in fact it is, with thousands of hits a week and 11,000 registered users on the forums you can hardly say it's an unpopular site. This article has been posted to inform users of the BBBA community information on the site and there is still more information to come. By the way, why does a site like Miniclip (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniclip" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniclip" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniclip</a>) receive allowance to have an article, if this is an encyclopedia then who gives a crap about a games website. You are contradicting yourselves here Wiki Nazis, let BBBA be! And for the record, there is thousands of sites here, so how can you honestly say Wikipedia isn't a listing for website history.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It is a no profit website that is quite popular and allows groups of people to chat about BB. It has attracted controvesy and is quite informative. The request to delete this page because it is 'advertising' is a rubbish. BBBA stands to gain very little from the Wiki listing other than informing those who are interested. Should Rove McManus' page be deleted because it seeks to advertise him, his business and show? NO. Should any AFL team;s Wiki entry be deleted because it postively high lights its good work and skills because it could be seen as advertising or self promotion? NO. Should the BBBA wiki entry be deleted because it is simply providing info on a popular site? NO. Kirsty.maree 13:00, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>the business of building an encylopedia</b></p>
<p>A 'encyclopedia' is a store-house of knowledge covering all topics, just as a dictionary is. That includes individuals, organisations, objects and interests. To the communities of Australia our work is of current and historical relevance, as it is world-wide as an example of art, freedom fighting and social justice. A true 'encyclopedia' is one that is compiled objectively, outside of the ethno-centric value systems of an elite (in this case the millioneth of a % who own a computer and have access to the internet.) If you regard your monitoring and contributions here to be of significance then it will encompass that and accomodate the value of our accomplishments. Look through the links for the events and actions we have facilitated and read the responses and impetus they have generated and then ask: 'What have I created and accomplished and, bearing that in mind, what power do I have to eradicate information about others who are inspired to create history?'</p>

<p><i>History, til this point has purely been a record endorsing the self-serving interests of the rich elite. One potential benefit of the internet (when it becomes accessible to the poor) will be the opportunity to break that standard. Instead of remaining an account which justifies the excesses of a few who reserve the tools that preserve information for themselves, the stranglehold may be broken. Let's hope that accounts, such as the music of social justice, illuminate a pathway to this.</i></p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Does it really matter if Elias Tsatsomoiros is non-notable? The fact that he wrote something that provides an unorthodox interpretation of how the Greek alphabet works should nonetheless have its place in Wikipedia. If "mainstream" academia deems Tsatsomoiros' work as "non-notable", then state it in the article (or put such a statement in parentheses). Besides, you cannot say that you want to "Free the Knowledge of the World" and at the same time repress something that people should know about. Let readers decide if Tsatsomoiros is "fringy" or not. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 20:32, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Look Fan1967, this article only provides an unorthodox interpretation of the Greek alphabet. Yes, I know Tsatsomoiros is not much to look at in terms of credentials since not many people have noticed him. However, human perceptions should not get in the way when it comes to promoting knowledge. Granted there are many non-notable people who have extremely non-realistic ideas that deserve to be dismissed. However, there are also many non-notable people with interestingly rational, yet unorthodox, ideas that deserve to be noted even if mainstream academia might be hesitant to accept them. It is all about knowing how to filter things. Generalizing everyone into one big "pseudoscience" group could very well marginalize intelligent people who have something interesting to say, but just don't have a big enough "voice" to be heard by everyone else. Please do not assume that I am supporting this article just because Elias Tsatsomoiros is Greek. <b>I only support him because I respect people who provide unorthodox ideas that could have some application to our current knowledge about things.</b> Tsatsomoiros' work is not necessarily based on "DaVinci Code" material if you get my drift. Believe me, I have met my fair share of outrageously asinine Greek ideas. Based on the comparison tests I have conducted a while back, the number of really really crazy Greek ideas are not that numerous. Interesting stuff. Anyway, I still maintain my position to keep this article. I hope others understand that people (including voters here) should, by now, be able to distinguish between "insanely unorthodox" individuals and "rationally unorthodox" individuals. If people can't do that, then they can just ask me and I will tell them the story straight (for only a nominal fee of $9.95 a month; just kidding). <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 23:53, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Interesting article Fan1967. Though I have confronted slightly more insane Greek ideas. Anyway, I appreciate you finding this website for me to read (never knew it existed, plus I learned the Greek word for "fraud"). Here is an idea to help solve any potential problems with the Tsatsomoiros article. I suggest that Tsatsomoiros' ideas pertaining to the functions of the Greek alphabet be preserved and any other theories deemed "insane" either be completely dismissed or relegated to a separate section in the article. The website you provided truly presents some outlandishly "unorthodox" theories. I will not lie to you, these theories are truly interesting (who knows, maybe they are true to some extent). However, for the time being, such theories are very difficult to validate scientifically. Specifically, it is difficult to prove if a northern Greek territory was the first land to have appeared from an ocean-covered planet Earth 140 million years ago (whatever happened to Pangaea?). Without evidence, these theories are just theories. So, if you want to place these outlandishly theoretical theories in a separate section of the article, then go ahead (or if you want me to do that then tell me). If not, then ignore them. Your call. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 19:10, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem isn't that he's a crackpot; we certainly have tons of articles on crackpots. The problem is that he isn't a <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> crackpot, and if we don't set standards for crackpots, then we'll end up with an article for everyone who's published a book (or even a blog) detailing how George Bush is controlled by a microchip implanted in his head by aliens from the planet Blugztrakh. So we only document the crackpots who have actually achieved coverage and notice of their beliefs, like <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Icke_4a63.html" title="David Icke">the guy who says that Bush is actually a shape-shifting reptile</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I understand where you are coming from Fan1967. Yet, I still think that notability is just not enough to really judge an article. Let me elaborate. Let's say there is an article that has some interestingly contributive information, but it is not noteworthy. What do you do? Do you delete it? No. Do you dismiss it entirely? No. So what course of action do you take? Analyze the content. Is the content interesting enough and applicable enough to academia that it deserve a place in Wikipedia irrespective of its lack of notability? If yes, then keep the content. If no, then delete. It is just not kosher to keep a notable article that does not contribute much to people's knowledge of things and delete an article that is ignored yet contains something constructive. See where I am getting at? Yes, there is a plethora of crackpots who are non-notable and Tsatsomoiros fits the bill. Yet, it would be a shame to ignore whatever insights he may have about the Greek alphabet. Say what you will of Tsatsomoiros, but his statements pertaining to each Greek letter possessing a "code" that would later help to form a logical Greek word helped me answer a lot of questions about the Greek alphabet's functionality and even its development. For instance, when Tsatsomoiros explained the dynamics of the Greek letter "Y" and what it represents, all of the words I commonly use in Greek just began to make sense (since I would always ask myself, "why do I say this Greek word specifically to explain a certain object or person?"). That is why I want Tsatsomoiros to stay. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 22:05, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's the problem. You think that his theories actually may have value (I disagree), and therefore should be kept despite the fact that the entire academic world considers them not even worth acknowledging. We can't keep articles based on the personal value judgement of a Wikipedia editor. Notability is the only fair determining factor. Is it a widely accepted theory, or a widely discussed controversial theory, or even a widely rejected theory that generates a lot of discussion? If not, then we can't justify keeping it, when we routinely get rid of other theories of similar status. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 22:45, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I did not say that all of Tsatsomoiros' theories be kept. Interesting theories, yes. However, even I know where limits should be placed when it comes to making theories. Notability is not exactly as fair as you may think, because notability is a fickle and ever-changing concept (didn't I state this already?). What could be considered "mainstream" one day could be considered "fringy" the next. So, if an article is deemed "fringy" just because a large handful of "mainstream" academics say so, then what makes the content of the article so unworthy for people to look at? Content, content, content. The concept of compromise and content-analysis is essential in order to transcend academic politics. If the president of a prestigious group of academics deems certain content as "fringy" after the previous president deemed the same content as "mainstream", then what do you do? You have to truly and honestly think about these things. Academia is not as "objective" as one may think, which makes notions of "fairness" very relative. Such concepts have to be substituted with notions of academic honesty and academic accountability. Again, look and analyze the content. See which parts are constructive and which ones are not. Though I admire your upholding of Wikipedia policy, you need to understand that policies can change and that policies are only enduring if they are both staunch and flexible in a dualistic fashion. This is an opportunity for you and Wikipedia policy to really show flexibility being that I already made a compromise in that I would only place certain theories made by Tstasomoiros. I know how sensitive Wikipedia is to the "fringiness" of the other theories that Tsatsomoiros made. I still stand with banners high supporting this article. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 23:06, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've looked at and analyzed the content. I'm 100% in agreement with the academic consensus on it. I could be more blunt in my assessment, but I think you get the drift.

<dd>I've looked at and analyzed the content too. I'm 100% in agreement with social reality (academia is not based only on notable things). I too could be more honest in my assessment, but I think you understand where I am coming from. I certainly see something here that does make me want to uphold this article (even if that something is deemed "fringy" by academic consensus). The statements I just made were not meant to offend you. Their purpose was to prove that anyone can state what you have just stated right now. Anyone. So much for Wikipedia being an "independent source". Did you know that academic consensus considered for a time that the planet was flat and that rocks never fell from the sky? Funny, don't you think? Wikipedia should not become the next Brittanica with Western European anal-retentiveness as its top characteristic ("Free the Knowledge of the World" indeed). People need to be exposed to individuals like Elias Tsatsomoiros in order for them to understand who is who irrespective of notability. Period. The ball is in your court my friend and I have yet to be convinced that this article with some, more or less, "sane" theories be removed. You said they were "saner" in comparison to the other theories in the website you provided and I agreed with you. Compromise anyone? Or is such a concept unusually novel to Wikipedia policy? <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 00:17, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. So nobody took Yahuda's work seriously. Does that mean that he should be completely ignored? Does that mean that every Wikipedian must prevent this so-called "bastard knowledge" from touching the pure minds that peer into this encyclopedia? The answer is obviously no. Articles should not be limited only to discussing the notable, the great, the glamorous and the mighty. By doing such a thing, Wikipedia is preventing itself from becoming a distinguishable source of knowledge. Besides, knowledge is knowledge irrespective of its status as notable or non-notable. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 20:41, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. So what if Christos Sariannidis is non-notable. Notability, if anything, is an ever-changing and fluid concept. Case in point, people have been given awards post-humously meaning that they became notable after they died. Prior to becoming notable, they were either ignored or not taken very seriously by their "mainstream" contemporaries. I don't see why the article should be deleted just because Sariannidis discovered something by accident. There have been people who discovered things by accident and helped "mainstream" academia propel itself forward into new directions of research. Shouldn't these people deserve some credit even if it entails a one-sentence article? <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 20:58, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Yes, that would be fine for a newspaper or an opinions piece or an essay or a blog or a book etc., but no matter how much this superficially resembles other online electronic media, this is an encyclopedia, which by its very nature is a third or even fourth source ideally relying on and synthesizing primary or secondary sources. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 21:38, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Quite frankly, I don't care if an encyclopedia is a tenth source that relies on tertiary sources to acquire information. Many people today who own computers utilize Google to acquire information. When you do a Google search on, say, an historical figure, a Wikipedia article is usually the first hit that appears. So, if someone were interested in Christos Sariannidis specifically, then he or she would type it in and find out that such an article exists. From there, the researcher discovers that there is more information that links Sariannidis to certain important events. What if there are people who know Sariannidis, but do not know much about the Petralona Cave? Sariannidis is just a stepping-stone for readers to learn more about Aris Poulianos, the Petralona Cave, the Petralona Man, etc. Overall, people should be able to access information as easily as possible with articles that serve as stepping-stones for further research. If a person removes a stepping-stone article just because it is "non-notable", then who is to stop such a person from doing the same thing to a "non-notable" article with well-researched content that deserves to be in Wikipedia? Remember, notability is not necessarily the only thing that defines an article's validity or importance. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 15:02, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The only reason anybody would ever search for information on Sariannidis, would be either because they already know about his role with the Petralona Cave, or because he was their grand-uncle. Nobody else would even know his name. In either case the article won't tell them anything new, and never will, because there simply isn't anything known about him except that he strolled into the cave on one sunny day. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 15:12, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: We have no control over what Google will find. But you are of course free to publish information about Sariannidis in various other places on the Web, where Google will find it. For that matter, Google today finds (among other resources) <a href="http://www.aee.gr/english/6petrlona/40years/40years.html" class="external free" title="http://www.aee.gr/english/6petrlona/40years/40years.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aee.gr/english/6petrlona/40years/40years.html</a>. For that matter, if there were an article on the Petralona cave discoveries in Wikipedia, it might be reasonable to mention Sariannidis there, and Google would find <i>that</i>, too. The only issue here is whether Sariannidis deserves his own article on Wikipedia, following Wikipedia rules (not your personal judgement). It is quite clear both from the wording of the rules and from the discussion here that he does not. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 17:29, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. How do you know that? Are you a psychic? This is yet another reason why I do not take your statements seriously (failing to take me seriously in a previous discussion was the other reason). Unfortunately, you are missing the point Future Perfect. Deleting one stepping-stone article will lead people like you to go off and delete (or nominate for deletion) other "non-notable" articles that actually do have new information and are actually worthy content-wise. So, if you want to delete the Christos Sariannidis article (just so you can deliberately destroy one piece of work I created), then have a ball. However, I am afraid the concept of "checks-and-balances" does not exist within your methodologies, which is the only reason why I am usually adamant in preventing you specifically from going off and destroying my work (or asking others to do the destroying for you). <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 17:20, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Deucalionite, no one is trying to "destroy your work". But if you insist on systematically violating Wikipedia policy about notability, your edits will be reverted. You may be right, maybe in 2053 Sariannidis will be recognized as a major figure in 20th century archaeology, at which point Wikipedia should mention him. But until then, notability is not about what <i>might be</i>, but about what <i>is</i>. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 17:29, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Sorry Macrakis, but when someone wikistalks me I have to assume the worst. I don't want to, but I am not given many options when big useless signs and rampant "wikifications" from a certain someone prevent me from correcting my mistakes (with help from honorable users). I like how you brand me as a "systematic violator of Wikipedia policy". It has a nice "mythologizing" effect to it (yes, fear me for I am god of the "violations underworld"; just kidding).</dd>

<dd>Anyway, writing articles about people should not be oriented on expecting them to be gloriously famous. Notability is about what "is" and what "could be" (not what "might be"). Example: I might be an engineer, but I could be a doctor. See the difference? The articles I write entail people who "could" be notable in some future time or "could" be rejected by "mainstream" academia for some interminable amount of time. However, to deem the people I write about as "might-be's" only ignores what they have accomplished already. This means that irrespective of whatever "mainstream" academia believes a scholar to be does not change the fact that the scholar conducted research, discovered artifacts, etc. Focus on just the facts until "mainstream" academia comes around to state, "Such and such academic is a worthy person...blah, blah, blah".</dd>

<dd>Christos Sariannidis, you could state, did not accomplish much. So he "could" be a great discoverer in some future time, but to deem him as a "might be a great discoverer" already ignores the fact that he discovered something that did have an impact on archaeology. I know you want to uphold Wikipedia policy as best as you can. However, all policies are perfectly imperfect and imperfectly perfect. This means that Wikipedia policy should continue to maintain certain standards, but should also include rules where it distinguishes "non-notable" articles that are absolutely useless to readers and "non-notable" articles that are beneficial. If Wikipedia continues to marginalize "non-notable" articles with interesting and well-researched information, then the encyclopedia will only exacerbate even moderate users who only want to contribute and help readers become more aware of certain events/people.</dd>

<dd>If you want to delete the Sariannidis article, then go ahead. However, I have yet to acquire a guarantee from anyone that a system of "checks-and-balances" be implemented to prevent people from deciding that my articles deserve to be deleted just because they lack glitter and glamor. Once I am given a guarantee (from editors, administrators, whatever) that the rampant "must delete" and "must hinder" campaigns on my work stop, then I will be fine in allowing one of my articles to fall gracefully. This is not extortion. This is not "wikiterrorism." This is not anti-Wiki ranting and raving (though I have done that already). This is not a soapbox. Finally, this is not an insistence on my part to "violate Wikipedia policy". This is a simple request for a guarantee instead of being told that "everything will be fine" and then get backstabbed the next minute. If you understand the rudimentary dynamics of an honor code, then you will understand the meaning of my request. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 20:22, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Simple logic only works to an extent my friend. Granted you are correct in that focus should be maintained on the article, but articles are created, deleted, modified, and updated by people. Therefore, articles are socially constructed (ask yourself, do you see articles creating themselves?). So, if you do not understand the social "politics" behind an article, then it becomes more difficult for you to communicate with people who you might need help from one day. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeucalionite_118b.html" title="User:Deucalionite">Deucalionite</a> 21:13, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Who cares about the politics behind an article? - as an editor, you should be asking yourself a)does this article add something to wikipedia and b) does it mean the requirements of wikipedia. In my view, that article does neither.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Didn't you state something about "ruthless purging campaigns"? Also, if you "understand" why I am upset, then why did you not listen to my simple request for you to leave me be? You, and everyone else, could have avoided all this. If you are truly a "civilized Wikipedian", then you would have kept an eye on me once in a while and not every ten seconds. Also, you have yet to admit that you implicitly deemed my statements as "trollish" on a previous discussion after we had an agreement of collaboration. To make a pact with me, and not take my statements seriously in a discussion is very rude. Now, I know the other voters here want to end this discussion as soon as possible (surprise, surprise, so do I). However, I have yet to receive a guarantee that Future Perfect stop stalking me and my work (also an apology would also be nice since being implicitly called a "troll" is very disrespectful).

Once I'm done with all those articles, I think you'll see their importance as a whole. It's sort of like the dark underbelly of DS. It'll take me a while to do the articles, though, so just wait until they're done, then we can resume discussion. --<a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGaming_King_0455.html" title="User:Gaming King">Gaming King</a> 20:42, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This wikipedia page appears to be just one huge resume. The only informative sentence is the second one, in which he is described as an international relations professor in Turkey. He is a teacher at a moderately prominent Turkish university, and I see no reason why that is deserving of a wikipedia page. To gauge how famous he actually is I looked up the various books he published. The first one, which was authored with others, gets about two pages worth of hits, roughly 20. The other "book" he wrote is actually an unpublished master's essay, whose only Google hit comes from his own personal page. Once finding that page, I actually saw that his wikipedia page is actually a completely copy+paste job from his faculty information page from the Bigli University site. I think a page on wikipedia should be self-explanatory as to why the subject deserves a wikipedia page. I cannot find, however, any reason from his page which is just one big list taken from his own personal listing. The page was created and updated by the user Ankaram (whom some believe to be Sedat Laciner, someone who has used wikipedia to promote himself and his organizations. Turan is actually on the editorial board of Laciner's International Strategic Research Org.- an organization for which Laciner created a wikipedia page for and Ankaram helped to update- so it is not surprising that Laciner would have created such a page for Turan as well.) I think wikipedia is no place for resumes and self-promotion, this page should be taken down as it adds nothing to general knowledge and is just a copy+paste job from someone's personal site.

<dd>I think we should be careful to confuse being cited a few times over the years by various news outlets and being wikipedia-worthy. When you consider the huge number of articles churned out by any news source, CNN, BBC, etc., on an extremely large array of topics, with an average of one or two people being quoted in each one, the number of people quoted more than once by a news outlet over the years is likely to be very large. Especially when it comes to an obscure area like Turkish politics, they probably did some research and came up with his name as someone to quote in an article or two. Saying that "the subject is notable enough to be quoted by main stream media" would set a very broad prescedent as to who deserves a wikipedia page. Tons of otherwise non-famous people, often professors like Turan is, are asked to give their opinions in articles. One of my college professors was just the subject of an NPR interview and has published quite at least a couple "mainstream" books on US politics. However he is not one anyone would classify as famous and does not have his own page. Meanwhile a search for various books and articles listed on the Turan page turns up nothing notable about them. Many of them were from 20 or 30 years ago even. I see no strong evidence of his notable status. Vartan84 16:52, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> First off, OSU80 is trying to make it sound like he's (she's) somehow diligently burrowed out my secret identity. I'm not Batman. If I were trying to post this article annonymously, I wouldn't use "nealiios" as my screen name on Wikipedia. Give all of us some credit. Secondly, user OSU80 obviously has an attitude that computer game designers and writers don't merit the same kind of recognition as would be given any writer, musician, or film director. On pages for those individuals, you would expect to see listings of their works, as would be entirely appropriate. Today, the computer gaming industry generates more annually than Hollywood makes at the box-office, which makes it the most powerful force in popular culture. Nowhere on this page am I editorializing that I am the greatest game designer who ever lived, nor making any statements that cannot be factually backed up. I am not trying to sell anything to anyone. I am also not implying in any way, shape, or form that other game designers should not be accorded the very same kind of entries. If we allow a single individual like OSU80 to single-handedly decide that a person's work is "non-notable", then there is very little purpose in Wikipedia. This service is meant to provide people with information in one place, not to become a link factory that simply sends people flying all over the net to find the information they need. If simply following links elsewhere was the purpose, then there would be no point to Wikipedia. I could do the very same thing in Google. Don't let this one user decide what YOU can't see.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Nealiios (<a href="../../../n/e/a/User_talk%7ENealiios_df6d.html" title="User talk:Nealiios">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nealiios_5ed3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nealiios">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<p>Procedural nomination - I noticed a redlinked AFD nomination for this article. Google only gets fewer than 100 hits and from reading the article and looking at the hits, I'm not even sure what the heck this article is about. One of the linked articles seems unrelated. The other talks about general ideas.

Returns only 123 unique google hits, has no listing at allmusic and amazon.com has never heard of them. This is a repost of an article I tagged for speedy deletion as a copyvio but which is not a copyvio in its reposted form. At the time of reposting all the text was in Spanish and while a possible db-band, because article was in Spanish, claims of notability or lack thereof might have been hidden to non-bilingual reviewing admin, so I elected to prod instead (removed). Given that I started the process as non-speedy, taking it here. Appears to be speedy-able material now that author has translated.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 18:32, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I take issue with this. It's the responsibility of those who want information on Wikipedia to back it up, not the responsibility of those removing it to prove that it can't be backed up. I didn't translate the page but I could read the location names in it, and none of them were out of the US, virtually all in New England. The source in question seems to be a solicitation to book the band, from their booking agent. I also found this page, <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=366587" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=366587" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> which confirms that their "tour" was mostly in New England plus NY, with one stop in Ohio and one in Florida, not exactly far out of the way. Both alofoque.com and alofoquerecords.net don't work. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 22:41, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I object. only first guy had a good reason to say delet as it looked like an advert. and I am sorry for that mistake, i did not think about that.</p>
<p>There are people who define love like I wrote there, and just deleting it and closing your eyes to not see it will not do any good. It is probably a minority view, but it still exists. And that I wanted to record.</p>
<p>Also remember the greeks they had three levels for the love: Philos, Eros, Agape. First being a love between friends. Second between a man and woman.

<li>Author's note: There are various spiritual communities and forums and schools as well listed on the WIKI website. You will find some on the Sri Aurobindo template, including Auroconf, which is comparable to the Vishaal Study Group. I do not consider this an advertisement for this group ... it is a declaration of its existence. It seems unfair to allow some forums a wiki-page and not others. I believe the history AND the current status of the Supramental Yoga begun by Sri Aurobindo is a valid issue and deserves a Wiki presence, as much as do groups such as Auroconf or the journals listed on the 'journals and forums' section of the Sri Aurobindo template.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have suggestions as to how to present this community/forum/school in a way that is comparable/compatible to all the other one's you allow. Thanks, Saberlotus</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> for now, yes, it duplicates the category format, but it's a valid subject for a list and it'll probably draw some attention and improvement.

Any time the previous debate was a "VfD" I'm skeptical about the idea that we shouldn't debate again; the community and our standards evolve. In this case, the prior VfD was based on the idea that we could have a category instead, but now there actually IS one. The Occult writers category is well-populated, and the list adds nothing to the encyclopedia beyond the category. I find the above keep votes on pretty shaky ground, considering the category exists and is more complete.

<li><b>Delete.</b> The used book site, http:www.abebooks.com, shows no copies, usually an indication of a self-published book with very limited circulation.

Searches on Emenar turn up only this book, i.e. Emenar has not published anything else.

<dd>As a sportscaster for a major network, who has won 2 awards and is a spokesperson for a charity event associated with the PGA, I think that does establish the notability.
