<li><b>Keep</b> the article describes maximum power efficiency and maximum power transfer.

<li>There is no claim that Odum invented it in the text. There is a claim that he proposed it as the fourth principle of energetics. If someone else proposed maximum power as the fourth princple of energetics before Odum, then this needs to be mentioned. Please include references to those people who have proposed that maximum power is the fourth principle of energetics (or thermodynamics) and then the article will be more relevant. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholto_Maud_822a.html" title="User:Sholto Maud">Sholto Maud</a> 03:57, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>No. I'm saying that a key component of Odum's ideas was the application of the electronic understanding of maximum power efficiency to ecological systems. Thus the graph and table are key components to the article and an effective rendition of his approach. I am not saying that Odum should get credit for ideas that existed in their current form before he was born. He proposed that this should be considered a principle of energetics with wider application than electronics, that it could be applied in ecology. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholto_Maud_822a.html" title="User:Sholto Maud">Sholto Maud</a> 06:33, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>comment</b> Ok&#160;:). So. <b>1.</b> It seems that the article on max power theorem could benefit the table and graph that used to be on the max power site. People happy if we put them on the max pow theorem in the section on efficiency? <b>2.</b> This maximum power article could be deleted. <b>3.</b> People criticised the article and the principles of energetics article because it did not properly refer to the history and development of the theorem. I notice that the maximum power theorem article has no historical discussion. It would benefit from this, with examples of applications. The history of the application, might be the best place to discuss Odum's use of the theorem and suggestion that it should be considered the 4th principle of energetics? How does that sound?<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholto_Maud_822a.html" title="User:Sholto Maud">Sholto Maud</a> 07:24, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: to repeat in different words what I said in one of the other related AfDs: the immediate problem is that (as I guess) Sholto is not familiar with the physics literature, while Linas is not familiar with the ecology literature. The trouble is that almost no-one else is either! Linas: Sholto is right about Odum being notable as one of the fathers of ecology, and even about Odum's influential but questionable ideas which he is trying to describe in these articles being notable. Sholto: Linas is right that you have not written a good article even regarding a good summary of Odum's suggestions and later work in ecology, and he is even more right that to someone knowledgeable in physics, Odum's suggestions about energetics will appear rather cranky. The best solution would be for someone expert in ecology, information theory, and thermodynamics, to write much better versions of all these articles, but such a user will prove hard to find. Oh well, if nothing else at least this incident shows the value (and difficulty!) of breaking down barriers between disciplines. I suspect ecologists have more to benefit from a better understanding of thermodynamics and information theory than vice versa, but that it would be far easier to a smart physicist to read enough ecology to be able to speak the ecologists's language. Linas, if you want to spend some time, a very nice semipopular book is Paul Colinvaux, <i>Why Big Fierce Animals are Rare</i>, Princeton U Press, 1978 (also reprinted by a mass market publisher). After that, you would have to do a literature search in ecology and start sifting through literally hundreds of papers with the help of an abstracting service, then read the most relevant dozen or so. You also have to have studied a book like Cover &amp; Thomas, <i>Elements of Information Theory</i>, Wiley, 1991.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 03:38, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I guess I'm on the hook. Looks like <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principles_of_energetics.html" title="Principles of energetics">Principles of energetics</a> will survive the AfD, and so I shall take a shot at editing it so that it has what I might have expected to see there. I am also concerned about the technical content of <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergy.html" title="Emergy">emergy</a>: it sounds more like a concept used economics, where there are explicit equations that can value an object today based on the value that its parts may have had some time in the past. Although I know I've seen such equations in the economics lit, I certainly wouldn't be able to name these equations. Again, my complaint is that emergy sounded like something the economists have already been working on for quite a very long time and even awarded each other nobel prizes for (e.g. the <a href="../../../l/t/c/LTCM_2137.html" title="LTCM">LTCM</a> folks).<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 04:23, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to draw the courts attention to Â§ 16.11 <b>Generalized Treatment of Linear Systems Used for Power Production</b> (in M.Tribus (1961) <i>Thermostatics and Thermodynamics</i>, Van Nostrand, University Series in Basic Engineering, p. 619). Tribus draws conclusions and variables about maximum power efficiency of thermodynamic steady state from an article by Odum, H.T. and Pinkerton, R.T., "Time's Speed Regulator," <i>American Scientist</i>, Vol. 43, No. 2, p. 331, Apr. 1955. Tribus seems to be referring to this as the founding article in the analysis of "peak power". Would anyone like to comment on the implications of this in terms of our discussion of the status of maximum power re: Odum and re: the laws of thermodynamics? <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholto_Maud_822a.html" title="User:Sholto Maud">Sholto Maud</a> 11:19, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
