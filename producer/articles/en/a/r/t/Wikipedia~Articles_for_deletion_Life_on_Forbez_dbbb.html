<p>Non notable keenspace comic, found <a href="http://cdc.keenspace.com/" class="external text" title="http://cdc.keenspace.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Is there any sort of notability? Apart from some comments on webcomic toplists linked from the article, I can find none. I think it was one time a part of the graphicsmash community, but I'm not too sure.

<dd><b>Reply</b> - Yes, it was a long time before it was completed, I was busy with other nominations and other non-wikipedia stuff. But you checked my contribs, so you should have known that I knew about the afd process. To be honest, I wasn't that bothered about someone creating the page, but was bothered over what you had to say about it. ie speedily remove the tage, and to evict me from the wikipedia house. Normally, if you find a broken afd listing, it's better complete the nomination, and then to put your argument rather than just posting some rash statements. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 13:49, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How has he complied? He even fails to note that this article was initially created by following the existing edit link on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphic_Smash_d091.html" title="Graphic Smash">Graphic Smash</a>. Stating <i>I think it was one time a part of the graphicsmash community, but I'm not too sure</i> shows he has not even bothered to read the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphic_Smash_d091.html" title="Graphic Smash">Graphic Smash</a>. He asks for notability without even checking the links in the article under the heading Awards. The reason Google does not show up much is that the web comics has moved home several times and also been a subscription comics in the past, thus less coverage. This is not impressive. Moreover I cannot see being unregistered is a disqualification anywhere. Can you? 85.164.86.246 19:51, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b> - One of the main reasons for nominating it for deletion was the fact that I DID check the external links in the "awards" section. They're not awards, they're forum posts on webcomic toplists. Every webcomic ever has that. I'm also against the, "once appeared on some network = notability" stance. It's like giving every band who has ever been signed by the most minor of labels an article. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 13:45, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

A handful of comments on two different web-based forums hardly qualifies as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> when trying to show that this is something more than just another webcomic with limited readership and influence. --<i><a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a></i>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllen3_35fb.html" title="User talk:Allen3">talk</a></sup> 20:55, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This comic is sufficiently established. Though the author moved it to his own site fairly recently, it was on Modern Tales. I agree Hahnchen was overzealous on this particular nomination. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 16:01, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It looks to me like some comics on <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Tales_9ad4.html" title="Modern Tales">Modern Tales</a> would be notable, and others wouldn't. Without consensus-approved guidelines designed to address such things without half an hour of research for each AfD, I don't think we can take its presence there as evidence. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 22:03, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Duly noted. My vote remains unchanged and I still believe Hahnchen made a mistake on this one. I'm not fond of the deletionist attention webcomics have received lately, but this one strikes me as an error as opposed to a philosophical difference. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 18:50, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - comics associated with Modern Tales and other professional webcomics syndicates are notable. The closing admin should also see <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_Webcomics_0e1f.html" title="User:Snowspinner/Webcomics">User:Snowspinner/Webcomics</a>, as I believe myself to be a subject expert on the matter of webcomics, which should be given due weight in closing this debate. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 22:45, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is Modern Tales really 100% professional? I see it has some free comics and some subscription comics, so it's hard to tell. That's why I think we should spell such things out in the guidelines--but we have to agree on them to use them. We shouldn't have to be experts to see that a comic is notable; this should be spelled out in the article. Incidentally, you might look at <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#The_role_of_expert_editors" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research#The role of expert editors</a> for Wikipedia policy on what expertise counts for; the answer is not a whole lot, unless reputable sources are cited. This is sometimes time-consuming (something I've experienced plenty on physics articles), but it makes the encyclopedia better. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 22:56, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And I would not pretend that my say-so should be taken as a valid source for content addition - but deletion debates are a different matter - subject experts ought be taken seriously when asserting notability of a subject, I would think. And yes, Modern Tales is a professional site - it is Joey Manley's business. A given MT artist may have other jobs, but MT in general is a professional operation, the contents of which are notable. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 23:00, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The site as a whole may be professional, but I would still want more information about the particular artist. It also depends on how many comics are on the site, and what its criteria are for inclusion. I don't know that within an AfD is the appropriate place to discuss such questions in detail—rather, the ongoing work at <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> is. Regarding expertise and deletion, if someone was deleting a physics article, I would put up a couple of links to places the concept was discussed in peer-reviewed journals. I realize that Modern Tales may be nearly the closest thing that exists to a peer-reviewed journal in webcomics, but I don't think it qualifies as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> in the same way under Wikipedia rules. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 23:08, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you want to have the discussion on <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a>, fine, but it seems absurd to declare that notability issues that haven't been settled there are somehow invalid to discuss here - the article is up for deletion now. Do you propose to table the discussion until we have inclusion guidelines? As for Modern Tales, they are selected based on their merits by the editor of the particular site - in the case of Graphic Smash, that's <a href="../../../t/_/c/T_Campbell_3b51.html" title="T Campbell">T Campbell</a>. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 23:11, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your point is well taken. So why did this comic move? It seems to have moved from a hosting service that might very well have made it notable, to one that doesn't (unless it's in the top 25). Where we should consider it as being from depends on why it moved, how long it had been there, etc.--so what's the story? -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 23:35, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure yet - it's something I'm looking into. But I'd like to err on the side of caution here. My guess, though I'm not certain, is that erratic updating made it unsuitable for a professional operation like Graphic Smash. I don't know of any other cases of strips going down from notable syndicate to Keenspace offhand, which is itself kind of notable. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 23:39, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While most comics on Modern Tales are notable, I don't think the least read comic on Modern Tales is automatically notable. Same goes for a comic that may have experienced 15 seconds of fame with a brief association with the Graphic Smash site. Is every failed sitcom pilot notable? Is a band automatically notable if they sign to a major label but then their album tanks? My vote remains "delete." <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 23:47, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would think few would object to an article on every television series to have aired on network television, considering that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> explicitly advocates articles on every individual episode of some of them. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 23:50, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think my vote will have to remain as is, at least if you're right about the unsuitability due to updating irregularities; that would undermine the whole reason that Modern Tales would be a standard of notability in the first place. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 00:35, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd just like to say that my feelings on webcomic syndication and notability are already covered in <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a>. I'm against the any membership to a syndicate = notability guideline as suggested. It would be the same as saying any signed band to the most minor of record labels would get an article. OK, GraphicSmash as an entity may be notable, but how notable are the individual comics? I reckon that most people would refer to the syndicate over a specific comic, on the lines of "I'm reading graphicSmash", over the specific comic. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 17:46, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You reckon completely and 100% wrong. I have never in my life heard of anyone refer to reading "Keenspot" or "Graphic Smash." <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 17:49, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Maybe that was a bad example phrase. But the point I am trying to make, is that graphic smash is way more notable than the individual comics that make it up, unlike say a record label. I doubt people would pay just to see 1 particular comic, but look at graphicsmash and say, "now, hey! There's a collection of not too bad comics that I wouldn't mind reading." Which is why I think that just because a comic has appeared on xxx syndicate, doesn't mean that it's notable. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 20:07, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In my experience it is generally one or two comics that get people to make the purchase, and then they stumble upon more from that - for me it was <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digger.html" title="Digger">Digger</a> on Graphic Smash and <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narbonic.html" title="Narbonic">Narbonic</a> on Modern Tales. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 21:23, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have known people who've paid because of one comic, and found out about others that way. I started subscribing to Graphic Smash mainly for <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digger.html" title="Digger">Digger</a>, Killroy and Tina, and <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fans_%28the_webcomic%29.html" title="Fans (the webcomic)">Fans (the webcomic)</a>, but I've been introduced to many other good comics through it. When you make claims like the one above, it makes it look as though you don't really know much about Graphic Smash. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 23:10, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
