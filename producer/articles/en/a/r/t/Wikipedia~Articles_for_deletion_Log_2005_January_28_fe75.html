<dd><b>Comment:</b> Could an admin have a look at all these votes? I find it highly suspicious that everyone would vote in the same way, contrary to the MO of everyone else on every other VfD item (usually by using "Keep"). Also, most of these people have almost no contributions other than to create a user page and vote on this site. A couple of the accounts appear to be "stealth" accounts in that they were used sporadically to make one or two edits a month, and then suddenly they vote on this account. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 02:37, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC). Never mind, looks like everyone's looking into it already.</dd>
</dl>
<p>BTW A quick snytax analysis of the majority of the following vote <i>against</i> deletion entries shows them to be written by the same person.</p>
<p>-- not reallly. you'll note similarities, but the use of the "vote against" would be a very striaght forward notation to make for as the prior votes carried it.</p>

<dd>It would be fair to say that has already been discussed, and while a large number of votes were cast by first-edit users, they were not the same person. You have only been a member since 17:59, 24 Jan 2005, so can hardly be called a long-term member, and your contributions appear to be only to vote to delete (even your own article). <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpideme_1b9b.html" title="User:Epideme">Epideme</a> 22:55, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Most of us are probably fairly new to wikipedia, although I have used it before many times, I only edited very recently. We agree that the article needs a great deal more work, and will have a complete reworking within 4 days. However, having gotten involved in editing now, I will no doubt take a much greater interest in the wikipedia and in correcting articles. Please do not suggest that simply because someone is new they are false. <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpideme_1b9b.html" title="User:Epideme">Epideme</a> 02:43, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>vote <b>against</b> deletion. I echo kickstart70's views that if we delete this article we'll have to delete others, just to be "fair." In addition to J.D.'s contributions in the cartoons, he is much more then a simple cartoonist. Abaron</li>
<li>vote <b>against</b> deletion. If we delete this, how about the numerous other minor celebs that have pages here? Like the people from Slashdot or some minor character from a cut-rate 1960's sitcom? Full disclosure: I am the head moderator at UserFriendly and the initial creator of this page. I have a feeling this is a grudge request for deletion. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickstart70_e0ea.html" title="User:Kickstart70">Kickstart70</a> 23:38, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

A minor celeb he may be, but as the first person to run a daily online web cartoon, and as the first web comic to be ported to newspapers, he is an important and vital addition to the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpideme_1b9b.html" title="User:Epideme">Epideme</a> 23:43, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC).

<li>Vote <b>against</b> deletion. As the creative force behind a highly successful web comic - <a href="http://www.userfriendly.org" class="external text" title="http://www.userfriendly.org" rel="nofollow">UserFriendly</a>, J.D. Frazier would be worthy of inclusion, but his contributions go beyond that of a typical web-toonist. Utilizing humor, he has been a visible and vocal advocate for the open source software movement since the strip's debut in November of 1997. It should also be noted that the strip has been online continuously since that time. In addition, the standards he has set (and consistently maintained) for the electronic community that evolved around the comic strip have allowed it to become a favored source for not only general discussions, but one which also provides significant contributions in terms of collaborative technical support in a positive, non-threatening manner. As the creator of this presence, his inclusion in this wiki is merited. Dire Lobo 01:09, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Alright, so let's discuss what the reasons are for keeping and deletion. He is the creator of a very popular comic strip that has been running for over 7 years and is syndicated in multiple newspapers. I notice there are no VfDs for the Wikipedia page on the strip itself, so I believe that the creator of the strip should have a page. According to Alexa, the site is ranked 17165 in popularity according to its rankings. Other strips' creators have pages that are not disputed. How about you give us a chance to provide content? <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickstart70_e0ea.html" title="User:Kickstart70">Kickstart70</a> 02:58, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>So improve the article. And <i>please</i> stop people coming over from UF for the sole purpose of voting against deletion, because it doesn't help at all, as you should know if you've been here long enough. <b>Keep and expand</b>. Raven42 03:19, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Article much improved. I think that if we get rid of the VfD then no one is going to keep coming here (FWIW, I -did- make a request for <b>registered</b> users to come voice their opinion here. I didn't think anyone would register specifically for that purpose. However, I don't control their extra-UserFriendly actions, so I can't do a whole lot about what they do here. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickstart70_e0ea.html" title="User:Kickstart70">Kickstart70</a> 03:28, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

</dd>

<ul>
<li>Well, your request probably worked. However, I would have done a quite search for notability before voting. To tell you the truth, seeing all the flood voting just brought up my suspicions and I voted for an extreme delete before even making a notability check. Please realise that flood voting isn't the only way to make your voice heard. Often, it takes just one vote or comment with a good explanation and the veterans will vote for your side. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 03:44, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I can understand why we don't explicitly say "no new user voting", but I wonder if it might be a good idea to update the {{vfd}} tag to say that new users should probably write on the talk page or make comments instead of actually voting?

<p>Don't delete They are an obscure band that few people are likely to have heard of and the article plainly says they are 'possibly' the first tribute band to a tribute band, which is description, in order to tell people something general about them.

<dd>I see eleven Polish bands listed there. Or are you referring just to <i>drone doom</i>? (the term <i>drone doom</i> does not appear to be used at the site you linked to, nor in the article in question) If so, one band does not make a scene (and the guideline says it must be the most prominent band in a local scene). Also, the article <i>itself</i> must make the claim of notability.

Only around 20 people speak volap√ºk, so why not delete it's entry?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not delete. The article does mention drone doom, when it speaks of "uber-slow drone riffs". Doom-metal.com does have drone doom listed if you click on the "All Bands" bar at the top of the bandlist (top left of screen)and scroll through the genres to drone doom, many drone bands are listed there including Sunn O))) and Earth, the two bands which the author mentions. As for being the most prominent band in a scene, surely that means 99% of bands do not deserve to be listed here seeing as only one (maybe two) bands can invent a style of music. Eg, Napalm Death should be the only Grindcore band listed but they are not.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not delete [Doom-metal.com site owner] As far as I am aware the only Polish Drone band, the only Drone tribute band to a tribute band, infact probably the only doom tribute band to a doom tribute band. Perhaps not as well known as ABBA, actually pretty sure of that. But they are quite unique within the entire doom-metal genre. And in all honesty, what can it hurt? It's hardly a vanity entry as the band didn't submit it themselves, nor are after any claim for glory. And doom-metal as a whole is already a strugling enouth genre as it is.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> not notable. The expression "Got 'em" (never spelled "Gotem") as an abbreviation for "Got them" is very old and long predates usage by Florida high school students. The new usage described for a single local high school in Florida is not notable, probably a fad that will end when they graduate or get bored and move on to the next fad. If an article about the very common English expression "Got 'em" is needed, then write it from scratch... there's nothing here that could be used. By the way, some of the "keep" votes above are suspicious and sound like an informally organized campaign to stuff the ballot box. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 02:39, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

"everythign starts small, let this grow. itll stop growing on its own if its not meant to be" is really the key: Wikipedia is not for the promotion of new trends, however, worthy.

<li><b>Comment</b> If I were the acting sysop on this page, I would probably count these as about three "keep" votes. Admittedly there's no way to be sure and a clever person could simulate different personalities and writing styles. I see enough differences in style between different voters to there's more than one voter. I see enough similarities in style to think there are fewer than nine. taking the geometrical mean of one and nine, I get three... <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:29, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> checking this page i can see that some people suspect that "sock puppets" have been used. I give you my word, that to my knowledge, no sock puppets have been used. Now granted some of the "keep" votes are by new users, which apparently aren‚Äôt going to count (however i think they should). So a question for an admin, how is it determined what votes are used and what votes are thrown out. Does a person need to have a certain number of edits, be a member for a certain amount of time, ect.. I am in no way trying to cause trouble, I am just curios as to what the protocol is. (And besides even if the votes that have been thrown out were counted the article would still be deleted, sadly I might add). One last thing would it be a problem for me to have the gotem article on my homepage? bakuzjw (aka 578) 23:31, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not suggesting that you yourself are a sockpuppet but nearly all of the those anonymous keeps came in within a few minutes of the page being VFD'd which is a strong indication that a little clique had been 'instant messaged' to fluff up the vote. Why else did a bunch of anonymous voters show up so quickly? It never happens unless some form of sockpuppetry is involved. I don't think they were sockpuppets in the strict sense of the word, but there was obviously a group of people trying to make their little catch-phrase into something it isn't. The delete votes, most of which came from regular contributors, straggled in as they normally do over the next hours and days. --207.253.111.119 15:18, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(This comment isn't just directed at 207.253.111.119 -- though it's fascinating that the strongest elitism is coming from an anonymous IP -- but at everyone in this discussion who is attacking the new users who tried to contribute to Wikipedia.)</dd>
<dd>They aren't sockpuppets in any sense of the word. It may be annoying when a new user recruits other new users to back them up on VfD, but there's no rule against it, and there shouldn't be, because all users are equal.</dd>
<dd>Editors who have made hundreds of edits are usually dismayed to find that some high school student recruited over IM can cast a vote that counts as much as theirs. They tend to react by intimidating the users, either calling them names or telling them that their votes don't count (which is untrue). You've done this too, now.</dd>
<dd>So is it that upsetting that someone might vote against you? Someone who (gasp) isn't familiar with how Wikipedia works? You should sit back and relax, knowing that other experienced editors will come along and cast their own votes, and the right thing will happen to the article.</dd>
<dd>Sure, this article doesn't have much worth, but the users supporting it might once they get more Wikipedia experience. Wouldn't it be great if more high schoolers discovered Wikipedia and found out what a wonderful thing it is? Instead, though, they tend to discover Wikipedia and immediately have to withstand a barrage of personal attacks on VfD. Get off your high horse and go edit some articles.</dd>

<dd>Actually, that "anonymous" comment was mine -- I didn't realize I wasn't logged in when I made it. I must admit I am baffled by the suggestion of 'elitism'.

<dd>I could not agree more with Rspeer, the whole point of wikipedia is to make loads of knowledge available to the masses for free. And the only way that a lot of knowledge can be compiled is if a lot of people compile it. When veteran users come out and attack an article so furiously is not saying much about the wikipedia community. I enjoy Wikipedia, I like creating new articles and editing old ones, and I like to just sit and read wikipedia. But the problem is wikipedia will die out if veteran users attack new users in the way that happened many times on this vfd page (lets face it veteran users, which i am not one of, as you age, get married, get a job, have kids, wikipedia will fall to the bottom of your todo list). I guess what I am trying to say is that just be friendly to the new users, help them with various wikipedia protocol (which i am still learning and i have been part of wikipedia for a good 2-3 months now). And instead of declaring their vote invalid (because they only have one edit, or are new to wikipedia) and mocking their attempt at trying to save a wikipedia article they like, tell them why it isn‚Äôt a valid wikipedia article (which wasn‚Äôt done until days after the initial votes were posted), and i would think that the process would go smother. I know this wikipedia article will be taken down, but that is no longer the point, the point is (and some users ego's still wont let them see this) that I think wikipedia needs to take a look at who they treat new users, becuase remember in the future it will be us (i am only 17, and most of my friends-which made up a large majority of the keep votes- are the same age)who will be keeping wikipedia alive, so come on treat as with a little respect.bakuzjw (aka 578) 23:42, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Read the comments again! There are comments on the article itself - most of which are utterly bland and neutral, saying that it doesn't belong. And then there are comments about the voting, some of which merely express irritation that a bunch of people came out of nowhere for the sole purpose of saving this one little catch phrase which wouldn't belong in WP anyway. That's not elitism. It's not a ferocious attack. Anyone is welcome as a contributor but if a contributor doesn't understand what WP is all about, someone else will point that out to them. Hopefully this will be done diplomatically, but sometimes not. I actually think people have been remarkably restrained and good-humored about this and a number of people have taken pains to explain how things work. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">LeeHunter</a> 02:42, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>Reading through some of the delete votes i was amazed at the amount of elitism that was contained in there reasons for deletion. While maybe I am just reading the votes wrong, I still find it somewhat shocking that this is how some of the veteran users treat new users. It seems to me that there is a wikiclick and if you are not part of the "click" then your going to be in trouble. I just think that people should maybe tone down their responses and try and welcome new members instead of scaring them off by bashing them. bakuzjw (aka 578) 23:44, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Lots of votes here are misunderstood. Veteran users aren't all a bunch of elitists. Most of them are just trying to be effective and quick about the deletion process. People who feel strongly about the subject may feel hurt about its deletion, but it's not a personal attack. They're trying to keep the wiki clean and it can be really frustrating to see such stuff coming by. I recommend all new users to read the policy on what <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html" title="WP:WWIN">wikipedia isn't</a>.

<li>Yeah. For instance, when I see an article posted to VfD on <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">Special:Recentchanges</a>, I'll usually check the article, do a Google check, and then post a fairly quick keep/delete comment. I posted the notes about number of user edits because it's common practice on VfD votes to do so. However, I think we (including myself) often forget to take into account that new users are often unfamiliar with Wikipedia policies. I'll note to be a bit less brusque in the future. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoobergunch_e9e1.html" title="User:Goobergunch">Goobergunch</a>|<a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGoobergunch_93e1.html" title="User talk:Goobergunch">?</a> 20:23, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

It would be a travesty to have this article deleted and lose forever knowledge of its specific origin due to a handful of doubting <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> users. It is highly likely that the use of this word will increase exponentially within the next two decades, if not sooner. This is due in part to the far reaching influence of North Central Floridian students (see <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Florida_4abc.html" title="University of Florida">University of Florida</a>) and many others associated with the region. What users such as <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> do not realize is that this is a rare opportunity to capture the birth of a phrase that will have a far greater impact on the English language than is currently realized.

<dd>In reply to Wetman's question ("Why would you delete this?"):
<ol>
<li>It serves no purpose that's not served by other project pages</li>
<li>Its language is border-line vulgar, and certainly juvenile. It's certainly not written in what would be considered conventional style for policies.</li>
<li>Having a thing like that in wikipedia namespace, especially categorized as policy, makes us look not only childish, but also dumb (hehehe, I said "butt").</li>

<li><b>Move to meta</b> (historically the place where such things reside) or <b>BJAODN, only Delete if supporters refuse to agree with either of first two options</b> (yeah, I know, it's an Iasson-esque vote, but not much other way of handling this). It is a quasi-humorous expression of the frustration many of us feel with the inability of current policy to deal with POV-pushers who game the rules, dance close to personal attacks, and generally seek to anger/annoy admins into doing something remotely wrong so that spurious RFCs and RfARs can be filed. As such, it might be good to preserve it, but it can't be anywhere that makes it look like official policy. <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="extiw" title="m:The_Wrong_Version">m:The Wrong Version</a> is a classic example penned by Angela -- it is funny, it expresses a frustration we often feel, and it lives somewhere that makes it clear it's not actually site policy. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 18:11, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> (or move/rename). I'd like to see this refactored into a usable bit of policy. I fear the current policies are tending to <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_Raul%27s_laws_b426.html" title="User:Raul654/Raul's laws">drift towards rigidity</a>, leaving no room for the plain old "don't be a dick" kind of rules.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I agree the wording does lend itself to personal attacks, but then it's difficult to have policies like this without breaking them being an insult. Changing it into "be reasonable" seems fair until you realise that saying someone's breaking it is saying they're "being unreasonable". Calling someone a troll or sockpuppet is a personal attack, calling an edit ill-researched and ill-cited can be construed as one. Aren't these both policies?</dd>
<dd>I realise one of the ideals of Wikipedia is professionalism inside and out, but is having a bit of fun on our end going to kill anyone? I personally think this policy makes a point, and it does it in a way that's fun. That's why we're doing this, remember? 'cause we enjoy it? At least, that's why I edit here. <a href="../../../c/x/i/User%7ECXI_62c6.html" title="User:CXI">CXI</a> 16:58, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Articles in the Wikipedia namespace are interpreted as "official", and the Wikipedia Talk pages are for commentary on policies, etc. This has not been proposed as a policy statement. If it is not deleted, it will be cited as policy, as there is nothing to distinguish it from Wikipedia space pages that are official policy. It should be on the author's User Talk page, or maybe in meta. From the keep votes, it seems like people believe that anybody should be able to write Wikipedia policy just by giving the page a pithy title. Maybe I should write Wikipedia:Wikipdia should not suck --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 18:01, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"are interpreted as official" is curiously in the third person; do you mean that you erroneously do, therefore assume others erroneously will? Being in the "Wikipedia:" space just means it's a project community page, not that it's "policy" per se - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 03:53, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I do. Is it erroneous? There are quite a few WP articles that are cited all the time as if they were official. For example, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, or <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> The only context in which this is every likely to be used is that of dismissive mockery. People will simply say <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_be_a_dick_6caa.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't be a dick">Don't be a dick</a> rather than "Don't be a dick." The link gives it a spurious authority and implied <i>permission</i> to use the vulgarity. If someone thinks that in a particular discussion it will be helpful to tell someone "don't be a dick," they should put the words in their own mouth and take responsibility for them. (I am sooooo tempted to say "They should put the..." must resist... must be strong...) We should not make it easy for people to give the impression that Wikipedia endorses vulgarity as an effective method for group decision-making. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:28, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Move to meta</b> was a good first step. Even there, it needs to be more professionally worded. The "jocular tone" will not come through when the link is actually used in a dispute (and I don't see it being used <i>unless</i> the parties are already in a dispute).

<li>It is useful, e.g., for wikipedia maintenance of broken links. If you suggest me another tool that does the same, I may reconsider the vote. Notability is but one of criteria. Anyway, since youare so picky, I did some research. It exists since 1997, and quite a few people are reportedly used it. Broken links are real plague of HTML; I'd say <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a>, since there is no uneversal cure yet. So I conclude: the tool is notable. And lastly, google gives 28,700 hits. So I guess none of the people voting to delete researched its notability from other sources. Bad stub does not establish non-notability. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 23:58, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>If you had <i><b>said</b></i> in your vote that you knew the program and had either used it or knew personally that it was notable, then I wouldn't have needed to post what I did. But since you declined to do so, all I can assume is that you are making a generic "notable" vote because that's the way radical inclusionists tend to vote. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 00:45, Jan 29, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, personal essay, original research. <b>However...</b> I think this is sensible musing and speculation by someone who is asking reasonable questions, but doesn't seem to be aware of existing answers. See the article on <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chunking.html" title="Chunking">Chunking</a> for a description of how some subjects were able to memorize extremely long strings of binary digits by recoding them into integers. For the use of musical pitch as an information carrier; even English uses pitch already to add information to speech. In effect the question mark is encoded in speech as a rise in pitch at the end of a sentence while the period is encoded as a fall in pitch. My understanding is that in Chinese differences in pitch can completely change the meanings of words. <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silbo.html" title="Silbo">Silbo</a>, used on La Gomera in the Canary Islands, is an encoding of Spanish vocabulary and syntax into pure whistling.

<p>"The Independent Student Newspaper of the University of Victoria". Marked as a speedy, but it doesn't seem like one. <s>Might be best merged somewhere but no vote from me yet</s>.

<li><s><b>Redirect</b></s> to <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Victoria_4600.html" title="University of Victoria">University of Victoria</a>, merging a little of the intro. Most of this article is a <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyvio.html" title="Copyvio">copyvio</a> from <a href="http://www.martlet.ca/archives/031002/news6.html" class="external text" title="http://www.martlet.ca/archives/031002/news6.html" rel="nofollow">www.martlet.ca/archives/031002/news6.html</a>, but the material doesn't belong in this article anyway. Some of the information (but not the text) could go to various other articles. My first reaction to this listing was that it was unnecessary, as the proposer didn't propose deletion, but I see the problems now and yes, VfD is probably the way to go. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 12:18, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is an existing category for Category:Canadian student newspapers, which I've added this article to. I <b>strongly</b> object to any attempt to draw a distinction between Canadian student newspapers that are notable enough to have an article and those that aren't, and fail to see how <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Martlet_b8c0.html" title="The Martlet">The Martlet</a></i> is any less notable than American student papers such as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tartan_4704.html" title="The Tartan">The Tartan</a></i> or the <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Maroon_9723.html" title="Chicago Maroon">Chicago Maroon</a></i>, both of which also already have articles. The only acceptable options are <b>keep</b> this, or <b>delete all university newspapers, period</b>; nothing in between is appropriate. I have to say <b>cleanup</b> (I've done some myself just now), but keep. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:08, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> (change of vote). Good <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refactor.html" title="Refactor">refactor</a>. Agree that Canadian (and Australian... <i>hang in there <a href="../../../l/l/e/Lleyton_Hewitt_aed8.html" title="Lleyton Hewitt">Lleyton</a></i>) student newspapers should be treated equally to those of other countries, but I think the above argument misses the point on several issues.

<ul>
<li>Well, if I'm missing the point, then please show me where. Because the way I see it, there are only three possible approaches to the general topic of student newspapers: (a) all are notable enough for Wikipedia, (b) none are notable enough for Wikipedia, (c) some are notable enough for Wikipedia and others aren't. I'm <i>genuinely</i> curious to know where the distinction lays for people who believe (c), because I don't personally see where a defensible distinction <i>can</i> be drawn. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 03:52, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Peace! But for a start, you still seem to think that someone wants to discriminate against Canadians. Nobody is proposing that, see my comments above and those of others below. Before, it seemed you were arguing that because we hadn't deleted a similar article, we shouldn't delete this one. Two problems there: Firstly, nobody had at that stage suggested deleting this one (not even the nominator). Secondly, we do make mistakes. Precedents are relevant, but not proof. No change of vote (ie still a keep as revised from redirect). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 08:46, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>In my original comment, my strong objection was to dividing Canadian student newspapers <b>from each other</b> as notable vs. non-notable; the American examples were raised in a different context. Yes, my point <i>is</i> that American and British student newspapers need to be treated equivalently; I raise that not because I think that there's some conspiracy against Canadian topics, but because if I didn't, this would have either survived or failed the VfD process as an isolated example and the others would have stayed right where they were. Frankly, I think student newspapers are a topic (university athletics teams and student unions would be two more) where we need to have a clear policy on their notability (or lack thereof) which applies consistently, because as things stand, some isolated examples get deleted and other isolated examples survive almost solely on the basis of <i>who happens to show up to vote in that particular case</i>, which isn't acceptable. (For example, the list of member papers at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_University_Press_d15e.html" title="Canadian University Press">Canadian University Press</a> <b>must</b> consistently link either to member papers or to the university articles. It <b>absolutely cannot</b> be half one, half the other. It also happens to be woefully incomplete at the moment, for that matter, since I can't add anything to it until I know whether I can link to papers.) And just for the record, Canadian topics <b>really have</b> sometimes been held to a higher standard of notability on VfD than their American or British equivalents. I ain't making this up. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 20:33, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Lots of issues here, but I don't think this is the place to discuss them. We agree on the course of action.

<li>Frankly, no, because I'm not going to pretend I believe that student newspapers are unencyclopedic or undeserving of individual articles. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 02:54, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The burden of evidence should be very high to show that a regularly published newspaper is not notable, and most English and major other-language newspapers not sufficiently notable for the English wikipedia. Some would obviously fail, such as advertising and listing "newspapers." This would not. Bearcat introduces the problems with such an isolated deletion. The article now notes how it was "responsible for bringing about the resignation of the university's president," which is highly important. Besides, I've never had anything to do with the University of Victoria, but I'm <i>interested</i> in it, and it's certainly expandible. (What's it independent of? Was it a response to an oldline establishment student newspaper? Have any subsequently notable people written for it? And so on.) <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 18:42, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not enough for an article. A newspaper is not notable <i>per se</i>. As for Bearcat's argument, I'm all for deleting every university newspaper from Wikipedia, unless they are actually notable for something else than simply being a newspaper. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> 23:59, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Then start putting the damned things up for deletion.

<li>It's a merge and redirect. My bad. And a student newspaper that's churned out a number of <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_e802.html" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer</a>-winning journalists or had an impact on major affairs off the campus would probably make the cut, for me. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 21:16, Jan 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. By default, student newspapers are not notable. Practically every university and college has one. There could be a student newspaper that is notable. The first one in a country or language. A student newspaper where an extraordinary number of a country's top journalists learned their profession. One that has won the Pulitzer Prize, or the equivalent in another country. But the burden of proof is on the person writing the article to establish notability. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:55, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> and redirect to <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Victoria_4600.html" title="University of Victoria">University of Victoria</a>. Current content is not sufficient to stand alone as an encyclopedia article. If there is ever a lot more encyclopedia-worthy material, it can be broken out to a separate article then. In the meantime, it is better discussed in context. Comment: To answer <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a>'s question above, I strongly believe the answer is C - keep some and delete others. The decision is a judgment call and often a very difficult one but it should be based on 1) whether the topic is or ever can be encyclopedic and 2) whether readers will understand the current content best if it is discussed separately or in the immediate context of some other article. I disagree with his/her comment that the "member pages at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_University_Press_d15e.html" title="Canadian University Press">Canadian University Press</a> must consistently link" one way or the other. Piped section links work just fine. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 22:56, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's necessary because Wikipedia <b>has</b> to start taking consistency of organization more seriously than it does. It looks bad to have some things separated out as articles while other equivalent things are strictly subsections of other articles, it looks bad to have an inconsistently-organized list, etc. Consistency isn't taken nearly seriously enough on here; there are <i>far</i> too many <i>ad hoc</i> decisions made in one case and not in another, resulting in poor organization. And also, I've noticed that the unofficial rule for most publications seems to be that any magazine or newspaper with a per issue circulation of at least 5,000 passes the test; why should a student paper be held to a different standard? <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 02:52, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think this is the place to discuss it, but I disagree with Bearcat's notion of consistency here. I don't see this as any different than (for example) one might have a list of an author's works with only the major works linking to articles of their own. Is there somewhere more appropriate to discuss this? -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:03, Feb 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Merging things like this defeats the object of the category system as the merged article won't be placed in the newspaper category. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Philip</a> 02:55, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Nobody's suggested otherwise. The point is that the category <i>isn't</i> serving the articles if it can't include 95 per cent of the articles that belong in it; it's of no value to have <i>any</i> articles on student newspapers, even "more notable than most" ones, if they're divorced of their context by the lack of any other student newspaper articles to compare them to. It <i>detracts</i> from the existing articles (and from Wikipedia as a whole) to have any "student newspapers" category at all, if isn't <i>allowed</i> to ever contain more than a fractional subset of that group of topics. (And again, comparing this statement to personal biography articles is intellectually dishonest; "student newspapers" is a finite set of things that are mostly of equal notability to each other, not a potentially infinite can of worms like allowing an article on any person who ever lived would be.) <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:05, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>RickK, I think that you and several other people here are making a common mistake; you are confusing an <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockmarket_index.html" title="Stockmarket index">index</a> with an <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_exchange.html" title="Stock exchange">exchange</a>. This is not a list of every company that trades on the exchange, but rather a list of the constituents of a very specific index of the 50 highest valued commodoties on the exchange. The list of stocks will never exceed 50, and the list should change no more than once a quarter. This is a highly regulated list, and is quite valuable. You are comparing this list to the <a href="../../../n/y/s/NYSE_f8de.html" title="NYSE">NYSE</a>, where the more appropriate comparison is the <a href="../../../d/o/w/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average_ca80.html" title="Dow Jones Industrial Average">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a>. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 21:23, Jan 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>A quick googling reveals their webpage, and looking at their policies shows that their list of constituents changes once every quarter <a href="http://www.nse-india.com/content/indices/ind_niftymaintenance.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nse-india.com/content/indices/ind_niftymaintenance.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. These updates are regularly scheduled. The list can never grow beyond 50, which is not that lengthy, expecially when compared to other indices. Also, index length should not be a criteria. The Russell 3000 has 3000 symbols, and is invaluable for evaluating the performance of small-cap stocks. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 21:26, Jan 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: Indexes like these don't change terribly often. I don't see anyone taking issue with the "constant need" to update the <a href="../../../d/o/w/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average_ca80.html" title="Dow Jones Industrial Average">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> for example. The <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASDAQ-100_43e5.html" title="NASDAQ-100">NASDAQ-100</a> is a longer list without much of an article.

<ul>
<li>Agreed. All indexes get updated about once a quarter, and it's big news when it happens, so the fact that the content changes should have nothing to do with whether or not the topic is notable or not. The list is not that lengthy, especially when compared to <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASDAQ-100_43e5.html" title="NASDAQ-100">NASDAQ-100</a> or <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_2000.html" title="Russell 2000">Russell 2000</a>, both of which are indisputably encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 21:19, Jan 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Stock_market_indices" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Stock_market_indices" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, you'll find twenty-some-odd stock indicies listed, so there certainly seems to be precedent that they are encyclopedic. I think the original complaint about this article was not so much the topic, but the quality of the content, which is no longer an issue after several people have jumped in and fixed this up. It's worth noting that most of the articles include the list of companies, with the notable exception of the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilshire_5000.html" title="Wilshire 5000">Wilshire 5000</a> , where such a list would be impractical to keep up to date --18:26, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. To quote a participant in the first AFD "If he is notable enough for a Wikipedia article, then almost everyone who has made his living as a journalist for more than a few years will be about as notable." Is wikipedia really the place for an article on every columnist for every publication in the world? The Borgman Promotional Commitee here at wikipedia has gone to great lengths to stress the importance of George and his family, but when it comes down to it, he's a guy who has written a bunch of columns on jazz and has appeared in some movies his son made. Hardly terribly notable. He's been listed in "Who's Who", but Who's Who is practically a joke. I'm curious if any of the other hundreds of people who must have written for the Mississippi Rag and other such publications over the years have articles. I'm guessing not. so why this guy then? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:16, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>Examining the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_Rag_a24b.html" title="Mississippi Rag">Mississippi Rag</a> article, I see that of the more than 100 "fine" contributing writers and photographers, only 3 others appear to have articles: <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chip_Deffaa_8bb2.html" title="Chip Deffaa">Chip Deffaa</a>, who writes for the substanitally more notable <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Post_3183.html" title="New York Post">New York Post</a> and is the author of numerous books (still a borderline case and a poor article); <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butch_Thompson_7781.html" title="Butch Thompson">Butch Thompson</a>, a musician (his articles doesn't even mention "The Rag"); and <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Avery_6932.html" title="Ray Avery">Ray Avery</a>, a photographer whose work has appeared on the covers of numerous albums (again, no mention of "the Rag"). Borgman is the exception, as his inclusion is based solely on his columns for what is now a online publication. Maybe the other hundred contributors need a group of wikipedians hell-bent on promoting them to sort of balance, but I'm thinking that's not the way to go. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 21:53, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Sorry, but no. Wikipedia is here to reflect notability, and a film which isn't finished and has no evidence of a distributor is not suitable for a Wikipedia article. It's a sad fact of the domination of the majors that indie films have a hard job getting noticed, but we're not here to fix that. Good luck with the film, but Wikipedia is not a tool to promote it. If it gets a wide distribution or wins a prize at a major independent film festival, then I'll be happy to vote keep for an article. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 18:05, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Votes like this one make me begin to think VfD (and Wikipedia in general) is a waste of my time. Between the two-thirds "consensus" requirement to delete an article, and the cadre of VfD habitues who will vote to keep almost anything, it seems that it is almost impossible to keep junk out of the Wikipedia. Practically the only things that can be deleted are the most egregious vanity articles written by high school kids about themselves and their bands, patent nonsense, and extremely bizarre original research. At the rate crap articles are accumulating, Wikipedia is sure to hit the one million article "goal" very soon, and most of it will be complete junk. I wonder whether Google will continue to give Wikipedia a high PageRank when three-quarters of it is trivia and crap, even if the other quarter is a useful resource? How low can the signal to noise ratio fall before people give up? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:32, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>You miss the point. If I happen to find a good article in Wikipedia, I can tell whether it is good. But what if an article title comes up in a Google search? Or, what if I see a non-red link in another Wikipedia article? At some point, the probability that a Wikipedia article is going to be vanity, some narcissistic aspect of so-called Internet "culture", popular culture sub-trivia, something from a fictional universe, a sub-stub, a moronic list, or something else exasperating will mean that it won't be worth the probable annoyance of following the link. "Results" in Google searches from Wikipedia and its mirrors will start to be a plague, if that hasn't happened already in some areas. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 15:42, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

You'll witness that there is a significant amount of junk that is kept out of Wikipedia <i>every day</i>. <i>This</i> article is nowhere near being in that category. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:09, 2005 Jan 29 (UTC)

<li>I did do new page patrolling at one point. You are correct that CSD gets rid of a lot of junk. It could get rid of much more if people would trust the administrators. The recent CSD policy vote shows that basically people will not trust the administrators; they insist on voting on anything that requires on any judgement at all. My experience from new page patrolling is that if something is not an obvious CSD candidate and has to go through VfD, it is an uphill battle to get it removed, unless it is such outright vanity or nonsense that nobody has the nerve to vote to keep it. Every keep vote has to be answered by more than two delete votes, and since people who are opposed to an article insist on voting "Merge" or "Redirect" (which equate to keep), it is actually even worse. In practice, deletion requires near unanimity. Each VfD failure to delete an article becomes a precedent for keeping other junk. On the next VfD about something similar, there will be people saying, "If we can keep X, why can't we have Y, which is at least as notable (etc) as X". So junk and precedents to keep junk are accumulating exponentially. As for this article, we are in the process of setting the precedent that not only every university on the planet will have an article, but also every university student organization that can mention any minor curiosity. The fact that the University of Glasgow has a strange student union structure is a minor wrinkle that perhaps merits a mention in the article on the University. It doesn't elevate the two student unions to the point where they should have articles of their own. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 15:43, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article itself is no good - it's basically not even a stub, since it gives no real details about Nivbed aside from the user's opinion. However, as a matter of public record, I would say Nivbed is most certainly notable. His real name is Justin Cherry, and he's either one of the art directors or senior art director for Troika Games. Considering that his particular style of art isn't exactly all the rage with the public, no, he's not fantastically known. But he's not any more non-notable than, say, Christopher Shy, Marc Sasso, or Chad Michael Ward. Well, maybe slightly less notable than Chad Michael Ward. I suggest the author of the post re-write it; if the quality improves, keep it. If not, delete it, and I'll write a better one myself. --Adarael 7:33, 2005 January 30</p>
