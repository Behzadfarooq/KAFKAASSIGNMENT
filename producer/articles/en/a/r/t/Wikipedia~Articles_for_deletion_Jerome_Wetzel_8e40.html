<p>Nonnotable author with one book, An Actor's Nightmare, also nominated here. The book is published by Amazon's vanity press <a href="../../../b/o/o/BookSurge_be4c.html" title="BookSurge">BookSurge</a> and has a current Amazon sales rank of 1,360,352. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 23:25, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So what is the problem if you come across a really good book and want to help the author get the word out? I don't think that should be penalized. A know many other people that have read the book, met a few dozen of them at a book signing, and we are all very eager to read the second one. We are also eager to spread the word about a book we really liked. Wikipedia is a great resource to do that. Why is this being fought so hard? --Stewart08 23:31, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> perhaps you might look at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Basically, Wikipedia is not for promotion.

I read the guidelines and see nothing that excludes Jerome Wetzel from having an entry. In fact, search Columbus and Madison County newspapers, and you will find reviews of his work, which I believe qualifies him for an entry, per the 'guidelines' referring to multiple reviews of an author's work. --JMSWDLY 23:41, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you are going to continue to fight this, I will give up. This is my last ditch effort to change your minds. --JMSWDLY 23:42, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It might be helpful to provide links to those reviews, then we could read them ourselves. I'm not convinced that reviews in local newspapers meet the guidelines. BTW, this really isn't a fight merely a discussion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 23:46, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reviews were in The Madison Press and the Madison messenger, neither of which are online. I cannot find the article from The Columbus Dispatch. Perhaps it is too old, or maybe I just didn't know how to search for it. Other newspapers may have carried it. I don't know. The guidelines, as I read them, are not binding or conclusive, just guidelines. It is my opinion that a book series that has readers and has been reviewed would qualify, but like I said, I won't keep discussing this if its clear that the editors don't agree. I will let Mr. Wetzel or some other fan take up the battle. I did this for fun, not to make a whole night out of debating just to get it posted.--JMSWDLY 23:52, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Hello. This is Jerome Wetzel, the author in question. I was informed a short time ago by one of my fans, who goes by the name Stewart08 on wikipedia, that there was a debate going on. I did just create an account to speak, because I didn't have one. I would like to personally apologize for any disruption this has caused to your web site. Although I did not have an account until today, I use Wikipedia often. While I am flattered that fans of mine want to take up my cause, I have to admit that there aren't that many of them anyway, and the multiple names was probably an attempt by them to help me out. I have been promoting my book for the past year, and have had a hard time of it, though comments from readers have been extremely positive. I am sure that these people only wished to help me in this task. I agree that I am not noteworthy enough to have my own Wikipedia entry, although it would be an honor if someday that did happen. Anyone who is discussing an entry for me on my behalf, please desist and let these fine people go about their jobs. If you are trying to get the post deleted, I apologize again. I hope that this comment stops the fan postings and that you may go about your nights. Thanks you. --JeromeWetzel 23:59, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
