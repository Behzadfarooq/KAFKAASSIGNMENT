<li><b>Keep.</b> The previous two writers raise valid points, which will probably win the discussion, but I'll speak for the opposing side. I was a child once, and I <i>know</i> that some of these songs, most especially <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Song_That_Never_Ends_8aaa.html" title="The Song That Never Ends">The Song That Never Ends</a>, are infinite loops or unbounded. The fact that there are many of these shows it's a common cultural trend, so a list (or category?) may be appropriate. I'm not sure how to counter the OR problem: how do I find a source for the fact that I used to sing those songs in fourth grade riding with my friends on the bus? <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 01:51, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Published books of children's songs would probably be a good place to start. You need some way to verify notability, however, I'd argue that the same song appearing in several (5+?) books by different authors and publishers would probably be a fair indicator of notability. Nonetheless, such research should be added to the main articles themselves: if the underlying concept of a list is not notable, the list should not be kept. (In other words, "List of cities with green fire hydrants" is not notable if green fire hydrants are not themselves notable.) - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 02:01, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If kept, the article would benefit from a tighter definition of "unboundedly long." There is a definite difference between neverending songs like...well, like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Song_That_Never_Ends_8aaa.html" title="The Song That Never Ends">The Song That Never Ends</a> which really doesn't end, and a rock song with an improvised jam at the end that fades away into silence. Including the second group invites abuse. I'm also thinking there might be a less awkward title. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoyous%21_8a6f.html" title="User:Joyous!">Joyous!</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/y/User_talk%7EJoyous%21_ed0e.html" title="User talk:Joyous!">Talk</a> 03:00, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This list lumps a bunch of different concepts under the "unbounded" label: songs like "The Song That Never Ends" that "never end" until the singers get bored; songs like "Row Row Row Your Boat" which are just really short and are usually repeated over and over when sung; songs like "Down By The Bay" which usually go on for a while with different ad hoc variations for each verse; and songs like "BINGO" which <i>do</i> have a definite end but are just repetitive childrens songs. It doesn't form a coherent concept at all. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 03:24, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, this seems like a perfectly valid list. However, "unboundedly long" should be defined such that it doesn't include songs which are sung repeatedly in succession and songs which are just long, but still having a bound. And, of course, we need sources. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 04:09, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Also, <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">User:Chardish</a> makes a good point that "List of songs of length <i>N</i> is pointless for any <i>N</i>".

<li><b>Delete</b> How is this significant? I disagree that not having a discernable end somehow makes this an exceptional length. I think you'd all find that there are very few songs with track times of 10:24. Shall I start that list? And could not any song conceivably go on this list? For example: "Row Row Row Your Boat" is actually a very short song. It is sometimes arranged as a round or a medley and could conceivably be arranged to go on infinitely, but, so could <i>any</i> song if you actually wanted it to do so. For a random example: "<a href="../../../n/o/t/Not_Ready_to_Make_Nice_dafa.html" title="Not Ready to Make Nice">Not Ready to Make Nice</a>" begins and ends with the same lines. One could easily make the end the beginning and sing the song on loop. Would such a mix merit inclusion on this list? GassyGuy 04:55, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Clearly the reasons for the songs nature is relevant, and maybe this should be accompanied by an article, illustrating the reasons (for example "Ivan's in the Garden picking Cabbages" was being sung by a number of Russian soldiers in WWI as they fought, using their rifles as clubs, having run out of bullets), many are traditional or humerous sones, some are work songs, or might pertain to military cadence. And the list does need continuous maintenance, to clearly classify the nature of the songs, and possibly a link to unbounded chants, monologues, dialogues and stories. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>, 20:14 <a href="../../../1/9/_/19_February_4ff2.html" title="19 February">19 February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> (GMT).</li>

<li><b>Update</b>. I've read the discussion, and I've decided to do the following.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>I will move the article (pending admin approval) to "List of repetitive songs". People <i>do</i> use "repetitive songs" (I can cite references on that), so it solves the problem with the title.</li>
<li>I will rewrite the introduction, again from references, as best I can.</li>
<li>I will delete items on the list that are not blue-linked to relevant articles. What does that accomplish? Very simple. It defers the problem of original research from the list article to the linked article. If you don't believe that "the song that never ends" is repetitive, go check its article. If you don't believe that article, slap an OR tag to that article. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 04:15, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have never seen anyone move a page during an AfD discussion, though I can't find anywhere in the AfD etiquette that says you shouldn't. Be warned that it may be interpreted as bad faith. You should probably wait for <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">consensus</a> to be reached before you make any sweeping changes to a page like a merge, move, or redirect. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 20:16, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I wasn't aware it was problematic. I was just being bold. I'm no longer active in this discussion, but I take no firm position on what the article title should be. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 05:38, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but the name has not received sufficient discussion, and should be done (or redone) as a Requested Move.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Unboundedness as a characteristic of songs is verifiable and interesting. Alternately, make it a category. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> 07:37, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
