<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - Do you guys have nothing better to do with your time than troll the Wiki looking to cause trouble? PoE is a very legit site and your crusade to pick on this team and others is disrespectfull. I would like to add that PoE is an organization that add added value to Dice and EA games. PoE has won countless awards and has been features multiple times in magazines such as PC Gamer.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Being an avid gamer and clan leader, i am always looking at games to keep my clan active and happy. PoE 2 has given us so much that it would be criminal to remove their page from wiki. The PoE 2 team have spent nearly a year making the MOD for no money, just the love of what they do and to see so many gamers enjoy their work. All this needs IMHO is some common sense to see this page causes no problems to the general public and is non offensive in any way. The team deserve this page to exist.Chef uk 22:28, 29 September 2006 (UTC) (<b>note to closer of AfD:</b> This account's only contributions are to this AfD)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>. This is an extremely popular mod. This would be akin to deleting the wiki articles for Counter Strike, Team Fortress, or Natural Selection. To me, this seems like a pointless vendetta grudge. I see a lot of stuff going on about vanity, software, and the like. Of course wikipedia style guide says that if you see something you don't like, you don't delete it, you make it better. Prose would be the exact word they use. In fact, the only reflection of vanity I see here is a pathetic "who can drop the most wikipedia jargon" penis measuring contest amongst the people recommending a delete vote. You may not like it, but what reeks of vanity is the bleating and chest-pounding of the users here. Add to that the borderline stalking of other users including the helpful tips as to what contributions they've made in a sad and transparent effort to somehow slander their position (and yes, I know that "<i><b>per</b></i>" (look, I can drop the jargon too!) what wikipedia is not, this isn't an experiment in democracy so their opinions may somehow count "less" in your eyes towards consensus) and you have what is sadly becoming endemic to Wikipedia: the hard nosed clique of "editors" who wear their barnstars like a crooked sherriff's badge and attempt to enforce their own mishmash ideas of what wikipedia should be, no questions or protests. The preceeding signed statement was made by <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 11:02, 30 September 2006 (UTC).

Just thought I'd remind you all of that. Cause I don't think you'll be offering up your accounts for speedy deletion. I'm sure deleting this article for a few minor violations instead of rewriting it is acceptable, but sacrificing your own accounts instead of improving your behaviour isn't. Think about that. You have the people here who want to keep this article, they've even asked you what needs to be done, and you ignore them instead of helping them. The copyright holder to the story text in question gives you permission, and you ignore it. Seriously. Think about that. If you're too lazy to improve the prose yourselves, why not tell the people here, <i>in the discussion, who want to keep the article,</i> what needs to be done to keep it, hmm? <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 11:15, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>AHEM</b>. Let's look at these, shall we?</p>
<dl>
<dd>WP:SOFTWARE: And I quote, "<i>The software package has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, user guides, television documentaries, and full-length magazine reviews 2 except for the following:<i>"</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore POE meets WP:SOFTWARE. WP:SOFTWARE is no longer a concern. POE has been written about in magazines. Therefore, notable for software. Any further statement involving its violation of WP:SOFTWARE will be met with a simple copy and paste of this paragraph.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>WP:RELIABLE SOURCES. This one is bullshit. You guys are obviously stacking the deck against POE. All of the problems with this article in fact stem from the fact that it does not cite its sources. You then extrapolate this into WP:S and WP:RS claiming that because it does not cite its sources, it therefore does not have reliable sources (a truism) and because WP:S requires that it be written about in those sources, you're attempting to chuck a WP:S violation in with it (another truism).</dd>
<dd>WP:VERIFIABILITY The only problem here is a lack of citations. Once the magazine articles are reproduced (I have seen them myself with POE featured in them) then this is no problem. The article is verifiable, it is just not <i>verified</i>. There is a difference.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So what do we see? We see that the only problem here is that the articles in question have not been linked. Instead, you guys use that to pile on multiple accusations and when the people who want to keep this article has to be done, you toss some abbreviated jargon down at them and say "find out for yourselves." You guys, especially <i>you</i>, Whispering, are terrible editors. You bite the newcomers (and please, fuck the whole single purpose account, we all got into wikipedia editing by finding an article on here we had an interest and knowledge in, these newcomers are working to save something they care about and rather than acting like meat puppets indefensibly defending something non-defensible, they are <i>COMING TO YOU AND ASKING FOR SPECIFICS THAT YOU WANT DONE</i>. Here's what's going to happen. If you want it changed, rather than the textual diarrhea that is the jargon you spew forth every time somebody asks you for specifics, respond with specifics. Because I can find no other reason <i>except</i> for bad faith to assume that in the 140 characters you have written in reply to this AfD, you haven't found the ability to, for example, write "If you would only link to the magazine articles that have written about POE, you would have satisfied all criteria." You know what's crazy? That's only 115 characters! You would have actually saved time by being helpful instead of being an obstructionist. Same goes for <i>all</i> the other editors here. When it is empirically verifiable that being helpful and not violating WP:Please Do Not Bite the Newcomers would have taken <i>less</i> effort than doing what you're doing, I can't help but assume bad faith on your part. And when I assume bad faith, I start going through edits finding every time it's ever been empirically verifiable that you have put more effort into obstructing something than helping, and therefore committing bad faith (and god knows what other breaches) and then I gotta kick it up to RfC. And I don't want to do that because the evidence I dragged out in an RfC was already responsible for an indefinite ban on a user, and I don't like getting people banned at all, for any reason, because I don't believe in it. But I do believe in giving bad faith violators a slap on the wrist. So. Please. Next time, take the time and effort to write out specifics because as we have seen without a shadow of a doubt, not only is it more helpful, not only does it take less effort, but it pisses less people off too, so we can only assume good faith. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 19:05, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Jeez, talk about more absolute empirical evidence of the bad faith of the deletionist editors. Took me literally five seconds of googling to find [<a href="http://www.pcaction.de/?article_id=496481" class="external text" title="http://www.pcaction.de/?article_id=496481" rel="nofollow">this</a>]. I'll think I'll post it on the main page and thereby remove all your objections since this SOURCE that is VERIFIABLY CITED fulfills WP:SOFTWARE. Enjoy making more bad faith harassments elsewhere. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 21:19, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Rallying all the fanboys to help defend this article won't do much good. PoE2 is a great mod but this article is terrible and doesn't provide much information about the mod itself. If you don't want this article to get deleted, please improve the quality of it. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUnicyclopedia_36c9.html" title="User:Unicyclopedia">Unicyclopedia</a> 06:01, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
