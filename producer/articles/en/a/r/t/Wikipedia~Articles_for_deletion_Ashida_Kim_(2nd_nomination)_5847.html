<p>I am renominating this page for deletion, asking editors to reconsider whether they kept it before partly based on the rudeness of the subject. The fact that he doesn't want the article is not enough reason to keep it.</p>
<p>Additionally, I should note that the article seems entirely and completely unverifiable. We say that he's a controversial martial artist, but is he? Does he even exist? Is there a newspaper article or any credible source? Those who are complaining against him, do they exist? Is there a newspaper article or any credible source?</p>
<p>What I see here is a fight from elsewhere which has spilled over into Wikipedia. None of the participants seem at all notable by any external measure. Flaming each other all over the web doesn't give us anything verifiable or notable by way of fact. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 17:00, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>No vote</b> as I am merely a facilitator in the relisting of this article.

<li>I completely agree that the rudeness of an article's subject should in no way be an argument for <i>or</i> against keeping the article. That said, I vote <b>keep</b>, for a number of reasons.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Jimbo, I am a little confused by your blanket assertion of "unverifiable". Are you claiming that we can know nothing at all about Ashida Kim? Yes, he is a fictitious Internet persona. But he has given his name to many, many things, and this has made him quite well-known; most of the facts on the page right now are verifiable. He has published books, for instance; I can probably look up the ISBN numbers. How is that not verifiable? I myself knew of Ashida Kim well before I had ever heard of Bullshido.</li>
<li>The article has <i>just</i> been through a VfD, which ended in a <b>keep</b> consensus by a rather large margin. I don't think it's a good idea to re-nominate it so soon, and--regardless of any other considerations--I would vote keep on principle, just based on this.</li>
<li>The same reason I gave in the original VfD. Ashida Kim is <i>very</i> notable in martial arts communities; not just Bullshido. Like it or not, he has made a name for himself, and he should have an article on Wikipedia. I agree that the article is not ideal, and needs a healthy injection of facts and NPOV. I do <i>not</i> consider that a valid reason for deleting it, however. Wikipedia is about improving imperfect articles, not deleting them. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 18:10, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>I see no real sense in which he has made a name for himself. If he's so notable in martial arts circles, where are the articles about him in mainstream martial arts magazines? Where are quotes from notable martial artists? Where is <b>anything</b> that can't be found on his own website?--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 21:06, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, O^O has already given a link to an interview with Ashida Kim in "Believer" magazine. Not sure how mainstream that is, and it's certainly not martial arts, but it's a lot more than nothing.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, here's an independent <a href="http://www.themartialist.com/pecom/mugei.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.themartialist.com/pecom/mugei.htm" rel="nofollow">review</a> of one of Ashida Kim's books. Quite apart from everything else, I'd say he's a notable author. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 21:44, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Let's refresh what just happened over the past few weeks. The <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashida_Kim_6a74.html" title="Ashida Kim">Ashida Kim</a> article goes up. Much screaming ensues. The article gets nominated for deletion, and is kept. In a fit of pique, Ashida Kim threatens Jimbo, and posts Jimbo's name, home address, and other personal details on his message board. And then, Jimbo comes along one week after the decision to keep is made, and nominates it for deletion again? Jimbo, I'm absolutely certain that you didn't do this because of Kim's threats, but honestly, this was the worst possible timing <b>imaginable</b>. Can you imagine what it would look like if we ended up deleting the article now? For the next six months, every POV warrior with an axe to grind would post your personal details in the hope of getting you to knuckle under and intercede on their behalf. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 18:10, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sympathetic to what you're saying, but frankly, threats to me are completely irrelevant to keeping or deleting the article. If we keep it because I'm mad at him and concerned that other POV warriors will stoop to his dishonorable tactics, we're not being NPOV. All I ask is that we not do the opposite, either. Let's consider the evidence: is he notable? Do we have anything to say about him that doesn't come from his own silly website or that of 'bullshido' or a random flamewar?--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 21:06, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I quite agree, and I was myself dismayed at the number of votes that essentially boiled down to "keep because we'll never give in!" in the last AfD. But while Ashida Kim is not notable as a martial artist (perhaps the reason why he's not in any martial arts magazines), he certainly is notable as a crackpot, a neo-ninja, and a fraud (excuse the POV, please). I don't know how much verifiable information there is on him; I don't frequesnt Bullshido, and I'm not an expert on Ashida Kim at all. But the man has written, what, 16 books? Books that received wide circulation, and have had independent reviews written. That <b>alone</b> would, I think, be a strong argument for keeping the article.</dd>
<dd>I don't know what can be verified, and what can't. I'm quite ready to help rewrite the entire article as needed; Ashida Kim's a very colourful personality, and perhaps the flashy flamewars have skewed the article's focus. But I am convinced that <b>he deserves an article</b>, as a known author of ninja books, if nothing else. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 21:44, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do we have a meaningful choice? The only question can be whether the article is encyclopedic or not, <i>not</i> whether it would lead to a flamewar or not.</dd>
<dd>Let me put it this way: would <i>you</i> be reconciled to the knowledge that Wikipedia's content depends on how tenaciously opponents of certain articles fight to have that content excised? Why haven't we deleted <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> yet? Is it just that the Church of Scientology hasn't made enough threats yet? Should we tell them that, because I'm sure they could do better than Ashida Kim, if they wanted. This is a tiny battle and an unimportant article, but the principle is just as serious.</dd>
<dd>I simply <b>cannot</b> acknowledge "would lead to flamewar" as any kind of justification for or against an article's existence. <b>Yes</b>, I am reconciled to the fact that this will lead to animosity. I will do what I can to be a part of the solution, and not the problem. I will bend over backwards to accommodate Ashida Kim's input, as far as NPOV allows. I will happily swallow insults from him if it will lead to less turmoil and more consensus. <i>But I will not allow him to compromise one letter of this, or any other, article with petty threats and flamewars.</i> And I fervently hope that I am not speaking only for myself. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 20:43, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>To those who would vote delete, I say: Jimmy Wales makes a good case for moving on from the current way of writing about Ashida Kim, but a reference or two in an appropriate article on the broader subject, with <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashida_Kim_6a74.html" title="Ashida Kim">Ashida Kim</a> as a redirect, would probably be appropriate, and as a compromise may help us to forge a consensus with those whose instincts are to not delete. The redirect could be protected from vandalism, and attempt to reintroduce the flame war on other articles could be met by further protected redirects. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 20:14, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

That pretty much limits us to reporting on his publishing career and his dispute with Bullshido - but on the dispute itself, not its content (since we haven't yet had 3rd party verifiable content provided). The only redeemable feature I can think of for such an article in the long run is that it may help someone using Wikipedia to investigate martial arts have more information in making a martial art instruction-related decision. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a> 20:21, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

Bullshido's investigation into this individual was done simply to determine the facts involved, and the facts can easily be verified by anyone wishing to check the sources. I understood Wikipedia to be a repository for information, so I'm confused as to why it would seek to censor information simply because it is controversial.

Anyone, even new or anonymous editors can join the discussion. It's more correct to say that points of view expressed without supporting rational are likely to be given less weight by the closing admin if they are from new or unknown editors. Pedantic?

I find it odd that many who are not a part of this community seem to be expressing a contrary opinion without much justification for doing so.

<li>"Ashida Kim" has been a topic of discussion and controversy on the internet since at least 1991. Definately not notable yet</li>
<li>He's a crackpot claiming to have mystical powers. Fine - but the question is here can he really claim the amount of notariety we have for our threshold? The article does not seem to back this up with references, other than a link <a href="http://www.bullshido.net/modules.php?name=Reviews&amp;file=viewreview&amp;id=160" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bullshido.net/modules.php?name=Reviews&amp;file=viewreview&amp;id=160" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> - which means that basically he notariety consists of being debunked by bullshido.net which in and of itself does not merit notability.</li>
<li>As O^O mentions, he has mentions in "The Believer" and a daily austrialian newspaper/periodical (speaking of which, was it an article about him in the newspaper/periodical?) . This is definately the point that might merit his inclusion. However, it is no "slam dunk", and one would think that if he really has attained such notariety he would a lot more than this - so I'd argue that while he might need a mention somewhere, he doesn't merit his own article (maybe in "List of martial arts crackpots"&#160;:)).</li>

<dd>Well, that's why we're arguing about whether they're <i>notable</i> books or not. They have had significant circulation; why would you say they are not notable? Arguments against, so far, were "if they really were truly notable they'd already have articles here", "the books here are very similar in verifiability to [a DVD film that was deleted]", and "at least one of the books wasn't even a book" (based, I assume, on its binding). I just don't find any of those three arguments very convincing. The argument for is simply that the books have achieved considerable circulation, which, to me, seems enough.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I respect Jimbo, but don't necessarily agree 100% with him. We should apply the same criteria to Ashida Kim as anyone else, and the published books, the wealth of Internet interest and opinion about this guy, etc., clearly establish him as notable and a public figure. I don't even think it's a close call. And, this was all hashed out recently in an AfD, and it's not like that AfD didn't bring out all the arguments pro and con, so I can't see bringing it up again mere days/weeks later. If there are POV problems with the article, they can &amp; should be fixed in the time-honored manner. I hate to say it, but this new AfD seems more based on Wikipedia politics than on actual merit of the article's existence.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Just because the truth seems to be particularly unfavorable towards Mr. "Kim" doesn't mean we should delete the article because he whines about it. If he can contest any of the article's veracity and back up his claims with proof then let him do so. Plus, I think it would set a terrible precedent for Wikipedia to delete an article under a hailstorm of criticism. Additionally, he does own his own business and is proven to be the author of many books and at the very least appears on his website&#160;; keep in mind that we have articles for Shmorky, <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowtax.html" title="Lowtax">Lowtax</a>, Fragmaster and other internet personalities as well. <a href="../../../w/e/l/User%7EWellsLaRivi%C3%A8re_dec4.html" title="User:WellsLaRivière">WellsLaRivière</a> 23:07, 5 October 2005</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Voted on negative precedent potential. First, to take away possibly valuable information regarding internet personalities who are significant to large circles (<a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowtax.html" title="Lowtax">Lowtax</a>, Shmorky, Fragmaster etc. Second, to allow for complaints from the subjects of fact-based criticism to destroy articles. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshwinr_347a.html" title="User:Ashwinr">Ashwinr</a></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I don't see any reason to remove this article. He's pretty definitively a personality of sufficient note to have an article and if nothing else the article should stay on the basis of truth. Wikipedia keeps to NPOV to show the unbiased truth, and if the unbiased truth is that somebody is a liar who steals people's money via confidence games, then removing a page showing evidence of his fraudulent claims would be de facto support. --Talain 00:30, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't really like going against our Glorious Leader on this, but the subject <i>does</i> seem to have achieved a degree of notability -- in a fairly specialized community, granted, but that is no bar to inclusion. His books (whether self-published or not; the ownership of the publishing company hasn't really been established here) are, by statement of several editors, available widely in both online and "real-world" book stores (I'll take their word for it; I haven't gone looking for them myself).

<li><b>No vote, and Objection</b>. This is a completely improper and specious re-listing for AfD. If Jimbo wishes to delete this article, he should simply do so as a part of his prerogative. Our time is being wasted with a 2nd AfD following so closely on the heels of another where there was overwhelming consensus to keep. Like many others above, I am also concerned by the <b>appearance</b> of Jimbo's actions here.

You can't have an encyclopedia that anyone can edit and then suggest that every fact needs to be recorded in a peer-reviewed journal edited by Nobel prize winners. The notability of Ashida Kim simply isn't in question: he gets 18,800 google hits and he is the author of numerous books on the martial arts. If he wasn't a Wikipedia trouble-maker, his <b>verifiability</b> would never be in question, but because he starts blanking his own article and attacking user pages, suddenly we need to prove his very existence with the most unreasonable of standards for the kind of subject he is. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func">Func</a>( <a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func">t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Func_dbc4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Func">c</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Func_6e40.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Func">@</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;user=Func" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;user=Func" rel="nofollow">&#160;</a>) 14:37, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>While I understand the intent and respect the effort it must have taken, I'd like to state <i>again</i> that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_democracy" title="WP:NOT">this is not a vote</a>.<br />

<dd>In this case, I took 'vote' in its common WikiVernaculear term to mean "the expression of an opinion in a consensus-seeking context." I think this was a fairly light breach of strict termonological correctness but nothing really heinous. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 01:28, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>My concern is that this is reductionist. This makes User:Ring Foo's "Delete, crap" count exatcly the same as User:Fing Roo's "Keep, as per seven published works, here are the ISBN's...". Or maybe I should just get off my high horse and kill the bug up my bum, eh? ^_^<br />

<li>I find that a reasonable concern, yeah, and there's no doubt it's not a good word, but I've learned to live with it just because it's so immediately what comes to mind. Anybody who's been here for very long has heard this very discussion about nine trillion times anyway.&#160;:P <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 01:43, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Meh. Let's not argue about the nomenclature, that never gets anyone anywhere. Substitute "discussing" for "voting" in my original message, above; it changes nothing.</li>
<li>This <b>is</b> reductionist; I collated some stats that I think may be useful. I'd certainly advise anyone against only looking at the lists, and ignoring the debate. Again, I just provided data. If the admin closing this debate finds any of this data useful, great! If not, he or she is free to ignore it. But for instance, if the admin sees an argument from, say, me, and wants to know how much experience I have with Wikipedia, I've made the information easier to find. That's really all I wanted to do.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 22:43, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>[Regarding Marksell incorrectly being given 663 edits] Actually <b>2100+</b> edits. If mine is wrong I don't know about the others; don't mean to disparage the work but I think this is a bad idea.</p>

<li>Mine was fine, maybe a one off? --<a href="../../../j/i/f/User%7EJiFish_180b.html" title="User:JiFish">JiFish</a>(<a href="../../../j/i/f/User_talk%7EJiFish_ceec.html" title="User talk:JiFish">Talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JiFish_b9a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JiFish">Contrib</a>) 00:24, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As long as the vote counts for relatively new users are correct, it doesn't matter. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:41, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wha?! If you look at yours and find it wrong you naturally distrust the others. Of course it matters. I'd love to say I'm going to check all of these myself but it's late on my end so I have to assume it was done properly. It wasn't done properly on mine so I can't assume that!</li>
<li>In general what's the implication: that 10 000 matters more than 1000? One hundred matters more than one but two orders of magnitude beyond that I think it irrelevant. List the users who have under a dozen, particularly those who have <i>only</i> voted on this (and discount them when keeping/deleting) and save yourself the rest of work . <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 00:58, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My apologies for the error; it's been fixed. I accidentally used the "distinct pages edited" count for you instead of the "total edits" stat. I double-checked everyone, and found that I made the same mistake for Tony Sidaway and Nickptar; both are now fixed. Everyone else seems fine, and I can guarantee the correctness of the numbers to +/- 5%, at worst.&#160;:)</li>
<li>As to its implication: like I said above, I am not trying to imply anything. I listed what I believed to be pertinent stats. What to infer (if anything) from these stats is up to the admin(s). --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 22:37, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
