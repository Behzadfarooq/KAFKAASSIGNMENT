<li><b>Comment</b>. <strike>Doc Glasgow</strike>Dpbsmith's (<i>my bad</i>) reasoning above is a <i>much</i> better argument than the one used by the nominator of this VfD, though still with some holes in it (i.e. the argument is based largely on specific mistakes in the content, even though quality of subject matter, not content, is the only relevant issue here; if we have to redo the list for the ground up, it's still easier not to delete the page history). And I'm afraid I still can't support these VfDs until I get some definite assurance that you guys are going to delete <b>all</b> of the numerous lists like this one on Wikipedia. I'm a thousand times more concerned with consistency than with whether any specific list stays or goes, so such specific VfDs, leaving out <i>so many</i> others, worry me deeply—what we <i>don't</i> want is a patchwork of random lists that noone's gotten around to yet while near-identical lists are long gone! I'd have probably been neutral (or even supportive) if this VfD had nominated <i>every</i> religious list simultaneously, since that would have been a much more structured way to handle this, and would have been a much more honest way to show what's really being nominated for deletion here. So, I will continue to vote "keep" until the following lists are nominated for deletion or until it's absolutely certain that they will be (or if there are specific reasons why anyone thinks any of the following lists <i>shouldn't</i> be deleted, explain the distinction between them and the ones that are VfDed currently): <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslims_773b.html" title="List of

This sort of thing is <b>exactly</b> why I'm opposing this VfD: it's absurd to subdivide this vote into hundreds of different VfDs for every article when it's obvious that some broad policy decision is under dispute, not any one article's validity as a list. The only <b>possible</b> result of running things so inefficiently will be that since completely different groups of people will vote on each list, whether any one list is deleted or not will be more or less random!

<dd>Firstly, the argument was not mine but that of <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> (although I agree with him). Secondly, you argument does not hold up. some of the articles you cite should be deleted IMO, but not all. The number of Zoroastrians or fellows of the Royal Society with a WP article is, I would think, managable for a list, and most of the entries will be at easier possible to verify. Further, as being in one of those categories of people and being notable enough for WP is somewhat rare, the list has some interest. Probably 10-20% (or perhaps more) of Wiki-bios will be somehow associated with R.Catholicism (lapsed, or by bith, or profession) - who will check them all?. The work of verifying this waaay outways any possible utility. List are complex, and although some guidelines have been developed - there is really no escaping a case-by-case examination. Anyway, the argument <i>keep this - or you'd have to delete all of this</i> doesn't really impress me, this article should stand (or preferably) fall on its own merits. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/Doc.html" title="Doc">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 19:04, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>My argument is not "keep this - or you'd have to delete all of this", it's "either keep this or delete all of this"; I'm not <i>threatening</i> you with a huge workload, I'm trying to clarify and figure out what you guys are <i>suggesting</i> we delete, and what you <i>aren't</i> suggesting we delete. There seems to be far too little perspective and broad observation of Wikipedia's many lists for such a significant, enormous-in-scale deletion drive. If this article is to be deleted because of qualities X, Y, and Z it has, then every other article that has qualities X, Y, and Z should also be deleted (hence my listing a few of them above), unless you can identify some other definite quality that would change such a list from "must be deleted" to "OK, let's keep it". While several Jewish and Roman Catholic lists are now up for VfD, not a single Muslim or Hindu one that I've seen is; are Islam and Hinduism, the two second-largest religions in the world, "unusual" enough that a list of their practitioners is A-OK? Where do you draw the line between when a religion is so common as to be assumed, and when being a member of a religion is unusual enough to merit a list? My problem with the argument "there are too many Roman Catholics to have a list of the most noteworthy Roman Catholics!" is that this whole affair reeks of cultural bias; because of the specific areas most native English-speakers live in, we're used to taking certain religious beliefs for granted, and used to considering other religions "exotic" or "noteworthy" whenever someone believes in them, even though in other parts of the world the opposite situation exists, and it's a <i>Roman Catholic</i> that would be considered highly noteworthy and a <i>Muslim</i> that would be considered so common as to be a meaninglessly large list. I don't see any rhyme or reason in this; why should one significant religion not merit a list of its practitioners, and another significant religion merit such a list? The <i>only</i> difference between the two lists "List of Roman Catholics" and "List of Sikhs" is that one is longer than the other, and <i>length</i> is not a valid reason for deletion! So please explain this a bit better to me; I'm willing to change my vote as soon as anyone provides a consistent explanation, rationale and plan for what lists will and won't be eliminated as a part of this deletion campaign. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:27, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Consistency, foolish, minds, little, hobgoblin of: see <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson_1ca0.html" title="Ralph Waldo Emerson">Emerson, Ralph Waldo</a>, also <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. Wikipedia is inherently inconsistent, particularly in borderline areas; it comes with the territory.

<dd>Please leave out the irrelevant indirect personal attacks right now; I'm trying to have a conversation with you, not with Ralph Waldo Emerson. I oppose arbitrary and meaningless attempts to make articles more consistent with one another when doing so does not benefit the specific articles in question, just as you presumably do; I encourage new experiments with Wikipedia article layout and style, which sometimes provide fruitful and effective results (though failed experiments are certainly fair ground for reversion). But this is not an issue of trivial consistencies, this is an issue of completely arbitrary, almost to the point of profound religious bias, attempts to delete articles without any conception of what to do about all the other articles of an exactly identical nature. Article <i>content</i> may not have to be consistent, but we most certainly should be consistent about what types of articles and lists are to be permitted on Wikipedia!! A large-scale, centralized vote for deletion seems quite clearly to be merited if there's strong support for deleting such a massive number of lists, not a slow, week-after-week or even month-after-month spamming of the VfD page with countless articles that are being argued for and against for the <b>exact same reasons</b>. Since article <i>content</i> is largely irrelevant in determining whether to delete a specific article topic, and only the subject matter is directly relevant, there is absolutely no benefit to stretching out and subdividing a single vote into hundreds of individual, totally unconnected votes. And there are many disadvantages. Again, until I get the rationale and clear plan that I have requested several times now for this elaborate VfD campaign, I will continue to fight for some actual sanity to be injected into this process. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 20:53, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Wow. Someone who accused someone else of having a weak argument, who turns around 5 minutes later and uses the two weakest, most self-contradictory (and clearly misinterpreted in their above usage) arguments in the history of Wikipedia: "Don't be consistent!" and "Don't follow any rules!" Any two arguments that can be used to counter <i>every reasonable, helpful, and good course of action in the history of Wikipedia</i> are clearly of severely limited value, especially when there is a total failure to explain <i>why</i> a certain rule must be broken and <i>why</i> being consistent would be harmful rather than helpful in this specific case. The point of those two maxims is not to say "never be consistent" or "never follow rules" (if you think Wikipedia lacks any rules or consistency whatsoever, you haven't visited even a single article yet), but to let people who see a <i>harmful</i> attempt to over-fixate on consistency and a <i>harmful</i> misuse or overuse of a rule to further justify his reasoned, explained-out objection to this error. Just using a link and a quote without the required accompanying reasoning is totally ineffective because it's an argument that could be used against almost <i>any</i> conceivable course of action: including against itself (why is consistency <i>consistently</i> foolish? why should I follow a rule that says to <i>ignore all rules</i>?). You might as well just use the classic catch-all pseudoargument and keep things simple: "Because I said so." No need to feign philosophical superiority or rules-adherence just to get that simple nonpoint across. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 21:01, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I have put <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_agnostics.html" title="List of agnostics">List of agnostics</a> on delete page. It's not showng up yet, but I did. I admit in part that was churlish and one of the rare times I did something nearing bad faith, but to be honest the reasoning I can give is about identical to this one being listed. Many estimates indicate that 100 million to 1 billion people are agnostic so it could have the "too big" issue. Also the verification issue. Although my intent was annoyance it ultimately fits the reasons this was done. (It's only bad faith because I feel the reasoning given here is invalid and so accepting it anyway is de facto invalid. It's also even a bit suspicious as Hinduism or Islam are about as large as Catholicism while List of neo-conservatives is far less verifiable.)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>I'm glad you nominated that article because it's indeed a high-quality, well-described list that could be very useful but has the exact same problem as the Roman Catholic lists. In fact, if anything it's <b>worse</b> than the super-long lists of Christians, because the only reason that it's shorter is because less work has been put into looking for and adding new entries (or it's just more difficult to do so; "agnosticism" has dozens of distinct meanings)! Do keep an eye out for <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, though, considering that you yourself seem to disagree with the VfD. I think we need to stop rushing to delete everything immediately and actually have a calm, rational discussion on exactly what lists we do and don't plan to delete. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 23:20, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>As for "its own merits" it is actually possible to fix things with a little work. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Catholic_artists_1130.html" title="List of Catholic artists">List of Catholic artists</a> article was, I agree, terrible when I saw it on deletion. Now it's almost respectable, or so I like to think. At present this article just links to lists of Catholics. So if it were renamed "List of Lists of Roman Catholics" it becomes more manageable. You just fix the individual lists. I think this is a case where deletion is being used when clean-up would make more sense.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>Subset of the List of Christians sounds good by me. Also maybe the surviving Catholic lists can just all be placed in the "Category: Lists of Christians"--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 23:53, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Lists of Roman Catholics" would be 80% acceptable. "Famous Roman Catholics" or "Notable Roman Catholics" would be <b>0% acceptable.</b> Wikipedia Lists and Categories <i>never</i> include "famous" or "notable" or "noteworthy" or "important", because (1) they're value judgments, (2) they're totally unnecessary because all Wikipedia lists, (3) they're cumbersome and almost <i>every</i> list and category on all of Wikipedia would need. Just think about it. We'd have to replace "1835 deaths" with "noteworthy 1835 deaths". How many hundreds of thousands of pages do you think we'd have to rename to include "famous" or "notable" everywhere it implied? Anyway, the only reason I gave Lists of Roman Catholics a "80% acceptable" is because I don't think there are enough such lists to merit a distinct category; those lists would work just as well within <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_Christians_7a14.html" title="Category:Lists of Christians">Category:Lists of Christians</a> itself.

<dd>I'm not strong on it. Even if it were a Category I think it should be as a sub-category of <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_Christians_7a14.html" title="Category:Lists of Christians">Category:Lists of Christians</a>. This list, or the lists it contains, being in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_Christians_7a14.html" title="Category:Lists of Christians">Category:Lists of Christians</a> is also okay. Naming Categories "Famous XYZ" strikes me as very silly and unworkable though.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<p>I bumped into a list of such but cannot find it again. I am torn about this decision here , thinking that by allowing faith based info into the open , at least it becomes visible , and trackable . I as editor have been forced to claim that at least one very active and extremely clever editor here is a vatican agent. Of course this honest opinion rather conflicts with good faith principles , with obvious result (Arbcom) . I am on record as warning Jimbo that good RC's are under order to subvert the WP , which he kinda <i>has</i> to ignore(I told him <i>there had to be snag</i> with his WP concept) . So , I really don't know what is the best in this case or in the above I'm locating . It is rather sad that the church should have need to fear facts that the WP system filters , and rather a shock to our supposedly secular modern world , to think that by means of WP email , that such subversion can prosper . <a href="../../../e/f/f/User%7EEffK_b5e6.html" title="User:EffK">EffK</a> 09:13, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>And anyway religion may not effect the voters that much. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">User:Silence</a> has often voted in favor of either keeping Catholic related lists or merging them into Christian lists rather than deletion.
