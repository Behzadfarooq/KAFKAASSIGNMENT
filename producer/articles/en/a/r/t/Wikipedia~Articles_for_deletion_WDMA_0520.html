<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Thirded. I have been a member of Something Awful for years and I can personally confirm that there was never any such thing as WDMA, or for that matter, BTB. This entire article is unencyclopedic science fiction. <a href="../../../a/f/e/User%7EAfed_b194.html" title="User:Afed">Afed</a> 06:58, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Absolutely. WDMA has never existed, and absolutely no one has ever been banned from SA for mentioning its existence, or asking where da movies atted. 24.168.5.223 07:56, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&#160;:<b>1</b>. I agree that this is just too incredibly obscure to be worth mentioning (and I am a person who has pretty generous limits on what I consider to be incredibly obscure). The fact that a torrent tracker associated in some way with a semi-private web-based forum may have existed is far from sufficient to warrant entry in the Wikipedia. Just because something existed does not mean it's worth entering, in the same way that just because down the street on the corner there is a little ghetto-mart run by a Pakistani guy who sells beer and cigarettes does not mean that, defacto, he is a key and important part of my local neighborhood which is a subset of my community which is a subset of my part of town which is a subset of the city I live in, and should thus carefully be logged and documented. There are literally thousands of private trackers in existence right now, many with associated forums (and vice versa). Those that represent something more than just the fact that they exist are those which could be considered in an article related to the general phenomena.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>2</b>. Above is a comment or two from what I suspect are some SA forum members who are jokingly happy to see their tracker not mentioned or publicised. This brings up the points mentioned elsewhere that things of this nature can be notoriously difficult to verify. Knowing the SA memebrs, I would find it equally possible that they would get a kick out of creating a false history of the site for fun (I don't mean this insultingly: its the tendancy to do things like this that makes their site so much fun to read). So, all in all, its a vague thing compounded by vagueness on this count.</dd>
<dd><b>3</b>. On the other hand, we need to be reasonable when it comes to documenting web-based communities and things that arise from them. Simply put, huge and widespread things can happen on the web for which, a year later, little concrete information remains. The very ephemeral nature of data these days (particularly on things which are invisible to google caches and such) on the web means we have to not allow ourselves to fall into the trap of saying, in essance, "because you can't clearly and easily show information about something with sixty thousand people experienced but didn't leave too much of a trail about, it means it didn't happen."</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. RFD: The only reason why people are voting for deletion is because none of the data has been verified. Ergo, all that needs to be proven is the existence of the site and the previous existence of File Forums on the Something Awful Forums. The data is verifiable in several different ways: one, the existence of the WDMA site and the drama that happened that brought it down; two, Something Awful owner Richard "Lowtax" Kyanka's public acknowledgement of the existence of the file forums' previous existence to an audience at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana; three, screencaps of WDMA are readily available; and four, screencaps of the old Something Awful forums which used WDMA as a tracker are readily available.</li>

<dd>Incorrect. I am voting for deletion for other reasons as well (see my comments above). I think the topic in general is worth a brief mention on the SA page if the author wishes, but do not believe it is worthy of it's own stand alone entry.<a href="../../../d/x/c/User%7EDxco_460c.html" title="User:Dxco">Dxco</a> 01:16, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The "WDMA is a hoax/never existed" tinfoil bandwagon of anons (and some registered users) is some strange attempt to keep WDMA a "secret". Its existance was pretty tightly guarded (as well as one can do such things on the Internet) while it existed. As far as I know, it hasn't been resurrected, so I can only presume that the reason people are posting false information about it here is simply to troll wikipedians who are not familiar with the SA Forums / WDMA. I know I'm not the first to point this out, but I figure a signed comment from a registered user with an edit history will lend some credibility to the statement. As far as keep/delete, I'm ambivalent - WDMA was a big deal to the SA Forums, but precisely because of its secrecy it was never well-known or important to the Internet at large. I'd say its main claim to notability is keeping such a large-volume torrent site under the radar of the authorities for so long, but whether or not that's enough for Wikipedia is for others to decide. -- <a href="../../../t/y/l/User%7ETyler_McHenry_2cd2.html" title="User:Tyler McHenry">Tyler</a> 08:45, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
