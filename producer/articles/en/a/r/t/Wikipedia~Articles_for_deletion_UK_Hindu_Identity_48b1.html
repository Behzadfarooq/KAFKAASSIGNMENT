<dd><b>Comment</b>: This may be a controversial and unpleasant subject. But that should not mean it should not be addressed in Wikipedia. I believe that it is a significant issue. I request you to read the references before making a decision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One would think that Indians and Pakistanis/Bangladeshis, who once shared a common history, and are from a region that was once just one country, would be very similar. However the Indians and Pakistanis/Bangladeshis in UK have developed into very distinct communities, with different lifestyles and outlooks.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The data on employment and education is from UK government sources. These are very singificant measures. I am sorry, there is no gentler way to do the comparision. They do bring out the differences using concrete numbers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Those of you who have followed the news from UK, and the riots involving the "Asian" youth may have noted that that the Hindu Indians were not among the rioting youth, but rather on the other side. In one case the "Asians" burned the cars of the Hindus. I request you to please do read the articles on the riots in UK, before judging the article to be "pov".</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Should Indians in UK continue calling themselves "Asian"? Many don't think so. They resent not having a distinct identity. They were not among the "Asian" rioter. They have nothing to do with the "Londonistan". The article addresses this issue.

<p><b>Comment on the deletion proposal</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Anirvan, in his proposal for deletion writes: <i>"The article also makes sweeping one-sided POV arguments"</i>. He also stated at <a href="../../../u/k/_/Talk%7EUK_Hindu_Identity_09b3.html" title="Talk:UK Hindu Identity">Talk:UK Hindu Identity</a> <i>"The article can be summarized in a line: "British Hindus are smart, wealthy, and good-looking, and hate being associated with evil Pakistani and Bangladeshi riot-causing terrorist-loving Muslims." It's racist, essentializing, full of unlabeled POV, and consists almost entirely of original research."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I take strong exception to this. I did not write anything about Hindus being good-looking. As for the race, the Muslims of the subcontinent belong to the same race as Indians; in most cases they have risen from the same castes and tribes as Hindus.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think I need to defend what the UK government studies directly say about education and unemployment. However let me mention about two things that many apparently may find offending and POV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Involvement in "Asian riots"</i>: Let me say this again, and you can check it yourself by looking at reports in British publications. Yes, it is absolutely true that in recent riots <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldham_Riots_d844.html" title="Oldham Riots">Oldham Riots</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradford_Riot_afb2.html" title="Bradford Riot">Bradford Riot</a> and the like, the Asians involved in the violence were Pakistani/Bangladeshi, and not Indian. In the Bradfort Riot, the "Asian youths" burned cars belonging to Hindus and whites, and a Hindu's Chemist shop was looted by "Asian youths" <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/racism/Story/0,,474369,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/racism/Story/0,,474369,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>About the militancy</i>: It should be acknowledged that many among the Pakistanis/Bangladeshi communities in UK have tolerated Islamic militancy. It is no accident (and it is not a secret) that a number of notable participants and supporters of militancy, with activities spanning countries outside UK (including India and Pakistan), have come from the UK Pakistanis/Bangladeshi community. Even now, about 15% of them consider the underground bombers to be "martyers". I am sorry to bring this out, but it makes them and UK Indians very, very different. If it is not permissible to mention that on Wikipedia, then Wikipedia is not what I, and many others think it is; and I, and many others, should not be wasting their time on Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../i/s/k/User%7EISKapoor_fb2c.html" title="User:ISKapoor">ISKapoor</a> 05:43, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There are problems with this article - mostly because of the fact that it is not NPOV. For example, it generalises by using statistics about British Indians and applying them to Hindus only. True, Indians do far better than other South Asians in the United Kingdom when it comes to money and education, but Indians are not a homogeneous group. Indians comprise of roughly 45% Hindus, 35% Sikhs and 15% Muslim. The statistics for Indians cannot be generalised to apply to Hindus alone.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, the article touches on an important (and a very none-PC point) that is felt by Indians. Indians dislike the moniker "Asian" because the largely inconspicuous Hindu and Sikh groups do not wish to be tarred with the same brush that Muslims have been tarred with. It's a way for Hindus and Sikhs to get away from the "everyone that's Asian is a terrorist supporter" opinion held by some. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;" lang="pa" xml:lang="pa">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 23:01, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sukh, yes you are correct, the Sikhs form a large section of the Indians in UK. That needs to be taken into account. You are right about one of points being very non-PC.
