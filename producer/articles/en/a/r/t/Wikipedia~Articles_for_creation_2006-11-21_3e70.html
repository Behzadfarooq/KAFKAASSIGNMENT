<p>"Man may have descended from apes, but both men and most apes descended from a sort of monkey."</p>
<p>That's the guess of Doctor Elwyn L. Simons, a Yale paleontologist. He says the remains of the creature were found near Cairo, Egypt. It lived about 33 million years ago and its called "propliopithicus".</p>
<p>This article opens up a discussion. Is there any updated information concerning this finding? Where did the creature come from - Africa? Does that place the birth of mankind in the same geologic area? Did the major civilizations of Atlantis, Egypt, Greece and India stem from this creature? Answers to my questions must be found.</p>

<p>The People's Republic of China's National Men's Ice Hockey team represents the Chinese Ice Hockey Association. Following a 5 game undefeated streak (4 wins, 1 draw) in Group B of the 2006 Division 2 Men's World Ice Hockey Championship (which took place at Auckland, New Zealand, April 3-9, 2006) they were crowned champions of Group B and were promoted to Division 1 along with Romania, the winner of Division 2's Group A. China had been relegated to Division 2 from Division 1 following the 2005 Division 1 Men's World Ice Hockey Championship (which took place at Debrecen, Hungary April 17-23) after losing all 5 games, managing only 5 goals for, while allowing 61 goals against. According to the IIHF's World Rankings, China stands alone in 28th place of 45 nations.</p>

<p>BB4Win is the abbreviation for "Blackbox for Windows".</p>
<p>Blackbox for Windows, commonly referred to by it's abbreviation, BB4Win, is a replacement for Microsoft's "Explorer" shell, based on the look and feel of the Blackbox shell for Unix / Linux.</p>
<p>Emphasis is placed on minimalism and configurability.</p>

<p><b>KTFM</b> 94.1 is a Rythmtic Oldies format owned by Border Media Partners. This station plays Oldies but much more R&amp;B and dance oriented.</p>
<p>The previous format was known as La Ley 94.1 <b>KLEY-FM</b> under the Regional Mexican format simular to <b>KTJM</b> La Raza 98.5 Port Arthur Houston.</p>
<p><b>KTFM</b> has been around for years under the 102.7 signal under a Rythmtic Contemporary format until October of 2003 when KSRX 102.7 K-rock took the airwaves.</p>
<p>Previous Rythmtic Oldies format was attempted on <b>KCJZ</b> 106.7 then known as <i>1067 Jamz</i> which around August or September of 2001 flipped to a Dance <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_40.html" title="Top 40">Top 40</a> format.</p>
<p>So on January 7, 2005 Border Media Partners after the aquistion of classic country KBUC 95.7 decided to give the format another shot by calling themselves <i><b>Jammin 94.1 San Antonio's Old School</b></i> and resurrected the KTFM call letters.</p>
<p>And La Ley moved up the dial to 95.7 dropping <b>KBUC</b>.</p>

<p>Andrea Stewart-Cousins defeated 20 year incumbent State Senator Nicholas Spano on November 7th, 2006. She will take office as the new Senator from Yonkers on January 1, 2007.</p>
<p>Candidate for 35th New York Senate District:</p>
<p>Andrea Stewart-Cousins, Democratic State Senate Candidate for the 35th Senate District, is presently serving her 6th term as a Westchester County Legislator for the city of Yonkers. During her tenure on the County Legislature, she has served in numerous leadership positions, including Chair of the powerful Legislation Committee; Chair of the Family, Health and Human Services Committee; and Majority Whip. She was recently elected by her colleagues as Board Vice Chair for the County Legislature.</p>
<p>In 2004 she ran for State Senate as a progressive outsider and came within striking distance of beating one of Albany’s most entrenched incumbents. Among her endorsers in that campaign were EMILY’s List, the National Organization of Women (Westchester Chapter), National Association of Social Workers, Citizen Action and Tenants PAC. After a lengthy legal battle, the incumbent claimed a narrow and disputed victory with a mere 18 votes.</p>
<p><br />
Westchester County Legislator:</p>
<p>Andrea Stewart-Cousins has lived in Yonkers for years. In 1995, Legislator Stewart-Cousins became the first African American woman to represent Yonkers' 16th District. As a result of her hard work and diligence, her colleagues on the Board of Legislators voted unanimously for her to serve as Board Vice Chair for the 2006-2007 legislative term.</p>
<p>A former AT&amp;T marketing professional, journalist, teacher, and personnel manager, Stewart-Cousins began her career in government with her appointment in 1992 as Director of Community Affairs for the City of Yonkers, the first African-American to serve in this position. Her unique perspectives spawned a number of creative and novel initiatives including the first union/government internship programs for youth in NYS; Yonkers’ first internship program for the disabled; and, the Mayor’s annual toy and coat drive. Stewart-Cousins was a co-founder of SOYO (Southwest Yonkers Planning Association), Riverfest, and “Art on Main.”</p>
<p>In her six years as Chair of the County Board’s Legislation Committee, Stewart-Cousins led the effort to pass landmark legislative initiatives, including the County’s first Human Rights Laws; Smoke-Free Work Place laws; tougher gun laws; Living Wage legislation; and laws that prosecute “predatory lenders” and racial profiling.</p>
<p>Legislator Stewart-Cousins continues to be an active community volunteer and has received many awards for her service including leadership awards from The Westchester Arts Council, the NAACP, American Cancer Society, National Association of Social Workers, among others.</p>
<p>A state-certified mediator, Legislator Stewart-Cousins earned her B.S. from Pace University where she is currently pursuing a Masters in Public Administration. The mother of three, she resides in Yonkers with her husband Tom.</p>

<p>Taint wipe is a word, commonly used to describe a person of a disreputable nature. Much like the term "deuche bag" would be applied to a person who is acting out in an outlandish manner, a taint wipe, is someone whos actions are worthy of only one position in life, which is that of wiping the taint of large sweaty men, or commonly referred to in the homosexual community as "bears".

<p>Detective Bill Pavelic retired from the Los Angeles Police Department in December of 1992. During his nineteen year tenure with LAPD, Bill Pavelic earned a Master’s Degree from Pepperdine University and acquired an extensive background in administrative and criminal investigations. Pavelic has investigated every conceivable crime and he is considered an expert in police procedures, interrogations and case biopsies.</p>
<p>Detective Pavelic received over 200 commendations and letters of appreciation from private and governmental institutions, including the United States Department of Justice. Prior to his retirement, Pavelic was honored by the City of Los Angeles as the Detective Supervisor of the Year for his professional competency, unimpeachable integrity, and for serving the civilian community with distinction, courtesy, and honor.</p>
<p><br />
Pavelic has been the subject of many articles nationally and internationally for speaking out against police corruption and police abuse which he personally witnessed mostly against minorities and non English speaking immigrants.</p>
<p>In 1991 and 1992, while a member of the Los Angeles Police Department, Det. Bill Pavelic openly challenged the LAPD leadership and called for the resignation of Chief, Daryl Gates. Det. Bill Pavelic met privately with several prominent Los Angeles “movers and shakers” to make certain that Chief Gates was held accountable and during this “meet and confer” process, Pavelic was told that Chief Gates days were numbered.</p>
<p>Chief Gates was forced into early retirement and on June 9, 1992, LA Councilman Zev Yaroslavky made the following comment to LA Times concerning LAPD Chief Daryl Gates; “....I have never dealt with a sicker mind, and a more outrageous personality, megalomaniacal personality, than this man, who has a problem recognizing what the truth is. He has left the Los Angeles Police Department in a total shambles. He has left this city in a total lurch.....”.</p>
<p>On July 20, 1994, as the lead defense investigator in the OJ Simpson case, Bill Pavelic(<a href="http://www.billpavelic.com" class="external free" title="http://www.billpavelic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.billpavelic.com</a>) told the mainstream media, that LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman was a racist and a pathological liar. Mark Fuhrman was vociferously defended by two of Las Angeles “finest”..... discredited LAPD Chief of Police, Daryl Gates and Private Investigator to the Stars, Anthony Pellicano.</p>
<p>The allegations against Mark Fuhrman by Bill Pavelic were made months before Fuhrman’s “celebrated” testimony in the OJ Simpson trial....and.....on January 29, 1996, Bill Pavelic spent hours and hours with California Department of Justice investigators Vickie Ward and George Fawrup, painstakingly going over Mark Fuhrman’s perjuries, Anthony Pellicano’s witness intimidations and myriad of other corruption related issues.</p>
<p>Bill Pavelic has consistently volunteered his pro bono services to indigent clients in the greater Los Angeles area and in 1998, he personally initiated multiple criminal misconduct complaints (which were sustained) against several LAPD Rampart police officers. The LAPD Rampart scandal closely mirrored Mark Fuhrman’s “fictional” audiotaped narrative that he provided to Laura Hart McKinny in February of 1985.</p>
<p>In 1999, in the matter of People v. Gordon Jones, Bill Pavelic ran into Anthony Pellicano, once again. After completing a biopsy of the Gordon Jones criminal case, Pavelic caused Pellicano and two defense attorneys to be fired. The client was being framed and milked as a “cash cow”. Pavelic informed the “authorities” that Private Investigator Anthony Pellicano was involved, in illegal wiretapping... and... that he was being “protected” by LAPD and LADA personnel. After six years, the “investigation” into Anthony Pellicano and his paid LAPD cronies resulted in the federal indictment of Anthony Pellicano and Pavelic’s police academy classmate, LAPD Detective Mark Arneson.</p>
<p>Since 1993, Bill Pavelic has intermittently worked as an investigative consultant, case manager, defense investigator and trial preparation specialist in Federal and State cases. Bill Pavelic continues to works for lawyers and clients as a consultant in the review and preparation of their civil-criminal cases. Bill has distinguished himself as an uncommonly effective defense advocate and strategist. His contribution to a 95% overall success rate in criminal defense cases is absolutely phenomenal and second to none.</p>
<p>Pavelic specializes in police corruption cases and he is equally as hard on passive, lazy and or back stabbing (pro prosecution) defense lawyers as he is against corrupt prosecutors and law enforcement personnel.</p>
<p>As a former LAPD detective supervisor, Bill Pavelic learned firsthand that “testalying” by cops is condoned by rogue prosecutors and pseudo defense lawyers who rely on “wussiest” positions rather than fight and defend their clients.</p>
<p>Law enforcement related corruption could not prosper without a tacit approval from the prosecutors and to some degree the judiciary. The prosecutorial misconduct that Pavelic has encountered in many of his cases involved;</p>
<p>Prosecutors, investigators and or agents who relentlessly, obsessively and injudiciously manipulate the print and electronic media so as to unfairly influence the outcome of a case;</p>
<p>Prosecutors, investigators and or agents who use the prestige of their office to intimidate, harass and spread propaganda about defense attorneys and defense consultants / investigators;</p>
<p>Prosecutors, investigators and or agents who suborn perjury so as to win at any cost;</p>
<p>Prosecutors, investigators and or agents who falsify search and arrest warrant affidavits;</p>
<p>Prosecutors, investigators and or agents who start out with a pseudo conclusion and "manufacture" facts to meet that conclusion;</p>
<p>Prosecutors, investigators and or agents who knowingly conceal exculpatory evidence at every level of the judicial process including the Grand Jury;</p>
<p>Prosecutors, investigators and or agents who tailor their "cherry-picked" evidence and remarks to the Grand Jury to fit their twisted logic or misguided perception;</p>
<p>Prosecutors, investigators and or agents who play fast and lose with evidence and rely on experts like Anthony Pellicano to “authenticate” transcripts from dubious - tampered audio and video tapes;</p>
<p>Prosecutors, investigators and agents who knowingly provide false evidence as true evidence;</p>
<p>Prosecutors, investigators and agents who play games with discovery;</p>
<p>Prosecutors, investigators and agents who under color of authority illegally detain and arrest people, so as to use them as bargaining chips;</p>
<p>The “legal system” is a multi billion dollar enterprise and knowing how “the system” operates does make a difference. During the past 13 years Pavelic has consulted on many high profile cases, including, but not limited to;</p>
<p>The L.A. Riots Case,</p>
<p>The O.J. Simpson Double Murder Case,</p>
<p>The Limousine Rapist (Gordon Jones) Sexual Assault Case,</p>
<p>The Max Factor (Andrew Luster) Rape Case,</p>
<p>The Scott Peterson Murder Case,</p>
<p>The Gregg Haidl Orange County Gang Rape Case,</p>
<p>The Phil Spector Murder Case,</p>
<p>The Robert Blake Murder Case,</p>
<p>The Michael Jackson Child Molestation Case,</p>
<p>The Murder at Chaka Khan’s Residence.</p>
<p>Zvonko “Bill” Pavelic - The Detective</p>
<p>Detective Pavelic left the Los Angeles Police Department on January 7, 1992, in part, because the LAPD Southwest Sexual Assault Unit knowingly framed the so called "USC serial rapist" (Richard Nichols) for crimes that he did not commit.</p>
<p>In the past, LAPD grudgingly “allowed” Bill Pavelic to exonerate citizens who were innocent, falsely arrested and or framed by LAPD, especially minorities and non English speaking immigrants. However, in this highly publicized case (involving an alleged African American “serial rapist” and a white USC student) the line in the sand was drawn and Pavelic was not about to let an innocent man languish in jail for the rest of his life ...and.... permit the actual serial rapist to pray on other women and children.</p>
<p>At every opportunity, Det. Bill Pavelic provoked the help of anyone (including the New York Times and The Los Angeles Times) and repeated the same message, over and over again, that the disciplinary system under the leadership of Chief Daryl Gates lacked legitimacy and sent a deplorable signal to others on the force that it was OK to frame people (especially African Americans and Latinos), falsify official investigations, violate the LAPD manual, discredit the Code of Ethics and be dishonest, as long it “benefits” the LAPD and a handful of LADA prosecutors, whose loyalty to USC was more important than their oath of office.</p>
<p>Over the ensuing weeks and months Det. Bill Pavelic met privately with several prominent Los Angeles “movers and shakers” to make sure that Chief Gates was held accountable. Pavelic was told in no uncertain terms to be patient and that Chief Gates days would be numbered.</p>
<p>In March of 2002, the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office quietly caused Richard Nichols to be released from custody....for crimes that he did not commit.</p>
<p><br />
On June 9, 1992, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky was quoted in the Los Angeles Times as making the following comment in regards to Chief Gates; "....I have never dealt with a sicker mind, and a more outrageous personality, megalomaniacal personality, than this man, who has a problem recognizing what the truth is...He has left the Los Angeles Police Department in a total shambles. He has left this city in a total lurch..."</p>
<p>On July 9, 1992, The Los Angeles Sentinel (local South Central LA Newspaper) published the following letter to the editor from Bill Pavelic;</p>
<p><br />
As a 19-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department, I am elated that Chief Daryl Gates was forced into retirement. His corrupt managerial style, coupled with his inflammatory and intemperate public comments, have done irreparable damage to the city of Los Angeles and its police department.</p>
<p>Daryl Gates and his close associates are suffering from a disease called megalomania...an exaggerated belief in their own greatness and that of the organization. In order to maintain a mythical status of being "the best law enforcement agency in the world," the LAPD management developed a bunker mentality and consciously impeded and retarded investigations or inquiries which reflected poorly on the organization. The "us against them" mentality required faulty analysis which was oftentimes based on pseudo reasoning, clever fallacies and distorted or manufactured evidence.</p>
<p>The disciplinary system under the leadership of Daryl Gates lacked consistency, uniformity and equality and sent a deplorable signal to others on the force that it is OK to falsify official investigations, violate the LAPD manual, discredit the Code of Ethics and be dishonest, as long as you are a member of management or have friends at the top who will protect you even when prima facie evidence of a crime is clearly evident.</p>
<p>Chief Gates has failed to hold accountable personnel under his control who were acting under the color of law and were exercising illegal direction under the guise of official authority. In no sphere of public life is this practice more repugnant than in law enforcement. Chief Gates, who morally bankrupted the Los Angeles Police Department, forgot, or never new, that true leadership can be gained only by an intolerance of wrong doing...and...unless we all abide by the highest standards among ourselves, we have no business enforcing the law upon others.</p>
<p>Chief Gates used the Internal Affairs Division to intimidate those officers who dared to speak out against Los Angeles Police Department's institutionalized racism, corruption, sexism, mismanagement, promotional cronyism and other sensitive issues. If the Internal Affairs Division didn't get these "disloyal" police officers, like the Russian KGB, the organization could always count on the Medical Liaison Unit to send these officers to the department shrink...to certify them as functionally crazy.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Chief Williams, respect for individual dignity will once again become an integral part of the Los Angeles Police Department's philosophy, a philosophy that will be based on the principles of professionalism, reverence for the law and harmony between the police and the community it serves."</p>
<p>NOTE: Chief Williams turned out to be a total disappointment.</p>
<p>Although financially and emotionally exhausted from a grueling fight with various LAPD and City of Los Angeles entities, in Dec. of 1992, Bill Pavelic was granted a medical pension for asthma, which Pavelic claimed was induced by LAPD corruption.</p>

<p>Chã das Caldeiras (“Plain of the Calderas”) is a community of roughly 1,000 inhabitants in the Conselho de Santa Catarina on the island of Fogo, one of eight inhabited islands comprising the west African nation of Cape Verde.</p>

<p>Fogo was the second in the archipelago to be populated, after Santiago. Initially, the island's cash crop was cotton, picked by slaves from Angola. A fiery eruption in 1688 caused a majority of the inhabitants to leave for Brava, another of the Cape Verdean islands. From 1785 on, whaling ships from Brockton and New Bedford, Massachusetts and Rhode Island (USA) came to replenish their ships and recruit crews. The departure of these Americanos marks the beginning of the Cape Verdean diaspora. Not everyone left Fogo, however. In 1870, the eccentric Duke of Montrond (France) stopped on the island en route to Brazil, or so he thought. He stayed, and brought with him the vines that kicked off wine production on the slopes and in Chã das Caldeiras. Many of the inhabitants of Chã, with their light skin, blond hair, and blue eyes, trace their ancestry back to the biologically prolific Duke.</p>

<p>A large crater rim with 800-m escarpments, called the Bordeira, encircles the village (elevation 1,629 m). On the plain is one large peak (2,829 m from sea level) and several smaller peaks and lava fields from recent eruptions, most notably 1951 and 1995. The entire caldera, some 67 km<sup>2</sup>, is a protected area as part of the Parque Natural do Fogo, a cooperative effort between the German and Cape Verdean governments.</p>

<p>Chã does have a lot of vegetation (albeit not in the lava fields), which grows in the rich volcanic soils adjacent to the crater rim. This includes fruits (apples, grapes, quince, pomegranate, figs, peaches, and tomatoes) and vegetables (beans, corn, potatoes, manioc, and peppers) for local consumption and commercial production, as well as the indigenous and endemic plant species. The local agricultural cooperative, Associação dos Agricultores de Chã buys excess fruit from the local farmers and turns it into white, red, rosé, and passito (dry grape) wine (label “Chã”); grape (label “Espírito da Caldeira”), apple, quince, and peach spirits; apple, quince, and peach marmalade; and juice for commercial sale. The white wine is made from locally-grown Muscatel grapes, the red from the Portuguese tradicional preto variety. Also famous is house-made goat cheese, queijo de cabra, and Manecon, an unfiltered, semi-sweet local red wine.</p>

<p>An average day can see up to twenty tourists, most of whom are European and come with operators from the islands of Sal and Boa Vista. Some come only for the day, to see the volcano, taste the wine, and tour the Associação (funded by the Italian NGO Cospe). Others spend the night to hike, with local hired guides, the final 1,200 m up the volcano and listen to live traditional music. Those spending the night do so in a small hotel, one of four locally-owned hostels, or with families.</p>

<p>Manecon is the traditional, semi-sweet or -dry, locally-made red wine of Chã das Caldeiras, a community in the Conselho de Santa Catarina on the island of Fogo, one of eight islands in the west African nation of Cape Verde. (It is not to be confused with “Chã” label red, white, and rosé wine, made by the Associação dos Agricultores de Chã.) Manecon is house-made by farmers in Chã from the Portuguese tradicional preto variety of grapes. It is an unfiltered, full-bodied wine, rich in color and extract. The percentage of alcohol in Manecon (14%) is greater than what is found in wines from the EU and the United States (usually between 11.5-12.5%). The majority of Manecon is sold in Chã, either to locals or to tourists. Some, however, is sold elsewhere in Cape Verde. Sweet Manecon is especially popular on the island of Santiago.</p>
<p>The wine is dark purple in color with shades of red. Flavors on the palate include small, dark fruits like the current or blackberry. This sensation is enriched with tones of pepper and Muscat nut. The wine's rich body, best when served at room temperature (20° C), combines well with the strength of the alcohol. The soft, velvet tannins of the wine can be appreciated when the wine is still young. Manecon is enjoyed best on a starry night at the Cooperativa in Chã, where Talaia Baixo, the traditional music of Fogo, is played on a nightly basis.</p>
<p>Manecon gets its name, legend has it, from the dog of the first person to live in Chã, a man named Manuel. He and his dog, Manuel e cão in Portuguese, both took a liking to the strong red wine they made. Others noticed the pair of, eh, lushes and started called the wine they made Manecon. The name stuck.</p>
<p>The legacy of Manuel and his dog remains to this day. Most households make Manecon for commercial production and personal consumption. A 1.5 l water bottle costs 500 CVE (Cape Verdean escudos, about $6.00). A 750 ml bottle, with label, costs 400 CVE at the Cooperativa. The Talaia Baixo accompanying it is, of course, free.</p>

<p>The red wine, vinho tinto, made from the Portuguese tradicional preto variety of grapes, has a dark red color with shades of purple. Odors include tones and flavors of small, dark fruits like the current or blackberry. This sensation is enriched with shades of pepper and Muscat nut. The wine's rich body, best when served at room temperature (20° C, 68° F), combines well with the strength of the alcohol. The soft, velvet tannins of the wine can be appreciated when it is still young. (Market forces being such, Chã's reds have not yet been aged for any considerable time. The majority of the label is consumed within a year of production.) The red is perfect alone or to accompany any meat of strong taste.</p>

<p>The white wine, vinho branco, made from locally-grown Muscatel grapes, has a fresh taste, unique clarity, and golden shades. Odors include semi-sweet citric fruits like the grapefruit. These characteristics are noticed visually and on the palate, where the wine combines harmoniously with the alcohol content. The white also has a subtle, residual sweetness to be enjoyed with appetizers or with fish, shellfish, white meats, or Chã's own goat cheese, queijo de cabra. This elegant wine is best served at a temperature of 10° C (45° F) and can be saved for 2-3 years, if stored correctly.</p>

<p>The rosé wine, vinho rosé, uses the same dark grapes as the red. It has an elegant rose color with flavors of small, sweet fruits like red currents and strawberries.

<p>The Jordan International Police Training Center (JIPTC) was created in November, 2003 by the Coalition Provisional Authority, Baghdad, to train 32,000 Iraqi police and border guards on a 560-acre site in Muwaqqar, about 30 miles southwest of Amman, Jordan. It is said to be the largest international police training center in the world, on the strength of the participation of police instructors from more than 15 countries, including Belgium, Sweden, Finland and Poland. As of November, 2006, the center had graduated more than 43,000 cadets. The Center is scheduled to graduate it last class of Iraqi cadets on December 20, 2006, but it may continue on a smaller scale, providing mid-career instruction of Iraqi security personnel. www.jiptc.org</p>
<p>In December, JIPTC received two additional classes of about 1,800 each. The last of these graduated on February 25, bringing the total number of Iraqi police recruits trained at JIPTC to 50,354. Small scale training of mid-career officers is continuing.</p>

<p>Meredith Wooldridge Thring (1915-2006).</p>
<p>Born in Melbourne, Victoria 17 December 1915; Assistant Scientific Officer, British Coal Utilisation Research Association 1937-44, Senior Scientific Officer and Head of Combustion Research Laboratory 1944-46; Head of Physics Department, British Iron and Steel Research Association 1946-53, Superintendent 1950-53, Assistant Director 1953; Professor of Fuel Technology and Chemical Engineering, Sheffield University 1953-64; President, Institute of Fuel 1962-63; Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Queen Mary College, London University 1964-81 (Emeritus); married 1940 Margaret Hooley (died 1986; two sons, one daughter); died Exmouth, Devon 15 September 2006.</p>
<p>Med Thring's father, Walter H.C.S. Thring joined the Royal Navy as a Midshipman in 1888 and rose to be a Captain. When he was a Gunnery Lieutenant, he developed a rate of change of range calulatorwhich was subsequently made in the Royal Naval dockyards in Malta. He was seconded to the Imperial Japanese Navy as as a Gunnery Advisor before the Battle of Port Arthur, 1904 (q.v.). His advice was so beneficial that the smaller, lighter-gunned Japanese fleet outmanoevered the heavier-gunned Russian navy and W.H.C.S. Thring was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (Second Class) by the Japanese, who considered that they had won the battle. In 1911 he left the Royal Navy to serve in the Royal Australian Navy where he established the Naval Inteligence service. One major result achieved by this service was the tracking by the first instance of directional trigonometry of radio transmissions of the German Cruiser the Emden (q.v.), which was subsequently sunk by the Royal Autralian Navy in 1914.</p>
<p>Meredith Thring's grandfather, John Charles Thring (q.v.) was instrumental in the codifying of the rules for what became Association Football. One of his granduncles was Godfrey Thring (q.v.) the hymn writer, another was Edward Thring of Uppingham (q.v.) who founded the Headmasters' and Mistresses Conference (q.v.), and yet another was Henry Thring who was a founder of the Parliamentary draftsman service and was elevated to be Baron Thring (q.v.) of Alderhurst.</p>
<p>Meredith Thring was a visionary engineer who loved nothing better than a heated debate (sometimes even over breakfast) about his predictions of the future. A physicist by training, he switched to engineering because he wanted to make the world a better place to live in, not just for the next 10 years, but for his great-grandsons when they reach the age of 90. He was a polymath and highly intellectual, yet passionate about the future of the world and its people, and firm in his view that engineers must have a conscience to help make sustainable development possible - and so he looked to today's engineers for renewable energy technology that could be shared throughout the world. He maintained a positive disposition, in spite of his knowledge of the dangers of the consumption by Western countries of so much more than their share of the world's resources.</p>
<p>Meredith Wooldridge Thring, known to his friends as "Med", was born in Australia in 1915. Returning to England when he was four, his mother died when he was just 6, and his father married again in 1927. He was sent away to Malvern College where he excelled academically. When he left the Headmaster wrote:</p>
<p>“Med Thring was a genius mathematical He could argue, that bloke, The hind leg off a moke, But his wisdom was highly problematical”.</p>
<p>He went up from Malvern College to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he attained a double First in Maths and Physics in 1937. He declined an offer to stay on for a PhD in the Rutherford lab, being keen to "get out into the world to help people", a decision which may have saved him - a staunch pacifist - from being involved in early work developing the nuclear bomb.</p>
<p>On graduation Med Thring joined the British Coal Utilisation Research Association, becoming head of the combustion laboratory, where one of his projects included converting vehicles to run on producer gas made from wood, to save petrol in wartime. In 1946 he moved to become the Head of the Physics Department at the British Iron and Steel Research Association, in London.</p>
<p>Turning to academia in 1953, he was appointed Head of the Department of Fuel Technology and Chemical Engineering at Sheffield University. His interests there included magneto hydrodynamics, robot fire-fighters and the domestic robot, a topic of enduring interest to the popular media. In 1964 he moved to Queen Mary College, London, to become Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, working on subjects as varied as aids for thalidomide children to novel methods of low-drag ship propulsion.</p>
<p>He was a founder of the International Flame Research Foundation and a founder fellow of the Fellowship of Engineering, which became the Royal Academy of Engineering, London. He was also a Fellow of the Institute of Physics, the Institution of Electrical Engineers, the Institution of Chemical Engineers, and a Senior Fellow of the Institute of Fuel (now the Institute of Energy), serving as its President in 1962-63.</p>
<p>His numerous books include The Science of Flames and Furnaces (1952), Man, Machines and Tomorrow (1973) and How to Invent (1977), the last of these with Eric Laithwaite. He was consultant to a number of companies including Shell Oil Co, ICI and Montecatini Edison in Italy.</p>
<p>In retirement Med Thring worked as hard as ever, getting up at 6am and going to bed at 11.30pm; he just stopped having to go to the office and was able to focus more on his favourite areas. By this time he had become very interested in helping the people of Africa feed themselves. He founded a charity, Poweraid, sponsored a village in Tanzania and was also very active in Nigeria, making a number of visits to Lagos.</p>
<p>One of his favourite technologies was that used to extract edible protein from leaves. He worked out ways to harvest the weed water hyacinth from Lake Victoria and turn it into food, acting as a personal consultant to President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda on this subject. His passion remained - science and engineering making a difference to the people of the world.</p>
<p>His wife, Margaret, gave him tremendous support, with activities ranging from entertaining students at their home in Sheffield to accompanying him to meet the Duke of Edinburgh. They married quickly during the Blitz in 1940 because, as they said, they could be dead next week. They both survived and were married for 46 years.</p>

<p><small>The Expressive Actor</small></p>
<p><small>Book and organization of Master Acting, Voice and Movement Specialist Michael Lugering, documenting the Lugering method of Acting, Movement, and Voice training for the Actor. The book, The Expressive Actor Integrated Voice, Movement &amp; Acting Training by Michael Lugering is published by Heinemann Drama Books</small></p>
<p><small>The Lugering Method In this innovative and practical approach to training the “total actor,” the traditionally disparate disciplines of acting, movement and voice are synthesized in a unified method of training. The Lugering Method explores the integrated manner in which mental and emotional content are expressed through the body and voice. The goal is an expressive actor capable of a vivid, powerful and artful expression of thought and feeling that is spectacularly human and rarely demonstrated in daily living. Developed by Master Voice and Movement Teacher, Michael Lugering, this internationally recognized voice and movement technique is taught at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, Southern Mississippi University, New Dance Group in New York City and the Actor’s Center in London, England. Michael Lugering holds Intensive Training Workshops in New York City, London, England, and other national and internationally locations. The Expressive Actor website is www.expressiveactor.org.</small></p>

<p><small><br />
Lugering Method Principles of Expression The Principles of Expression articulate the universal process in which all human beings organize thought and feeling into meaningful forms of expression. Expression is viewed as a highly specialized type of physical action in which energy, orientation, size, progression, flow, direction, speed, weight, control and focus are structured and shaped to reveal the content of our thoughts and feelings. Emphasis is placed on making an exploratory distinction between Expression in its 1st and 2nd Function--a distinction between the physical and intellectual, the emotional and the mental, movement and language, physical form and psychological content. The result is a synthesis of the mind and the body in the sensuous expression of thought and feeling. Whether the actor is working on expressing--love or loss—resonance or range—alignment or flexibility— the Principles of Expression have a similar and consistent application. These principles transcend any specific acting style, focusing on universal aspects of human expression present in all drama form Shakespeare to Simon, Wycherley to Wasserstein, Moliere to Mamet. Principals of Expression include: Content and Form, Static and Dynamic Forms, Verbal and Non-verbal Forms, Intelect and Intuition, Energy, Expressive Action, Integration, Expressive Cycle, Expressive Continuum and Living Form.</small></p>
<p><small>Lugering Method Integrated Voice &amp; Body Exercises The Integrated Voice &amp; Body Exercises of the Lugering Method are adaptations of many of the physical exercises of which comprise the Erick Hawkins' Dance Technique. Erick Hawkins was a master Modern Dance, choreographer and teacher. His internationally recognized approach to movement has revolutionized traditional dance training. Erick Hawkins' "free-flowing" approach to movement, creates an ideal physical environment, where breath and sound can be integrated with momentous physical action without stress, strain or injury. In the course of a traditional class, the student moves sequentially from lying, to sitting, to standing and finally to locomotive movement. In the Lugering Method process, breath and sound are integrated with physical action through a series of sighing, hissing and sounding actions. The result is the increased physical and vocal freedom, flexibility, dexterity, coordination, range and power. The exercises seek to center, integrate and balance the actor's instrument through the reprogramming of fixed physical and vocal structures that are inefficient, habitual and idiosyncratic. More than merely a set of arbitrary physical and vocal drills, the integrated voice and body exercises reflect and mirror the universal pattern and structure that characterizes all acts of human expression regardless of content or context. Voice and Body Exercises explore: Body Structure, A Universal Place of Departure, Free Flow, Momentum Path, Weight Shifts, Tasselling Arms and Legs, Flexibility of the Spine, Stabilization, Leg Alignment, Grounding, Flexible Breath Training, Breath Cycle, Breathing Center, Releasing the Breath, Carrying the Breath, Breathing Spaces, Acoustics, Tuning the Vowel, Flexible Resonating Spaces, Releasing the Sound, Carrying the Sound, Vocal Center, Upper and Lower Voice, Balancing Resonance, and Articulation.</small></p>

<small>Improvisational Studies
</small>
</pre>
<p><small>The Improvisational Studies of the Lugering Method are designed to cultivate a healthy respect for impulse, spontaneity, and creativity while simultaneously expanding and broadening the actor's imagination and increasing expressive power. The improvisational studies foster an intuitive and non-intellectual approach to skill building. The studies begin with the repetition of a physical action and progress sequentially adding breath, then sound and finally words and phrases. The outcome is the organized, sensuous and integrated expression of the body's most powerful thoughts and feelings. The improvisational studies have proved to be an essential link in bridging the wide gap that so often separates traditional methods of voice, movement and acting training. Through the improvisations, the actor learns new forms of expression never thought possible and many of which he or she has never experienced in his or her own life. In an advanced study, specific improvisational studies can be structured to address individual deficiencies and limitations. The goal is to develop an instrument that is flexible and dynamic and in direct contact with pure sensation. Improvisations explore: First and Second Function, Sound and Movement, In And Of Itself For Its Own Sake, Beginning / Middle / End, Phrasing, Expressive Action, Pure Sensation, First and Second Order Facts, Dynamic Structures, and Characterization.</small></p>
<p><small>Aesthetic Theory The Aesthetic Theory of the Lugering Method is rooted in the philosophical exploration of artistic form. It provides the actor with a context and perspective in which important distinctions can be made between everyday expression and artful expression, distinctions between real feelings and imaginary feelings, between the personal life of the actor and the fictitious world of the character. The theory fosters a healthy and playful approach to the creative process that is never psychologically abusive or consciously therapeutic. The aesthetic theory includes study of Significant Form, Pure Form, False Forms, Real and Imaginary Feelings, Decoration, Radical Empiracle Immediacy and Suchness and Otherness.</small></p>
<p><small><br />
The well coordintated body and the well cooridanted mind go and in hand. Physical flexibility and and dexterity are linked directly to mental and emotional flexibility and dexterity. When the body learns new ways of moving and sounding, it also learns new ways of thinking and feeling. --Michael Lugering</small></p>
<p><small><br />
Michael Lugering is a master teacher of voice, movement and acting. Mr. Lugering has spent over 15 years researching the physical, psychological, behavioral and aesthetic aspects of human expression. The Lugering Method marks a revolutionary departure from traditional methods of actor training.

<p><small>This is a case about a sergeant of Marines who shot his commanding officer (CO) and executive officer (XO) while they were in their command office suite, killing the XO and seriously wounding the CO. The appellant’s sentence included the death penalty. Because the military judge committed an error that materially prejudiced a substantial right of the appellant by granting a prosecution challenge for cause, we must set aside the findings and the sentence and order a rehearing.</small></p>
<p><small>Contrary to his pleas, the appellant was convicted of attempted unpremeditated murder (two specifications), violation of a general order by carrying and concealing a .45 caliber pistol, premeditated murder, aggravated assault by pointing a dangerous weapon (two specifications), carrying a concealed weapon, communicating a threat, and obstructing justice. The appellant’s offenses violated Articles 80, 92, 118, 128, and 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. §§ 880, 892, 918, 928, and 934. A general court-martial comprised of 12 members unanimously sentenced the appellant to death, reduction to pay grade E-1, and total forfeiture of pay and allowances. The convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged.</small></p>
<p><small>We have carefully considered the record of trial, the appellant’s 49 briefed assignments of error and 83 summary assignments of error, the amici curiae brief, the Government’s response, the appellant’s Reply, the Petition for New Trial, the Motion for Summary Disposition, the Supplemental Assignment of Error, all other appellate pleadings, and the parties’ excellent oral arguments. Arts. 59(a) and 66(c), UCMJ. The Petition for New Trial and the Motion for Summary Disposition are denied. While our decision as to a challenge for cause renders moot all other assignments of error, four of the additional issues warrant discussion.</small></p>
<p><small>I. Background</small></p>
<p><small>In March of 1996, the appellant was assigned to Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron 39 at Camp Pendleton, California. He worked on the night crew at the squadron, meaning that he routinely reported for work in mid-afternoon. The squadron CO was Lieutenant Colonel (LtCol) Thomas A. Heffner, United States Marine Corps (USMC). The XO was LtCol Daniel W. Kidd, USMC.</small></p>
<p><small>On the morning of 5 March 1996, the appellant consumed an undetermined quantity of alcohol, then left his home to drive to work. When he left his car parked in the squadron parking lot, he had a .45 caliber pistol tucked into his clothing. The appellant entered the squadron spaces, walked upstairs to the command office suite, then waited outside the XO’s office until other Marines left.</small></p>
<p><small>A uniform inspection was scheduled for the night crew at 1500. In preparation for the inspection, LtCol Heffner was changing into his dress uniform, in a changing room located next to LtCol Kidd’s office, where LtCol Kidd was working at his desk.</small></p>
<p><small>The appellant walked into LtCol Kidd’s office, pulled out his pistol, asked him, “Remember me, f---er?” and then shot the XO as he tried to exit the office through the door into the changing room. The bullet entered the right side of his lower back, exited the right front side of his abdomen, and then amputated his right ring finger. LtCol Kidd managed to stagger into the changing room, with the appellant close behind him.</small></p>
<p><small>LtCol Heffner was changing uniforms when the door to the changing room burst open and LtCol Kidd rushed in. LtCol Heffner first glanced at his XO, and then noticed the appellant in the doorway. The appellant raised his pistol and shot LtCol Heffner in the chest, at which point LtCol Heffner ran out of the office suite. The appellant then shot LtCol Kidd again, the bullet entering his upper back. LtCol Kidd collapsed to the floor and bled to death within a matter of minutes.</small></p>
<p><small>After the third and fatal shot was fired, the appellant left the office suite and followed the bloody trail left by LtCol Heffner. As he moved down the passageway, he confronted Gunnery Sergeant (GySgt) W.J. Till and Staff Sergeant (SSgt) A.L. Karr. The appellant pointed the pistol at both Marines but did not fire.</small></p>
<p><small>By this time, LtCol Heffner was lying just outside one of the ground floor entrances to the building. Various Marines were providing first aid to their CO. GySgt W.E. Tiller was there and heard someone ask where the XO was. He then went up to the second floor to find the XO. As he proceeded down the passageway toward the command office suite, he saw the appellant a few feet away. GySgt Tiller stepped toward the appellant and reached for the gun. The appellant raised the gun toward GySgt Tiller and fired. GySgt Tiller avoided the shot and struggled with the appellant, eventually disarming him.</small></p>
<p><small>The appellant broke away from GySgt Tiller and went down the stairs to the ground floor to the Production Control Office. A number of senior enlisted Marines were in the office at the time. When the appellant entered the office, none of them knew what had just happened. The appellant said, “Gunnery Sergeant, apprehend me, I just shot the CO and XO,” or words to that effect. GySgt P.T. Sullivan asked the appellant to sit down, and he did so.</small></p>
<p><small>Soon other Marines entered the office. The appellant talked about why he shot the CO and XO, complaining that he wasn’t treated well in the squadron and that he did it for his “brown brothers,” or words to that effect. At one point, the appellant stood up, pulled down his coveralls, took off his undershirt, and displayed the tattoos that covered his upper body. One of the large tattoos read “Sureno,” which the Government argued was a reference to Southern California gangs. Shortly thereafter, a military policeman arrived and took the appellant into custody.</small></p>

The parameters of this type of music are unclear, but common elements of his music are unusual and abrasive rhythms, humorous samples and indefinable, distorted noises. When asked to describe it in an interview, he said: "if Rammstein forced a robot at gunpoint to write a jingle for Cancer Research, that would be very halfcore."</p>
<p>Despite the fact his career is still in its infancy Treetops McPhoenix is already infamous for several things: 1. His telling of controversial jokes between songs. 2. His bizarre appearance (his “trademark look” consists of painting his entire body black, wearing a pair of women’s tights and a blonde wig). 3. An incident during a recent gig in which he passed out onstage due to an overdose of drugs.</p>
