<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b> defaulting to "keep". I am not persuaded by the arguments that individual episodes are not notable: how then could they be awarded <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmy_Award_4d8c.html" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Awards</a>? I also understand that this is a work in progress, in common with most of Wikipedia, and that older seasons will be brought into line. The delete arguments mostly appear to amount to "smash them all" which is hardly in the spirit of constructing an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> - these articles are pointless - other articles have separate articles for episodes because each episode is a self-contained story. 24 is different as each episode is part of a single series-long story. These are episode articles for the sake of it - i.e. just created because other shows have them. (Same applies to all 24 episodes). -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 21:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete /</b> <i>maybe merge</i>, per Chuq and other concerns. While I'm usually not a fan of individual episode articles anyways, Chuq is right in that the unique nature of 24 makes these types of articles just stupid (even if you love episode articles, why organize the plot summary like this?). This same logic can be applied to the reason I normally (but certainly not always) discourage individual episode articles, the individual episodes are not independently notable nor do they need to be split for page size concerns. It's this kind of preemptive article creation that leads to the massive misconception about episode articles. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> #7, we are not plot summaries, and other uses of plot summary don't need this kind of formatting. It's being done just because that's what someone did for other episode articles. These episodes, aired or not, shouldn't be formatted this way, even if you like episode articles. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 23:49, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> If the other seasons do not have episode articles, we don't need them for this season. I support a season article and maybe a link to the 24 Wiki could be provided.

<li><b>Creator Comment</b> While I of course would hate to see my articles deleted, I do understand they need content. Content which hasn't been provided yet, via Fox. I do believe that we need individual articles to cover each episode. One reason would be the spoiler, some people may want to only read one episode. Second, usually the episodes are covered a bit more in-depth; and you shouldn't really pile them into one larger article. External links to the 24 wiki, while nice, discredit what we are here to provide. One large source of information, to research and look things up. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomitho_e029.html" title="User:Somitho">Somitho</a> 17:22, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>External inks to the 24 wiki don't discredit us.. If anything it helps us by directing editors to the proper place for high level of plot detail. As for the spoiler concern, that's pretty much nabbed in the ass by us not being censored. (Although I do think it is acceptable to write plot summary in a chronological sense. For example: "Jimmy went to the mall, is ok" but " Jimmy, who later died, went to the mall" is needless.) -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 01:20, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I agree that episode articles are rarely a good idea and even on shows like The Simpsons you just end up with a plot summary and a ridiculous trivia section.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 07:54, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete all</b> since the episodes have not yet aired, and essentially there's nothing we can say about them other than existence. I've never watched the show and so can't speak to the wider issue of if individual episode articles make sense for <i>24</i>; while I'm generally in favor of episode articles, I see that <a href="../../../2/4/_/Category%7E24_%28TV_series%29_episodes_16de.html" title="Category:24 (TV series) episodes">Category:24 (TV series) episodes</a> does not contain anything for seasons 1-4. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanG_1aea.html" title="User:BryanG">BryanG</a><sup><a href="../../../b/r/y/User_talk%7EBryanG_f39b.html" title="User talk:BryanG">(talk)</a></sup> 23:05, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, you haven't. I know, because i wrote the episodes articles for the past three seasons while the episode was airing.

<li><b>Delete</b> Individual articles like this is not appropriate encyclopedical content.

<li><b>Comment</b> To delete these articles but keep separate articles for countless other shows, even those with a sequential plot, would be inconsistent to say the least. If the consensus turns out to be to delete these, then it should be applied to the hundreds of other articles like these for dozens of other series'. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodnightmush_2887.html" title="User:Goodnightmush">Goodnightmush</a> 04:40, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
