<p><s>*<b>Keep Listed</b> - I live in New York and have traveled to Jerusalem a number of times on business and pleasure. I have attended this Kiddush along with up to 50 other people on a given week. It is not in fact renowed throughout the Jewish world, however, it is well known among a wide circle of Jews from all walks of life (though mostly single) in major cities throughout the world, so I'd vote to keep it listed. Especially since this "Kiddush Club" is not a group vying for greater visibility, a Wikipedia reference for this topic is not an attempt at self-agrandizement. I think it could be useful reference for on off-handed remark by someone in this clique on a website, such as "My wife and I met at <i>Ted's Kiduush</i> about 4 years ago." Without this article, the rest of the world would be lost.

<li><b>Sigh</b>. Look, folks, I'm sure Ted is a very nice guy, and I'm sure the Kiddush is important to the small circle of people who frequent it, but that doesn't make it a topic for an encyclopedia article. Let me try an analogy. I work for a company which has a wikipedia article about it. It deserves the article because it's an international company with 25,000 employees worth $30 Billion. But, my particular office doesn't have an article about it. It's a nice office. It's very important to the 100 or so people working in it, and I can certainly count people from more than a half dozen countries. We even have three (that I know of) husband-wife pairs, although I don't know for sure that they met while working here. We've probably got Steelers fans, and I know some people here who are good cooks, some of whom probably have a good chulnt recipe or two on their hard drives. None of this makes the office worthy of having a wikipedia article written about it. The goal of Wikipedia is to document things which are important, not as a tool to make things important. -- <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoySmith_db67.html" title="User talk:RoySmith">(talk)</a> 15:53, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Lol. Roy I appreciate the humor of your response and get the point. I also accept the logic. I realize that you (and the others) are probably extremely annoyed by what you call "sockpuppets", but realize that the people who posted here were not trying to manipulate the process by making something seem more important than it is. They were simply trying to counterbalance <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon513_f8f5.html" title="User:Jon513">Jon513</a>'s claim that it must not be a notable group because he lives in Jerusalem and has never heard of it. If THAT was the basis of the decision to remove the article then the decision was flawed. But if, as you have all clarified, the criteria for proving notability is citation of sources (and not personal experience), then the group probably does not meet Wikipedia's definition of notability. One thing to consider, in general, when you all debate the idea of notability - perhaps "Google" should not be the test of notability for ALL things. With or without Wikipedia the kiddush will go on, and I invite <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon513_f8f5.html" title="User:Jon513">Jon513</a> to come and enjoy (drop by Chovevai synagogue around 11ish and ask around).

<li><b>Delete</b>. Despite the claims made by the sockpuppets, nothing has changed which would cause me to think that this subject has established its noteworthiness. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:04, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: For ease of reading, I've gone in and stricken all false votes by sockpuppets/meatpuppets. Nothing's been removed, just crossed out. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 23:16, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: this is with regards to user Aaron who has decided to take matters into his own hands and cross out statements made by sockpuppets or meatpuppets. well, my comment was crossed out above and i am neither. i have contributed in the past and have only one username. so, get your facts straight first. secondly, i find it inappropriate to have a balanced discussion if the comments that he finds unfit are crossed out! please do refrain from this kind of underhanded practice! --hubscubs</li>

<li><b>Additional note</b>: "hubscubs" has a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hubscubs_14cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hubscubs">total of 10 edits</a> (including the one above), with major edits only in "<a href="../../../k/i/d/Kiddush.html" title="Kiddush">Kiddush</a>"; he was not logged in when voting, and has changed the anon IP above to his name, which was not the case when the comment was struck. Thus, I have removed the strike tags. However, I would suggest he reflect on the policy of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>.
