<p>Deprodded. I think the FSF's notability is enough for this to go through a full-fledged AFD. - <a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikon_a19b.html" title="User:Sikon">Sikon</a> 13:33, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> The FSF is certainly notable, but this makes more sense as a section in the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Software_Foundation_6e41.html" title="Free Software Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a> article (the board members are there already). No need to keep their whole employee directory, complete with loads o' redlinks. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 13:38, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>This article started as such a section in the FSF article, and was split off with no rationale, discussion, or consensus by <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChealer_e61a.html" title="User:Chealer">User:Chealer</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/e/User_talk%7EChealer_71de.html" title="User talk:Chealer">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chealer_952d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chealer">contribs</a>). Moving it back would be a one good resolution. If it stays, it needs a more editing: cats, an intro, an external link section to the FSF web site, etc. <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELentower_3d21.html" title="User:Lentower">Lentower</a> 18:26, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Red links are just an invitation from one editor to all editors to do the hard work of writing a quality article. This will be a bit harder for those who worked for the FSF in the '80s and early '90s, before the Web and Google happened. Doing work in a research library is more effort, then a quick Google. <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELentower_3d21.html" title="User:Lentower">Lentower</a> 18:43, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Red links assume that the subject is notable. How many of these are sufficiently notable to warrant an article, sufficiently obscure in today's world to be absent from Google, and currently have no articles? My guess is not many. All of which is irrelevant: Wikipedia is not a directory. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 19:08, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per above, just working for the FSF isn't a claim to notability in its own right. The material needs to be of some encyclopedic quality.

<li>The FSF is not a company. A little research helps AfDs, before one expresses an opinion. At least, read a few of the related articles. <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELentower_3d21.html" title="User:Lentower">Lentower</a> 18:26, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ahem! You're not on safe ground by telling other editors to read the related articles. Reading <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-profit_organization.html" title="Non-profit organization">non-profit organization</a> will tell you that non-profit organizations are companies in law; and reading <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Software_Foundation_6e41.html" title="Free Software Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a> will tell you that the FSF is such a company incorporated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:52, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Although Wikipedia may owe some thanks to the FSF, this doesn't mean that we should consider them any differently than other companies - and we don't have a list of all staff of any other companies (at least, we <b>shouldn't</b>), so there's no reason this should be a special case. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 20:34, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge back</b>. These people are notable by virtue of the effort they expended, with Richard Stallman (RMS), in the founding of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software_movement.html" title="Free software movement">free software movement</a>, the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_project_03cd.html" title="GNU project">GNU project</a>, the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_b7e8.html" title="GNU">GNU</a> operating system, and the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Software_Foundation_6e41.html" title="Free Software Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a>. Even RMS could not have done it all by himself, and many of his ideas, strategies, and tactics came from this team. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory</a> 1.7.1 notes: "Of course, there is nothing wrong with having lists if their entries are famous because they are associated with or significantly contributed to the list topic, for example Nixon's Enemies List." - this is one of those cases. These FSF employees all worked at well below industry scale for their job descriptions, and worked well beyond 40 hours a week, to donate to the cause and as a public service. As noted in <a href="../../../w/i/k/WikiPedia_62ce.html#History" title="WikiPedia">WikiPedia#History</a> and <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNUpedia_85e0.html" title="GNUpedia">GNUpedia</a>, this team contributed to the idea that became Wikipedia. This team also created and proved that free software worked -- which caused the creation of the free software that Wikipedia uses. It's unlikely that Wikipedia would exist, if it had to pay companies like Oracle, royalties to use their software. <i>Summary: This team and it's members are notable.</i> <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELentower_3d21.html" title="User:Lentower">Lentower</a> 01:46, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>if their entries <b>are famous because</b> they are associated with or significantly contributed to</i>. Being associated with the list topic is not enough; the entries have to have achieved some kind of fame or notoriety as a result, and I don't think every single person who has worked for the FSF qualifies. Those that <i>do</i>, of course, <strike>are</strike> should be mentioned on the FSF page and have their own articles already. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFiggyBee_3e70.html" title="User:FiggyBee">FiggyBee</a> 01:55, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>{Ahh, ignorance of a different kind.&#160;;-} My apologies. None of the FSF Directors have been or are paid. This is true of most non-profits. And the FSF Directors are all active, giving much donated time (rarer among non-profits), and in some cases donated funds.</li>

<ul>
<li>That would leave it a very short list though. Better to mention those who actually are notable in the FSF article proper (yes, I am aware that the article currently proposed for deletion was split from the FSF in the first place). Preferably with some sort of context or assertion of notability rather than just a list, so it's clearer who to include and who not. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFiggyBee_3e70.html" title="User:FiggyBee">FiggyBee</a> 02:33, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The <i>most</i> significant persons associated with the FSF should be mentioned in the article <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Software_Foundation_6e41.html" title="Free Software Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a>. However, per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>, I can't see why Wikipedia would want to include a list of people just because they are staff/employees/volunteers there. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:44, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete and UNDO</b> the edit to the FSF article that split the list out. There were minimal other changes in that edit which could be redone by hand. I see no reason to have this as a standalone article. Where are the <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">independent</a> sources on the topic of the FSF's staff? I'd be surprised if there are any. Putting the list back in the main article is appropriate; the editors there should evaluate whether they believe each red linked individual is sufficiently notable (per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>) that an encyclopedia article could be written someday - if they are not yet so notable, either unlink or remove completely. For the blue linked folks, the answer is presumably already obvious. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 09:59, 6 December 2006 (UTC) Tweaked bolding per suggestion on my talk. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 16:39, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> the notable members back into the FSF article, as per GRBerry. On the one hand, we don't want the FSF article to get unmanageably long (if its maintainers decide there are many notable members); on the other, having a list full of redlinks is not very useful, or encyclopedic. I believe the best course of action is to merge for now, and if in the future there start to be too many members listed in the FSF article (who have their own articles, meaning there was enough material to write at least a stub about them), *then* split off to a list. "too many" in this case meaning "enough to start a list with, so that it contains a majority of blue links". <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapi_43f5.html" title="User:Capi">Capi</a> 16:32, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> FSF is notable, a list of individual staff and employees is not and sets a very bad precedent <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragomiloff_1fd6.html" title="User:Dragomiloff">Dragomiloff</a> 19:00, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
