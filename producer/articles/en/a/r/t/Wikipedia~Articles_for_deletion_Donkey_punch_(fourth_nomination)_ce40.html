<p>This article is nothing but a magnet for vandals (of all stripes). The article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donkey_punch&amp;diff=79447252&amp;oldid=79307379" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donkey_punch&amp;diff=79447252&amp;oldid=79307379" rel="nofollow">was gutted</a> by <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> himself, and removed of all non-sourced items. I believe that it is near impossible to actually source sexual slang like "Donkey Punch" except through cultural references, which Jimbo calls <a href="../../../d/o/n/Talk%7EDonkey_punch_2422.html#This_article_is_terrible.3B_this_debate_is_absurd" title="Talk:Donkey punch">original research</a>.</p>

<li>I agree with you, but all of those things you cited, or similar ones, were in the aricle.

<ul>
<li>Jimbo cautions against name-dropping the TV shows without something (a transcript, etc.) to prove they mentioned the practice; I suspect that can be done. He also suggests that we should find newspaper or magazine articles to verify the practice, and we can verify that Andrea Nemerson of the SFBG has written about the practice several times: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Awww.sfbg.com+Nemerson+%22Donkey+punch%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Awww.sfbg.com+Nemerson+%22Donkey+punch%22" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. I also found a reference at the Vue Weekly, an independent Edmonton paper: <a href="http://www.vueweekly.com/articles/default.aspx?i=4668" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vueweekly.com/articles/default.aspx?i=4668" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. At any rate, it doesn't seem that deletion is the correct remedy for this article being, as Jimbo says, "terrible." We can verify this with sources that are not UrbanDictionary. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 20:56, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Neither SF Bay Guardian nor Vue Weekly were one of the false sources that Jimbo struck out, as they were never in the article before. They seem to be new sources found by Hyperbole. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 22:41, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Once again we have the error of pointing to a Google search as if it constitutes research, rather than reading what the Google search turns up. Actually reading <a href="http://www.sfbg.com/37/15/x_alt_sex_column.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sfbg.com/37/15/x_alt_sex_column.html" rel="nofollow">the first SFBG article listed</a> what we find <i>that this journalist has actually written</i> is "Honey, get over it. There's no such thing as a 'donkey punch'.". In other articles, xe writes that this is "an imaginary icky sex act". Similarly, upon actually reading the Vue Weekly article one discovers a set of reader-contributed slang terms, which <i>doesn't even include "donkey punch"</i>. It merely mentions a donkey punch, without any explanation of what it is. There's no evidence that the list of reader contributions has been fact checked, and as a potential source the article is on the same level as Urban Dictionary — i.e. it's not a source at all. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:30, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I improved the article and took the position that what Nemerson said about it was notable, not what was reported in the letter. Since there's a similar statement by Dan Savage, they work nicely together. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 13:23, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The central tenet of the AfD nom, that any notability for the term is inherently unverifiable, in my opinion has yet to be proven. Jimbo's comments were for the article as written (then), not the topic in general. That Hyperbole seems to have found a perfectly fine reference for the term (from Nemerson) solidifies my opinion. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 22:33, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I strongly suggest actually reading the sources that you declare to be "perfectly fine". They aren't. In fact, they clearly state outright that this sex act does not exist. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:30, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You've missed the point, or you're being deliberately obtuse. Whether or not this act is ever practiced is largely irrelevent. Notability is derived from the use of the term as a cultural reference. The fact that so many sources mention the term (<i>especially</i> since they mention it without feeling the need to provide an actual definition) is in itself ample evidence that it is well known in popular culture. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 15:50, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wrong. Evidence that something is well known in popular culture is <i>some source saying that</i>. Counting mentions of a term and deducing (a) that the sexual act that is the subject of this article is therefore well known, and (b) that that sexual act is what those people are even referring to in the first place (rather than, say, the act of punching a donkey, or perhaps a cocktail) is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. Please stop trying to build this article from vapour and "cultural references" (which is apparently synonymous with "people naming various things Donkey Punch and characters in works of television fiction talking about donkey punches"). That bad approach to article construction is what has got us here in the first place. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> is setting a good example to follow. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:11, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"the act of punching a donkey"? Sheesh. I am well aware of what a primary source is and what a secondary source is, and I have stated repeatedly the need for better sourcing of this and almost all other Wikipedia articles. My comment was aimed at your contention that because the act may not exist it somehow should not be in here, ignoring the fact that the notability of the term is derived from its propagation as a meme, not from its existence per se. Vampires do not exist- we still have an article. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 23:59, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Uncle G is right. To cite an example, consider <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Burning_of_the_School_bc9b.html" title="The Burning of the School">The Burning of the School</a>, a song that's part of playground culture in the US and UK. That article is referenced, not because there are lots of "references" to the song it TV shows and whatnot, but because someone actually did some research and wrote books documenting the folklore of children. Those books are cited in the article, and they're what makes the topic verifiable, and not original research. When someone publishes a book in which they chronicle joke sex moves as a cultural phenomenon, and they talk about the Donkey Punch in that book, which they'd better if their book is any good, then we'll have something to work with. Surely you can see the difference between that and a Southpark episode in which Cartman makes a Donkey Punch joke. The book may cite the Southpark episode as an example; it's our job to find and cite the book.

<dd>It <i>is</i> a vote - but simply one in which a simple majority (or indeed a supermajority) need not carry the motion. Anyone who presents a possible resolution or expresses their will is "voting". There is in any case a difference between "a vote" (as a collective noun) and "a vote" singular. In the case above, I was obviously referring to the latter. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 04:10, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And I was simply repeating the usual mantra that effectively says "let's not refer to these as "votes", as much as we can avoid it, because we don't want to reinforce the impression that these discussions should be thought of as votes." In the sense that a "vote" is nothing more than a formal expression of will, these recommendations we're making are "votes", but it's really better not to call them that, IMO. The word way too easily brings a whole raft of expectations with it that we'd like to avoid. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 05:22, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the average editor is likely to be clever enough to distinguish between a vote (which this is) and a <i>majority</i> vote (which this is not). It is perfectly reasonable (and parsimonious) to refer to an individual expression of opinion here (<b>k</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>merge</b>, whatever) as a vote. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 18:40, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Shout people down"? I thought I was very polite and calm about it? What does one have to do to suggest a different way of speaking around here and not be thought a belligerent asshole? I'm not trying to have an argument with you, nor to belittle "the average editor". I sincerely believe there are good reasons for choosing words carefully - I've seen way too many people treat these discussions as majority votes to think that nobody makes that mistake, or that we needn't be vigilant about guarding against that misperception. But honestly, "shout people down"? I apologize for offending your sensibilities, and beg your forgiveness for any inadvertent offense I caused. I shall continue to refer to my recommendations in AfDs as "recommendations", and I promise I won't bother you about it again. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 20:32, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. There's a difference between verifying this is a real sex act and verifying this is a notable joke. The article has sources now, including books describing the act and columnists talking about it (much better than before, when all we had was a long obnoxious list of pop culture references.) It seems that the real issue is whether or not those sources are good enough the establish the encyclopedic value of the article. If not, it implies sufficient sources are unlikely to be found at all, considering this is the best anyone's been able to do. Either way, this has implications for many other articles we have about even less notable fake sex acts and internet urban legends.--<a href="../../../c/u/c/User%7ECuchullain_f14f.html" title="User:Cuchullain">Cúchullain</a> <a href="../../../c/u/c/User_talk%7ECuchullain_0f10.html" title="User talk:Cuchullain"><sup>t</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cuchullain_2c21.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cuchullain"><small>c</small></a> 23:09, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
