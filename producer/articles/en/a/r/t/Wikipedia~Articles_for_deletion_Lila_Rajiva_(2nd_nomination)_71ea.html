<dd><b>Comment</b> That does not qualify for <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> at all. The criteria are:
<ul>
<li>The person is regarded as a significant expert in their area by independent sources.</li>
<li>The person is regarded as an important figure by those in the same field.</li>
<li>The person has published a large quantity of academic work (of at least reasonable quality).</li>
<li>The person has published a well-known academic work.</li>
<li>The person is known for originating an important new concept, theory or idea.</li>
<li>The person is known for their involvement in significant events relating to their academic achievements.</li>
<li>The person is known for being the advisor of an especially notable student.</li>
<li>The person has received a notable award or honor, or has been often nominated for them.</li>

<dd>None of those things are proven in the article. Further, the notability for authors requires four published books. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 17:10, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How exactly does listing [all of] the above respond to another blackletter listing on <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> that "An academic who has published a book of general interest, a widely-used textbook, or non-academic articles in periodicals with significant readership is notable as an author, <i>regardless of their academic achievements</i> (emphasis supplied). The problem, of course, is how to define "general interest." That appears to speak to subject matter, i.e., not a textbook or treatment of arcane matters, but listing all the criteria in the first section there, and not treating the one I am obviously citing, is not responsive. I am always willing to consider new information. In this case I am changing my vote, but for a different reason, having checked other sources I see that the above section I have cited is poorly drafted (and needs to be reformed). In the main precedents section it is stated that: "Published authors are notable if they have received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work." That criteria she appears to fail and I agree with to an extent, though I do think the criteria for academics is out of balance with the too liberal standards which allow the keeping of all manner of cruft.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 17:38, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly, general interest is a subjective term thus I do not discuss notability based on that criteria but a work certainly isn't general interest simply because it's on Amazon.com.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 17:42, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> 2 hits on google scholar and 91 google hits is a very poor score for notability for an academic. An academic's main function is to publish and engage in discussions, and the internet typically plays a major part in this, so one should expect a higher google count for a notable academic.

<li><b>Delete</b> Fails proftest miserably. I'm sorry, but teaching "at" a university without any indication of tenure-track is a pretty shoddy level of "academic".

<dd>I'm not debating it. I am willing to discuss the AfD because, afterall, this is a discussion. But all users who come to this page see that it has been renominated because they see the large article title at the top which reads: "Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lila Rajiva (2nd nomination)" The 2nd nomination part is clearly visable to all users who come to this AfD discussion. It is also clearly visable in the AfD tag on the main page of the article which tells the users it is a 2nd nomination. All users should read the article before they discuss it in the AfD discussion. There's absolutely no point in me stating that it's a second nomination. It would be simply redundant and silly. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 02:54, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, in that case, I guess you should continue not to link to earlier AfD discussions such as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lila_Rajiva_ee67.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lila Rajiva">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lila Rajiva</a>. Nor should you attempt any explanation for why it was massively kept on AfD not so long ago, or why we should ignore the earlier debate (effectively thumbing our noses at all those previous participants). Meanwhile, I will continue to indulge my silly, redundant habit of pointing out those sorts of pointless links every time. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:07, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> seems to be just barely notable per above arguements. Also, its always a mistake not address the first nomination in a renomination. Failure to address it, suggests, there's no flaw in the first, and no new reason, but merely a dislike at the outcome. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:58, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems to me that some arguments for deletion here would generally apply to stubs. The fact that an article is a stub in itself cannot be regarded as a criteroin for deletion.
