</dl>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. Discounting anons and new editors, and with 2 extra delete voices since relisting, I think consensus is clear. I probably should have closed as delete rather than relisting in the first place but now there's no excuse not to close it that way. Furthermore, as for arguments raised, he would appear to be borderline on notability and most editors felt that he wasn't quite there yet. He's a young man and maybe he will become more notable in the future, there's no rush. This is an enyclopedia and it's meant to stand the test of time. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 06:12, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>COMMENT</b> - Kittybrewster who nominated this for deletion vandalised Kirill's page making it blatantly POV: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kirill_Makharinsky&amp;diff=48771995&amp;oldid=48767856" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kirill_Makharinsky&amp;diff=48771995&amp;oldid=48767856" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kirill_Makharinsky&amp;diff=48771995&amp;oldid=48767856</a> The two Delete votes below saw this version of the article and therefore their votes must be invalidated unless they vote again looking at the actual version. <a href="../../../d/e/z/User%7EDezhnev_08f7.html" title="User:Dezhnev">Dezhnev</a> 10:35, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>As Heycos pointed out, this article has always been blatantly POV. Pages are always being improved and it is mistifying why Dezhnev is troubled that his POV is brought to the fore.<a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a> 10:59, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Unsalvagable self-promotion and vanity. If he is truly notable in the future someone else will start an article about him. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkestone_e60a.html" title="User:Hawkestone">Hawkestone</a> 01:27, 17 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - What do you mean he has done nothing, no sources it says at the bottom <a href="http://www.kirillonline.com" class="external free" title="http://www.kirillonline.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.kirillonline.com</a> everything is there. <a href="../../../d/e/z/User%7EDezhnev_08f7.html" title="User:Dezhnev">Dezhnev</a> 10:27, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b>. This is still advertisement or sycophancy. It remains strong POV. It is all written by Dezhnev (a new user), who is probably the same person as Macaroni. 84.70.175.84 10:52, 17 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Regarding POV, how can one help it if everything they have done is positive and there is nothing negative to say? <a href="../../../d/e/z/User%7EDezhnev_08f7.html" title="User:Dezhnev">Dezhnev</a> 11:02, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Over 200 pages on Google about him from sites like The Economist, The Guardian, York Evening Press, Russian London, Ecademy, RealWorld magazine, official sites of Oxford, Warwick and Greenwich universities etc. <a href="../../../e/b/a/User%7EEBayVP_3da9.html" title="User:EBayVP">EBayVP</a> 18:32, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Notable 160.83.32.14 09:05, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the POV/bias argument is stupid since you can't find anything negative to say in article. 158.143.133.70 18:57, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Sepentrionalis/Pmanderson is acting like a spoilt child who cannot get their way. Maybe, just maybe the above is normally signed in but this time wasn't, maybe they didn't realise they were logged out, or maybe this is the only time they've felt strongly enough to want to post here. You are also lying that eBayVP's previous edits are all incomplete nominations, as his two deletion requests had been deleted. Stop trying to judge people on how many times they have posted, that is completely irrelevant and discriminatory. <a href="../../../d/e/z/User%7EDezhnev_08f7.html" title="User:Dezhnev">Dezhnev</a> 08:50, 22 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Much of this comment speaks for itself. It may well be true other edits by EBayVP have been deleted; but if he's not Dezhnev's sockpuppet, how does Dezhnev know? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 16:56, 22 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have no doubt that EBayVP is Dezhnev's sockpuppet and Dezhnev has acknowledged he is a close relation of Kirill who is proud of Kirill - which is just fine. I think he would be better off watching this space; it is hugely relevant that EBayVP and Dezhnev are virtually non-contributors to other entries. They have staggered into the room for this topic alone and it would be strange indeed if their views were not discounted accordingly. - <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a> 17:58, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Borderline notability. If it is kept, it needs to be wikified/cleaned up. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 07:20, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. As Metamagician says, the subject exhibits borderline notability. I tried to make the article presentable, but if kept, it needs much more work (and will anyone actually <i>do</i> that work?). <a href="../../../a/n/v/User%7EAnville_a648.html" title="User:Anville">Anville</a> 09:54, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - some of you may be outside UK, right now Kirill is getting huge coverage including national newspapers everyone knows who he is. 129.67.52.37 22:33, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Goodness sake. Highest calibre graduate in the entire UK is certainly more notable than half the people entries on this site. And no, before any pedants step in, I am not a "sockpuppet" and have not met Kiril in person. <a href="../../../g/o/y/User%7EGOY2006_2dd4.html" title="User:GOY2006">GOY2006</a> 03:20, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - My objection is to Kiril inserting himself as one of the great people of St Johns College, Oxford. This link is what I have a problem with. Kiril is obviously a gifted and well positioned young man. It may be a little preemptive to call him one of the greats of a very old college. Metaphorically, when one's child pronounces that s/he wishes to be an astronaut when they are grown up, it absurd to expect their name to be immediately added to NASA's astronauts list. Let Kiril live his life. If it turns out as he hopes, it will be added. If not, he will avoid embarrasing himself. Oxford is not going anywhere, it can afford to wait - commentator, St Cross College, Oxford and former member Darwin College, Cambridge</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - achievements to date include going to school, university, and playing games. Well done him. Now he should go and do something worthwhile. I dispute that he <i>is getting huge coverage [...] everyone knows who he is</i>: what is he supposed to have done - and no links are included in the article. Precisely the sort of self-aggrandising rubbish that should be saved for his User page rather than the main Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajor_Bonkers_92c3.html" title="User:Major Bonkers">Major Bonkers</a> 20:44, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is ridiculous. I am at St John's. He's an unknown arrogant twat. Delete him!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> please, I'm fine with seeing him later, per "commentator, St Cross". --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_alf_522c.html" title="User:Wiki alf">Alf</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWiki_alf_56f1.html" title="User talk:Wiki alf"><font color="green">melmac</font></a></sup> 21:25, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>those speaking negatively are posting hilarious comments not based on facts and not in the spirit of wikipedia. how do you know kirill added himself as a great of st johns? or even contributed to this article? or cares whether he's on here or not? i suggest commenting only if you have access to facts, in an objective manner and on him personally only if you know him well. Just as should be the case for everyone on Wikipedia.</p>
