<p>The club was founded in 2001 and entered the AFLSQ the following year. In its short history the <b>Griffith University Gladiators</b> have finished runners up in 2003 (Division 3) and in 2004 (Division 1), in its first year with reserves.</p>
<p>The Club features some of the best amature Australian Football facilities in Queensland. It is known for its state-of-the-art lights, club rooms and playing surface. The facilities have been used by QLD representative teams and the MtGravatt Vultures, a local AFLQ club.</p>
<p>The coming years will continue to see the clubs rapid growth, as Griffith University commits more resources into it.</p>

<p>PDC originally Pill Dem Crew later changed to Poverty Driven Children. Is a South London gang that has its base in the heart of brixton. It was origially formed by second and third generation Jamaican immigrants as a way to fight the poverty they faced in council estates during the early ninetees. Most members of PDC today are Afro-Caribbeans, however due to its recent collaboration with the Muslim Boys and gangs such as South Muslim Soldiers, PDC has members from the BLack comunity of Somali's and Asian of Pakistan'a community, and to a lesser extent Turkish and Middle Easterners. According to the Metropolitan Police, PDC together with the muslim boys are the most dominant gang in South-West London currently with its members known to go around schools recruiting young boys to join. The gang members indulge in crime such as Cocane dealing and robbery's, however it is largley seen as the catalyst in the rising gun crime seen in South-West London. Its members are said to move from house to house and therefore are difficult to be tracked.</p>
<p><b>Music</b> More recently PDC has pursued a career in rap Music, with the opening of Channel U and the recent rise in popularity of British Urban Music, PDC released a song named fallen soldiers dedicated to death of one of their affiliates known as "Jus-co". The song won good air play on Channel U and was the first sign of PDC trying to do something positive. However as with the So Solid crew the government and Police intervened with their Music Sucess, due to Police request PDC was banned from Channel U and their video was dropped from the channel. However the banned has not stopped members of PDC making considerable moves in the rap industry. Rappers Such as Quinny and Ja Ja Soulz are well known in the underground circuiT, even more so is rapper Logic whos album "The Gaberlunzie" has won critical acclaim on the streets for its positive messages and his mixtape with rapper Lowkey is schedueled for a highly anticipated realease. Prehaps the most successful rapper from PDC, is Muslim Rapper Devious. His Emotional and Conscious songs such as "Muslim Brothers" and "Marjay" are classics in the underground.</p>

<p>Chester is a sarcastic critical yet smart cat with a wild imagination. He is convinced that Bunnicula the family bunny is a vampire(for more information on this subject and other charcters read the books by James Howe.) He constantly criticizes Harold and later the hapless puppy Howe but is actually great friends with both. One strange idea of his is that on Saint George's day the Devil has sway and evil spirits are rampant. He tryed to destroy Bunnicula one time by trying to drive a stake into his heart. But he picked the wrong kind of stake and instead ruined the family's dinner. He reads Edgar Allan Poe and Stephen King plus many other tales and movies of horror and the supernatural. Once when he was seeing a cat psychiatrist he started reading Finding Yourself By Screaming Alot.That pretty much sums him up. If you want to find out more browse the net or read the books.</p>

<p>Traffic is a simulator being developed by INTEX. It simulates public transportation networks in real-world cities. Instead of having grapics compairable to most simulators today, Traffic has very simple graphics, the city is represented by a road map and the vehicles are icons that travel along routes. However, due to the simple graphics, each city has a realistic number of inhabatants, i.e., Koln has 1.3 million people on the map, and the program allows many more routes than other programs. The demo has been released with the map of Koln. City List (so far): 1. Köln (demo map) 2. Berlin 3. London 4. Paris 5. New York 6. Rom 7. Madrid 8. Moskau 9. Amsterdam 10. Istanbul 11. Sydney 12.

<p><i>Microsystems Software, Inc. v. Scandinavia Online AB</i> is a <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> US District Court civil case, numbered 00-cv10488-EFH, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. It received considerable attention in the online community because it involved <a href="../../../r/e/v/Reverse_engineering.html" title="Reverse engineering">reverse engineering</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptanalysis.html" title="Cryptanalysis">cryptanalysis</a> of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Content-control_software.html" title="Content-control software">content-control software</a>, allegedly in violation of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> law and a <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clickwrap.html" title="Clickwrap">clickwrap</a> license agreement.</p>
<p>In early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, Eddy L. O. Jansson and Matthew Skala reverse engineered the content-control package Cyber Patrol and published a report titled <i>The Breaking of Cyber Patrol® 4</i> detailing what they found, including a <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptanalysis.html" title="Cryptanalysis">cryptanalysis</a> of the <a href="../../../c/r/c/CRC-32_5917.html" title="CRC-32">CRC-32</a>-based <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hash_function.html" title="Hash function">hash function</a> that concealed the configuration password and Web site and <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a> newsgroup blacklists. They commented critically on the content of the blacklist, and highlighted apparent errors in it, innocuous sites and newsgroups blocked as objectionable for no visible reason. Along with the essay, they included software in C and Delphi demonstrating the attacks and allowing users to disable the package, change its configuration, or browse the blacklists in decrypted form. The break was widely reported on March 11, 2000. <a href="http://slashdot.org/yro/00/03/11/117240.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://slashdot.org/yro/00/03/11/117240.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>On March 15, Microsystems Software, the publisher of Cyber Patrol, and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattel.html" title="Mattel">Mattel</a>, its parent company, filed suit against Jansson, Skala, and the ISPs that hosted their personal Web sites, Scandinavia Online and Islandnet. They filed in US court, though Jansson and Scandinavia Online were located in <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> and Skala and Islandnet were located in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. They alleged that the reverse engineering was copyright infringement by Jansson and Skala; that distributing the essay and software (or, in the case of Islandnet, the link on Skala's site pointing to the essay and software on Jansson's site) was copyright infringement by the ISPs; and that Jansson and Skala's actions constituted breach of the <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clickwrap.html" title="Clickwrap">clickwrap</a> license agreement on Cyber Patrol, interference with advantageous business relations, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conversion_%28law%29.html" title="Conversion (law)">conversion</a>, and theft of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_secret.html" title="Trade secret">trade secrets</a>. <a href="http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/lawpoli/youthrights/cpbfaq.php#whatclaims" class="external autonumber" title="http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/lawpoli/youthrights/cpbfaq.php#whatclaims" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Once the lawsuit became known, it attracted considerable attention from the online community, far overshadowing the discussion of the reverse engineering itself. <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,34998,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,34998,00.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>In response to demands from the plaintiffs, Scandinavia Online deleted Jansson's Web site and Islandnet asked Skala to remove his link to Jansson's (now non-existent anyway) Web site. The document and software had already been mirrored on many sites worldwide, however. The plaintiffs asked for, and received, a temporary restraining order against distribution of what they termed the "bypass code", and were authorized to serve it by email on mirror sites, along with a subpoena demanding the identities of every Web user who accessed the information. <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,35196,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,35196,00.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Some commentators dubbed these email-distributed subpoenas "spampoenas"; use of email for official service of court documents was, and remains, highly unusual if not absolutely unheard of. <a href="http://tbtf.com/jargon-scout.html#spampoena" class="external autonumber" title="http://tbtf.com/jargon-scout.html#spampoena" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>On March 27, Skala announced that he had settled the cases against him (including one filed in a Canadian court as well as the US case) out of court and that Jansson was close to doing the same, with an agreement to stop distributing the essay and software and assign its copyrights to the plaintiffs. <a href="http://cryptome.org/skala.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://cryptome.org/skala.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Other parties had become involved, however, including three mirror site operators associated with <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peacefire.html" title="Peacefire">Peacefire</a> and backed by the <a href="../../../a/c/l/ACLU_cdbb.html" title="ACLU">ACLU</a>. The suit continued with the main issue being whether those mirror sites would also be forced to stop distributing the material. When their motions on that topic were dismissed, the mirror sites took that as an indication that they could continue to distribute it safely.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some controversy erupted when news sources suggested that the exploit software had been released under the <a href="../../../g/p/l/GPL_a75a.html" title="GPL">GPL</a>, making any restriction on its distribution problematic. <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,35226,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,35226,00.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> Statements from Jansson and Skala denying any intention to place it under the GPL, the lack of any copyright notice in Skala's code, and a vague nonstandard GPL notice in Jansson's code, made it fall apart as a possible GPL test case.

<p>SMS aka South man Syndicate/South Muslim Soldiers, Is a South London gang that originates from Stretham South London, however has members from Brixton, Clapham and Peckham. The gang was originally started at time when tensions resided between the Afro-Caribbean and Somali community in stretham. Stretham is a inner city who's main inahibbitants were people of Jamaican descant. However during the mid ninetees (during the Somalian Civil war) an influx of Somali assylum seekers entered Britain and mainly settled in areas like Stretham and Woolich. During the years the Somali community segregated itself from the other black communitys, and tensions grew when Somali owned businesses opended specifically for the Somali community, such as a Internet Cafe on Stretham high street. Even though the tensions did not rise to an extent of a racial riot, Somali and Jamaican gangs were fighting on Iscolated incidents. Thus, the creation of SMS was a defence force for Somalians in stretham, however the meaning of the gang changed when members of other Black gangs such as PDC were converting to Islam. Through religion different gangs in South London found a way to unite, and therefore the concept of the "Muslim Boys" came about. This was a Unification of Gangs mainly with in South-west London consisting of (SMS PDC and the Stockwell Crew). Unlike PDC and the Stockwell crew, which is predominantly Black, SMS's ethnic make up is vastly mixed, it has large amounts of Pakistani and Blacks in the gang including a few white members who are converts to Islam. The Muslim boys claim to have links with Al-Qaeda, however these have been denied by the police who say the gangs claim to use that link to gain street credablilty. The creation of the Muslim boys has raised the question of poverty within the Muslim population in London and the sudden radicalisation amongst Muslim Youths. Certain Muslim leaders believe that Gang members are using Islam as a tool to indoctrinate youths in gang activity. However SMS is known as the most violent gang within "The Muslim Boys". There have been reports of violent street muggings, often forcing victims to say Shahada, and discriminately robbing people who they believe are non-Muslims. Others believe that the creation of "The Muslim Boys" is an act of unification between Muslims, and due to the aftermath of 9/11 and 7/7 and the rise of Islamophobia, Muslims of different Ethnic backgrounds have united to protect the Muslim community.</p>

<p>Sheep bloat, also referred to as pasture bloat <a href="http://beef.osu.edu/library/bloat.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://beef.osu.edu/library/bloat.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> or green legume bloat, is a condition caused by a build-up of gas and pressure in the sheep, where the normal release of gas through the esophagus is blocked. The ingestion of green legumes such as alfalfa and clover causes a drop in the pH levels and a chain reaction ultimately leading to the production of a frothy substance that blocks the cardia and prevents eructation and gas release.</p>
<p>Striking quickly and often lethal, the first symptom of sheep bloat is usually a dead sheep. Modern treatments include the use of a stomach tube or antifoaming agents such as mineral or vegetable oils. A somewhat more dramatic treatment is the rumenotomy, the puncturing of the rumen to allow pressure release - as shown in the film adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd. <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0061648/" class="external autonumber" title="http://imdb.com/title/tt0061648/" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>

<p><br />
Mojo magazine recently wrote, "the debut album was Bruce Arnold and Orpheus at their best, 'Can't Find The Time'...just beautiful." I could not agree more, however, as gorgeous as Arnold's hit single is - with it's R&amp;B influenced chord progressions, (a passing resemblance to Billy Stewart's "Sitting In The Park") and very tasteful yet refrained orchestral arrangement, "Can't Find The Time" is not the best song on this album. Although I was duly impressed with Arnold's intricate guitar work on the "Uncovered" version (included on Big Beat's 1995 "Best of Orpheus" compilation), I have begun to appreciate just how well producer Alan Lorber understood this band - or more importantly, understood Bruce Arnold.</p>
<p>Imagine how easily Orpheus could've fallen into the hands of some amateurish 60's producer with formulaic arranging skills such as Wes Ferrell, (whom the band wisely turned down). The results would have been a sound closer to the horrific 1971 arrangement of "Can't Find The Time" by Rose Colored Glass. Let's face it, Bruce Arnold was not writing rock songs. He was and is a far more sophisticated composer. However, as soon as this album hit the shelves in 1968, a small yet vocal group of music critics and "would be" fans objected to what they called "over-orchestration". They complained that the band's true sound was drowned out by Lorber's MOR treatment. Interestingly, this view has been adopted by subsequent generations, most of which have never actually sat down and listened to an Orpheus album in it's entirety.</p>
<p>Because of this fact, it's extremely difficult to determine whether the seemingly widespread disdain for Alan Lorber is due to his key role in the Boston Sound debacle or if listeners actually believe his influence ruined the music of Orpheus. Either way, one thing is clear; in 1968, very few people could complain that the band's true sound was lost since very few people had actually heard them play live. It was recently revealed by bassist, Eric Gulliksen that Orpheus only played two gigs before flying to New York to begin recording - and perhaps even more surprising is the recent revelation that despite the LP credits, neither Gulliksen or drummer Harry Sandler even play on this album!</p>
<p>Bruce Arnold, either alone or with Gulliksen, was composing music for the masses. The problem was that his instrumental compositions and vocal harmonies were so sophisticated they could not be categorized - at least not yet. In a few years, bands like Chicago, Bread and even Steely Dan would help define the sound but for now, Alan Lorber was without a doubt the best man to, as he put it, "distill their symbiotic harmonies."</p>
<p>Track Notes:</p>
<p>1. "I've Never Seen Love Like This" - Upon hearing a demo for "Can't Find The Time", Wes Ferrell told Arnold, "write another song like that and I'll sign you." Arnold responded by writing this number with a verse or two contributed by Gulliksen. It actually surpasses "CFTT" for commercial appeal and sets an early high water mark for the Arnold / Lorber collaboration. Listen to the "Anatomy of" version included on Big Beat's "Best of" compilation for a fascinating view of the song's construction.</p>
<p>2. "Lesley's World" - Penned specifically for Arnold by Alan Lorber's then wife, Lesley Miller. The track begins with Lorber improving on the intro from fellow arranger Jimmy Webb's "Up-Up And Away" to create a more interesting and personal song. Both songs address the idea of romantic escape, however, "Lesley's World" does it in a more mature way. "Up-Up And Away" sounds like it was written for teenagers while "Lesley's World" was intended for thirty-something’s. This song was actually released several months prior to the album's debut and received moderate airplay along with it's A-side, "Can't Find The Time."</p>
<p>3. "Congress Alley" - Arnold's friend and fellow "alley" inhabitant, Steve Martin, auditioned this song as a possible Orpheus track. Arnold wisely grabbed it but not before completely rearranging it for the band. Listen to Martin's own version available on his website (www.stephenbmartin.com) and you will appreciate the distinct differences between the two artists. After "CFTT," "Congress Alley" is the second most covered song originally performed by Orpheus. Later versions were recorded by The Alan Lorber Orchestra, Clean Living and a group called Congress Alley, headed up by former Doo-Wop legend, Lee Andrews.</p>
<p>4. "Music Machine" - Another Martin penned track except this time written especially for Orpheus and about Orpheus (the machine that was "pumping out a pretty tune"). Arnold has been noted as saying this song loosely dealt with God, pointing to lyrics such as, "the things that we saw 'bout my Father and his law made me want to lay down and die" as well as "I had a thing about a bird on a wing that was calling to me from outside." One of Lorber's finest arrangements, the well-phrased lead vocal was actually done by Jack McKenes with Brian Wilson-like vocal direction from Arnold.</p>
<p>5. "Door Knob Song" - Arnold and Lorber use all three of Martin's compositions to complete side one of the LP and I'm hard-pressed to decide which song, this or "The Dream", does a better job of encapsulating this fantastic album. Whereas "Music Machine" only implied a spiritual theme, "Door Knob Song" dives straight into the Bible and comes out with sympathetic references to the fallen angels of Genesis as "the heroes and the villains," who are "silent when the games are named" and "seldom cry"..."they've forgotten how to fly." Scott Walker couldn't touch this track with a mile long pole. The orchestral arrangement is breathtaking and again, Arnold's phrasing rivals Sinatra at his best. The last "da da'n da" before the chello's finale still causes goosebumps. An absolute genius.</p>
<p>6. "I'll Stay With You" - Side 2 of the LP begins with what is arguably the band's most under appreciated song. If there is a track more deserving of Billboard's number one spot in the spring of 1968, I don't know it. Apparently, "I'll Stay With You" did receive some minor regional airplay in New England but it's power did little more than strengthen an already growing number of devoted young Orpheus fans such as Brad Delp, (lead singer of Boston) and Laura Nyro.</p>
<p>7. "Can't Find The Time" - So fumbled by MGM in 1967 that they reissued it a year later and again a year after that! Reaching only #80 in 1969, it would have been no less a tragedy if it had climbed to #20. This is the song that currently classifies Orpheus as a "one-hit wonder" but mark my words, it will become just a small chapter in the biography that future generations will write about Arnold and this band.</p>
<p>8. "Never In My Life" - Rumored to have been considered for release by 'Old Blue Eyes himself, this lovely 3/4 time gem showcases Arnold's sophisticated writing skills (only 19-years old when he wrote it), as well as Lorber's sheer enthusiasm for the material. Along with Bernard Purdie, (uncredited drummer), and Joe Macho Jr. (uncreditied bass player), Arnold creates a thrilling undercurrent, which Lorber uses as a foundation for some wild yet beautiful orchestration.</p>
<p>9. "The Dream" - Irene Trudel, DJ for WFMU in New York repeatedly refers to this as one of the most beautiful songs ever written. In a e-mail correspondence I had with Arnold, he revealed that after performing this song for the legendary Ali Akbar Khan in 1972, Khan was so moved he invited Arnold to stay at his home for as long as he pleased. The favor was later repaid when Arnold used his political connections to have Khan's birthday recognized as Ali Akbar Khan Day in the state of California. The late Collin Walcott, one of Khan's disciples, adds beautiful Indian instrumentation to the track and Lorber's refrained orchestration was so poignant on it's own that he later included a version (sans Arnold's voice and guitar) on the reissue of his "Lotus Palace" CD in 1996.</p>

<p>Wind Shear NoteS</p>
<p>Wind shear is a difference in wind speed or direction between two points in the atmosphere. Depending whether the two points are at different altitudes or at geographically different locations, shear can be either vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>Wind shear can affect aircraft airspeed during take off and landing in disastrous ways. An explanation in regard to vertical wind shear can be seen here: (wind gradient). It is also a key factor governing the severity of thunderstorms. An additional hazard is turbulence often associated with wind shear. Wind shear also generally inhibits tropical cyclone development.</p>
<p>Weather situations when shear is observed are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weather fronts. Significant shear is observed, when the temperature difference across the front is 5 °C or more, and the front moves at 15 kt or faster. Because fronts are three-dimensional phenomena, frontal shear can be observed at any altitude between surface and tropopause.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Obstacles to flow. When wind above a mountain blows from the direction of the mountain, vertical shear is observed on the lee side.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Inversions. When on a clear and calm night, a radiation inversion is formed near the ground, the friction does not affect wind above the inversion top. Change in wind can be 90 degrees in direction and 40 kt in speed. Even a nocturnal low level jet can sometimes be observed. Density difference causes additional problems to aviation</li>
<li>By virtue of the physical processes involved, spatial variations in the magnitude and extent of microthermal activity within the ground layer occurs at the micro-scale to sub-mesoscale (100 m to 10 km). Consequently, ground layer effects are important in determining local scale variations in site quality following the selection of an observatory site.</li>
<li>If the site is located on a mountain range oriented perpendicularly to the prevailing wind the air is forced to flow over the mountain barrier. The air stream is compressed and therefore accelerates, creating a wind shear that may be strong enough to support turbulent mixing. If air being mixed in this manner has different temperatures enhanced microthermal activity will occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wind shear occurs between two air currents in the atmosphere that are traveling at different speeds or in different directions. The friction that occurs at the boundary of these two currents is an indication of wind shear. Wind shear is a crucial factor in the development of other atmospheric phenomena. For example, as the difference between adjacent wind currents increases, the wind shear also increases. At some point, the boundary between currents may break apart and form eddies (circular currents) that can develop into clear air turbulence or, in more drastic circumstances, tornadoes and other violent storms. Under certain storm conditions, a wind shear will travel in a vertical direction. The phenomenon is known as a microburst, a strong downdraft or air which, when it reaches the ground, continues to spread out horizontally. An airplane that attempts to fly through a microburst feels, in rapid succession, an additional lift from headwinds and then a sudden loss of lift from tailwinds. In such a case, a pilot may not be able to maintain control of the aircraft in time to prevent a crash.</p>
<p>Astronomical seeing refers to the blurring and twinkling of astronomical objects such as stars caused by turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. The astronomical seeing conditions on a given night at a given location describe how much the Earth's atmosphere perturbs the images of stars as seen through a telescope Astronomical seeing has several effects:</p>
<ol>
<li>It causes the images of point-sources (e.g., stars) to break up into speckle patterns, which change very rapidly with time (the resulting speckled images can be processed using speckle imaging)</li>
<li>Long exposure images of these changing speckle patterns result in a blurred image of the point source, called a seeing disc</li>
<li>The brightness of stars appears to fluctuate in a process known as scintillation or twinkling</li>
<li>Atmospheric seeing causes the fringes in an astronomical interferometer to move rapidly</li>
<li>The distribution of atmospheric seeing through the atmosphere (the CN2 profile described below) causes the image quality in adaptive optics systems to degrade the further you look from the location of reference star</li>
</ol>

<p>An Epic Conviction is an American rock band out of Red Bank, New Jersey. They're music ranges from post-hardcore to emo. The band was started by singer Eric Ramas, guitar players Chris Thompson and Kevin Gajewski and drummer Mike Bergamo. In April of 2006, they added bassist James Carroll to the lineup. Before the Summer of 2006, An Epic Conviction decided to break-up citing personal differences and the inability to get along with one another. However, in August of 2006 they have decided to get back together.</p>

<p><br />
In April of '68, while touring with his band in support of their debut album (released in January of that year), Orpheus leader Bruce Arnold was instructed by Alan Lorber to prepare songs for a follow-up LP. The sessions would take place at Mayfair Studios in New York and the resulting album would hit the stores that summer! Probably sensing the deadline would be tight, Lorber is said to have proposed that Arnold re-arrange two cover songs, (The Left Banke’s "Walk Away Renee" and The Zombies’ "She’s Not There"). These songs, together with some leftover material intended for the first album, would serve as the foundation for what would become Orpheus Ascending.</p>
<p>The songs believed to be recorded for (but not appearing on) the first album were all Arnold-penned tracks. These included "I'll Fly", "So Far Away In Love" and "Just A Little Bit" (the latter two songs were written while he was performing in the folk duo, The Villagers). Arnold is quoted to have said he was somewhat surprised to find only nine tracks on the first album, which suggests these songs may have been recorded at Bell Sound Studios in 1967. If this is so, one could assume that Lorber intentionally saved this material for the second album.</p>
<p>There is only one problem with this theory. The drums and bass on the aforementioned tracks are definitely not legendary session players, Bernard Purdie and Joe Macho Jr., (who both played on the first album). The sloppy cymbal-heavy drumming style is that of Harry Sandler (a self-professed novice) and the steady-stream-of-notes bass belongs to Eric Gulliksen. So it seems that somewhere along the line, Lorber decided to dump the two session players from the three backing tracks. But why?</p>
<p>From recent information, which has appeared online, we now know that although Lorber had no intention of using either member on record, Gulliksen and Sandler had begun bitterly complaining to Arnold and as a result, the two were allowed to record. Thankfully by 1969, Arnold had become more confident in his authority and began to produce his music much the same way his followers, Donald Fagan and Walter Becker would in the coming years.</p>
<p>Although Bernard Purdie and Joe Macho Jr. had an extremely tight and professional sound, the same, unfortunately, cannot be said about Harry Sandler and Eric Gulliksen. Orpheus Ascending still featured Lorber's brilliant orchestration coupled with Arnold's fabulous singing and intricate guitar work, but the album was too often muddled by a weak rhythm section.</p>
<p>1. "I’ll Fly" – Written by Arnold and sung by Jack McKenes, this is a fantastic pop tune hampered by a sloppy rhythm section and muddy mix. First recorded as part of a nine-song demo in the summer of ’67, Gulliksen claims that acetates of the demo were shopped around to the major labels resulting in eight contract offers. The band, however, chose to audition their repertoire live for both Wes Farrell and Alan Lorber. Strong evidence suggests that the basic track for "I’ll Fly" was actually recorded during the sessions for the first Orpheus album. This would mean that an alternate version featuring session musicians, Joe Macho Jr. and Bernard Purdie might exist. I imagine this alternate version would be a vast improvement over the one included on the album.</p>
<p>Sandler’s sporadic and nonsensical drum fills completely destroy the song’s straightforward beat and Gulliksen’s bass figures are dated - pure fluff. It’s no wonder Lorber opted for session musicians. That being stated, it’s a mystery why MGM decided not to issue this as a single in ‘68. In fact, "Orpheus Ascending" yielded no singles at all. My guess is that since MGM was still harvesting singles from the first album; Lorber may have opted to showcase this record as a stand-alone effort.</p>
<p>2. "Just Got Back" – Thanks to friend and neighbor, Bruce Arnold, writer Steve Martin had three of his songs featured on the first Orpheus album. Arnold continued their collaboration with this cryptic rocker. Full of interesting references to time (i.e. the future, crystal ball, etc.), the song is difficult to decipher. But as with "Music Machine", (from the first album), Martin again appears to be referring to Orpheus with the lines,</p>
<p>"Put it on the radio. Find a meaning for the word fantastic. Put it on the radio, singing: Mama’s learning how to be plastic."</p>
<p>Arnold’s acoustic intro and distorted electric riff are a nice juxtaposition.</p>
<p>3. "Mine’s Yours" – Arnold introduces listeners to a perfect example of what would become his trademark sound. A serious of unusual major seventh and augmented ninth chords delicately played with a unique finger-style all his own. A guitarist that puts Steven Stills in his place with a voice that rivals Sinatra. Gulliksen finds an equally unconventional bass line, which beautifully compliments Arnold’s guitar – evidence that he at least understood the balladeer side of Arnold.</p>
<p>4. "Don’t Be So Serious" – This could have been a nice upbeat radio-friendly track if it had not been for Sandler’s embarrassingly sloppy drumming. Gulliksen tries to fit too many notes into his changes and would have better served the track by choosing a more conservative bass line. Lorber emulates George Martin’s contributions to The Beatles "Good Morning, Good Morning" by throwing in silly cartoon noises including, of course, a roar from Leo the Lion (MGM’s mascot). The song jokingly ends with a sample of Sandler attempting to sing the opening lyrics to "Magic Air". It appears someone in the control room was having fun at the drummer’s expense.</p>
<p>5. "So Far Away In Love" – This track actually dates back to The Villagers era (pre-Orpheus). According to Arnold, a live version and at least one other studio version were recorded by the duo in 1966. The studio version, which briefly appeared on the Spectropop website, featured drums and bass (apparently not Sandler &amp; Gulliksen). That version had a much softer feel and Arnold’s closing guitar piece was different - echoing Simon &amp; Garfunkel’s "Scarborough Fair" although it most likely predated it. The album version is again ruined by Sandler who appears to be doing a bad Ginger Baker imitation. Even Baker would have preferred Bernard Purdie’s version.</p>
<p>6. "She’s Not There" – The Zombies wrote intelligent pop songs that were largely ignored in their homeland. Although England’s mod crowd labeled them pretentious college boys, The Zombies soldiered on and created some fantastic music. Bruce Arnold’s music had a similar sophisticated quality and I imagine that’s one of the reasons Alan Lorber choose this song for Orpheus.</p>
<p>Arnold handled the song’s arrangement and plays a fantastic guitar solo based on Gulliksen’s equally complicated baseline. The verses were given to McKenes while Arnold took the lead on the choruses. As with their version of "Walk Away Renee", vocal refrains were added by Arnold to showcase the group’s rich harmonies.</p>
<p>7. "Love Over Here" – If "I’ll Fly" was intended to be this album’s "Can’t Find The Time", this track was it’s "I’ve Never Seen Love Like This". Arnold opens the songs by proclaiming the death of Martin’s fabled "Congress Alley". Apparently disillusioned with the bogus counter-culture scene, he wisely jumped ship. The song continues as a straight pop tune but not before Arnold and Lorber drive the point home by including another sample – this time from "Congress Alley". Listen closely and you can hear a slightly warped "hey, what a groovy day" before the first chorus begins. This album could very well be the first to contain recorded music samples.</p>
<p>As always, Lorber adds lush instrumentation including harmonicas, timpani’s and some unidentified drones but unfortunately it all falls apart at the bridge. As on nearly every other track, Sandler amateurish drumming drags on the song. Another great track ruined. Along with "I’ll Fly", this song received moderate airplay on the East Coast.</p>
<p>8. "Borneo" – Arnold admitted to stealing Jim Kweskin’s arrangement of this 1928 Walter Donaldson classic. In his CD liner notes, Lorber refers to it as a "live performance favorite", however fans I’ve spoke with don’t recall having heard it at their shows. According to Arnold, McKenes plays the Flatt &amp; Scruggs-esque banjo piece at the end. It’s interesting to note that Orpheus is actually given credit as composers. Overall, a nice departure for the group and proof that Arnold and McKenes had not strayed far from their folk roots.</p>
<p>9. "Just A Little Bit" – Written by Arnold when he was only 17 years old, the lyrics display what is a remarkably deep sentiment for a teenager. In the liner notes for 1995’s "The Best of Orpheus", Arnold comments, "As a kid I was looking to fall in love and write love songs, fashioning my desires of a relationship."</p>
<p>Although not quite as lyrically mature as "Mine’s Yours", the song still features beautiful singing by both Arnold and McKenes, (whose trademark "paintbrush stroke" vocals are wisely mixed down by Lorber). Sandler’s drums are mercifully relegated to the bridges, which are abrupt thanks to Lorber’s screechy violins. A revised mix by an outside producer would undoubtedly yield better results.</p>
<p>10. "Walk Away Renee" – Arnold "Orpheus-ized" this Left Banke classic. New York DJ’s jumped on the Orpheus version and its heavy rotation during the fall of ’68 defined the band for the uninitiated. Many listeners were unaware that the same group did "Can’t Find The Time".</p>
<p>The intro features Arnold playing his unique brand of unusual chords in a chunky style that recalls the opening to "Bye Bye Love". His bell-like electric guitar adds highlights to the chord changes, which somewhat mask Sandler’s messy drum fills. The strong vocals by Arnold, McKenes and Gulliksen give an added dimension to the song despite the fact that they boldly discard the verses. The Left Banke’s version seems puny in comparison.</p>
<p>11. "Roses" – Sandler and Gulliksen were both asked to contribute one song to this album. Gulliksen’s "Roses" is a curious piece that mixes Arnold’s trademark guitar chords (played by Gulliksen) with lyrics that are a flowery take off of Sinatra’s "It Was Very Good Year". "Roses" is about as dated a song as Orpheus would ever record, which strengthens my appreciation of Arnold and Martin’s writing ability. Although I give Gulliksen credit for giving the instrumentation a Bruce Arnold-feel, I would have liked to hear him do something a bit less lilting.</p>
<p>12. "Magic Air" – If you weren’t irritated enough with Sandler’s drumming on this album, wait ‘til you hear his singing! This was his moment to shine and he doesn’t even seem to be trying. Listen for his New England pronunciation of the word "Garden". It is assumed that at some point in their childhoods, the other members of Orpheus had equally thick accents. What makes them different from Sandler is that they wisely realized the rest of the world considers it comical. Anyone from New England who wants to be taken seriously should loose the accent.</p>
<p>I’ve concluded that Harry Sandler is either an ignorant fool or an arrogant showman – probably both. His contributions to Orpheus were so out of place, I’m amazed that Arnold didn’t fire him sooner. Sandler was said to "throw out his drumsticks during songs" and Gulliksen called him "the consummate entertainer." Although I’m sure it impressed 14 year-old girls, Orpheus was not that kind of band and I’m sad to say Sandler’s antics would have probably ruined the experience of seeing Orpheus live – at least for me.</p>
<p>Amazingly though, "Magic Air" is not a total loss. In fact, the latter half of the song is quite breathtaking. It begins with the chorus, which I suspect was actually written by Arnold, (as he does sing it) and continues with what sounds like all four members singing harmony. Lorber’s ethereal orchestration is complimented by Collin Walcott’s tamboura and a piano, which adds the highlights usually reserved for Arnold’s electric guitar. The song builds with Bruce’s voice climbing up a step and as Lorber’s strings enter, the voices multiply over each other creating what is, even today, a stunning conclusion. It was as if Arnold and Lorber threw everything they had into Sandler’s laughable effort, and in doing so, managed to resurrect the album (albeit at the eleventh hour).</p>

<p>Overview</p>
<p>The Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses was established in November 1965 to initiate studies and research in areas relating to national security and the impact of defence measures on economic, political and social developments. Over the years, the Institute has evolved as a premier research institution, carrying out policy-related authoritative studies on national and international security issues. The institute is a registered body under the Registration of Societies Act of 1860 and is governed by an Executive Council elected by the members of the Institute. The Institute is accessible to political leaders, scholars, the media, service officers and others who have interest in issues concerning national security.</p>
<p>Activities :</p>
<p>Conferences/Seminars/Workshops</p>
<p>The Institute organized the 5th Asian Security Conference with the theme “Asian Security and China in 2000-2010” during January 27-29, 2003. The Conference was attended by foreign participants from 22 countries including policy makers and opinion shapers from Asian countries and major powers.</p>
<p>IDSA organised a national Workshop on "Terrorist Organisation and Financial flows (TOFF)" on 13 July 2002. The Workshop was attended by participants from different disciplines. The Institute also organised 34 Round Table Discussions with visiting scholars, diplomats and foreign delegations/teams.</p>
<p>IDSA Journals</p>
<p>Starting January, 2002, the Institute’s journal ‘Strategic Analysis’ has become a quarterly issue. IDSA also brings out the ‘Strategic Digest’ which is a monthly compendium of information from open sources which focuses on weapons of mass destruction issues, military doctrines, arms transfers and related technology developments and also includes important speeches, declarations and agreements. A monthly bulletin called Current Journal Contents which lists the contents of about 140 crore journals received in the library is brought out.</p>
<p>Training Programmes : The Institute also conducts training programmes and imparts training to Government officers both from civil and military streams.</p>
<p>Research Activities : On the basis of their research projects and areas of interest, ISDA has grouped the research faculty into ten ‘Clusters’. The Clusters are amongst others required to apply collective and focused attention to the subject and area; attempt joint articles and research activities; ensure internal ‘refereeing’ and assistance to other researchers within the Cluster and mentoring of junior colleagues.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-16_73b5.html" title="Edit section: The Middle Way Meditation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Middle Way Meditation</span></h2>
<p>The Ancient Concept of The Middle Way</p>
<p><br />
Lord Buddha referred to “The Middle Way” as a path that leads to enlightenment by avoiding the two extremes of sensual indulgence and self-mortification. And from avoiding both extremes, one will gain vision and knowledge that leads to Peace, Supreme Knowledge and Enlightenment.</p>
<p><br />
However, according to many well-known Meditation Masters, the real knowledge of meditation practice on the path of “The Middle Way” had been lost from this world for about 500 years after the passing away of the Lord Buddha.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
The Re-discovery of The Middle Way</p>
<p><br />
“The Middle Way” concept of meditation became lucid and more practical to meditation practitioners again in 1916 after the attainment of “Dhammakaya” of Luang Pu Wat Paknam (The late Abbot of Wat Paknam), a renowned Buddhist Monk and a celebrated Meditation Master.</p>
<p><br />
Luang Pu is the one who laid his life down in the condition of gaining the supreme truth of The Lord Buddha. In 1916, at the age of 33, he had sat down in the posture of meditation and made a vow that he would never rise up again and sat till death if he could not find the supreme truth of the Lord Buddha. And with his strong determination, he meditated the whole night until he finally revealed the real path and the body of supreme truth, “The Middle Way and The Dhammakaya”.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Essence of Dhammakaya</p>
<p><br />
The word “Dhammakaya” is an ancient word means the Body of Enlightenment (Dhamma means the truth or the enlightenment and Kaya means body). This term was found many places in many old Buddhist scriptures both in Theravada and Mahayana schools. It is not the new term or new theory from the Teaching of the Lord Buddha.</p>
<p><br />
Dhammakaya is the body that transformed Prince Sidhatta to The Lord Buddha. The enlightenment of the historical Buddha is explained as his mind became perfectly refined and purified to the same level of the refinement and purity of the Dhammakaya, and thus attains the body of enlightenment. The Dhammakaya is therefore seen as central to the Teaching of the Lord Buddha.</p>
<p><br />
Dhammakaya is a source of peace, wisdom and true happiness, exists in all human beings and can be attained through the process of self-refinement and self-purification.</p>
<p><br />
Dhammakaya Meditation Technique</p>
<p><br />
Dhammakaya Meditation Technique was rediscovered by Luang Pu Wat Paknam, the late Abbot of Wat Paknam. With his great work of meditation, he found that the station of stillness or the gateway of The Middle Way is at “The Center of the Body” around two-finger width above the navel. And the center of the body is the best point that any meditation practitioner should lay the mind down upon.</p>
<p><br />
The technique is simple but effective. Just keep your body and mind relaxed and maintain your attention slightly at the center of the body. Once you touch or feel the station of stillness at the center of your body, you will experience inner peace, true happiness and the transforming power that Dhammakaya Meditation can provide for every aspect of your life.</p>
<p><br />
Although Dhammakaya Meditation was developed as a technique by the Lord Buddha, its practice is not limited to Buddhists. The practice has nothing to do with any organized religion or sectarianism. For this reason, it can be freely practiced by everyone without conflict due to race, creed or religion. People from many religious backgrounds have experienced the benefits of Dhammakaya Meditation and have found no conflict with their profession of faith.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-16_73b5.html" title="Edit section: David Samuel Gottesman">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">David Samuel Gottesman</span></h2>
<p><b>David Samuel Gottesman</b> (1885–1956), Hungarian-American pulp-wood merchant, financier and philanthropist</p>
<p>Gottesman emigrated to America from <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> as a child. As a young man, he became a businessman and eventually parlayed the family's M. Gottesman &amp; Company, a New York City firm that sold raw material for papermaking, into Central National-Gottesman, a billion-dollar pulp-and-paper corporation that is active today. He also became active as an investment banker and as an organizer of the Central National Bank in New York City. (The bank was founded in 1864 in New York City and through numerous amalgamation is an ancestor of today's JP Morgan Chase holding company.)</p>
<p>From the 1950s, Central National-Gottesman established a network of offices in Europe and South America. Long after Gottesman's death, the corporation acquired Communication Paper Corporation in 1991, for the sale of communication and printing papers, and Perkins &amp; Squier Company in 1998, for the sale of book-publishing papers. And a combination of these businesses with Lindenmeyr Paper and D.F. Munroe under the name Lindenmeyr Division has become one of the largest independent fine-paper merchants in the U.S. The consortium is privately held.</p>
<p>Gottesman was also the director of the Eastern Corporation and Rayonier, Inc. All lead to his becoming extremely rich and generously philanthropic, which benefited the New York Public Library and various Jewish aid organizations and efforts. His best-know gift is the purchase of four so-called <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Sea_Scrolls_dfda.html" title="Dead Sea Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a>, presented to the State of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, and the 1965 construction of <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrine_of_the_Book_8f03.html" title="Shrine of the Book">Shrine of the Book</a> in Givat Ram, western <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, funded by the Gottesman Foundation.</p>
<p>Gottesman's money as well as his philanthropy was inherited by his daughter and granddaughter.</p>
<p>Before his daughter, Celeste Ruth Gottesman, inherited substantial money from her father's estates, she married. Jerome John Altman in 1935, soon after graduating from Wheaton College. In 1941, they had a daughter, Jenifer Altman who likewise became a privileged Park Avenue and Long Island socialite. Celeste divorced Altman and married Armand Phillip Bartos (1910–2005), who had studied architecture at the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_dd6d.html" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>. She eventually amassed a substantial collection of blue-chip modern art still housed in a Park Avenue apartment and a generous donor to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Museum_of_Modern_Art_a4d1.html" title="The Museum of Modern Art">The Museum of Modern Art</a> and, like her father, the New York Public Library.</p>
<p>Thus, it was that Samuel Gottesman chose Bartos as well as Friederich Kiesler (1890–1965) to design the <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrine_of_the_Book_8f03.html" title="Shrine of the Book">Shrine of the Book</a> adjacent to the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Museum_bbc6.html" title="Israel Museum">Israel Museum</a>. The appointment raised the ire of Israeli architects who took umbrage to the appointment of non-Israelis, particularly one based on nepotism in the case of Bartos and on an absence of qualifications in the case of Kiesler who had not finished his architecture studies in <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> and had built nothing.</p>
<p>Gottesman's granddaughter Jenifer Altman contracted cancer in her late forties (late 1980s) and died in 1991. She had sought non-medical treatment at Commonweal, the eclective center in Bolinas, California, founded by Michael Lerner. Shortly before her demise, she established the Jenifer Altman Foundation for the betowal of grants, along with the Mitchell Kapor Foundation and the StarFire Fund, both associated with Michael Lerner. A major donor is the Pinewood Foundation established by Celeste Gottesman Bartos; Pinewood was the name of Samuel Gottesman's estate in Lawrence, Long Island, New York. She is also the director of the D.S. &amp; R.H. Gottesman Foundation in Purchase, New York</p>

<p>The term Open Art marks works of art, which meet criteria for <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_Content_57d1.html" title="Open Content">Open Content</a>. Features of Open Art are for one thing the (i.e. institutional) non-commissioned creation of the work, so there is usually no refunding. For another thing Open Art is intent on broad distribution. To make that sure <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> and related rights need to be considered.</p>
<p>Several options for relaxation resp. derestriction of copyright are provided, subjected to national legislation and the originators’ intention to unblock. In some countries (i.e. the Federal Republic of Germany) there is no waiver of copyright possible. Nevertheless the legal right of use may be broadens by the use of certain licenses (cp. Open Art-licences).</p>
<p>All in all Open Art contrasts to works which are limiting the options of distribution by dealing with the rights of intellectual property (especially the copyright).</p>
<p>The term Open Art as such was for the first time coined by the europea network on Open Art <i>art-society.eu</i>, initiated by Mischa Strassner 2004, which operates with a specific form of Open Art in <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_space.html" title="Public space">public space</a> called °<i>asacs!</i>°.</p>

<p>Tunnel was the name of a large New York City nightclub with multiple rooms on several levels. It received its name from the fact that the main dancefloor was a renovated train tunnel from the early 1900s.</p>
<p>It was one of the most unique dancefloors of its time, untraditionally rectangular and enlongated. The dance floor was dotted with several dance cages throughout the floor, and had a notoriously loud sound system. The decor throughout the club was everchanging; one room was decorated by artist Kenny Scharf, called the Kenny Scharf Lava Lounge, others were decorated as Victorian libraries, S &amp; M dungeons, and chill-out lounges. It was perhaps best known for hosting Junior Vasquez and Danny Tenaglia after the close of the original Sound Factory in the mid-ninties. It later hosted Kurfew, a trance-techno oriented Saturday night party catering to a younger gay crowd. While Tunnel frequently played to a mainly gay crowd (Vasquez spun for primarily gay parties, Tenaglia who is gay rarely branded his parties with a sexual preference, Kurfew was notoriously gay), it also attracted many members of the hip-hop community, often hosting parties in separate rooms throughout the course of the week. One distinct advantage to the multiple rooms of the club was the ability to host many different types of parties with several, sometimes five or more, different DJs spinning various styles of music, to quite varying crowds.</p>
<p>Tunnel closed its doors soon after the demise of nearby Twilo, the victim of the owner's debts and of Rudy Giuliani's quality-of-life campaign. Once owner Peter Gatien was often connected to drug trafficking or fire code violations, and sometimes underage drinking violations. His clubs were frequently the targets of police raids.</p>
<p>The Tunnel was mentioned in the Sex and the City episode, "Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda" (season four). In the scene where Miranda discusses her abortion with her, Carrie mentions a termination she had herself, 15 years earlier. She reveals that her unwanted pregnancy resulted from sleeping with a waiter "after a drunken night at The Tunnel." Miranda retorts, "The Tunnel?! No judgment!"</p>

<p>Kuatagh is a word created by Ajim sometime in the year 1978 where it emerged from few local malay slangs, pronounced with mixed west coast of Malaysian dialects and east coast of Peninsular of Malaysia slangs. It describes the intellectually humor and cool person, yet the ideas contributed is always out of the box, and mostly comes from different angles compared to norms, but even though it creates laughter, still the idea is acceptable by many as practical. It usually starts with abrupt short laugh but when explains further, the idae will be reconsidered and at the end will be the way to execute the action. Now since Kuatagh way of thinking and styles has been adapted by many of Alumini members of MRSM Kuantan, or Ex MRSM Kuantan, the word Kuatagh has been widespread in the Malaysian Intellect Communities and NGO's. Since the last 9 years, the alumini members have actively contributed their experiences to the communities in education and social works, their appearance has been recognised by the name Kuatagh, which shows the cool people that will always set a new standards for every events for the communities mostly local NGOs.</p>

<p>Biorock Technology, or mineral accretion technology, is a method that applies safe, low voltage electrical currents through seawater, causing dissolved minerals to crystallize on structures, growing into a white limestone similar to that which naturally makes up coral reefs and tropical white sand beaches. This material has strength similar to concrete. It can be used to make robust artificial reefs on which corals grow at very rapid rates. The change in the environment produced by electrical currents accelerates formation and growth of both chemical limestone rock and the skeletons of corals and other shell-bearing organisms.</p>
<p>Biorock methods speed up coral growth in damaged areas and restore authentic coral reef habitat and species. Biorock structures become rapidly colonized by a full range of coral reef organisms, including fish, crabs, clams, octopus, lobster, sea urchins. Species typically found in healthy reef environments are given an electrical advantage over the weedy organisms which often overgrow them in reefs stressed by humans.

<p>Biorock Technology, or mineral accretion technology, is a method that applies safe, low voltage electrical currents through seawater, causing dissolved minerals to crystallize on structures, growing into a white limestone similar to that which naturally makes up coral reefs and tropical white sand beaches. This material has strength similar to concrete. It can be used to make robust artificial reefs on which corals grow at very rapid rates. The change in the environment produced by electrical currents accelerates formation and growth of both chemical limestone rock and the skeletons of corals and other shell-bearing organisms.</p>
<p>Biorock methods speed up coral growth in damaged areas and restore authentic coral reef habitat and species. Biorock structures become rapidly colonized by a full range of coral reef organisms, including fish, crabs, clams, octopus, lobster, sea urchins. Species typically found in healthy reef environments are given an electrical advantage over the weedy organisms which often overgrow them in reefs stressed by humans. The advantages corals gain from mineral accretion are cancelled if they no longer receive current, at which point weeds will overgrow the corals. If the current is maintained, coral reefs can often be restored even in areas where water quality would prevent their recovery by any other method.</p>
<p>Biorock structures cement themselves to the hard bottom providing a physical wave barrier which over time, grows larger and stronger. Biorock materials are to an extent, structurally self healing.

<p>A spice by name 'Teppal' is being used in the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Goa in India, by a very small community called Konkani's (they speak a language called Konkani), an official language of Goa and spoken in many parts of these 3 states. 'Teppal' is a fruit which grows on trees full of thorns. It grows in bunch like grapes. Fresh fruits are parrot green in color and is used as a flavoring agent in many curries made with a paste of coconut, chillies and other spices. The fruit is seasonal and available during the monsoon period. When dried, the flesh of the fruit hardens, turns to brownish black color and opens up to show the black seeds within. The seeds are discarded and the dried fruit is stored in containers for use around the year. This spice is mostly used in Fish preparations and a few vegetarian dishes, with the coconut masala. This spice has a very strong woody aroma and is discarded at the time of eating the Veg / Fish curry.</p>

<p>As I was reading the article about Sichuan pepper and realised that this is same as the Teppal that we use in our homes for making curries. I do not know, if there are any other articles around. But would like to contribute to Wiki as this is one source I use to get many an information.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-16_73b5.html" title="Edit section: Gonzalo Borges">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gonzalo Borges</span></h2>
<p>Gonzalo Borges, a prominent Cuban Painter and drawer, was born in La Habana, Cuba in 1936. Since his early years his talent was evident for drawing, devoting particular attention to mythological African classic tales of the Yoruba religion. At the age of twelve years Borges began his first painting production in which he undertook those matters related to Cuban folklore.</p>
<p>When he was only 15 years old in 1951, Borges joined the prestigious National Plastic Arts School of San Alejandro as a formal student in La Habana, Cuba, obtaining a scholarship to begin studies by opposition, duly reported in the Diario de la Marina, where the most important social and cultural news were published at that time.</p>
<p>During six years of intense and advanced academic studies in San Alejandro, he received lessons and the personal instructions of consecrated Cuban painting professors such as René Portocarrero and Amelia Peláez, both painters and also from sculptor Florencio Gelabelt, among other outstanding professors of Cuban Plastic.</p>
<p>Gonzalo Borges participated in 1954, being yet a painting student, in his first collective exposition which was held at the Exposition Hall of the National Plastic Arts School of San Alejandro, winning the first prize in a painting contest among a group of young Cuban artists.</p>
<p>As part of his academic curriculum, years after graduating in the National Plastic Arts School of San Alejandro, he takes a two-year course of Arts History under Professor Juan Moreira’s Direction, at the Superior School of Fine Arts in La Habana.</p>
<p>Due to his personal efforts toward learning, he spent years in mural painting with the famous Spanish fresh painting (al fresco) professor Vicente Klemade, becoming his assistant and direct pupil, participating with him in the production of several wall paintings, where are evoked different Bible’s themes that are still kept in cathedrals and churches of Old Habana, being found in temples as Caridad del Cobre, Monserrate, La Merced, San Juan Bosco, the Sacred Heart and others.</p>
<p>Under his young career’s rise, he initiated together with the internationally renowned painter Manuel Mendive and artists Miguel Angel Ruiz, Saida del Rio and Osvaldo Lugo the Painting Group “Roots”, deemed very remarkable through several expositions that since 1967 were collectively exhibited in such important Expositions Halls as that of Wifredo Lam’s House, Student’s House and Galeano &amp; Concordia’s Gallery, Led at that time by the outstanding painter Gustavo Acosta.</p>
<p>Borges’s biography points out as a very important event in the process of his Academic Career the scholarship granted in 1954 by the Cuban Ministry of Culture, to carry out superior Arts Studies in Paris, France.</p>
<p>Being already a young painter, drawer and a professional muralist, Borges begins a long journey, exhibiting expositions which allowed him to introduce his works at important Halls in La Habana, Cuba. Among the most remarkable were those presented in temporary Exposition Halls at the Superior School of Fine Arts of La Habana, in 1957; Exposition Hall of Marianao Anfiteatro, led at that time by today’s famous painter José Bedia, in 1978; Master Eduardo Abela Gellery (Drawing Exposition) in San Antonio de los Baños in 1982; Exposition Hall Mella Theater, in 1984; Galeano &amp; Concordia Gallery in 1988.</p>
<p>Searching to expand the symbolic meaning of his paintings, directly associated to the religion and mythological traditions of the Yorubas, Borges migrates to the United States in 1991, residing in New York City, where his works reached a remarkable presence, exhibiting individual and collective expositions in Y.M.C.A’s Exposition Halls of New York in 1993, Carib Art Gallery in Soho New York where he exhibited his pieces together with Dominican painter José Perdomo, and likewise during that years he exhibits his works in the Arts Hall of the State University of New York, in Stony Brook; Exposition Hall of Tweed Court House, New York, in 1994; Ward-Nesse Gallery, Soho, New York, in 1997; Ward-Nesse Gallery, Soho, New York 1996; Long Island Museum, New York, 1996; International Home Gallery, New York, 1994; S.O.L.O. International Gallery, New York, 1994. After spending several years with his workshop in New York City, where he was awarded by Governor George Pataki, who delivers a speech, recognizing the quality of his works, in 1995, as part of a program of Cultural and Artistic activities held during the Hispanic Heritage Month.</p>
<p>Borges established his workshop in Miami, where he presented several expositions, especially those exhibited in Barcelo Fine Art, Coral Gables, Miami, in 1999; Inner Tropical Gallery, Coral Gables, Miami, Florida, in 1999.</p>
<p>His works are part of important public and private Collections in the United States, Russia, Bulgaria, Spain, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, where one of his pieces is part of the late and former Puerto Rican Governor, Don Luis A. Ferré’s Personal Collection. Don Luis A. Ferré bought Borges’s work in New York.</p>
<p>Borges’s paintings are a normative apportion inside the so called ethnic art, assuming deconstruction of cryptogram and symbols coming from the ancient Yrouban culture, trying to impose a true Caribbean Speech, according to updated and bold speeches of our time above all concerning its formal structure and mastery in the design balance and visual composition.</p>
<p>Through years of intense meditations and observations of mother nature, Gonzalo Borges has created a fusion of dynamic images that shape themselves in his mind; which he then captures in his drawings and paintings, expressing the feelings of music, dance and the folklore of his native country, Cuba. As well as capturing traditional symbols and deities that have been integrated as part of the population in all aspects of Cuban life.</p>
<p>Today, Gonzalo Borges, fine artist and iridology specialist, owner of a single and humble artistic personality, spends his time in his quaint workshop in South Miami.</p>

There has been recent heresay and conjecture about the increase of the population of elephants in Africa recently. This article will set the facts straight about these disputable facts.</p>
<p>The population of elephants in Africa, <i>is</i> tripling every year, according to the Modern Research Institute For Unendangered Mammals. Despite constant warnings from the MRIFUM elephants still remain on the list for <i>Potential Endangered Animals</i> and people seem to believe that the population of elephants is in fact decreasing.</p>
<p>With their large tusks and firm hides, elephants are able to survive in the wilderness much longer than what is naturally expected, and they are running rampant across Africa.</p>

<p>The 1920s inspired those with courage or hard cash (or connections to it) to forge a world that only superlatives could describe. The "War to end all wars" was won, and the powers of politics, science and industry to erase mankind's other ills were in evidence: · Women had the vote · "devil rum" was shackled · two army pilots flew across America non-stop in less than 27 hours · now, more Americans lived in cities than on farms (after all, they had seen Paree' ) · Jack Benny and Eddie Cantor commanded vaudeville, and F. Scott Fitzgerald, Eugene O'Neill, James Joyce, T. S. Eliot and Sinclair Lewis reshaped our literature · Knute Rockne's "Four Horsemen" dominated college gridirons, and the National Football League was formed · the world's first commercial radio station, Detroit's 8MK (now WWJ), went on the air, and a patent was sought for an electronic television transmitter. A gay, glorious era for flappers, marathon dances and singing, "Yes, We Have No Bananas". The Teapot Dome oil scandal and the re-emergence of the Ku Klux Klan were forced to compete with the popularity of Babe Ruth and Winnie-the-Pooh. A clumsy attempt to overthrow the German government, the Beer Hall Putsch, was dismissed as the political escapade of an eccentric malcontent, Adolph Hitler. This was also a time for building. Detroit's Penobscot Building, the General Motors Building, the Fisher Building, the Detroit Public Library, the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village, Masonic Auditorium, the Buhl Building and Police Headquarters on Beaubien were only part of the construction that was reshaping Detroit's skyline. In this climate, John W. Austin approached financier Joseph A. Bower, a Detroiter, in Bower's offices at the Liberty National Bank in New York City.Austin was an officer of the Detroit Graphite Company, and his aim was to secure a contract to paint such a bridge as might, inevitably, span the Detroit River. Their meeting spawned a remarkable accomplishment - a $23.5 million, privately financed link between the United States and Canada. As the two men met above the din of Manhattan's streetcars and crowds, they talked of heavy construction and high finance.

<p>Christian Konrad Sprengel (* 22. September 1750, Brandenburg an der Havel, Germany; † 7. April 1816, Berlin, Germany) was a german theologist, teacher and, most important, a naturalist. He discovered sexuality in the plant kingdom.</p>
<p>Sprengel studied Theology in Halle, Germany. In 1774 he became teacher in Berlin. Since about 1787, Sprengel did considerable research on the pollination of plants and the interaction between flowers and their insect visitors. With his work "Das entdeckte Geheimnis der Natur im Bau und in der Befruchtung der Blumen" (Berlin 1793), he was one of the founders of pollination ecology as a scientific discipline. Together with one of his predecessors, Köhlreuter, he is still the most classic author in this field.</p>
<p>During his lifetime, his work was neglected, not only becuse it seemed to a lot of his contemporaries as obscene that flowers had something to do with sexual functions, but also because the immanent importance of his findings on the aspects of of selection and evolution was not recognised. Until Charles Darwins book "On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing." (London 1862), floral ecology was not considered a 'proper science'.</p>
<p>Important successors like Paul Knuth, Fritz Knoll and Hans Kugler were inspired by Sprengel and brought great advance to the field of pollination ecology. After the second World War, their work was continued by and Stefan Vogel, Knut Faegri, Leendert van der Pijl, Amos Dafni, G. Ledyard Stebbins as well as Herbert and Irene Baker.</p>
<p>The ideas and terms inherited out of Sprengel's fundamental work last forth.</p>
<p>Sprengel is buried at the Invalidenfriedhof in Berlin, Germany. A small monument designed after the frontispice of his fundamental work can be seen in Berlin Botanical Gardens.</p>

<p>Jeremiah Sullivan, Marine Biologist, San Diego, California In the late 1970’s, marine biologist Jeremiah Sullivan developed a flexible suit of armor for divers to wear while working around sharks. The suit has often been referred to as the Metal Mesh Shark Suit, Chain Mail Anti-Shark Suit, Steel Mesh Shark Suit, etc. Its actual name is the NEPTUNIC SHARKSUIT. The technology Sullivan developed and continues to advance is known around the world and has been instrumental in the development of the shark diving industry.</p>
<p>Jeremiah Sullivan's pioneering work with the anti-bite technology has become the world standard among those who must work under hazardous circumstances with sharks in the open sea. He has participated in over forty television and film projects, as well as museum and technology exhibits including the Museum of Natural History, the Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Vitra Design Museum in Essen, Germany.</p>
<p>An individual of diverse interests, Jeremiah has always maintained parallel careers in both art and science. He believes this combination of disciplines is the key to creativity. Jeremiah has spent many years working in remote areas of the world on the leading edge of the adventure industry. He is deeply involved in environmental issues globally, both above and below the surface of the water.</p>

<p>A marine biologist and photographer from San Diego, California, has borrowed an idea from the Middle Ages to create a sharkproof suit for professional divers. The suit, designed by Jeremiah Sullivan, has a steel-chain mesh that protects the diver against a shark’s razor-sharp teeth-just as medieval knights wore chain mail to ward off arrows. Sullivan’s suit uses a heavy mesh and a rigid understructure that weighs up to 18 pounds. But its design enables a diver to zip it on in about a minute. Sullivan says the suit is effective against sharks as large as 10 feet long-the kind that bother divers the mos</p>

<p>Yes, it’s finally safe to go back in the water. A San Diego marine biologist has designed an armor-plated skin-diving suit to protect against shark bites. Inspired by the armor of medieval knights, the 15-pound underwater outfit consists of an epoxy resin shield sandwiched between a heavy-gauge mesh of 150,000 stainless-steel rings, says twenty-nine year-old inventor Jeremiah S. Sullivan, of the Scripps Institute. He claims the suit makes divers “invulnerable” to attacks from all the shark species studied to date, including the blue, brown, bull, mako, white tip reef, gray reef, ragged tooth, and hammerhead sharks. Tests on larger sharks such as the tiger, oceanic white tip and great white are still pending. Sullivan first tested the special mesh on a prosthetic limb dropped into the ocean. Though the armor seemed adequate, Sullivan wasn’t really satisfied and decided to test the suit by wearing it himself. After }baiting sharks into frenzied hunger with ground-up fish, he jumped into the water and eventually emerged unharmed, with “pieces of shark teeth embedded in the mesh.” Scheduled to go on sale later this year for more than $3000, the suit has attracted interest not only from cameramen, photographers, and marine scientists who specialize in the study of shark behavior, but also from commercial fishermen and NASA officials concerned about rescuing astronauts from the ocean. Says Sullivan: I guarantee that the person with the suit on will fare far better in dangerous waters than anyone without it.”</p>

<p>Armor Suit To Protect Divers</p>
<p>Washington: A photographer who is also a marine biologist was granted a patent this week for an armored skin-diving suit, intended to provide protection from sharks. Jeremiah S. Sullivan of San Diego, who got patent 4,356,569 is beginning manufacture of the garment. In a telephone interview, he said it would retail for several thousand dollars. The suit is flexible, but its surface is substantially covered by rigid shield elements made of epoxy resin, which resembles hard plastic. Chain mail of stainless steel links is sandwiched into the shield elements. Mr. Sullivan, who has studied sharks in nature, has tested the suit with several species in the California area, and reports that Australian divers have also tested it.</p>

<p>Legitimacy is necessary for social productivity whether based on electronic or physical media, where legitimacy is defin0ed as fairness plus social good. In this view email, chat, bulletin boards and groupware are social-technical systems (STS), i.e. social systems that overlay technical ones, where “technical” includes both software and hardware aspects. There are four STS levels: Social, Personal, Information and Mechanical. Each level “emerges” from the previous as a different view, as information derives from mechanics, human cognitive meaning has an information base, and community norms arise from a sum of human cognitions.</p>
