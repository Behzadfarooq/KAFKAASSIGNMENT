<p>Almost patent (religious?) nonsense; by reading the article I get no sense as to whether this "immortal" person is real or mythical; I suspect the author meant real.

<li>This is probably a delete just because it's pretty obscure but I don't see any reason to dismiss it as nonsense (at least no more so than any other religious idea). The belief that there are immortal rishis living for hundreds of years in the Himalayas is not uncommon in India. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 01:59, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep. I have trouble understanding it, and it certainly needs NPOVing, but it seems like a valid religious topic.

I would strongly recommend that other articles on swamis and yogis by User:Mansukram be deleted. Don't vote keep, simply because they are well-written or non-stub. Ask some Indians [...]; they know that these yogis are not really notable."</i> On the other hand, in a country with a population almost the size of those of Europe and North America put together, even things notable to a small subset of the population may be regarded as notable enough for an encyclopedia with the scope of Wikipedia. However, all these articles need a clearer context and some kind of categorizing. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up land</a> 07:54, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. For one thing, this article is a verbatim quote of a page on www.yotor.com <a href="http://www.yotor.com/wiki/en/si/Siddha%20Guru%20Sri%20Alakh%20Puriji.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yotor.com/wiki/en/si/Siddha%20Guru%20Sri%20Alakh%20Puriji.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and the other articles in the series may well be also. yotor.com isn't cited in the article. That makes this a copy vio. Google turns up 1 hit on the full name of this guru, and only 19 on the phrase "Alakh Puriji", several of which are links to Wikipedia or its mirrors, and the rest to yotor.com and a couple of other bizarre sites, including another wiki. I don't think these gurus and swamis are notable, even in India, especially with the comment from <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">User:Utcursch</a> quoted above. Finally, the article (like the others in the series) is very poorly written, verging on being nonsense, and I doubt there is enough interest in these gurus that these articles will get cleaned up any time soon. So this just ends up being more crud in the Wikipedia. Delete this article and the others, and if these swamis and gurus are notable, someone else will come along and write a good, sourced, article eventually. But I doubt they are notable. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:30, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually, putting "Mike Hancock mayor Brantford Ontario" into Google gives you several pages of legitimate hits. But I am not convinved this is the point. I have made the point elsewhere that just serving as an elected official in some two-bit town (sorry, Brantford, I'm sure you are all lovely people -- but just 90,000 of you) cannot possibly entitle someone to an encyclopedic entry, or we will end up with millions (yes, millions) of them. Look -- how many Indian towns are there with 90,000+ inhabitants and a mayor. What about Indonesia, Brazil, or the USA? If the time comes that Mr. Hancock achieves some fame or notoriety (e.g. he serves more terms than any other Canadian mayor, he bankrupts Brantford by siphoning off city funds into his car dealership, or whatever) then give him his entry.

A five-minute look at <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a> brought up several journal articles (not just reviews) written on aspects of his work, and even a "mini symposium" on Kagan's <i>The Limits of Morality</i> consisting of three papers published together in the journal <i>Ethics</i> in 1994. However, the present article reads just like an entry in a university directory, and I can't see the value of keeping it unless it is expanded. OTOH it was slapped with the VfD-notice two minutes after creation, which may have frustrated and confused some newbie planning to do just that. I don't like subsubstubs like this, but it should probably have been given a chance for a few days before being VfDed.

<p>Certainly a notable song by a notable band, but this article says nothing. Anyone doing a search will type "<a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Calling_542a.html" title="London Calling">London Calling</a>" and get the album, which gives them more information. An easy keep if anything consequential is said about it, but until then it's useless. I'm all for articles on songs when they're notable and say something useful and interesting (I wrote <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_the_Casbah_fa9e.html" title="Rock the Casbah">Rock the Casbah</a>, and would love to see this article approach that one) but if Wikipedia is going to be home to 100,000 articles that say "X is a song by Y" then I'd like to nip this in the bud. Yes, I know, "VfD is not cleanup/expand". I could put a request for expansion on this and wait for something to happen, but an "expand or die" ultimatum might actually get the ball rolling, and if it doesn't we'll get rid of a useless article and hope thousands more don't pop up.

<li><b>Comment</b>âI didn't find anything online about it that wasn't written by its participants. What is the evidence that this particular one is notable? And yes, a municipality of fewer people would be notable, because as a municipality it would have official government recognition, a listing in the census, and perhaps most importantly, the ability to pass laws. Municipalities, even small ones, therefore necessarily have an impact and notability beyond the people who live in them, and are verifiable beyond what the residents say about it. What impact has this had outside of the less than 20 who live there, and how would we verify anything about it without any external sources? I might change my mind if we could get some outside information.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm sorry to say this but you are all mistaken. Paris Hilton didn't invent this phrase, but she did trademark it. I think she deserves recognition as this popular phrase's owner. LeeJacksonKing 15:47, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Anybody who makes a product or who provides a service, or who is planning to do so, can register a trademark for about $50 per category. If the product fits in multiple categories, or you want to use the same trademark on several different products in different categories, you can pay for multiple categories. If Paris Hilton has registered the phrase "That's Hot" as a trademark for some line of products that she is planning to market, so what? It doesn't mean she owns the phrase, and she'll lose her rights to the trademark if she doesn't market products in the registered categories by some defined date. If she owns the rights to market "That's Hot" brand lipstick (for example), that does not prevent you from registering and using the phrase for your "That's Hot" line of corn flakes (unless she registered that also, and actually markets corn flakes under that brand). It certainly does not mean that you have to pay Paris anything when you use the phrase "That's Hot" in writing or conversation. None of this makes the phrase, or her association with it, notable enough for a general encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:05, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a>, you are WRONG. It says Paris Hilton is going to use the trademark on clothes and accessories <a href="http://celebrityjustice.warnerbros.com/news/0409/20a.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://celebrityjustice.warnerbros.com/news/0409/20a.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. More important, however, is the use of "that's hot" in everyday conversation. LeeJacksonKing 15:08, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Are you an expert on trademark law? I'm not either, but I think I probably know more about it than you do. Paris Hilton cannot possibly have trademarked the use of the phrase in everyday conversation, and if she has applied for its use as a trademark on clothing and accessories, and paid the fee, that means (a) in order to keep the mark, she has to market clothing and accessories with that trademark before some time limit expires; (b) as long as she has the trademark, nobody else can use the trademark for clothing and accessories; and (c) people can register the trademark for use on other types of products, for example, "That's Hot" brand microwave ovens. Regarding (c), in rare cases, a trademark owner can prevent people from using the mark, period. For example, the Coca Cola company can stop you from marketing Coca Cola brand toilet paper, even though they haven't registered the trademark in that category and don't market toilet paper themselves. But that is pretty rare, takes decades of intensive marketing to establish, and doesn't happen automatically no matter how much marketing is done, especially on "weak" marks, such as "Thats Hot". Paris Hilton and her "That's Hot" trademark are far from being in that league. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:52, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No. A very quick check seems to confirm that this is indeed an important university professor, the author of 8 books (most seem to be available on Amazon) and 350+ scientific articles.

<li>As I pointed out on the talk page a while ago, it is almost certainly autobiographical; it is created by User:Kleinert, and later edited by an IP traceable to the <i>Freie UniversitÃ¤t</i> in Berlin (if I remember correctly from when I looked into this). However, he is clearly notable enough for a Wikipedia article, and in spite of the obviously autobiographical origin, I vote to <b>keep</b> this.

<li>How?? 5,000 google hits, 8 books and only 350 scientific articles is actually not that much. A lot of mediocre academics have acheived this and more. Someone is going to have to come up with a very clear reason why this guy is notable. This page at least needs to eb deleted on standard grounds that vanity pages and autobiographies are not wikipedia content. I have no problem if a future page gets written up, I'll deal with notability then. This page needs to be deleted because the snail's pace of Wikipedia, plus the general non-notability of this character means it is not likely to be cleaned up any time soon.--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 02:42, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>How is 5000+ Google hits and 8 books not notable? There have been people with fewer hits and publications that have biographies in Wikipedia. I'm not suggesting the article remain unchanged.

<li>The onus is not on me to prove non-notability, it is for keepers to prove notability. Thats how things usually work. This article has not be nominated due to non-notability. It has been nominated as <b>vanity</b>, <b>self promotion</b> and <b>autobiography</b> - I have shown this to be correct. If you'd like to disagree with those then your vote might make sense.

<li>Actually that statement position is incorrect. It's up to the person putting up the article for deletion to provide evidence why (non-notability, vanity etc.), not the keepers. Remember this is Votes for Deletion - so technically anyone who abstains/no votes, is voting for its retention by default - its up to people who wish to delete the article to prove otherwise (non-notability, vanity etc.) by majority, not the keepers. Another thing is you've made a comparison between this academic and the artist Chonk. Chonk in no way has scored +5000 Google hits or written 8 books. So professor Kleinert is not in the same category as Chonk. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 01:14, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. "No autobiographies" is a good principle, but it's not a hard rule, and in this case, it seems the individual in question may be reasonably noteworthy. True, professors write articles. He's published roughly one per month since 1967, at least some of which are in scientific journals I recognize (and I'm not a physicist).

<li><b>Comment</b>: I am not all that convinced that userfying and rewriting may not be the best solution (as a way to eat the cake and still have it), but unless the rewrite is made by somebody expert in the field, it is not going to look much different from the present stub. Compared to the contributions in the same genre we get from some teenagers, this vanity article in its present brevity is downright modest. But as for notability, the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProfessor_test_c55c.html" title="Wikipedia:Professor test">professor test</a> speaks of an "average college professor" (<i>"If the individual is more well known and more published than an average college professor, they can and should be included"</i>), obviously referring to the American conditions for reaching professorhood. I would claim that <i>any German professor</i> can be assumed to pass this test with flying colours, even before making any independent assessment of the value of his or her publications, simply because the bar for getting a professorship is so much higher in Germany than in the US. Had Kleinert been a baseball or football/soccer player, there is no doubt that he would have been considered notable for much less. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up land</a> 06:53, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Expand</b>. Writing eight books on physics as a professor of that subject in a major university suggests that this man is notable.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I don't know the field at all (Physics) and so the chap may well be notable. But I do know that writing articles - and having them published - is standard form for all Professors over here (EU). In itself, therefore, that would not seem to make anyone particularly notable. Going beyond that stage and having chapters in books and then books published under your own name would be going some way toward notability - but even then the books need to sell and, really, to be the stuff of some import. So, all in all, a weak delete.

<li><b>Comment</b>. If this article is written by the professor himself, and not a relative or someone with the same name, then it is vanity, by definition. Wikipedia prohibits autobiographies/vanity. Maybe it shouldn't. What is actually wrong with vanity? If an article is about a notable subject and the information contained therein is verifiable, what does it matter if the person wrote it himself? If by some amazing chance, President Clinton had decided to write a Wikipedia article about himself (perhaps in conjunction with his book tour, or something), would we have deleted it as "vanity", assuming that it was NPOV, true, and verifiable? In fact, "vanity" is rarely provable; it is only a suspicion. We delete, as vanity, bragging articles by high school kids. But these are just as deletable for not being notable, not being verifiable, and being most probably false. Perhaps we should stop using unverifiable suspicions of "vanity" as reasons for deleting articles and stick with notability and verifiability. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 01:30, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b>. It prevents the "Well President Clinton did it" response to any other would be autobiographers trying to add themselves to Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Professor Kleinert's work is certainly notable within physics. <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Feynman_1f56.html" title="Richard Feynman">Richard Feynman</a>, for example, was absolutely brilliant in developing the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Path_integral.html" title="Path integral">path integral</a> approach to quantum mechanics. But he was unable to actually solve it for simple systems, like the <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen.html" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> atom. Kleinert solved the latter. Much of his work is like this. A theoretical genius comes up with amazing mathematical frameworks that promise so much to come, but gets bogged down, and Kleinert finds a way to push the method through. Very important work, but no revolutionary discoveries, no grabbing of attention. Kleinert was collaborating with Feynman during Feynman's last illness. If you look in <i>Physics Today</i>, Feb. 1989, at the page of photographs of Feynman's last blackboards, you'll see Kleinert's name.--192.35.35.35 14:50, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A classic case for <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleanup.html" title="Cleanup">cleanup</a>. <i>Astropolis</i> is hardly a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>, it appears in the title of <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_Jolas_2517.html" title="Eugene Jolas">Eugene Jolas</a>' <i>Secession in Astropolis</i> in 1929 for example. Probably this page should become a disambiguation, the term is so heavily used for so many things, by so many authors - including the French techno music festival of course. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 17:43, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>not neologism? A vocabulary entry, please. I doesn't matter that google gives 10,000 hits for the word. The only "cleanup" for the article is to ""delete". If one wants to write about French festival or something real, he is welcome. Even if you turn this article into a disambig, something should be done with the current content, other than to sweep the problem with it under the carpet. Just think that you are voting for the article Astropolis (city), not for Astropolis (disambiguation). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 20:04, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: I don't want a fight, IMO whether we keep this is not very important, but I think I must reply as the above is full of important misapprehensions. No, we are voting here for the article <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astropolis.html" title="Astropolis">Astropolis</a>. This, rather than Astropolis (disambiguation), is the best title for a disambiguation page if there's no clear winner for the unqualified title, as seems to be the case, but again that's not terribly important and either will do IMO. No, it's not a neologism, and yes, more than 10,000 Google hits do require some explanation, what is yours? No, we don't delete articles to clean up the history, even in the case of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyvio.html" title="Copyvio">copyvios</a> (unless asked by the copyright holder), and no, editing an article to improve it isn't sweeping a problem under the carpet, and that's a basic principle underlying many of our policies. No change of vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 20:32, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, according to your logic, if someone writes in, say, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_%28DNA%29_e46e.html" title="Nick (DNA)">Nick</a> article, that "<b>Nick</b> is the guy with the longest <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a> in <a href="../../../c/u/p/Cupertino%2C_CA_ce93.html" title="Cupertino, CA">Cupertino, CA</a>" we shall keep the article?

<ul>
<li>Comment: No, I would not suport that argument, nor do I think it is a valid parallel to the current discussion. But I <b>would</b> argue that, if someone were to suggest that <i>Nick</i> was a <i>neologism</i>, then their logic was faulty. Wouldn't you? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 05:03, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, Andrewa gives 25,600 googlehits. let's have an article, then. BTW, is <a href="http://bbwdatefinder.com/Members/Browse.asp?Handle=andrewa&amp;SID=DV44B7D4-074C-4F50-9193-00028788A86B" class="external text" title="http://bbwdatefinder.com/Members/Browse.asp?Handle=andrewa&amp;SID=DV44B7D4-074C-4F50-9193-00028788A86B" rel="nofollow">this you</a>? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 21:43, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: No, and no. There is another explanation for these Google hits, and that is that Andrewa is a standard tie-breaker when several people called Andrew all want a userid based on their Christian names, on the same system. (That's not rocket science surely.) All I was asking for was a similar explanation, I still think one is required to cover a gaping hole in the logic above, and it's not obvious to me what it might be. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 05:03, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: Just to clarify my above vote, I think the current contents, although they need a lot of work, do contain some useful material.

<li>90% of the article was speculation. Deleted. Of the remaining 3 sentences, if you really want it, you must describe where and this exqactly term was used in the scifi Star Wars and babylon 5. I don't recall it used there. I admit, I didn't learn them by heart, but google search gives zero relevant pages, which is suspicious, in view of huge fandom. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 21:37, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I like the idea of a disambig page, but I'm still worried it is not a notable enough concept to warrant it.

<li><b>LOL</b>, Actually i found it funny that this page was put for deletion so fast. First i'd like to point out that votes for deletion of user pages is suppose to be done "in excessive or stubborn cases" as is stated on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, the comment on my user page was left after the VfD. I will try to work on the page, and probably remove the "list" of other users. It is sad that i wasn't given a chance to do so. <a href="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/index.php/User:beta_m" class="external text" title="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/index.php/User:beta_m" rel="nofollow">Beta_M</a> <a href="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/index.php/User_talk:beta_m" class="external text" title="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/index.php/User_talk:beta_m" rel="nofollow"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beta_m_affc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beta m">|<sup><b>contrib</b></sup></a> (<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Beta_m_520d.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Beta m"><small>Ã-Mail</small></a>)</li>

<li>Um voting without giving reasons is very stress-inducing because the vote and the voter are then unknown quantities. If someone wants to answer reason for deletion, maybe by providing evidence or improving the article, they don't know how or if there would be any point trying. Maybe the article doesn't need a reason, but they can't tell if the vote is about the article, or the topic. If a reason been given, it's not to hard to say "delete per (username) is it"? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 19:32, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I too see the list has returned, after being deleted. I think those on the list should feel free to remove their names, if they wish, and if added again then they can proceed with some sort of arbitration. I was actually thinking of adding my name. I've never actually been called a "deletionoholic" (just an old fashioned alcoholic, though that isn't true either), but if "frequently votes delete" (for shame, RickK, for <i>shame</i>!) is all it takes then I guess I fit the bill. I don't consider myself "deletionist", mostly because I think it's a stupid word. In fact, this whole thing is stupid, and I'm not going to cast any official vote, just my suggestion I mentioned. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 14:12, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

If you <b>do</b> update another user's page (and that's what a Wiki is for), please be very careful not to impersonate them, even accidentally. As an example of this, if you check the history, you'll see that the list was actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ABeta_m%2FDeletionoholics&amp;diff=9946955&amp;oldid=9913558" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ABeta_m%2FDeletionoholics&amp;diff=9946955&amp;oldid=9913558" rel="nofollow">restored</a> by another user, and of more concern they also restored the personal attack at the same time.

<li>(I started this page.) I agree to some extend with the above arguments, and the page should certainly be more precise about the status quo of these suggestions. It is known that Mr. Martin was consulted about and <i>has</i> blessed the pronunciations of Mr. Dotrice on the audio book version, which lends some credence to them. I am looking for a quote from Martin to confirm this. Also, the pronunciations of Martin himself have been recorded and noted by very diligent listeners and can be considered stable and more or less canonical (though not to the degree of Tolkien's). The motivation to collect this information in a single spot is to make them accessible to readers outside the core fandom. -- That being said, the page in its current form could easily be merged with the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_560d.html" title="List of characters in A Song of Ice and Fire">List of characters in A Song of Ice and Fire</a>.

<li>Shouldn't it all be merged into the main article on the book. <b>Merge into <a href="../../../a/_/s/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_3dd5.html" title="A Song of Ice and Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></b>. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:06, Feb 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>(I started the page.) Agreed with the suggestion of merging it into the main <a href="../../../a/_/s/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_3dd5.html" title="A Song of Ice and Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a> page, and promptly done it. The main problem of <i>sources</i> that MacGyverMagic pointed out in the original VfD remained (and bugged by much more than the location of this information). I think I solved it by changing the list of pronunciations to explicitly present <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Dotrice_c6d7.html" title="Roy Dotrice">Roy Dotrice</a>'s in the audio books, rather than the received pronunciation that has been established in the fandom (even thought that happens to be the same, because Martin and Dotrice are friends and agreed on the pronunciation). Suddenly it's an objective list that can be verified against the audiobooks, edited, and extended. I am much happier with the status of the information now, mostly thanks to MGM's original objections. -- I am new to the deletion proces... what happens now? I moved the information to another page, so the VfD'd page can die. Am I supposed to do anything, or will that happen automagically? Thore 09:32, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The term is a neologism invented by Ronald P. Carver, a professor of educational psychology who died a year ago, to denote normal reading as opposed to skimming or scanning. Carver was an important figure in his field, but this term does not enjoy wider usage.

<li><b><strike>Weak</strike> keep</b> I can see why this was nominated, though. It read like a puff piece, and he has only 3 league appearances. However, he has 8 England Under 21 appearances, so while I'd normally say that I'd want more time in a professional league to list a player (and have done so in the past), the international Under 21 caps and his transfer value (the BBC say 1 million pounds, not 250,000) give a strong indication that he is highly likely to have a significant career ahead of him, and certainly viewed as such by Liverpool FC.

<dd>But equally the teams may have been aware of UEFA plans to insist on a minimum number of 'homegrown' players for future matches in the Champions League and UEFA Cup, which would make a promising English player even more attractive to English teams.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It is hard to say why someone thought this person was interesting enough to write an article about. I'm guessing that it was someone connected with the Middle School that is named after him. It might be a young person who wrote it, and perhaps he or she didn't quite capture what Farquhar achieved on the School Board that made them think to name a Middle School after him one hundred years later. The article was only written today and is the first contribution of this user. I'm going to wait and see if there is any more information forthcoming.
