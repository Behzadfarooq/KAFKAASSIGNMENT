<li><b>Keep</b> I am very sorry for my late reply to this, It could not be helped because I had to deal with some people who wished me to modify my page. I also apologise in advance for any offence I may cause in disproving other's theories that this was not, to quote people's words "something made up in school one day."</li>
</ul>
<p>This action of putting "The Day" signs at strategic locations within a school is a documented and well used practical joke throughout the minority of American High schools. It has since spread to Australian schools.</p>
<p>I only thought of re-documenting it in wikipedia after reading about the "Columbine High School Massacre" in which one of the shooters was found to be in possession of "The Anarchist Cookbook." This triggered my memory and I remebered that this book has several offshoots, one of which is "The School Stoppers Handbook" or the "School Stopper's Textbook" (excerpts can be found at <a href="http://http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=451" class="external text" title="http://http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=451" rel="nofollow">| FIS</a> and <a href="http://http://www.omnipresence.mahost.org/fuckschool.htm" class="external text" title="http://http://www.omnipresence.mahost.org/fuckschool.htm" rel="nofollow">| OP</a> , some of my primary sources for this information ) which describe how through disinformation and acts of anarchy, a school can be stopped from running efficiently. Number 24 in both of these lists, describes how to distract teachers by sticking up "The Day" signs so that other acts of anarchy could be performed without intrusion.</p>
<p>For the record, cases have been reported in Australian schools, such as Waratah and Kotara High school. However, I chose to record Lambton High School's event, because the Police and Anti-Terrorism Unit were involved, thus giving the even more notoriety. My only source of primary information was an interview via phone that I had with the school and local police station, to confirm whether an event as such had taken place. Other secodary sources included the forum's on the now removed <a href="http://www.fridaystheday.cjb.net" class="external text" title="http://www.fridaystheday.cjb.net" rel="nofollow">| Friday's The Day</a> website,</p>
<p>What I have heard through unsourced means is that is was two students suspended, even though more "supposedly" helped them to commit this act and that the Police and Anti-Terrorism Unit were involved because a bomb-threat had been called in the same day. Technique 72 in the "School Stopper's Handbook."</p>
<p>As such, I believe the article in question is fit for listing in Wikipedia. Regardless of the outcome, I would appreciate a reply from <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a> ( Who put the up for deletion. ) as to whether the article will stay or go. Happy Nit-Picking on other's works</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_for_things_made_up_in_school_one_day_29ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day">Point to note</a> is that "School crazes, fads, and fashions can end up in Wikipedia. But only if someone first sits down and researches them, and <b>publishes a book</b>, an academic paper, or a magazine/journal article detailing that research. <b>Then the subject becomes eligible for Wikipedia.</b>"</p>

<dd>Thanks for the reply <s>and the insult</s>, but the issue is out of my hands now. The question I would have for you is whether anybody other than yourself and perhaps those at Lambton High School or the "minority" of high schools would ever think of putting The Day Signs into this encyclopedia and finding it useful. When I put it up for deletion, the article did not mention any of the sites listed above, nor any work of reference - I think you'll agree with me that the article does read like <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_for_things_made_up_in_school_one_day_29ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day">something made up in school one day</a>. Certainly, if this is notable, some of the information could perhaps be integrated into the <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_prank.html" title="School prank">school prank</a> article or maybe the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullying.html" title="Bullying">bullying</a> article. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a> 07:06, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also, would it be possible to change your signature, please? I would imagine it's not going to further your case by insulting every user you interact with. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a> 07:47, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sure it is out of your hands now. If I didn't think it was valuable to the encyclopedia I wouldn't have put it up. That is common sense. As for agreeing with you, please do not make assumptions on my part. It is a great suggestion that this be incorporated into the <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_prank.html" title="School prank">school prank</a> article, especially since the <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_prank.html" title="School prank">school prank</a> article is being considered for deletion for a third time. Are you trying to waste more of my time by suggesting this? You seem to be deleting my articles. . . and this is an editable encyclopedia, why don't you edit my name yourself? My point has been made, as such I do not need to "further my case" at this point.</p>

 Hey guys, i am one of the suspended students who was involved in fridays the day. We got the idea from another school who did it, though quite some time ago. I think it is worthwhile to feature this article. By the way, i made the fridays the day site. All it was was a pathetic flash cartoon and a spooky warning, as well as the forums, but it got the message accross. We were not the first to feature 'the day' signs and we certainly won't be the last. It is worthwhile because when it happens again, those who attend the school will need a point of referance.
