<li><b>Strong Keep</b>I say it needs an article because playing chicken with 381 lives is an excedingly noteworthy occurence. Also, there will likely be a large number of very noteable safety recomendations related to this accident when the investigation is completed, regarding the design of airports, how Air Traffic Control works and why the automatic collision avoidence systems failed. The page for the Teneriffe disaster links here. The cattegory this is listed in is not just 'accidents', it also contains 'incidents', where there was no major damage or injury, but still an important occurence. If almost hitting another jetliner isn't a noteable incident, I don't know what is. Finally (for now), <a href="../../../j/e/t/JetBlue_Airways_Flight_292_52ed.html" title="JetBlue Airways Flight 292">JetBlue Airways Flight 292</a> survived deletion, and a lot fewer lives were at stake there than in this article. - <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman">Blood red sandman</a> 19:58, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> as regards the numbers of incursions investigated, almost all <b>but</b> most of these either involve aircraft being there without authorisation but not actually being in the way, or a baggage car taking a shortcut accross the runway, that sort of thing. To airliners coming within a few feet of each other at take-off speeds (which are even higher than cruising speeds} is almost unheard of, in fact the only one I can think of othey than this one is the infamous Tenerife disaster - and we all know the consequences of that one. - <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman">Blood red sandman</a> 23:02, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sorry, what i <i>meant</i> but managed to screw up saying is that the power settings on the engines are much higher for take-off. while I'm on the subject, they would have had enough residual energy to propel the aircraft into each other for several seconds after the impact. - <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman">Blood red sandman</a> 23:21, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Sorry to add <b>yet another comment</b> to this discusion, just to say, the reason incursions like this are rare and unheard of is that usually the collision avoidance systems designed to prevent this sort of accident/incident from happening usually tell the aircraft involved to stop before they ever get going. Before this incident, the <a href="../../../f/a/a/FAA_42fa.html" title="FAA">FAA</a> had thought these systems to be unfailible. The fact that they failed on both aircraft and in the control tower and left two aircraft hurtling towards each other with engines at max power for take-off is a very serious and very noteable occurence. - <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman">Blood red sandman</a> 23:28, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> As a private pilot, I would like to add a few words here. Incursions happen more often than most realize, TCAS or not (the equipment sandman talks about). The power setting on take off are higher than at cruise however that doesn't mean anything when you are dealing with inertia. A jet traveling at .93Mach has much more inertia than a jet rotating (lifting off speed) at 140-160knots no matter what the engine settings are. Crashes are notable. Incidents like this happen many times a year, though most civilians never hear about or realize they occurred. I suggest that this be removed.

<dd>I was not refering to innertia. jet engines at full power do not stop instantly but can instead continue turning with significant power for a few seconds after power failure.

<li><b>Comment</b> Not really. Many other flights have happened that have changed national or international flight rules. A large majority haven't any article on them. There are MANY near misses or 'deals' that occur over a standard year. There is nothing special about this one. In fact, I can note two more where aircraft in the past two years, have had this EXACT incident happen (all commercial airliners, all nose to nose on the runway). In fact I have one where one airliner was landing while another was lining up to take off right at the landing aircraft. Incidents happen. Nothing is notable for this one other than the media decided to make a big deal out of it. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 14:41, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, but in the incident you refer to, the collision avoidance systems worked perfectly as I recall, and the aircraft was able to pull up long before it would have touched down. - <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman">Blood red sandman</a> 15:25, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sandman, no. TCAS does not work on the ground, nor would it detect aircraft on the ground, especially since the transponder was not turned on (they normally are only turned on after liftoff). The aircraft landed but was able to stop short of the other aircraft. Please do not make things up. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 18:48, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have heard reference made by the NTSB to a secondary, less well-known system for ground use, the acronym and name for this escapes me. I was never refering to TCAS - although if it were switched on, as I understand it, (although I'm unsure of this) it can detect aircraft on the ground, but would simply transmit continuous false alarms since what is too close in mid-air is perfectly reasonable on the ground. - <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman">Blood red sandman</a> 19:10, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This incident was a coordination error, not some yahoo sitting in a control tower going "yeehaw, look what I can do!" Do you have any idea how extensive FAA controller training is?

<li><b>Comment</b> I would normaly expect it to be deleted too, but I once, when i was even newer than I am now, saw an archived AfD discusion which stated 'The result was <b>no conscensus</b> - but (and I'm kicking myself for this) remember what article it was so I don't know if it was deleted, relisted at AfD, or kept - I guess we will just have to wait and see what the closing admin does. - <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman">Blood red sandman</a> 12:01, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This isn't a vote where the "majority" opinion gets implemented.

<li><b>Comment</b> I struggled with that too, but I think - in fact unless the user says otherwise I'm sure - that the meaning was that if this article was deleted, then some other article should include a link to the an external source to the incident, so that it at least gets a mention on Wikipedia. So far as I see though, there is no suitable article. - <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman">Blood red sandman</a> 01:25, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Your right - either or both would be suitable. I'm left wondering if that would be a good policy, though - I mean, if something is noteable enough to have an external link in a related article, surely it should have an article of it's own. I can see horrendous edit wars if that were to happen. It's not out of the question, but it would need to be carefuly thought over and carefuly implemented too. - <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman">Blood red sandman</a> 01:37, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think you guys got the idea. I understand some of the issues that would arise from this, but encyclopedias by their nature have gaps. Wikipedia, being able to change instantaneuosly, fills one. But it is just one source, while also being a compendium of knowledge (another gap). Citing outside sources would (sort of) fill that.<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary_Joseph_38f4.html" title="User:Gary Joseph">Gary Joseph</a> 06:23, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm teaching an intro to HCI/HF course tomorrow and found this link off of kegworth. I think it's worth the space, but will need to be updated. It is to my understanding a very close and uncommon incursion (not .1 miles, not .5 miles, not 1 miles), and has interesting usability and system implications.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As a former pilot, this event is highly unusual. The stastic of 1 incursion per day pointed out above (can't find a ref, but it's probably about right) includes airplanes that are hundreds of meters apart. These aircraft were a few meters apart, vertically, and would have crashed without evasive maneuvers on one pilot's part, which makes the incident relatively unique. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianski_0857.html" title="User:Brianski">Brianski</a> 09:48, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think that by keeping this article it sets a very bad precedent for wikipedia. The 5 pillars of Wikipedia clearly state that this place is not a newspaper; meaning that everything that gets into the news doesn't necessarily require an article. This incident was minor news. It took more then a full year(after the incident occurred) for someone to even write an article on it. If this article is kept, it means that ANYTHING,from a newspaper, one can argue that it belongs here. TripleH1976 19:47, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - I think that, for better or worse, that precedent was set a long time ago. &#160;:) I only voted "weak keep" because I do think you have a point in this regard, <i>but</i> Wikipedia already covers many, many less notable events than this. I understand your viewpoint that Wikipedia needs to tighten up and be more encyclopedia-ish, but it's not like this would set a new record for least notable article on Wikipedia. There's no precedents being set here... --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaysweet_f27f.html" title="User:Jaysweet">Jaysweet</a> 20:01, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Runway incursions of this nature are not "common", its not very often you see over 300 people on a collision course with each other. Had the pilots not noted the other aircraft then we may of had another Tenerife, which I think makes it more than noteworthy. In addition, the fact quite a thorough investigation is taking place asserts the seriousness of the incident. 82.195.109.147, 22:05, 5 September 2006 (GMT)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - It's these types of exaggerations, like the one above, that I'm afraid will get this article kept. Three hundred people were not on a collision course. Pilots are trained to handle very difficult situations. Do you think only on the ground is where those passengers faced danger? All through out the flight they were(just like all aircrafts in the air as I speak right now) in danger. Turbulence, weather, staying clear of other planes, minor malfunctions. All of that is danger. Do you purpose we make articles on those too? Make articles for every aircraft in serious danger. Traffic congestion is going to become a real big problem in airports around the world; the world isn't getting smaller, so we shouldn't be shocked by these near-misses in the future. Believe it or not, they will be happening. We can't have articles for each one of them. Wikipedia is becoming another newspaper source. TripleH1976 01:31, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - But what you just wrote is an exaggeration too. The dangerous parts of a flight are taking-off and landing. Planes rarely just fall out of the sky (maybe plane poop). I am not sure this falls under a "current events" category. Besides, you are using the "slippery slope" argument which is justifying current action by some unproved hypothetical. I agree to "keep" or delete only with some limitations. But if one of the pilots got an award from his peers for that, then it must have meant something.(see original vote above)<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary_Joseph_38f4.html" title="User:Gary Joseph">Gary Joseph</a> 06:23, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I know planes don't just fall out of the sky. However, there is danger while in the air. Mainly from turbulence and bad weather. Many years ago, a Japanese airplane experienced some very turbulence. Enough so to toss around some passengers that weren't seated. My point is that near-accidents shouldn't be sufficient enough for an article. I see Wikipedia has rules, but they don't seem to be reinforced. The criteria for an article seems to be way too flexible around here. TripleH1976 09:14, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> Yes, I think I remember the Japanese incident - my only comment at the time was "that's why most regular air travelers keep their seatbelts on when they aren't moving around the plane, even if the little light says you can take them off". In the air, yes, there are a lot of small incidents involving some danger. I myself have been on a plane carrying over 100 people that had to divert to a longer runway after a mid-air brake failure, they even rolled the fire trucks for us and i've been on a <a href="../../../c/r/j/CRJ-200_e77a.html" title="CRJ-200">CRJ-200</a> that had an engine seize up shortly before landing, and during final aproach the pilot struggled to maintain control because he payed more attention to trying to restart the engine than anything else. As they take-off and land, that's when the real danger is, because a tiny little thing like that happening then could be disasterous. but they can at least expect to be clear of other aircraft on the ground - unlike in the air, the rules are "one at a time", so it's fairly easy to keep things in check - as soon as theirs a problem on the ground, ATC just says "Stop!" and they all do. The planes should never have been allowed to even get their take-off rolls started. That ATC left them on a collision course is almost unheard of, Tenerife being the obvious exception. A few more seconds, and it would have been too late to stop the plane taking off, and the planes would have collided, killing most or all of 381 people. - <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman">Blood red sandman</a> 11:43, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - This article should be kept. All articles should be kept! If there is one person willing to write it and another interested in reading it, then why delete? The only articles which might ever be deleted should be those which are false, and those which distract from another, more correct article on the same topic. I think it is simply absurd that there are people out there who wish to get rid of articles simply because they personally judge them unimportant. If you don't like the article, then don't read it!</li>
