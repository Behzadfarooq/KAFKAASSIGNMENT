<li><b>Do not delete</b>, first, let it be said that contrary to ScienceApologist's accusations <b>I did not create this fork</b>. This stub was a consensus reached decision from a previous discussion on whether or not to include a popular creationist claim regarding the second law of thermodynamics in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_law_of_thermodynamics.html" title="Second law of thermodynamics">second law of thermodynamics Wikipedia entry</a>. It was decided that the issue, being a significant minority view, was nonetheless best put somewhere else and this stub for it was created. See for instance <a href="../../../s/e/c/Talk%7ESecond_law_of_thermodynamics_5a68.html#Mediation" title="Talk:Second law of thermodynamics">this mediation section</a> and especially the end of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Talk%7ESecond_law_of_thermodynamics_creationism_d827.html#Comment" title="Talk:Second law of thermodynamics/creationism">this section</a>. The link BTW ScienceApologist is referring to is owned by me <b>but it is not a personal web page</b> (i.e. it is not <i>about</i> me, it is about science, philosphy etc. and contains no actual <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">vanity content</a>). It is also not original research, as it consists of more than a dozen verifiable citations. I have had a dispute with ScienceApologist before, and he is now trying to remove web pages of mine both here and from the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontological_argument.html" title="Ontological argument">ontological argument</a> section. I didn't actually put the link there (some other user did, apparently finding the page useful) but ScienceApologist wants it removed nonetheless. You can find out about that dispute <a href="../../../o/n/t/Talk%7EOntological_argument_b15c.html#Removed_link" title="Talk:Ontological argument">here</a>. --<a href="../../../t/i/s/User%7ETisthammerw_810c.html" title="User:Tisthammerw">Wade A. Tisthammer</a> 23:50, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I created this page, not tisthammerw, as a solution to a very extended discussion on <a href="../../../s/e/c/Talk%7ESecond_law_of_thermodynamics_5a68.html" title="Talk:Second law of thermodynamics">Talk:Second_law_of_thermodynamics</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/c/Talk%7ESecond_law_of_thermodynamics_creationism_d827.html" title="Talk:Second law of thermodynamics/creationism">Talk:Second_law_of_thermodynamics/creationism</a>, following the direct suggestion of the appointed WP mediator to that discussion. The joint feeling in that discussion was that a detailed treatment of this pseudoscience topic was not appropriate for a frontline physics article. Therefore this page was created to allow a detailed examination of the history, sociology and whatever else for this topic here, rather than in <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Law_of_Thermodynamics_723b.html" title="Second Law of Thermodynamics">Second Law of Thermodynamics</a>. The article is clearly flagged as a stub, because to start it I merely cut and pasted the material that had previously been on the Second Law of Thermodynamics page -- which putting here allowed us to remove from there. A detailed treatment of this topic is by consensus not appropriate for <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Law_of_Thermodynamics_723b.html" title="Second Law of Thermodynamics">Second Law of Thermodynamics</a>, not appropriate for <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entropy.html" title="Entropy">entropy</a>, so it is ++useful for those articles to have this article that they can hand the discussion off to (including links, references, etc). Of course, at the moment the article is just a stub; but I very much doubt it will stay so short for very long(!). Like any other article on WP, the contents of this article are up for editing and change -- I'm not going to make any defence for or against tisthammerw's link. But the bottom line is this: having this separate article here in WP's namespace <i>is</i> useful, and has helped resolve a lengthy discussion elsewhere, so please don't delete it. -- <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheald_bb56.html" title="User:Jheald">Jheald</a> 23:58, 10 January 2006 (UTC).</li>

<dd>No, it's not a POV fork. It's a rational factoring of the content into two NPOV articles, reflecting the consensus outcome of an extensive and prolonged discussion. If there's something in this new article that you don't think reflects NPOV then edit it, but it seems a pretty solid and balanced NPOV beginning to me. -- <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheald_bb56.html" title="User:Jheald">Jheald</a> 03:35, 11 January 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>It may not be a POV fork of the 2nd Law article, but it is definitely a POV fork of the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a> article which already deals with second-law objections to evolution. It would have been better if editors at 2nd Law had consulted editors at <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> or <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a> before making a wholly separate article. As it currently stands, there are a lot of problems with this article and it doesn't lend itself to a redirect merger (it's not just a matter of editting). This is a generally poor way to handle a content fork especially now that Wikipedia has articles about so many subjects. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 04:01, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure what basis you have to call it POV. The section on the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a> says almost nothing about the topic, though that it even exists in the entry bears some mention.

<li><b>Comment</b>: A bit more detail is necessary, I think, given that this is an ongoing issue.

(Addendum: the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a> page says that this theory is too stupid even for creationist organisations to recommend using it, which means that it seems unlikely to be worth covering in any more depth than that article does.)</li>
<li>Currently the article does not explain why creationists believe the 2nd Law proves God's existence or whatever, but does find time to say that they're wrong.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Malthusian, the primary problem is that creationists make five separate arguments concerning 2LOT, none of which are scientifically supportable. As for delete vs keep, if this article is to stay it needs work, but not as if it were a full-blown article. On the other hand, I'm not sure that it should be kept at all, per the points raised by SA and others.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Given creationists never-ending litany of objections to evolution that cover such fields as physics, chemistry, cosmology, biology, mathematics, philosophy, theology, geology, paleontology, archaeology, etc., if we allow this article to stay, we'll need articles on such diverse topics as "Dendrochronology is suspect because two or more rings can grow per year", Light moths increased before trees got lighter", "Dinosaurs may still be alive in the Congo", "There is not enough helium in the atmosphere for an old earth", etc. But, having said all of that, I'm not going to vote because I had some involvement in the genesis of this page.

<dd>My point has always been that creationism objections to scientific viewpoints do not belong in every single article about a topic that they object about. I have to agree that making a new article is not reasonable for each topic's controversy, and that it should be in creationism, however I'm beginning to think that the article on creationism is hopelessly bogged down with comparisons between it and science. Maybe there should just be one big article similar to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_and_science.html" title="Religion and science">religion and science</a> or something like that? I suppose I am <b>delete</b> but for <b>relocation</b>. This stuff needs a home. I think <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> would be better if it talked about <i>creationism</i> instead of objections to scientific evidence and theories, and that the articles on scientific evidence and theories would be better if they were similarly limited in scope. Call me a reductionist, I guess. There are plenty of things in the Bible that do not have to do with creationism and yet violate the scientifically accepted laws of physics. --<a href="../../../i/g/n/User%7EIgnignot_131a.html" title="User:Ignignot">Ignignot</a> 21:17, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> First, being a stub is not sufficient reason for deletion. The article is only a few days old - wait a month and see if it grows up, and if not delete it then. Second, creationist misunderstandings about thermodynamics should be addressed somewhere in Wikipedia; but certainly not at <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_law_of_thermodynamics.html" title="Second law of thermodynamics">Second law of thermodynamics</a>. There is no adequate comment elsewhere. Third, deletion of this article will result in continuation of creationist interference with <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_law_of_thermodynamics.html" title="Second law of thermodynamics">Second law of thermodynamics</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article could be expanded to include arguments against evolution, and geological time, dating back all the way to <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelvin.html" title="Kelvin">Kelvin</a>. Kelvin argued (before the discovery of radioactivity) that the earth was too warm to be as old as geologists claimed and Darwin's theory required; when he presented his argument for a max age of 20,000,000 years (which was solid, if you don't take into account the heating due to radioactivity) in a popular form (MacMillan's Magazine, volume 5, 1862,pp. 288-293), it was in the context of the recent publication Origin. And in 1872, he presented a short essay on the origin of life, based similarly on thermodynamic arguments; after an invocation of the "solid and irrefragable argument" of Paley's Natural Theology, he concluded,: "...overwhelmingly strong proofs of intelligent and benevolent design lie all around us; and if ever perplexities, whether metaphysical or scientific, turn us away from them from a time, they come back upon us with irresistable force, showing to us through Nature the influence of free will, and teaching us that all living things depend on one ever-acting Creator and Ruler." (Report of the Forty-First Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Edinburgh, August 1871, pp lxxxiv-cv)--<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagesoss_e992.html" title="User:Ragesoss">ragesoss</a> 04:14, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whilst Kelvin's calculations was important to establishing the ancient <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_the_earth.html" title="Age of the earth">age of the earth</a>, (given the radioactivity issue which when discovered pushed it back further), that is not how modern YEC creationists ("<a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_scientists.html" title="Creation scientists">creation scientists</a>") use the term. The more modern "sophisticated" IDists don't use 2LOT because it is <i>so dumb</i>. Kelvin recognised the importance of evidence over scripture and recognised evolution but with "divine guidance" <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114_1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114_1.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. But the thermodynamics and the age of the earth is a different to creationism and the second law of thermodynamics, and is therefore OT. â€” <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">â˜º</a> 11:12, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And yet, strictly speaking, Kelvin did make the connection between his work based on the 2LOT and creationism, broadly defined. I'm not saying it's the same thing as modern YEC invocations of it, but it fits the title and potential content of the article; there is enough history of 2LOT-based arguments related to creationism, from both a geological and biological perspective, that the article could contain significant content in the future. The article is potentially broader than just "YEC creationism and the 2LOT applied to biology". And even for just recent arguments, the article has a lot more potential content, including arguments that the 2LOT didn't operate until the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fall_of_Man_58ca.html" title="Fall of Man">Fall of Man</a>, and a more extensive treatment of the detailed arguments and criticism. As Banno argues, we can't just relegate everything to do with creationism to the controversy article. 2LOT arguments are extensive enough (and different enough from other aspects of creation-evolution) to merit the existence of this article. The creation-evolution article is largely not about the details of the intellectual arguments in the debate, but about the nature of and participants in it. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagesoss_e992.html" title="User:Ragesoss">ragesoss</a> 05:08, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
