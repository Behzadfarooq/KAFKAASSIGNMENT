Whether we like it or not, schoolcruft seems to have a strong (if baffling) following on Wikipedia. Everything you've nominated will be kept, and I suspect you knew that before you nominated. Please consider reining it in a bit, and only nominating articles that could possibly see consensus to delete. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 17:35, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just because "schoolcruft will be kept" is no reason to attempt to stop the madness. This is a school which is a carbon copy of thousands of others. Merely existing is not sufficient reason for an article.

<ul>
<li>This is not the only school article that Dunc has nominated recently. He's put quite a few of them up for deletion, despite knowing full well that his nominations would not do any good. He's also phrased his nominations in a manner calculated (or so it seems to me) to irritate the pro-schoolcruft faction. If that's not being a dick and disrupting AfD to make a point, well, what is it? --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 03:32, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Have you nothing better to do than finding articles people have spent their precious time writing and nominating them for deletion?! Wikipedia is not paper and it has more than enough resources for an article on every school in the country. Tredington school has served local communities for well over 100 years, and has even had a book written about it. It's also clearly stated that the article is a stub (so even a suggestion of 'rewrite' is hardly useful, that's the whole point of a stub is it not?). As for (my) reference to culture shock, if you don't like it delete the reference (which somebody has done). That comment has no bearing on the usefulness of an article on Tredington School. Actually I consider that to be useful information anyway, as somebody who went through that process - Tredington had under 60 pupils when I was there, and we left that closed little world for a school of over 1,000 - that's nearly triple the population of my entire village! <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Kennedy_feb5.html" title="User:Stephen Kennedy">kingboyk</a>
<ul>
<li>Don't worry, I'm sure the nominator will point out how few edits you have and cook up some condescension for you as well. If you're lucky, he might throw in the word "crap" since he hasn't used it in this AfD yet. That way, you'll know that he does have "something better" to do with his time. ie. count user contributions and think up non-clever condescending remarks.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 18:26, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm not making any such assertion, no. It's no more or less notable than any other random school. Wiki, however, <b>is not paper</b>, and AFAIC an institution which has touched the lives of hundreds of children over 100+ years (and which is still active today) deserves a page if someone is willing to write one - yep, any and every school. Why not?! It's not costing anybody anything, and if you don't like it don't read it (the stance I will be taking with pages on railway engines, I can assure you). There's clearly a 'political' motive to all this and it's not really about Tredington School, it's about how wide Wikipedia's coverage should be. My personal opinion is: as wide as possible. Others will disagree, no problem. I do think there's a danger of all this descending into an early 90s style Usenet flamewar however... --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 19:47, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm getting tired of the newbie chant "Wikipedia is not paper." True, but Wikipedia <i>is</i> server space, screen real estate, editor time, and search engine fodder. Just because it exists does not render it an automatic in. Schools are not automatically notable. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:44, 24 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Server space costs virtually nothing, especially for text articles. Schools attract more editors and thus create more editor time. Schools also provide search engine fodder, attracting more users, donors and editors to wikipedia, which is a good thing. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:24, 25 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Server space is not just about cost, it is also about accessibility. Every article takes up server space, and the more articles on server space, the longer they take to access. Next time you can't get onto Wiki, you may consider your foolishness in voting to keep everything with four walls and a roof. I question your contention that the mere existence of school articles on Wikipedia is going to encourage the participation of users and editors. Sounds like wishful thinking to me, and is most certainly unverifiable. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 02:17, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, the mere extistence of an article about something interesting, obviously does attract readers and editors, through something known as a <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine.html" title="Search engine">search engine</a>. It, generally, only returns results for a search, if relevant content already exists. I, like many editors, have edited countless articles *only* because I found something on wikipedia in Google, based on wikipedia happening to have what I was looking for. Many people start as an anon, with just an interest in a specific article (maybe just doing a spelling correction at first), then they progressively turn into regular editors, even admins, and ultimately make lots of contributions in many areas. There's no finite/fixed amount of wiki editors. Editors create interesting content, and interesting content attracts new editors. On the other hand, blind deletion of content, without justification, quite clearly does discourage new editors, and causses existing editors to give up in frustration. The contribution of those editors extends beyond just schools. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 14:04, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't see the formation of a consensus in the former, and the entirety of the latter page seems to be evidence that it's a contentious topic, with no consensus yet formed. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 16:58, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>It depends on what type of school you are talking about. If you are referring to a degree granting institution, there appears to be an overwhelmingly strong consensus in favor of including them. There also appears to be a mild or luke-warm consensus to keep high schools. There is no consensus to delete primary or middle schools and when there is no consensus on whether to keep or delete something this results in a keep. So to say that the consensus so far has been to keep schools is somewhat accurate depending on how you want to interpret its meaning. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 17:29, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's not true, gracefool. There has almost always been no consensus to keep schools, either primary/elementary or secondary/high. Very often, there is in fact a bare majority to delete, but no consensus to do so. With no consensus to keep, delete, merge, or do anything else, these articles generally exist in a kind of "legitimacy limbo"; they exist purely because it is the nature of a wiki to be relatively indiscriminating. This is sometimes a great strength of a wiki; it is also its profound weakness.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">enceph</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#666699">alon</font></a> 12:02, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Eventually wikipedia will develop some kind of filter for general-interest and specialist-interest topics, so people who want a highly discriminating wikipedia can have it, and users can still find information when they need it. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 22:31, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Very poorly written. However, 1. there appears to be at least one good, independent, reliable source which has the school as its focus, and which may be used to write an encyclopedic article in accordance with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>; 2. with a 100 year history there is some chance that the 27-page report is not the only such source; if a reference can be found detailing its history, it will probably satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Of course, I am sceptical that it will ever be improved: the whole school thing is one of WPs depressing ironies.
