<li><b>DO NOT Delete</b> Those of us familiar with the art world know how remarkable the students of Jacob Collins are, and Nicholas is considered among his finest.Steveh1023 23:05, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> But, he's a student that has yet to attain notability. I guess this is all in the eye of the beholder. Let's give Nick the chance to become notable before we sing his praises. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 22:12, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I guess I find that to be a strange way of looking at things. After all, doesn't one become notable, in part, by others singing one's praise? And is it fair to label someone as not having attained notibility in a field with which you may not be familiar?Steveh1023 23:05, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Maybe I should clarify. A better saying would be don't count your chickens till they hatch...or something like that. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 22:29, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> "Don't count your chickens before they hatch" may be a fine saying, but not entirely applicable here, as I can assure you that Nicholas' chickens have already begun to hatch.Steveh1023 23:05, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If they did, he would have at least one google hit, or a hit on any search engine, or be mentioned by some sort of information. So far, the signs point to the fact that this has yet to occur. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 22:38, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Try "Nicholas Hiltner" and you may be pleasantly, or perhaps unpleasantly in your case, surprised.Steveh1023 23:05, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>DO NOT Delete</b> Please?<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.143.69.126 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.143.69.126_faac.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.143.69.126">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> No offense, but it's Hiltner's personal website, and a few other links describing how he is "(good at) navigating the web comes naturally to a new generation of artists—like himself. Hiltner participates in online art forums, posting images and receiving feedback."<a href="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:vqTTXtQ0KmUJ:www.1lifedrawing78.info/+%22Nicholas+Hiltner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6" class="external autonumber" title="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:vqTTXtQ0KmUJ:www.1lifedrawing78.info/+%22Nicholas+Hiltner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. None of those articles show Hiltner is above and beyond the rest of his field. All, I know is that he is a sculptor. Ok, anything to tell me that he's notable? Nope. Sorry, let's not worry about Wikipedia but actually worry about the subject. I don't understand how having a wikipedia article suddenly makes you great. If you garner a wikipedia article, chances are Wikipedia is something you're not going to care terribly about. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 22:49, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> None taken, don't worry, but understand that my previous comment was simply negating yours, and showing that he did indeed have "at least one google hit, or a hit on any search engine, or be mentioned by some sort of information," no more, no less. And what, may I ask, prompted the rant on wikipedia making someone great? Certainly it was not something to be inferred from my simple comments.Steveh1023 23:05, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> You're right it was a little bit of an unprokoed rant, you can post messages on my talk page btw just to keep this article short, of something that I've been noticing. My little term that I call a Wikidream, in which people will post what they wish to do or overexagerate what they have done. I feel like I'm crushing dreams. But that's aside the point. I just really have to question Hiltner's notability. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 22:57, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> No notability whatsoever asserted for this artist in his early 20s. Five unique (seven total) Google hits for "Nicholas Hiltner". -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:57, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It seems that if this guy was "internationally renowned" and prestigious enough to warrant a Wikipedia definition, he would have maybe won some sort of award or gotten some other recognition. If there was a link showing something like that, then the article would have some validity. Plus, he does have very few Google hits, and most if not all of them are stuff he probably put out there himself. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisheromen_0b6d.html" title="User:Fisheromen">Fisheromen</a> 23:06, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Gentlemen, there comes a time when even the most dedicated of brothers must admit the failure of his ploys. I accept your gracious judgments, and I thank you for your undying dedication to purging wikipedia of non-notable articles, however curious it is that you've responded within a few minutes of the article's creation. Good day, and may the force be with you.Steveh1023 23:18, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
