<li>Wikipedia is not a game guide. <b>Edit:</b> I just want to add right up front for the closing admin to make sure there is no confusion that this article is merely a list of every ability the various pokemon have in the various pokemon games, what these abilities do, and which pokemon have them. Therefore the sole purpose of the article is to be an in-depth guide to a facet of a video game. Here is a quote from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "Instruction manuals - while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice (legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, <b>video game guides</b>, and recipes." (Emphasis added) To quote <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_Policy_a230.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion Policy">Wikipedia:Deletion Policy</a>: "[I]t's worth noting that (as with all Wikipedia consensus decisions), the purpose of a discussion is to bring out a "sense of the community" and the valid points for or against each view. So deletion is not a strict "count of votes", but rather a <b>judgement based upon experience and taking into account the policy-related points made by those contributing</b> (emphasis added). The policy arguement for deletion is that it is a violation of the WP:NOT point quoted above. The keep votes are based mostly on an desire by pokemon fans to keep an article they have worked on and find useful, but no arguement has been made relating to policy, nor has the proposition that the article violates WP:NOT been refuted. Just some food for thought. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 01:39, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Whoa, hold it!</b> Wouldn't it be more appropriate to discuss this on the article's talk page instead of instantly nominating it for deletion? I'm not for deleting the article, but I also see how it doesn't qualify for the Best Article award. Maybe it could use more expository text and have more of an overview of what a Pokémon ability is instead of being merely a huge list. Several people put a lot of work into this article (there's a lot of Pokémon to list and link); it'd be a shame to lose it so fast. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandon_Dilbeck_91d8.html" title="User:Brandon Dilbeck">Brandon Dilbeck</a> 01:48, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is none of my concern whether a lot of people have worked on this article or not. Please read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, paying particular attention to the part about wikipedia not being a game guide. This article violates policy, and I see no way this article could be changed to not violate policy. AfD is the proper venue for this discussion. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 01:53, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I say <b>Keep</b> because this article is relatively new and could be fixed to have more generic information in it, rather than being a big list of data. With the new Pokémon game coming out soon, there may soon be a plethora of information to add. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandon_Dilbeck_91d8.html" title="User:Brandon Dilbeck">Brandon Dilbeck</a> 02:05, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Though there are other wikis where concerned Pokemaniacs can harvest info, a small article is ok.<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 01:58, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, no it is not because it violates policy. I hope that if this keep vote trend continues the admin who closes this AfD will take a close look at the article and a close look at policy and realize that this article is in violation. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 02:03, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Although it could do with references moving onto the article itself instead of via wikilinks, it passes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, my most important test.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hold up! Where does it cite sources? Why should this article be allowed to ignore <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> when all other articles must follow them? While I can respect the feelings that some of the other editors have completely, the fact of the matter is that this AfD is not about censorship or picking favorites or suggesting that pokemon isn't important to children or such. <b>It is about if the Article can pass all of Wikipedia's rules.</b> Let me help out a bit so the people new to wikipedia understand. The real problem with this article is that it doesn't follow the three pillars of wikipedia. An article must be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiable</a> through multiple, reliable, reputable, independent, third-party sources. It must not be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, which means there have to be sources to back up the claims of the author(s) and all information provided in the article. It must also have a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point-of-view</a> and not show bias. As a guideline for the above rules, an article must <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite it's information</a> with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and be must be <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">encyclopaedic</a>. This article fails to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, sections of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> (if not all of OR), does not follow the guideline of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Wikipedia is a tertiary source that includes material on the basis of <b>verifiability, not truth.</b> This article <b>must</b> cite <i>multiple, reliable, secondary, independent of the organization, non-trivial, third-party sources such as books, magazines, and papers that have national and/or international coverage.</i> The articles must be based, or completely focused on just pokemon (and in this case, the powers). Just a mention in passing is not acceptable (as it is concidered a trivial source...even if it is in the New York Times...the source isn't trivial, but the coverage by the source was). So far no one has shown that there are reliable secondary sources that fit this criteria for this article. <b><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a></b> is one of Wikipedia's three content-guiding policies. The other two are <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> (as explained above). Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main namespace. They should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should therefore try to familiarize themselves with all three. <b>The principles upon which these three policies are based are non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by other policies or guidelines, or by editors' consensus.</b> In essence, please explain why this article should be allowed to not follow WP:V when all other articles must. While we know that pokemon is Verifiable, where are the New York Times, Washington Post, or CBS nightly news report on the pokemon abilities? I hope this helps understand my take on this discussion. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 07:04, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> There are ungoing debates over the use of wikilinks as references. Whilst featuring the references themselves is generally better, if a direct wikilink has the reference this also tends to count. Secondly, Primary sources are valid sources for <i>indisputable facts</i>, such as the engine of a car, or rules within a game.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. The section where it lists what abilities each Pokémon has should simply be on the individual Pokémon pages, however a general article describing the gameplay mechanics of abilities (i.e., everything above the list) is fine with me as long as it doesn't become a game guide. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanG_1aea.html" title="User:BryanG">BryanG</a><sup><a href="../../../b/r/y/User_talk%7EBryanG_f39b.html" title="User talk:BryanG">(talk)</a></sup> 07:11, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>How do you cite a video game? I'm just ignorant--I'd do it if I knew how. Regardless, I didn't use any external resources to write the upper paragraphs (above the list), just my own personal knowledge of what Pokémon have which abilities. Besides, the List of Mario series items is also video-game-related and it doesn't seem to cite any resources as well. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandon_Dilbeck_91d8.html" title="User:Brandon Dilbeck">Brandon Dilbeck</a> 14:39, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My research wasn't original; this information can be found in many places on the Internet and it's been published in many playing guides and even in the game itself.

<li>A page listing and describing all the abilities is a game guide in violation of policy. Cleaning it up will not save it. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 17:10, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm all for having an article that explains what Pokémon abilities are, which assumes no prior experience of Pokémon, and generally describes some of the various types of abilities. But a listing of each specific ability and which Pokémon creatures have that is utter gamecruft, and should be removed. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 18:33, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>However surely the article you propose, stripped of descriptions of all but a handful of abilities and without additional information is of less intrinsic value than the current article? It would, however, be more immediately accessable - but this is easily fixable in the current article. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 19:22, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The question is not one of value but of being encyclopedic. If one wants a description of Pokemon abilities, one should go to GameFAQs. Wikipedia is not a substitute for the internet. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 19:42, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't see why not--isn't it Wikipedia's goal to absorb as much knowledge as possible?

<li>If Wikipedia's goal was to "absorb as much knowledge as possible", then every single non-notable vanity article would have been kept. I've written articles about my former company, a fan club I'm part of, and myself. All got deleted for non-notability, and I agree with the result. If you really want "as much knowledge as possible", I can document every single old newspaper, empty beer can, and ball of dust I have lying around. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 20:59, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Cleanup</b> — Based on the desriptions of the abilities, which delve into things like HP's &amp;c., most of the content is pretty clearly game guide. It needs a significant re-write to bring it in line with wikipedias consensus policies.

<li><b>comment</b>. I don't understand the jump between an article being <i>about a game</i> and being a <i>game guide</i>. To my mind, a game guide gives you hints and suggestions about strategies, etc. Documenting facts about a game need not constitute a guide. Also, for articles about fictional works, the work itself often serves as a perfectly good primary source. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 04:40, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree that this can be a difficult area to define. To me, it usually comes down to focus. Obviously, an article must give a general overview of how a game works in order to convey the subject properly. However, when an article begins to go into every facet of a game, or a part of a game, then it is starting to cross the line. By analogy, a plot summary is necessary to explaining a novel, but a chapter by chapter summary goes beyond explaining what the book is about and becomes a substitute for the novel itself. As for pokemon, describing the role abilities play in the game and giving one or two examples helps inform on the game. Something this comprehensive can only be useful to one attempting to formulate game strategy even if the article does not give specific strategies itself. In other words, only one playing the game requires this level of deatil. That, to me, is what makes it a game guide. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 04:51, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree and would put the Catagories into a Deletion review, personally. There is no reason for catagories on 'growth' or 'lightning' just to catagorize the characters. The articles on the characters are enough. There is no need to catagorize them or even have a 'list' like this. Remove the list, leave the top paragraph but reference the hell out of it. Why do we need a list when it is easy enough for people to look directly at each characters' page and/or get a free game guide/FAQ online? The only people who would be interested in knowing this information are the people who play the games...hence it is a game guide. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 16:30, 26 August 2006 (UTC)
