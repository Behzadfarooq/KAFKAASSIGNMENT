<li><b>Delete</b> The whole basis of this article is original research or speculation including choice sentences like "Nick Berg visited Israel which lends credence to the idea he was an Israeli spy. I visited Canada once, does that make me a secret Mountie agent? And that is just one of many examples. The article asks a series of questions which I can only assume doesn't really fit in any article.

<li>In principle, I agree with you. But who would write an NPOV article about the conspiracy theories surrounding the death of a single individual? All the people interested in those theories are true believers in Nick Berg conspiracies. A more neutral observer is likely to be interested in conspiracy theores as a general phenomenon, and not be interested in focusing on this particular area. ¶ If I thought anybody was likely to step up to the plate, I'd suggest stubifying the article. (The existing article is really a conspiracy <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tract.html" title="Tract">tract</a>, not an article -- there's nothing worth saving.) But I don't believe anybody will, so we might as well delete it. ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 22:12, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless revised. This is complete speculation and most of the so called "suspicious" things about the video are easily explained by the captors killing Berg before his decapitation.

<li><b>Merge, Rewrite</b>. This article being separate makes it a soapbox for conspiracy theorists. Yes, there are bad arguments, but there are many good ones much accredited by research and people spent a lot of time accumulating these.

Yes it is speculation, but so is the Kennedy Assassination, and that is a better known and more popular discussion.

<li>nonono, we allow and indeed encourage users to add to articles while they are up for Vfd!--indeed the changes may sway voters to change their votes.

<li>Not really sure how I should vote on this. Klonimus -- help me out. Perhaps Wikipedia does not exist to pass judgement, but rather to document, eh? Perhaps our objective should simply be to document the claims that surround the useage of the term "Right to exist," without passing any judgement over its existance or nonexistance, pejorative nature, the moral value of those who use the term, its history of use, etc. etc. Haven't made up my mind yet, I'm sure you've got some consistent insights to share, though. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 17:23, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Furthermore, in virtually every negotiation between the Israelis and Palestinians, the "right to exist" is mentioned in some way, and often plays a critical role in the negotiations.

<li><i><b>Comment:</b> Hello. This is not a "joke" or "POV rant." MAPA is a real organization with over 20 active members from Mandeville, Louisiana.

<li><i><b>Comment:</b> 20 members may not seem like a significant amount, but it is in terms of Mandeville, Louisiana. Every organization has to start somewhere and for a young group in our area, this is a lot of members. The article was written to supplement the article about Mandeville for anyone interested in what we do. If you don't think this article belongs, that's fine, but there's no need to make fun of people trying to get something started.<a href="../../../p/a/j/User%7EPajhonka_f9d7.html" title="User:Pajhonka">Pajhonka</a> 20:00, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</i>

<li><b>Comment:</b> 20 members may indeed be significant in terms of Mandeville, Lousiana, but this is not an encyclopedia about Mandeville, Louisiana.

<li>That doesn't mean it isn't vanity. He may be a very good teacher at Fredericton High School but that doesn't make him a legitimate subject for an encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">Dbiv</a> 21:50, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We think reverence is a better term. While it is indeed 'coloured' by our point of view, there is nevertheless valid information contained therein: for example, even I (the co-writer) didn't know his wife- and daughter's names, and I imagine many others would learn something even if they knew the man well, like myself. One commented that he is not 'notable'. Well this is quite subjective; we certainly think so, and we know of many who would find this article informative as well as amusing who have taken one or more of his courses. He deserves to be recognised - there are few teachers we can say this about.</li>

<li><b>query</b> At 1.24 Kb, the text with which we are concerned takes about 0.000075 cents of storage space. I need not remind you that this is not an ordinary encyclopaedia, yet your reasoning for deletion because of 'non-notability' seems to suggest it should contain a similar amount of information as a physical one; that 1.24 KB is a precious amount of storage space compared to the fame, or lack thereof, of the subject in question. I understand the motive for keeping the information on wikipedia clean and relevant, but it seems absurd that these 'non-notables' should be deleted for any other reason. If this is relevant to 1 person, is that not worth at least 0.000075 cents?
<ul>
<li>No. This is also not the point, if it is only relevant to one person, it is not likely to be checked adequately for inaccuracy and vandalism. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 08:03, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>It was a rhetorical question - I don't appreciate your spite. Anyway, I did not say that it was only relevant to one person; it was hypothetical, and to prove a different point.</li>

<li><b>Do not Delete</b>*. Mr. Dunfield's accomplishments greately surpass those of the stereotypical high school teacher. He has greately influenced the lives of many if not all of his students. He teaches advanced level classes and always teaches with knowledge and great enthusiasm. For these reasons he is definitely notable and deserves to be in this encyclopedia.</li>

<p>Several problems with the article. 1) the title "Economic fallacy" is a bit of a misnomer. Everyone agrees on what the "fallacy of composition" is. There isn't a single "economic fallacy" with the same consistent definition. 2) the content of the article is mainly a POV-heavy critique of the lending practices of the World Bank and IMF. Criticsm of those institutions is already well documented in their respective articles. For those two reasons, a merge or a redirect don't seem useful to me... I think it's better just to delete the page. <a href="../../../f/e/c/User%7EFeco_e36a.html" title="User:Feco">Feco</a> 19:22, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> The current content is a POV essay, and even if it were replaced, I'm not sure what we'd write in an article about economic fallacies.

<li>I recently saw a short text made for university use about popular misconceptions about economics, but it was something of a POV piece. Feco and Rhobite are right; the title isn't really salvageable. Nor is an article that begins "To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck” a likely candidate to merge... <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 22:56, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page was up for deletion once before but I decided to list it again. The article seem to be a total vanity article. When discussing whether or not to delete the article before, the subject of the article, who is <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> was asked to refrain from editing the article. He has been unable to do so and has made almost weekly edits to it changing wordings, listing himself as in categories (such as philosopher) which he may or may not actually be qualified as. He did seem to appear in a few Google searches, but that's not very hard to do. I myself have published books, have taught classes, and have many of the same qualifications as this man seems to have, but I don't feel the need to glorify myself or make a completely vanity-like article. The fact that this user himself is the one who's done most of the workl on the article, and has made the majority of the edits, especially after being asked not to do so, is troubling to me and puts the reputation of wikipedia at stake. {See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_David_Mertz_Archive_262f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David Mertz/Archive">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David Mertz/Archive</a> for the previous deletion vote) --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottyBoy900Q_4200.html" title="User:ScottyBoy900Q">ScottyBoy900Q</a> 15:35, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My book on <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addison-Wesley_c410.html" title="Addison-Wesley">Addison-Wesley</a> has sold about 3500 printed copies to-date (but has just gone to second printing in the last week), but has been downloaded approximately <b>70,000</b> times in its electronic version. The website gnosis.cx is essentially exclusively for archival publications of my articles first published in other places. It has received visits from approximately <b>750k</b> distinct IP addresses (which only loosely correlates with eyeballs, of course). However, the original publishers, chiefly IBM <a href="../../../d/e/v/DeveloperWorks_76db.html" title="DeveloperWorks">developerWorks</a>, O'Reilly ONLamp<a href="http://www.onlamp.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.onlamp.com/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, and Intel's (now terribly unorganized) developer site, certainly receive more readers on first publication (of my articles specifically) than does my archival site.

<dd>I took a look at Google Scholar for my name. It's a cool tool; I haven't really used it before. There seems to be a "DB Mertz" who is an ethologist, and is not me. But looking through the 67 basic hits, I see that 38 of them are really about me. Fewer than half of those concern any work for IBM. It appears that I have a number of citations and acknowledgement related to my philosophy work that I had not been aware of. Cool! See: <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22david+mertz%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22david+mertz%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></dd>

Interestingly, all of the 11 books that contain my name in their text are genuinely references to me. It's delightful to me (for vanity reasons) that books as diverse as <i>Women's Health Solutions</i>, <i>Understandings of Russian Foreign Policy</i>, <i>Philosophy of Science and Its Discontents</i>, <i>Python Cookbook: 2nd Edition</i>, <i>Fear, Truth, Writing: From Paper Village to Electronic Community</i>, and <i>Sexual Investigations</i> all mention me. Mostly just by way of brief acknowledgments or citations of a single paper; I'm certainly not claiming that any of those are significantly about me.</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Google Scholar turns up some half-dozen hits (admittedly in IBM publications) so I don't feel it's <i>total</i> vanity although it is somewhat self-promotional. I too am disturbed by the edit pattern, but it did fairly clearly survive the previous Afd and the request there by <i>Smoddy (Rabbit and pork)</i>that <i>Lulu</i> not edit the page further can hardly be taken as binding. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 16:26, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This is just absurd (again). Yeah I'm the guy the article is about, and I've done a number of <i>small</i> edits on it, but the substantial content was written by our fine admin SlimVirgin (and contributions by other top-notch editors). But either way, "David Mertz" is both meaningfully discussed in a bunch of Wikipedia articles (on computer programming-ish topics), and read by hundreds of thousands of readers (a magnitude more than watch the minor porn actors with articles, or ever attended some high school with an article). I mean, 85,700 google results on "David Mertz" isn't an accident (about 95% are the right david mertz). Nor is the high Alexa rating on the site gnosis.cx where my articles get archived. Contrary to my "sworn enemy" Jguk, my contributions to Wikipedia are completely non-notable in this article, and that's why they are not mentioned. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 17:08, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just the fact that you're so dedicated to making sure the article stays seems to justify my claim that its for vanity.

You just don't seem significant enough to warrant having your own article. The very idea that you edit it and keep editing it to me indicates its just for self promotion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree that if he <i>weren't</i> a Wikipedia editor, this article would unquestionably be kept.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have no reason to doubt that this AfD was brought in good faith. However, while I had personally never heard of David Mertz, there is sufficient evidence of notability, through google searches, and online bookshop searches, etc. His book "usually ships within 24 hours" at Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk. (The more obscure titles have "usually ships within two months, but may not be available at all".) The book seems to be popular and to sell well. Obviously, it was against Wikipedia policy for Lulu to have started the article, but he explained in the first AfD that he was unaware of that policy at the time.

<dd>As is noted in the article talk page (and the prior failed VfD), I <i>did not</i> write the article. I copies it from a bio at another wiki that discusses various computer people.

<li>A just-now emerging political figure in small New Zealand is not likely to Google-test well, but his high place on the electoral list of one of the world's most successful Green parties makes him quite notable. <b>Keep</b>, and I will resubmit it for vfd myself if he doesn't win the seat on the list of a party in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_2005_f2fa.html" title="New Zealand general election 2005">the election</a> rumoured for late July, and no later than September this year. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 23:10, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but move to the correct spelling. His chances of election may not be as high as suggested above, but they're certainly not zero, and we're not in the business of predicting the election results. Whether the article is worth keeping can be debated after the election. Note that Vardion is adding short bios of all candidates in this election with a non-zero chance of being elected, and I think that's very worthwhile for us to have.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 00:33, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I wouldn't quite go so far as to say that I'm writing bios for "all candidates in this election with a non-zero chance of being elected", but I'm trying to make sure that anyone who eventually is elected isn't a red link when it occurs. Personally, I would <i>like</i> to include all candidates (after all, what harm would it actually do?). But that's probably not going to happen. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVardion_fde2.html" title="User:Vardion">Vardion</a> 01:01, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>What, even if they're of the level of Tarquin Fintim-Limbim-Whimbim-Lim Bus Stop-F'Tang-F'Tang-Olé-Biscuit-Barrel, who stood in the Corby 1981 by-election in the UK?

<ul>
<li>Actually, I think that someone like that would actually be <i>more</i> worthy of an article, as he sounds considerably more interesting than most other by-election candidates. Basically, my view is that including minor candidates doesn't in any way hurt Wikipedia, and so just so long as the information about them is verifiable and NPOV, it might as well be included. If there's someone willing to create the articles, of course — I certainly wouldn't consider the lack of complete coverage to be a gap or flaw in Wikipedia. But there's no need to worry that I'll be attempting something like this — I doubt most Wikipedians would share my view, and I'm quite prepared to abide by the consensus. (Although I still think that Russel Norman fits well within the scope of Wikipedia — he actually stands a chance of being elected.) -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVardion_fde2.html" title="User:Vardion">Vardion</a> 20:05, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's not a successionist movement, not even a micronation, really. It's more of a political stunt, I agree.
