<dd>thanks Bainer. I removed all the duplications. For the Web Pro News one, since he's writing articles on privacy and security for a notable source, that means they consider him an authority on the topics (thats why I included that one, that way, since it all compiles to establish notability IMHO). For the newsletter one, that seems to be a major news thing for that industry, and had been in his article as a source for quite a long time. thanks for the help. That cuts my list to 47, with 10 in the primary section. There may be more in the Google search I included, or if someone has Lexus Nexus-type access (I don't unfortunately!). - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 05:53, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia does not need to follow your advice minutely. A consensus was reached to bring it forward a few days since it was going nowhere.</p>

<dd>Look at the talk page for the article and at the hopeless drama that occurred this morning. I don't care either way but it doesn't make any difference whether people sit around thinking for a week or only four days. Especially considering that no one was thinking about anything and just continuing the wheel-war in new and innovative ways. And even so, once 50 people have given opinions without anyone objecting that it is "too early" is then I'm afraid is "too late". <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Spart_dfd6.html" title="User:David Spart">David Spart</a> 00:50, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

But the question is really for you: are you <i>so</i> tied to process that the mere recommendation of a closer on DRV is some kind of holy writ in your mind? Really who cares? I just don't want to see yet another 50 considered comments on the scrap heap for some daft reason. Do you?

<dd>Wait a second. You claimed there was consensus for an early AfD. I asked you where consensus was reached. You replied that there was "hopeless drama this morning " and that "50 people have given opinions without anyone objecting". Neither of which answered my question. I am not saying that we should close the AfD. Now that it has started, we should let it run. But <i>prior to starting the AfD</i>, there was NO consensus reached that we should start it early. That is all that I am saying. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 01:14, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Michael, in fairness, there was no consensus to have an AfD one week from now. It's also not clear that we needed yet another AfD when DRV seemed to show that most people wanted to <s>delete</s> keep it. Dragging the process out to AfD meant that another farce was guaranteed, and it doesn't make any difference whether we act it out now or in a few days time. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:48, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't believe that's what deletion review showed at all. That's why a separate discussion was necessary.

<dd>Sorry, I mistyped above; I meant most people wanted to keep it. It was deleted out of process, and DRV, which is supposed to be based on a majority, overturned it. Therefore, there was no need for another AfD, never mind one postponed by a week. The more frequently this is discussed, the less chance there is that the discussion will be a rational one, because people get frustrated and positions become entrenched. This is the second time in the last few weeks I've seen an admin ignore the majority position in DRV about a BLP, which has had the effect of making DRV almost redundant. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:36, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How can a consensus ever be build here? Everyone has there own position - there are really only two:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) Brandt doesnt want it, privacy BLP blah blah blah so Delete or Merge or something and</li>
<li>(b) Brandt is notable and passes all the tests so Keep.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone understands the other position and all the honest people that both (a) and (b) are true. <b>So this is all a waste of energy</b>. Under current rules (b) wins out, since there is no official provision for opting out. So, to build consensus the first step is to try and create a new policy to the extend that notable people can opt out of having an article.

Shortly afterwards, he made a post on Wikipedia review <a href="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=6979&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=23821" class="external text" title="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=6979&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=23821" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which I think should concern all editors interested in this debate. Here are some quotes, in bold, with my comments afterward in plaintext:</p>
<p><b>"Hardly anyone thought the article should be kept; the rest wanted the deletion overturned because it was 'out of process'."</b> - Completely untrue. By my count, there were 76 votes to keep deleted, 71 votes to overturn based purely on process, and 40 votes to overturn that explicitly say that the subject is notable enough for an article. See for <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Daniel_Brandt_6850.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Daniel Brandt">yourselves</a>.</p>
<p><b>"This time there is a mandate for a full debate (which won't be speedily closed) and I think the consensus is moving towards deleting the article."</b> - Highly doubtful. First, the votes were 111-76 to overturn deletion, and 40 of those endorsed keep based on notability. I am willing to bet that a significant percentage of the overturn votes that only expressed a process opinion would convert to AfD keeps. Second, the overturns only picked up steam as the DRV went along and were clearly dominating towards the end; if anything, consensus was moving away from deletion.</p>
<p><b>"That's a fair assessment."</b> - With this pithy four-word sentence thebainer is agreeing with a section of a post by Brandt, which he quotes in full. The Brandt quote that thebainer reproduces and responds to ends with this summary of Brandt's opinion of "keep" Wikipedia voters: "It's not like they have any of their own interests at stake, apart from their little joysticks driven by their little brains." Thanks for supporting your fellow editors, thebainer.</p>
<p><b>"I plan to close it. I seem to do fairly well at closing otherwise controversial debates and making the result stick. I deleted Gregory Lauder-Frost's article, for example, when the debate was split 50/50 on the numbers, and when there had been dozens of previous conversations that didn't get anywhere."</b> - Wow - so you're boasting about how you closed a previous AfD on a controversial article that was nowhere near consensus as delete, and in the same paragraph you express your intention of closing this AfD? I will leave readers to draw their own conclusions about thebainer's intentions with this AfD. Needless to say, I have drawn mine.</p>

<dd>Indeed. This close had better be cleaner than the Harvard Medical School brain-surgery operating room, or the community will continue to be fractured.

<dd>As somebody who was both hip-deep in the GLF foofaraw and opposed to its deletion, I think thebainer did a fantastic job closing it. I think it was the wrong decision for Wikipedia to make, but I think the closing was a thoughtful, clear, and appropriate sifting of the community opinion into a useful decision. I would feel better if he didn't close this one after closing the DRV, though, so there's no chance of misinterpretation by spectators. And I agree that whoever does it, the close has to be cleaner than clean. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 16:42, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As the guy that found thebainer's wikipedia review thing and reading all this mess again, again: sorry for causing a flare up... his DRV close was awesome and fair, and logical. I agree someone else should close this though, and don't have an opinion on people posting to both sites right now. I still throw in my $0.02 that the close of the afd should be done by a group of admins.

<li>I don't see why usual wikipedia closing policy should be altered at all here, on the contrary. In this case it is crucial that policy is followed precisely without any licence on the part of the closing admin(s). Since one way or the other there will be loads of votes on both sides anything other than a strict interpretation of policy will lead to more chaos a certain DRV and another AfD. This vote - me thinks - is a power play by people who want to delete it. Note the language above: "I will abide by the decision whatever it is" - implying perhaps that if their position here is not accepted and the article is kept through "no consensus" that will not be enough for them and they wont accept it, but continue this gayness on and on. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Spart_dfd6.html" title="User:David Spart">David Spart</a> 18:01, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'd mentioned this idea in a few places but got no replies that I noticed (or misplaced the place I posted it on my watchlist)... Simple closing idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>Once the time (since we aren't closing early) expires on the AfD, protect the page, put up a "being deliberated" notice, and a recommendation that any "late" news go to the talk page, here.</li>
<li>Five admins close this down together, and deliberate at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Daniel Brandt (13th nomination)/closing.</li>
<li>Those five together decide based on policy what to do, based on the consensus here. They can figure out the specifics amongst themselves of how to decide specific points before digging into the meat...</li>
<li>Recommend an arb-com style thing, 3 of 5 needed to pass a point (points derived from consensus points on AfD, like how Bainer did the DRV)</li>
<li>Having five admins together decide is the best way to do this so no-one can call foul later, and anyone trying to reverse them and cause more problems in any direction, be it keep or delete, would be disrupting.</li>
<li>Protect the deliberation page, and no one else is allowed to post there but the five admins. Just RV out anything else for simplicity sake.</li>
<li>Recommend their decisions be binding on community (punishable by blocks to discourage POINT warriors...) for 6 months to a year barring OFFICE stuff or ArbCom action. Yes, yes, I know no "binding decisions" but we are into IAR territory now anyway right? Might as well end how it began.</li>

<dd>I have to say that this idea is interesting, although I'm not sure it makes sense to put people on all of whom have been previously involved. It might make sense to include admins who have had no connection. Also the last point about blocking issues seems bad, if someone attempts to respond disruptively to anything, whether this article or something else, they will be blocked, generally how ever long (or short) is necessary. Having specific mentions of a time maximum is less then helpful. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 08:13, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am always worried about special rules, no matter what the cause because special rules lead to more special rules which in turn ... if you don't believe me just take a look at government laws. A law that would have passed a century ago on a single legal size piece of paper now fills dozens of binders.

<dd>my thinking wasn't special rules but rather a finality either way. The problem is that people are ignoring rules (IAR) that caused this whole mess, right? No one can argue that IAR did this, and brought it here. Having 5 admins close based on policy and consensus means that anyone who than IARs and undoes their close is just disrupting to continue fighting. It's to help close this mess.

<dd>There will only be closure in this case if the conflicting interests of some editors can be resolved. If you take a good look at this mess you will find that there are people around that would do anything to get their faces off Brandt's webpage and those that are not willing to give in to <s>blackmail</s> coercion and those that principally are opposed to any breach in the rules (oops, we don't have rules... we have guidelines) no matter at what cost and those uninvolved in the main problem that are at it out of principle. As long as these are not resolved we won't see the end of it, no matter how many new rules we make. And anybody who thinks that Brandt is just going to lay down and die because we deleted his article upon his request does not know the rationale of those who desperately are clinging on a tiny shred of notability <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 01:10, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thats the best reason to committee it--no one can call foul then, and we just slap a "revert this close for 6 months or a year and get banned" note or whatever to lock it in.

<dd>Maybe... but where are you going to find anybody uninvolved enough in any of the above groups? Because if you nominate anybody to the committee involved in this one way or the other the ones with conflicting interests will scream foul, no matter what decision one of the groups will scream foul and try to create rules that will overrule the six month time period and off we go again.

<dd>That is probably the best idea I've seen here. I don't know if Arbcom would want to get involved, but the idea of a committee close by admins who are not involved in this is an excellent idea here. I've already taken a bunch of shit (perhaps rightfully so) for having started this AfD before it was apparently intended to go forward; no reason for a single closer to get beat up on as well.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:13, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unless there is a <i>dramatic</i> shift in voting paterns this will not be required since the admin would not be able to claim much discretion in a case where there are a) hundreds of opinions and b) aprox 3 to 1 split to keep.

<dd>I think the last was not an opinion as such, but rather a reply to a previously phrased opinion. Also, in all honesty, arguments expressed for deleting include "Subject is not notable." --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 19:24, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But according to the bar set by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, Brandt is notable. The delete voters who advocate that he is not notable are using a criteria beyond WP:BIO. Now if WP:BIO is changed to this more stringent criteria, then maybe the delete voters would have something. But the majority of delete arguments are (c) &amp; (d). <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Agne27_bd48.html" title="Special:Contributions/Agne27"><sup>Cheese</sup></a>/<a href="../../../a/g/n/User_talk%7EAgne27_a02f.html" title="User talk:Agne27"><sup>Wine</sup></a> 19:30, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In regards to (h), "notability" itself has no basis in policy. The concept of what is notable per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is a guideline. As I said somewhere before on the main page, just because a subject meets <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> does not mean we <i>have</i> to have an article on the subject, just like we don't automatically have to delete a subject who falls short of the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> criteria.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:08, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I would add to the arguments against deleting that removing contentious articles would a) increase systemic bias, and b) give an incentive for people seeking deletion to create contention around an article. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 01:53, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The second argument has been brought up by multiple users in the discussion but not many. I don't think the first one has been brought up at all (of course, you are welcome to do so on the AfD page).

<p>Say, for those who count noses on things like this, I found the Firefox extension "XPath Checker" helpful. You can use XPaths like these</p>
<ul>
<li>id('bodyContent')/ul/li/b/text()[contains(.,'eep')]</li>
<li>id('bodyContent')/ul/li/b/text()[contains(.,'erge')]</li>
<li>id('bodyContent')/ul/li/b/text()[contains(.,'elete')]</li>
</ul>
<p>to pull out and count the summaries. It's not perfect, as people use bold for other things, so it shouldn't be used when closing, but it is a quick way to get a sense of the numbers. Oh, and you can't see all the items return, just make the window bigger until the scroll bar appears. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 17:41, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Suppose this were closed with the above assessment and vote proportions. Under those conditions, does anyone think it would be proper to close with anything but "keep"? If not then we all agree that if the proportions hold then it must be keep and we have a consensus for what to do. If anyone wishes to argue that the proper thing under those conditions is something else such as stub or move content to other pages, speak now and not as part of a race to close with your unique personal insight into what is right (in other words, get consensus now for a different interpretation and not later).

<p>It really proves that old publicity maxim: Within a month of the controversy, Wikipedia had <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?site0=www.wikipedia.org&amp;site1=&amp;site2=&amp;site3=&amp;site4=&amp;y=p&amp;z=1&amp;h=300&amp;w=500&amp;range=3y&amp;size=Medium&amp;url=http://www.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?site0=www.wikipedia.org&amp;site1=&amp;site2=&amp;site3=&amp;site4=&amp;y=p&amp;z=1&amp;h=300&amp;w=500&amp;range=3y&amp;size=Medium&amp;url=http://www.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">doubled its page views</a>. This wasn't a flash in the pan - as the graph shows it simply started at exponential trend that continues 'till today. The alexa graph is also an underestimation as it shows growth as a percentage of all internet traffic - which is growing itself (by all accounts) by some 3% a month. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Spart_dfd6.html" title="User:David Spart">David Spart</a> 20:34, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also note - and I think this is the important stat - that public awareness of wikipedia seems to have surged. Wikipedia stas <a href="http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/ChartsWikipediaEN.htm" class="external text" title="http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/ChartsWikipediaEN.htm" rel="nofollow">(see here)</a> shows that the number of new wikipedians per month doubled (and has since maintained that level) in response to Sigenwhateverhisnameis and Brandt's actions early in December 2006. Looking at the charts together one gets the impression that if it were not for Brandt wikipedia would only be about 70% of its current size and quality. Thus Brandt is possibly the greatest contributor to our project after Jimbo (and that other guy who claims he invented it.) He should be unblocked immediately and given every barnstar that we have.</p>
<p>Someone should do a study into this. Brandt was a pivotal moment in wikipedia history. Suddenly 100 of millions of people were aware that there was a website that they could write in - and vandalise! That was the basis of the story. So many tried and many stayed.</p>

<p>How so? The Seigenthaler controversy was already big before Brandt came in. Brandt, IMO, just threw more gas on the fire by unmasking the person who did the vandalizing, which just cuased more grief - him getting fired, him writing a letter, Seigenthaler forgiving him and asking that the guy be unfired...now Essjay, Brandt can take full credit for that.

<li><b>Comment:</b> My opinion doesn't count because I've been banned for almost a year, but I nevertheless have an opinion. There are issues which no one has addressed in this farce of an AfD. First, about one-third of my biography is self-referential for Wikipedia. It's the equivalent of the World Book Encyclopedia having an entry on someone associated with Encyclopedia Britannica simply because that someone criticized World Book. No, it's worse than that. It's as if World Book started a negative article on someone who worked at Britannica, and then when that someone criticized the World Book for doing so, the article in World Book got longer and longer, mainly by referring to these criticisms. Either the self-referential material should be deleted, or Wikipedia should stop calling itself an encyclopedia. Second, there is no information on my education, or my three years in graduate school, primarily because such information in not easily found unless the subject of the article consents to the article. Third, there is no information on my employment history for the same reason. Fourth, the information about President Carter's draft amnesty was deleted, but the draft-card burning information was kept, an act that is prejudicial. Fifth, the year of birth was deleted, primarily because no one could figure out whether it was 1947 or 1948. Sixth, no one at Wikipedia has found a photo of me anywhere on the web. Seventh, the Google Watch stuff is about as notable as someone starting a blog on some topic. The only reason it has more than its fair share of citations on the web is because it was the first anti-Google website, and when it started no one could believe that anyone could be anti-Google. Eighth, the NameBase material is biased. It's not a "quirky" index. Ask Oliver North how quirky it is. NameBase led a reporter to the person who put up Oliver North's security gate, which resulted in North's only conviction (for accepting an illegal gratuity). This was covered in the Washington Post. Picking out a quotation that uses the word "quirky" to describe NameBase suggests bias. (The same source also says it was started in the 1960s, which would have been difficult since I would have needed a mainframe and IBM punch cards to start it that early.) Ninth, the cookie stuff at CIA and NSA is trivial. One fax to each agency and the problem was solved. It played in the press because no one understands cookies, which in turn gave the press an opportunity to hype it. The bottom line is that Wikipedia should not pretend that it is competent to write biographies of living persons without the subject's consent and cooperation. Without that cooperation, the article at best ends up as a loose collection of facts, most of which would be irrelevant in a balanced biography. At worst, it ends up as malicious libel that uses verifiability and notability as convenient cover. The motives of those who voted KEEP are clearly suspicious, based on their own justifications. This AfD was front-loaded with a prejudicial list of citations, which is improper. Posters for candidates are supposed to stay a certain distance away from the voting booths -- why doesn't this apply to Wikipedia? Most of those voting KEEP have no familiarity with me or the article, which makes them drive-by voters who only seek to amuse themselves. This is also improper. This entire AfD is a disgrace for all of Wikipedia. -Daniel Brandt 68.91.89.24 20:35, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You were blocked indefinitely for making legal threats. Please withdraw those legal threats and get yourself unblocked. I dont think your inability to have a voice here would justify deleting your article but it is not right that you dont have a voice. Its in your hands, I honestly believe, and you need to act like a responsible wikipedian and get yourself a voice here. I linked to your earlier comment on the afd but find your attitude very frustrating, almost as if you prefer to be blocked.

<p>which is that the debate is a disgrace. WP is best served by object treatment of contentious matters, and that means following the usual procedures. thee is no reason to have tried repeatedly to remove this article. He was notable long before WP was started, and once N, always N. That his requests to remove the article should be taken seriously is an indication of continuing lack of understand of the benefits of NPOV when it concerns our own affairs. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 16:28, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Brandt is as responsible if not more than any other individual for the poor quality of the Afd. That much at least is obvious, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 04:58, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
