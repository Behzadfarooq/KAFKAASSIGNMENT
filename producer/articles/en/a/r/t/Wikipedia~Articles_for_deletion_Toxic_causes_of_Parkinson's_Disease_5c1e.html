<li>Information on Wikipedia must be verifiable. With scientific articles this would require scientific references.</li>
<li>Wikipedia is also limited by the potential article size. It therefore can not include all relevant information, but can refer to other web sites where more information is available.</li>
<li>Wikipedia is limited by copyright as to how much information it can make use of from other sources.</li>
<li>The most comprehensive source of information on the toxic causes of Parkinson's Disease is on the links provided.

<li>The web site is not mine. So I am not Spamdexing, and until I read your link did not even know what it was.</li>
<li>The suggestion that the information lacks verifiability is obviously a false one. The information via the links it refers to provides full references of published scientific literature. Therefore the suggestion that it fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and possibly <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> is plainly wrong.</li>
<li>Toxicity is a rapidly ongoing area with entirely distinct subjects within that area - one for each toxic substance. The information and web sites for each subject will alter independently for each subject. For example, when new research becomes available concerning manganese toxicity, a different web site and references will be inevitably linked only to manganese. The links used at the outset are only what is used at the outset and will inevitably change.</li>
<li>What is the alternative&#160;? - no link to further information and references, or only one link for each toxin which soon becomes out of date, as a better link will become available for some of the toxins&#160;?</li>
<li>Is the purpose of Wikipedia providing information for those that want it, or preventing the availability of information solely due to the possibility of the alteration of search engine rankings for a site that does not even sell anything&#160;? --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnson_MD_4c03.html" title="User:Johnson MD">Johnson MD</a> 14:05, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Parkinson's Disease site has been repeatedly vandalised. The toxic section has also had large parts of it randomly deleted. It has also been proposed in discussionson the Parkinson's Disease site that, as the page is well over the required size that subjects (such as symptoms and toxicity) be taken out on to other pages, so that only a brief summary can remain on the Parkinson's Disease page. This is one of the reasons for doing it here.</li>
<li>The Parkinson's Disease Forum (the original source of the information on the toxic causes of Parkinson's Disease) is listed on the web sites. However, it is very unlikely that this in itself is going to lead to people getting information about the toxic causes of Parkinson's Disease. It is also three links away from the actaul page for toxicity. Somebody would have to go to in order&#160;: Parkinson's Disease (Wikipedia) &gt; see the tiny link &gt; The Parkinson's Disease Forum &gt; Parkinson's Disease &gt; Toxic causes.</li>
<li>Therefore, is the purpose of Wikipedia to make information more readily available, or to make information as difficult to get to, because the arguments against inclusion solely indicate the latter. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnson_MD_4c03.html" title="User:Johnson MD">Johnson MD</a> 15:12, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Very well said! Bridgeman's website has very little besides his own contributions, as Andrew notes. What he has done is something like a literature review of his topic. However, he's gone very broad-brush in his review, attempting, for example, to say something about any toxin that produces a symptom bearing some resemblance to PD. For each toxin he cites only one article. In a literature review for a peer-reviewed journal this would not be acceptable, since it's too easy to pick and choose among the literature for work that supports a particular viewpoint. Bridgeman has a particular and not widely shared view of PD pathology, and he has selected his articles to support that viewpoint. Since his invention, dopavite, is based upon that viewpoint, that's expected. His website looks impressive to a layman, but it's shallow and very wide. He's really not critically reviewed any of the articles, either, as one would expect in a solid literature review, but has mostly clipped and pasted. His expertise is very open to question in my mind, especially given his hyperbolic claims. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfsnow_eafc.html" title="User:Profsnow">Dan</a> 15:30, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not even particuarly thorough. Rotenone was thought to be causative on the basis of an animal study involving megadoses which induced parkinson-like symptoms and also lewy body pathology. However the family on whom the human model was based were subsequently shown not to have been poisoned with an organophsophate but what was in fact liquid halperidol. I know he likes to make out that we're all idiots but it's more of a case of not wanting to waste my time talking with a troll.--<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 15:56, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If this article's saga gets any weirder or the supporters of this article misbehave, my vote would swing to a "strong delete". Collectively, we editors owe Wikipedia readers reliability even if we may sometimes miss the mark on style, comprehensiveness, etc. That means we can't accept any material we don't think has been proffered in good faith. That's especially true of highly technical medical material.</dd>
<dd>From painful, close observation of someone dying of Parkinson's, I can say this is a horrible disease.

<dd><i><b>Upgraded to "Strong Delete"</b></i> -- "Strong" because of the additional bad faith edits made by the article's supporter(s) since I voted 13 hours ago. If we can't trust the article's editor(s) and supporter(s), then the article is unreliable. Additionally, the article's backer(s) have insisted on keeping their vanity link in place, claiming it's vital to the article as a source, yet it's not a peer-reviewed source. Taken together, these two behaviors are just so revealing.

<dd>What exactly have I as a supporter of the article, due simply to the overcrowding on the main page, done to deserve to have "the book thrown at me". Assume good faith in established editors at least. And btw, I left the link in one place as a compromise, not endorsing it, considering the debate surrounding it. External links do not come under the Verifiability policy, thats just for References, however, if the site is a valuable external summary of the topic it could be relevant. Fully protecting the page has simply made me unable to improve it, leaving this debate from now on as a sham as I cannot improve on my initial referencing efforts. Could someone change the full protection to semi-protection so I can actually put the references on? And if this article is deleted the admin should ensure that the references are kept on the main page, for all the bloat that this will make on the page I think it is worth it given the reputations of the journals being used. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 03:14, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am a little confused about your comment still. You seemed to <i>imply</i> in your vote that supporters of the article, regardless of their efforts should be dealt with by administrators. I know that there were a string of edits made by the sockpuppets in question, however, I am behind the scenes trying to improve the article due to my firm belief that the content would bloat the main article, and forking is legitimate because of this. I am hampered in this by the recent full protection put on the article, something which I do not approve of but cannot find a quote to back up my belief that AfD articles should be free to be improved by participators in the debate.

<dd>I'm not sure how to address your concerns. Your efforts to improve the article are commendable and I will take your word for it that there needs to be a separate article. I am reluctant to change my "delete" recommendation, however, if that could lead the forces of sockpuppetry somehow tainting the reliability of an article (medical articles in particular). I just don't know enough about protection, etc. to know how to reconcile your intentions with my concerns; maybe someone more knowledgeable does.<br /></dd>

<dd>"Rotenone is an insecticide that is known to cause Parkinson's Disease. Insecticides are also known to affect well water. Rotenone is commonly used in powdered form to treat parasitic mites on chickens and other fowl, and so can be found in poultry. Rotenone is produced by extraction from the roots, seeds, and leaves of certain tropical legumes. Rotenone inhibits tyrosine hydroxylation, which is essential for the formation of dopamine. So Rotenone causes Parkinson's Disease by lowering dopamine levels.[12]"</dd>

<dd>I wrote that after coming from a case presentation about the suspected human cases of Rotenone which were widely reported. The presentation was from one of the Neurologists who examined the family and was tasked with looking for gene markers for them. The bottom line is that there have been no human cases of PD caused by Rotenone. So a statment like "Rotenone causes Parkinson's Disease" is misleading.</dd>

<dd>As for references, I think if you can't read the original references then you have to take it on faith that what was said in the article is what is reported. Based on the behaviour of General Tojo so far I have a big problem with putting any faith in him. Whilst there are peer-reviewed papers knocking about on these toxins the evidence is nowhere near strong enough to be making the kind of statements listed here. I will endeavour to get some of my lab-based colleagues to have a go at this article, but the disruption GT has caused so far is exactly the kind of thing that puts busy academics off putting Wikipedia in the first place. A compromise solution would be to keep the page here, keep the toxins off of the main PD page, but to protect the page, and go and round up some biochemists to start it off from scratch.
