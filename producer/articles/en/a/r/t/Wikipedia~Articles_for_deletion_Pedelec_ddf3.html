Let's go through that article on content forking. Here is my analisys:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is <b>not</b> another article on the same subject. This is another subject. (ie.: You have a <a href="../../../r/o/l/Roller_blades.html" title="Roller blades">roller blades</a> and you have <a href="../../../i/n/l/Inline_skates.html" title="Inline skates">inline skates</a>. Both are similar but one talks more about the company than the inline skates.)</li>

<li>Stop right there. Pedelec is a class of electric bicycle is a class of motorised bicycle. It says so right there in <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> and has done for ages - there is even a picture of one. Your legal case in Ontario notwithstanding, nobody else seems to have this problem with somehow thinking a "pedelec" electric bike is in any way a separate class of machine from all other electric bikes. Since that demolishes your point 1, the rest of the house of cards goes with it. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 18:49, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Pedelec is a title that is not a synonym of an existing article title <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a>. A motorized bicycle in canada is a totally different class of vehicle (ie.:limited speed motorcycle vs a pedelec often considered a <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power-assisted_bicycle.html" title="Power-assisted bicycle">power-assisted bicycle</a>. Also, in certain jurisdictions, such as Oregon, a motorized bicycle is like a <a href="../../../m/o/p/Moped.html" title="Moped">moped</a>. We have had a discusion in regards to <a href="../../../m/o/p/Moped.html" title="Moped">moped</a> vs <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> and the concensus was not to merger these articles. Again, for other jurisdiction such as Canada that consideres a <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> a A pedelec is considered a type of electric motor assisted bicycle. Once the detailed specs on pedelecs are cleared up it will be far much easier to understand that this is non synonymous of the existing article.</li>
<li>The content in the pedelec article is being developed not according to personal view but according to consensus elaborated in the German article, and probably the content from the french article.. There is much content that exist on the subject. Not only that, but there was never any issues brought up in the talk page in regards to lack of consensus.</li>
<li>There are no personal theories that are at issue for inclusion. Au contraire there may be some interesting research on Food consumption vs. electric consumption and that is a published document. etc...)</li>
<li>It is bad faith to assume because of my knowlege about the article "motorized bicycle" it may be a content fork. I believe one should give the benefit of the doubt to the creator. This is not a duplicate article. This is a different class of vehicle.</li>
<li>According to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html#Article_spinouts_-_.22Summary_style.22_articles" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking#Article spinouts - "Summary style" articles</a>,: <small>(for the ease of reader I include it hear)</small>:
<ul>
<li>Even if the subject of the new article is one about which people are bound to hold strong POVs, this does not automatically make the new article a POV fork. Even if the new article was created because it's a particularly controversial aspect of the article subject, that does not mean that the new article is a POV fork; if one aspect of the article subject is more controversial than the others, it is perfectly legitimate to isolate that aspect as much as possible to its own article, in order to keep editing of the main article fairly harmonious.</li>
<li>(Seeing as there is difficulty in editing and adding anything to the article of motorized bicycle... such as the current debate we are having in regards to the inclusion of a picture of a motorcycle/motor assisted bicycle/motorized bicycle from Triumph. It is 10 folds harder, even though it may fall in as a sub-category of motorized bicycle, to place a little information on a class of vehicle that is not trully related.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Furthermore, According to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html#Article_spinouts_-_.22Summary_style.22_articles" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking#Article spinouts - "Summary style" articles</a>;
<ul>
<li>Summary style articles, with sub-articles giving greater detail, are not content forking, while the main article, written in summary style, will give a balanced summary of each of the subtopics. The sub-articles can each treat a particular aspect - which might reflect a point of view for each of the sub-articles - but these sub-articles should anyhow be linked to the other subarticles and to the main article, for instance by a navigational template.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Though it is possible for editors to act in bad faith and make article spinouts as POV forks, this is clearly not the case and nor has it been proven in this instance. Or previous instances. (assides from maybe the in september when I first joined and was new a though I could include a bunch of laws... and that was not a content fork but more or less a fueding debate about what should be included). As soon as user found out about the article he nominated it for deletion. This justs seem to re-enforce my belief that user nominating this article has absolutely no faith in my editing.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Conclusion:</b> There is nothing left for you to argue according to those guidelines. Nomination of this page for the above reason <a href="../../../f/o/r/WP%7EFORK_4e79.html" title="WP:FORK">WP:FORK</a> is not justified. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CylePat</a> 03:03, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>CyclePat, please go back and read the part of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking</a> which clearly states that those are not affirmative defenses -- if you're the only one who thought that there should be a separate article on electric bikes, creating one and calling it a "spinout" (weren't you just claiming that it was a translation of the German "Pedelec" article? It can't be both!) doesn't make it not-a-content-fork. Neither can you justify it by claiming that the consensus reached at the <i>German</i> Wikipedia means you can ignore consensus at the English Wikipedia, not when your article's in the English Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 03:44, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>You address the subject very vaguelly. I understand that some of those issues such as "is not a synonym of an existing article title" is not an affirmative defense. But you are reversing the roles here. You are attempting to make me prove my innoncence, when you haven't even proven that there is guilt. There is no doubt that this is a translation. And yes it can be both! This is because it is a "sub-class" of <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a>... or in the case of this alleged POV FORKING, a "spin-out." (I call it an article with more details.) These vehicle may be, in some instances similar, but they definatelly warants their own pages. The first part of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking</a> stipulates:</p>
<ul>
<li>POV forking, occurs when two or more contributors disagree about the content of an article or other page, and instead of resolving that disagreement, someone creates another version of the article (or another article on the same subject) to be developed according to their personal views rather than according to consensus. This second article is known as a "POV fork" of the first. Wikipedia does not view article forking as an acceptable solution to disagreements between contributors, and such forks may be nominated for deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't experienced any disagreement <b>about the content</b> of "pedelec". What content don't you agree with? You see none of this was discussed, even with past issues that might have occured with the totally different class of vehicle called the "electric bicycle." This makes it difficult to assume good faith when you don't prove your case. I'm sorry but if the German Wikipedian have decided to "spin-out"(I call it have more details in another article), I see no reason why this precedence could not be used?... But that doesn't really matter because it's not a spin-out or a POV FORK. The key idea here is "summary". When "motorized bicycle" was created consensus was that this was a summary file. Editor firgured it would be better to have all articles under one roof. It was created to <b>summarize</b> power assisted cycles and power assisted bicycles and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_bicycles.html" title="Electric bicycles">electric bicycles</a>, etc... Again, as per <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking</a> <b>Summary style articles, with sub-articles giving greater detail, are not content forking.</b> Again: there is no disagreement on content and motorized bicycle article is a summary style article. We need to go into more details. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CylePat</a> 04:51, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I think that there is a good argument that the Pedelec article should exist. Amongst other things, the "Electric bicycles" section in "motorised bicycles article is hopelessly inadequate regarding technical explanations of the operation of these vehicles (as is that entire article). The pedelec article is clearly not a content fork, duplicate or stub, and I think that the grounds stated by the nominator for deletion are not sufficient. <i>However</i> The pedelec article is no better than a babelfish of the German article, not including the (excellent) formatting of that page. Cyclepat is clearly not competent to do the translation (or there wouldn't be an AFD). Therefore, the article in question is no better than the babelfish link to the German article [<a href="http://216.239.37.104/translate_c?hl=de&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;langpair=de%7Cen&amp;u=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedelec&amp;prev=/language_tools" class="external autonumber" title="http://216.239.37.104/translate_c?hl=de&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;langpair=de%7Cen&amp;u=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedelec&amp;prev=/language_tools" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>], and I might add that the link preserves the formatting. Wikipedia, is not a personal sandbox, and unusable rough versions belong on user pages. I therefore support a delete until (or unless) a good quality translation results. I would note to Cyclepat, that wikipedia has all sorts of articles with dubious content but excellent quality, but having low quality (even with excellent content) is a guaranteed way to end up on AFD. <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKAF_4851.html" title="User:AKAF">AKAF</a> 13:29, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b>: Now, Cyclepat, don't take this badly, because I can see that you mean well, but [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Precedents" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Precedents" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] has an option for Gibberish, and I think you'll agree that the article is not readable english by any stretch of the imagination. Also, if you delete all of the gibberish (all of it) and replace it by the link I provided, then the article is a substub [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wp:substub" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wp:substub" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>], which is grounds for deletion. Additionally, due to your association, the article probably would qualify as a vanity page [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vanity_page" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vanity_page" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>]. Now, if the article was well written, you'd have a good ground for dispute, but as it is, there are plenty of grounds to delete, and none to keep. So, I have a couple of suggestions for you. (1) Move the article to your user space and accept the deletion. (2) Ignore this, and other comments, and focus your attention on improving the article. If you spent the energy on improvement that you've spent on this article, there wouldn't be an AFD (3) Spell and grammar check the article and add cross-references (but no references to any companies or organisations with which you are personally involved). (4) Wait 7 days and then re-read (5) Re-create the article and leave a note on the user pages of everyone who participated in the AFD.&#160;; Good luck with the article. <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKAF_4851.html" title="User:AKAF">AKAF</a> 14:48, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I really don't understand how this can be a POV fork when it is a work in progress from a translation... This is typical bad faith on behalf of the nominator because he knows I have built 2 electric bicycles and he assumes I have an agenda. Since when do we punish people for their knowledge and previous wikipedia edits (That of which I was fairly new to experiencing, lacking arguing skills, and having poor wikipedia etiquette.) Next thing you know you'll be saying <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granny_Smith_cbc9.html" title="Granny Smith">Granny Smith</a> smith and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gala_%28apple%29.html" title="Gala (apple)">Gala (apple)</a> are POV Forks from <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple.html" title="Apple">apple</a> article because the primary creator really likes these types of apples. If the issue of delete is not about formatting, {attention}, etc... and solely about a POV fork, I think, this issue should be closed. Again, according to "content forking": "Summary style articles, with sub-articles giving greater detail, are not content forking, while the main article, written in summary style, will give a balanced summary of each of the subtopics." There is obviously a mistake in the nomination of this article for deletion. This, I believe is an error in procedure and may lead to an appeal. As for the gibberish... well... I couldn't possibly comment on that, except for the fact that I am working, slowly but surely at translating this page so inherently there be no POV. (It's a win-win or lose-lose situation.) (I'll be gone for the weekend so if anyone wants to start translating!)

<dd>This above quote demonstrate that "pedelec" article is a subcategory of motorized bicycle. It easy to see that motorized bicycle will never really be able to go into as much details as that of the pedelec article. Hence, motorized bicycle is a summary article to pedelec. Hence, pedelec is a sub-article giving greater detail.

<dd>I have expanded the electric section of <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> slightly to include some additional detail alluded to in the German article and other sources. I have also created two new stubs for <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crank_sensor.html" title="Crank sensor">crank sensor</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torque_sensor.html" title="Torque sensor">torque sensor</a> since we didn't have those. I don't think there's much more in <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedelec.html" title="Pedelec">pedelec</a> which does not already exist in <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> now. There is, however, still no article on storage density or half a dozen other related topics, none of which are addressed by the <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedelec.html" title="Pedelec">pedelec</a> content.

<dd>One minor update to respond to a specific point: you say you don't think there's room for this content in the existing article, but <i>you did not even try</i>, let alone talk about it on the talk page. Whereas you <i>have</i> previously tried to turn the redirect at <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_bicycle.html" title="Electric bicycle">electric bicycle</a> into a separate article, against conensus. I <i>do</i> think there is room for the additional content, not least because <i>most of it is already there</i> and I have recently added some of what little was not. It is useless to appeal to the clauses on splitting out controversial content, because the inclusion of electric bikes in <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> is not controversial. It represents a consensus position with, as far as I can make out, only one dissenter, who is acknowledged to have a vested interest. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_AfD_78f4.html" title="User:JzG/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 16:05, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obejection... bagering the defence. euh! Yes...&#160;:) I think if you calmed down and explained yourself you would make a litle more sense. YOu might then be able to see that my second comment, way up top, shoot down every hypothesis that this is a fork. I suggest you present your counter arguments instead of claiming bad faith. (You really haven't proven anything we don't know.) You see, to argue something I have to take a side... it is your responsibility to try and point out these things. I am clearly aware that "it is possible for editors to act in bad faith and make article spinouts as POV forks," however I still haven't seen any proof. As I indicated this is a translation page. No agenda's. And I don't think I am close at all to meeting the situation <s>that is portrayed in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html#Article_spinouts_-_.22Summary_style.22_articles" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking#Article spinouts - "Summary style" articles</a></s> for content forking.</dd>

<p>A precedence exists at [[Wikipedia:Arbitration policy/Precedents#Content of articles ]] that is related to this article. <i>"Statement(s) of principle:</i> An encyclopedia article is a summary of accepted knowledge regarding its subject, not a complete exposition of all possible details." <i>Using this precedence, we may argue that motorized bicycle, should remain a summary article.

I would say yes, but that's only because we have mis interpretated Wikipedia's neutral point-of-view (NPOV) policy which "contemplates inclusion of all significant points of view regarding any subject on which there is division of opinion." We are meeting the wiki policy of NPOV in the article of motorized bicycle and I think we need some supporting sources regarding the subject of the article.
