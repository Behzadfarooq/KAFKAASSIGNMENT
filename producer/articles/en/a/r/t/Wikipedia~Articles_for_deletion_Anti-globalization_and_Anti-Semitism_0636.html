<hr />
<p>The result of the debate was <b>No consensus</b>. Thus, the article is kept. It is now clear that this VfD will not reach consensus. Deletion is supported by slightly over half of the voters. Many voters expressed concern about POV problems and this should be discussed in the article's <a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnti-globalization_and_Anti-Semitism_39b0.html" title="Talk:Anti-globalization and Anti-Semitism">talk page</a>. The possible renaming of the article should also be discussed there. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 02:56, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article consists of content that was at <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization.html" title="Anti-globalization">Anti-globalization</a>, where the general opinion was that it was a load of rubbish added just to try to slander the anti-globalization movement. It was disproportionately long compared to the rest of the criticisms in the article. People such as myself wanted to shorten it to a summary. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">User:Sam Spade</a> had the bright idea of saving this by creating a spin-off page. Our policy discourages the creation of spin-offs consisting of the controversial bits of other articles. This content was not good enough to be a section in another article, and its not good enough to be a full article. The accusations are only notable enough to justify a quick summary in the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization.html" title="Anti-globalization">anti-globalization</a> article. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChamaeleon_1199.html" title="User:Chamaeleon"><i>Chamaeleon</i></a> 12:05, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I could briefly respond to that note: This isn't about notability, it's about it being a pov fork in that the phenomenon is too marginal to be written on outside the main article (and when it does, pov is the result). It should be made clear this is what many on the delete camp are arguing, better referencing and npov language notwithstanding. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 02:45, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>El C, I'll answer you in full below. Suffice to say here that this is not, in fact, a marginal topic. It may have started life as a POV fork but it's now shaping up to be a legitimate article. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:14, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. I was about to post a VfD myself, but it looks like <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChamaeleon_1199.html" title="User:Chamaeleon">User:Chamaeleon</a> beat me to it. Good to know I'm not alone. This was originally a section of the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization.html" title="Anti-globalization">Anti-globalization</a> article created by <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">User:TDC</a>. It was overwhelmingly rejected on the Talk page for that article on NPOV grounds, and reverted multiple times. Since TDC continued to revert it back, he was eventually given a 24-hour block for violation of the 3RR. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-globalization&amp;diff=10340138&amp;oldid=10337479" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-globalization&amp;diff=10340138&amp;oldid=10337479" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> shows, TDC was clearly writing with the intent of furthering a specific POV. After several more reverts by various users, <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">User:Sam Spade</a> unilaterally spun this section off into a separate article. This article should be deleted: it consists entirely of content that was rejected for NPOV reasons, the article title is inherently NPOV, and the topic is not broad enough to warrant an article. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 12:09, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> delete this article, it dresses itself up as informative but is totally biased. It does not define anti-globalization, or anti "neo-liberal" policies, which are about opposing richer countries using indebtedness and trade law (and war) to control smaller economies and enrich a very tiny fraction of the world's population at the expense of the rest. To the extent that this is being imposed on the middle east, yes, people in those countries will oppose it, but this article has nothing to do with explaining those policies themselves.

</ul>
<p>I think a good place to start my argument it to examine what the prereqresites for a Wikipedia article are.</p>
<p>One generally recognized qualification is the topic in question notable? In the case of Anti-Semitism in the Ant-globalization movement a Google search turns up 12,300 on the subject <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=anti-semitism+anti-globalization&amp;spell=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=anti-semitism+anti-globalization&amp;spell=1" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. This is certainly much more notable, at least by this commonly used standard, than many articles in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Secondly, is the material well sourced. Even a cursory look at the material in question will show that all opinions are very clearly stated as such and all opinions are sourced back to the individuals who made them. These individuals are, I might add, not obscure kooks, but are relatively prominent individuals.</p>
<p>There have been articles about this written in the Financial Times, Washington Times, National Review, The New Republic,</p>
<p>Now with this in mind, ask yourself this question&#160;?even though I may not agree that the anti-globalization movement is rife with Jew haters, is there a significant number of people in the world that do believe this??, if you answered yes, and I think that by the Google citation alone we can see that there is a significant number of people who believe this to be the case, then there really is not other option then to vote to keep.</p>
<p>How fucking ridiculous is this, anyways? Some Wikipedians do not like a certain segment in an article so they work to have its content banned from Wikipedia all together?</p>
<ul>
<li><i>For example, a couple of right-wingers can only revert an article a total of four times before violating the three-revert rule. Ten progressives each committing to voting just once can easily overcome this and more. By working together, we can stamp out certain POVs.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Chamaeleon/Sandpit5" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Chamaeleon/Sandpit5" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Let me be a bit more specific who I am talking about here, Chamaeleon. Here we have a contributor who sees it as his mission to band together with likeminded folk and marginalize&#160;?certain POV?s?. Not all POV?s, not dishonest POV?s, but POV?s that he sees as representing&#160;?bad stuff?.</p>
<p>First the information is stripped from its original article, and shoveled into a new one which then can be speedily deleted.</p>
<p>They have a term for tactics like this, its called airbrushing, and has no place here.</p>
<p>Vote to keep! <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">TDC</a> 13:36, Apr 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This does seem to be a legitimate topic judging by Google searches. I've tidied it up a bit, have added a couple of extra sources, have found links for the quotes already there, and have added a references section. The article needs to be expanded, and examples should be given of actions or statements by anti-globalization protestors that are regarded by others as anti-Semitic. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:12, Apr 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How do you distinguish "main criticisms against anti-globalization" from other criticisms? How do you decide which ones are more "notable" than others, and which are mere "smear campaigns"? The article itself seems remarkably "resistant" to any sort of criticism; a perusal indicates that fully half of the small "Criticisms" section is itself devoted to "counter-Criticisms" defending the movement. Furthermore, a review of the edit history indicates that the excision of this material was done after it had existed there for over a month, and after an apparent consensus to leave it in by the very editor who decided weeks later to excise it. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:10, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Copied from above: If I could briefly respond to that note: This isn't about notability, it's about it being a pov fork in that the phenomenon is too marginal to be written on outside the main article (and when it does, pov is the result).

<li>It's clear from <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-globalization.html" title="Anti-globalization">Anti-globalization</a> that there was an attempt by several editors to delete all mention of anti-Semitism from the article, or drastically reduce it, which is worrying. Therefore, that section was moved to its own space and has been extended and referenced, and if it stays, will be extended further, so it is no longer appropriate to move it back. This is a legitimate topic, much discussed in Europe by academics and journalists, and is part of the drift of the far Left to the right, focused in particular on the anti-globalization and anti-war movements. I've yet to see an argument, as opposed to an assertion, from anyone that this topic or the title is either non-notable or is <i>inherently</i> POV, which is what would have to be shown for it to be legitimately deleted. Here is a paper <a href="http://www.axt.org.uk/HateMusic/Cohen_essay_October_04.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.axt.org.uk/HateMusic/Cohen_essay_October_04.pdf" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> (pdf) on "The British Left and the Jews" by Ben Cohen, a journalist and broadcaster who has served with the United Nations Protection Force. He argues that "the delegitimisation offensive against Israel presently pursued by sections of the anti-globalisation movement, the far Left and certain periodicals of the moderate Left&#160;? many of whose themes are shared by Islamists and parts of the far right&#160;? can reasonably be said to have begun in the aftermath of the 1967 war. It was then that the difference between the anti-Zionism of the <i>ancien</i> Left and that espoused by its new incarnation was established. As Robert Wistrich has argued, in becoming a&#160;?code word for the forces of reaction in general,? Zionism assumed a global importance for the contemporary Left that not even Marx and Lenin could have foreseen. Consequently,&#160;?[t]he extreme Left in western societies not only denigrates Israel and Zionism in a systematic manner, but its irrational hostility frequently spills over into contempt or antipathy towards Jews and Judaism as such." Perhaps if we want to continue this, we should go to the talk page so as not to take up more space.

If the "X-hate" in a group G dominates other aspects of that group, and is reported by various sources, discuss the phenomenon at length in an article on group G.

<li><b>Delete</b> There is no connection. Of course that type of writing is never intended to be taken seriously by the thinking segment of the population.

<p>I propose that the current title, and any other proposed titles, redirect to which ever title we all can agree to. I am pretty open minded about titles, and having written the one in use now, I don't claim it to be beyond question. I also think that separate articles could well be written using different proposed titles. Lets list proposed titles below:</p>

<p>I think the title should be the one most likely to be linked to by encyclopedia readers using the search bar.

<dd>As I've said above, regarding article titles, the sources describe it as "Anti-Semitism", not "Anti-Zionism"; you can't just decide they meant something else. As for the name, "Allegations of" or "Alleged" are, as far as I can tell, not used in article titles; rather, the topic is cited neutrally, and the pros and cons are hashed out in the article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:08, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Disagree - sources may discuss "anti-semitism" instead of "anti-zionism", but all of the discussion relates to opposition to Israel/support of Israel. "Jewish" is not necessarily synonymous w/"Pro-Israel", and just b/c the sources are misusing the terms doesn't mean we must as well. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">gab</font></sup></a> 21:10, 2005 Apr 7 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The entire article consists of allegations, even the primary article header states this.
