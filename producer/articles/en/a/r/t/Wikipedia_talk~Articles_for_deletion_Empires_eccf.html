	    <p><b>Keep</b> - This mod, is very worthy of its spot. Not just because of the lack of entry, if its lacking, there are hundreds of people who could just edit this Wiki entry. But the game itself isnt what keeps me coming back, its the people who play. The developers are among the greatest, the back story is solid. This mod, even if its in infancy, deserves its place among. If this article is making you pee your pants, then you have no life and require a diaper. Cause you have no right to say this mod is so-called NN, cause you have never looked upon the Empires Community. No matter how big or little we are. We'll F*****g pwn your n00b asses on this mod.

<li><b>Aside</b> - Wow, I haven't checked this in a couple days, and, geez, everyone here came up with a lot to talk about (58k worth apparently)... 0_o... Wikipedia isn't running out of space, but if every AFD looked like this, it probably would. Good luck to whoever closes this and has read through all this. More concise arguments in future AFDs, guys! &#160;:-P <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 20:15, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Indeed</b> - A little more precise reasons for AfD and a discussion on the article page for improvement beforehand would've helped. Everything that was missing has been added but since then it degenerated into a pit of wrongful assumptions and petty judgements. Please use the cleanup and cite sources tag next time.

<li>Usually its better to just leave one or two messages complete with some sources and let the closing admin take it from there. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 01:24, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The reasons for deletion I think were concise enough. It was when people poured into the discussion from the Empires board that thinks went nuts. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 09:15, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>For those of you interested in the despicable 'canvassing' i did near the start of this, here is the coppied and pasted message, which i posted on Brownhairedgirl's Talk page (i forget what the talk page is for, if not to discuss dicissons and wikis)</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Please, Please, from all the many fans, creators and clans: do not try to harm this game. we are still developing a fan base, and exactly what we do not need now is for our Player Manual to be deleted. hundreds and hundreds of hours of work have gone into this mod, and as it has much competition, a setback like this could ruin much of it for the entire mod developement team. Please take the time to play the game before you try to destroy it. <a href="http://www.empiresmod.com/download.php" class="external free" title="http://www.empiresmod.com/download.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.empiresmod.com/download.php</a></i></p>
<p><i>beside the newer (and thus less origional for ideas) mod: Iron Grip, we are the first game to ever breach the boundries of FPS / RTS. the concepts are difficult to begin with, but with all the work going ahead, we are continually developing a better, more rounded game. soon, we will be the first mod to use the source engine to implement real, air lift based (so the aerodynamics of the wings actually play a key role in the ability of the vehicle) aircraft!</i></p>
<p><i>I beg you please to change your 'delete' vote on this page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Empires#.5B.5BEmpires.5D.5D" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Empires#.5B.5BEmpires.5D.5D" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Empires#.5B.5BEmpires.5D.5D</a></i></p>
<ul>
<li>Now I'll be the first to admit that posting this was stupid. i mean, it's not the empires wiki that she's even trying to delete, so my first paragraph doesn't make a <i>lick of sense.</i> The second paragraph, what's that? trying to say the game is good? Nay, here i was trying to show how the mod was origonal and thus notable: not another run-around-shooting fps clone, but a new and exciting idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sorry if this kind of plea is seen as wrong. but from brownhaired girl's first comment, her only comment when i first talked to her, "*<b>Delete</b> unless there is sufficient evidence of notability, which there currently is not." I did not think she had paid enough attention to the mod, or it's significance.</p>
<p>Can i just add now that there is no justifiably reason to delete a wiki based upon the 'behaviour' of people in the debating section. there is no possible way you can delete a page because "someone sent me a message asking me not to delete it." Was the message i sent really that bad? I didn't force her to do anything, nor was i rude.</p>
<p>can we just reach a decision based on the <b>facts</b> and end this. <a href="../../../n/u/k/User%7ENuka5_f7a6.html" title="User:Nuka5">Nuka5</a> 16:05, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, and Hahnchen? you are not allowed to delete other people's comments. don't. I wouldn't have thought this issue would be much relevant to the issue either, but some admins think that the 'canvassing' is a big issue. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE HAD TO RE-INSTATE THIS COMMENT. DO NOT DELETE OTHER PEOPLE'S COMMENTS. i can KEEP doing this all day, Hahnchen, and you're going to get yourself banned.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Look at the AFD, it's a complete fucking mess. You have already posted 2 long rants with no real input to the debate other than to throw others off the flow using your powers of confusion. I've removed the above comment because it had absolutely nothing to do with what was being discussed there. If you want to talk about your vote-canvassing, then place it above where it's debated. Don't just throw off the flow of the debate with uncertainty and doubt. Normally, people make a point once, and then maybe defend it. You have made your point multiple times throughout the page, and they all smell the same, I have not voted <b>Delete</b> in three separate locations. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 17:55, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment'</b> As per <a href="../../../n/u/k/User_talk%7ENuka5_01a8.html" title="User talk:Nuka5">User talk:Nuka5</a>, all this effort at spamming the AFD was unnecessary. The quoted text which was repeatdly dumped in here was clearly linked at the point where I first raised it. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 18:59, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
