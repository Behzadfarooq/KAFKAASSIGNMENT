<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> for Pharos, Pburka, and whoever else might know. I'll agree to that. <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_metal.html" title="Christian metal">Christian metal</a> is one notable/controversial case of this, and I'd say Tolkien metal is too, to a lesser extent. But are there any bands that claim forest metal as their genre, rather than as a label indiscriminately slapped on them? Or is the term used often by metal magazines/ezines/publications? If there are, then I'll change my vote... but it doesn't appear to be in common use in the metal scene... I follow metal somewhat but have never heard of this genre. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 4 July 2005 05:32 (UTC)

<li>It's Yu-Gi-Oh fancruft. Weapons that are neither used by any real-life people (e.g. any military weapon) nor bear significant notability in the work in which they appear (e.g. <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excalibur.html" title="Excalibur">Excalibur</a>) do not deserve their own articles... <i>maybe</i> a mere mention in some sort of "This is what all the weapons are" list. I'd say that writing an article on this is like writing an article on the "battle muffin" in the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neopets.html" title="Neopets">Neopets</a> Battledome (and by the way, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battledome.html" title="Battledome">Battledome</a> redirects to Neopets, as it should, rather than getting its own article).

<dd>Because if we delete this info first, before the new article is written, then it is lost. Believe it or not, the data, dates in particular are still note-worthy. I've created a basic stub at <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Kalk_e963.html" title="USS Kalk">USS Kalk</a>, which I encourage anyone interested to add further to. There's plenty more info at that link from Sonic Mew, which could be included, but I don't have time to do so just now. My vote would now be to <b>Redirect</b> <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalk.html" title="Kalk">Kalk</a> to <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Kalk_e963.html" title="USS Kalk">USS Kalk</a>. <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> 3 July 2005 22:00 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>At this point, then <b>redirect only</b> is perfectly fine. However, going to extremes to prevent deletion is a bad general idea. If it needs a total rewrite, that means that nothing is worth keeping. In this case, the only things actually worth keeping came from VfD voters! I.e. VfD was being used as a Requested Articles, in effect. I'm all in favor of good information going in, but why not just go ahead and <i>write</i> the good article and then argue for redirect or delete from the start? Presumably, this ship was named after a person who will be bio-worthy, and now this redirect points to the ship, rather than to the person. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 4 July 2005 02:15 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>: I have no respect for the anonymous user who's been creating editorial havoc on this page in the past few days, and has already voted above to delete this article <b>twice</b> (both IP's point to dialup.xtra.co.nz). This is a person with a very polar non-negotiable opinion that the <i>only</i> thing that matters in any astronomy at all is professional research by people with whom that particular person is affiliated. The same anonymous user has been trolling and vandalising a variety of NZ-related astronomy pages in the past few days, wiping some and putting glowing-sounding factual errors on others, in most cases hypocritically. All of that said, this particular article doesn't seem to be wanted by anyone, so I'll reluctantly support its deletion. <a href="../../../i/z/o/User%7EIzogi_2699.html" title="User:Izogi">Izogi</a> 5 July 2005 13:43 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Please delete this entry</b>: As one of the "incompetent" people from the "mickey mouse outfit" known as Benmore Peak Observatory, I am all in favor of the removal of this entry from Wikipedia. It has been nothing but a source of trouble ever since a thoughful visitor created it on our behalf. People such as this "anonymous" assailent (Gee, can't imagine who that could be...) have been causing us a huge amount of grief (we've even had to switch hosts to end the DDoS attacks) and we've voted to minimize BPO's Internet presence, and end public access to the physical site for the time-being.

By the way, my IP is xtra.co.nz which along with IHUG is as common as fleas on a yard dog here in NZ. Can we get some real information here? So what if the observatory and the website is staff only--hell, Hubble is staff only.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Vote changed. I picked up the phone--they are listed. I spoken to one of the group (who has also spoke to one of the Wikipedia people before). The Benmore Peak group prefer to be left alone--astronomy is the point of it all and they prefer this nonsense be dropped if it means being dropped from Wikipedia. They are dealing with people outside their group who have problems being reasonable and would just as soon be left alone.

<li><b>Delete</b>: I'm the manager of BPO.

<li><b>Keep and make npov</b> - It's POV and looks like advertising, but that's nothing that can't be fixed. It's traded on nasdaq, and a google search shows 9,070 hits on "Onyx Software Corporation".

<li>Delete: Advertising. No, UkPaolo, if it reads like an advert, then it is an advert, and that violates the deletion policy. If <b>you</b> wish to rewrite it to make it NPOV and to give it some specifics, then that's well and good, and we can vote to keep. However, saying, essentially, "Because it <i>could</i> be worthwhile, leave it," means ignoring policy and keeping an article that violates the deletion policy. I do not wish to fix this article, and Cleanup won't. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 3 July 2005 21:00 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b>: I agree, advertising violates the deletion policy. My point was that it is a notable company, in question - as Phroziac said, it gets a number of Google hits, and is traded on Nasdaq. If there's an article on a notable topic, which is not written to a NPOV, then the way to deal with it, in my opinion, is for it to be rewritten. That is exactly what my statement was meant to mean. It's not advertising alone which means it shouldn't be deleted, it's the first part too, that it is also notable. It looks as though Alex12 3 has now done such work, and my congratulations go to him. <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> 3 July 2005 21:47 (UTC)

<dd>I absolutely agree with you that people cleaning it are to be congratulated. I don't think it's clear of advertising, yet. I prefer Alex12 3's other idea, though: creating an article at <a href="../../../o/n/y/Onyx_Software_Corporation_8cc1.html" title="Onyx Software Corporation">Onyx Software Corporation</a>, which is a preferrable location. The cleaning still leaves the total solution, stuff in there, where an NPOV article would just say what they make, how it's used, and facts about success of the company, so I can't change my vote. I worry that some people are campaigning so vigorously and calling names so liberally whenever anyone votes to delete that people are now afraid to cast the vote. An article that breaks the deletion policy should be deleted. If that article gives people an idea for a <i>good</i> article, they should write it. A <i>damaged</i> article should go to cleanup, and a short one to RfE. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 4 July 2005 02:22 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Campaigning so vigorously? Calling names so liberally? I don't see that going on in this particular VfD... the thing that could most be construed as "name calling" that seems to have gone on was with your remark directed at myself! Anyhow, I fail to see how people are going to be afraid to cast their vote. And if you were referring to myself as "campaigning so vigorously" then I can assure you I have much better things to spend my time on. I have no particular interest in this article whatsoever, I was merely making my personal viewpoint to keep. <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> 4 July 2005 08:50 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure what Splash is saying. I wouldn't <i>move</i> this page until consensus, but there's nothing wrong with creating a new article with valid information in it, no matter what. Cleaning up an article while it's on VfD is not only ok, it's actually a virtuous thing. At present, the article still seems fairly promotional, so I can't change my vote. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 4 July 2005 02:22 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I had interpreted <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex12_3_bbbb.html" title="User:Alex12 3">Alex12 3</a>'s statement to mean he planned to execute the move (and keep) sooner than the conclusion of the VfD. The more usual way to phrase what was meant would be as a <i>vote</i> to move/rename. Improving an article, to whatever extent is absolutely what VfD is about, I agree, but I thought the comment meant that unchanged article, save for its VfD tag being removed, was going to be summarily moved to a different title before conclusion of the VfD. If that's not the intention, then I have no problem at all, so long as the vote remains uncontroversial-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> July 4, 2005 11:55 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's how I inerpreted Alex's statement too. Pending a consensus to keep the page surely means "until the decision to keep the page", thus implying that the move would be made now.

Since my original question about this jello and Mormons business on the reference desk I've seen enough to be convinced this is an established - if rare - term. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 8 July 2005 21:01 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Tiny number of real Google hits. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadd4Max_1b3a.html" title="User:Madd4Max">Madd4Max</a> 20:51, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - As it stands, the treatment of the term in the article is far too colloquial for me to consider it to be of "encyclopedic quality". However, this can be corrected. Furthermore, I do not see this as an exception to other relatively esoteric articles on Wikipedia that have become mainstream over time such as the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_umlaut.html" title="Heavy metal umlaut">Heavy metal umlaut</a> and <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploding_whale.html" title="Exploding whale">Exploding whale</a>. The article can still be expanded, and we can give it a chance to do so. It is at minimum missing these things:
<ol>
<li>A description of its importance as a stereotype for a particular group of people</li>
<li>Its influence on marketing strategies within the region</li>
<li>Its role as a form of identity, either as in a colloquial or academic context</li>
<li>Its influence on popular culture and general perception of Mormons by the American public</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Given that all of these can be added to the article in an encyclopedic manner, and that references for these things can be researched in material <i><b>not</b></i> on the internet, I will advocate that we give the article a vote of confidence, and a chance for a few Wikipedians to come by and fix it up. For starters, I will volunteer myself to expand the article, and submit it to peer review once it has reached a reasonable level of quality. If it turns out that this decision still results in an unacceptable article for Wikipedia, then so be it. I will place the article on VfD myself if it comes to that point, but I believe that will not happen - of course, provided that the article as it stands survives this current VfD. For these reasons, I'd like to sincerely request a reconsideration on the part of the "delete" votes already cast, and to simultaneously encourage more "keep" votes as well. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 07:07, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

They are a non-standard (i.e. original research) categorisation of a class of puzzles.</p>
<p>Although the history includes many other editors, careful examination reveals that they mostly performed copyediting rather than adding content (except for a picture or two of a puzzle that fits the definition in the text).</p>
<p>It should be noted that <b>over 100</b> articles (about 200 including images) created by Karlscherer3 were deleted simultaneously in a single VfD, by a 90% majority (see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Zillions_games_a7c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Zillions games">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Zillions games</a>).

<li><b>Comment</b> The disambig page would have been created when someone typed "packing" in on the search bar, or created/clicked on a link to <a href="../../../p/a/c/Packing.html" title="Packing">packing</a>, noted there was no article, noted that the search brought up <a href="../../../p/a/c/Packing_problem.html" title="Packing problem">packing problem</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/h/Sphere_packing.html" title="Sphere packing">sphere packing</a>, and then added links to both. It is unlikely to have been created as a reflection of accuracy, but just as a reflection of the existance articles named or concerning "...packing..." in wikipedia, but no article named <i>packing</i>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/a/c/Packing_problem.html" title="Packing problem">Packing problem</a> is <b>not</b> about the mathematical issue. Read it, it simply gives two examples already in <a href="../../../s/p/h/Sphere_packing.html" title="Sphere packing">Sphere packing</a>, states that there is a result that <i>many mathematicians are surpised to learn</i> (because it is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, and most would dispute its existance and/or noteworthyness), and then states that it is a class of puzzles, which is also original research. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 6 July 2005 22:22 (UTC)

<li>Blimey. Obviously we disagree about the interpretation of the predicate "is an article about the mathematical issue of packing". Readers can decide for themselves: I added the comment because when I did click through to read the article, I felt that your assertion had (I'm sure inadvertently) misled me about its content, and I didn't want others to feel they had been misled. —<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlotwell_e987.html" title="User:Blotwell">Blotwell</a> 8 July 2005 03:00 (UTC)</li>

I would rename <a href="../../../p/a/c/Packing_problem.html" title="Packing problem">packing problem</a> to <i>packing puzzle</i>, since it's a well known class among puzzles. I think (I am not an expert in puzzles, just have some interest in them) the classification is somewhat questionable on <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanical_puzzle.html" title="Mechanical puzzle">Mechanical puzzle</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wire-and-string_puzzle.html" title="Wire-and-string puzzle">Wire-and-string puzzle</a>.

<li>The point is not that there are things which satisfy the description (e.g. the images), but that the division into "mechanical vs. other" is not standard, and in this case, original research by Karl Scherer. Obviously if someone categorises puzzles, e.g. Turquoise Puzzles, many things will fit the description, and allow images, and thus can be discussed, but this is obviously still original research, and a non-standard division. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 5 July 2005 08:21 (UTC)

<li>Just because the classification scheme may be original research does not mean that these articles should be deleted.

<li>The issue is not that puzzles exist which satisfy these definitions (e.g. I could define Puzzles made from red plastic, and obviously some would exist), but that the division of puzzles into such classes is not standard, and is Karl Scherer's own original research (he admits as much on another VfD). The articles serve only to push his own agenda as to how puzzles should be classified, when puzzles simply are not classified in this manner - indeed they are usually not differentiated at all. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 5 July 2005 19:07 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I notice that when Scherer makes assertions about circle packings you're the first to say he's probably lying so as to get it deleted (see below), but when he claims that something is his original research (oh, and can you reference a link for that?) you cling dogmatically to the assumption that he's telling the truth so as to get it deleted. From your claim that puzzles "are usually not differentiated at all" even you should be able to guess that you haven't spent as long looking at the literature as those of us telling you these are standard classifications. As <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamohyl_Jan_6337.html" title="User:Samohyl Jan">Samohyl Jan</a> says, you should go to more puzzle shops. —<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlotwell_e987.html" title="User:Blotwell">Blotwell</a> 6 July 2005 01:13 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason that I trust him when he claims something is his own original research, is that I can find absolutely no reason for him to say so if it is not true, since it would prove the case against it - that it is his original research, thus violates <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, which thus requires deletion. There is no reason I can see that he would lie so as to delete his own work even if it is genuinely valid. Thus I see no circumstance where I would doubt his claims of committing original research; on the other hand, I can see many circumstances where I would suspect something of his is original research and/or lying. These are by no means mutually exclusive, and indeed are virtually identical. In both cases I suspect it to be original research, its just that in one, he admits it. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 6 July 2005 22:31 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Anyway, why don't you believe other people telling you that the topics (except maybe <a href="../../../p/a/c/Packing_problem.html" title="Packing problem">packing problem</a>, but such puzzles definitely exist) are legitimate and mostly contain no original research. There probably isn't some official classification of puzzles, since there is no authority (and also, there are crossovers). But please understand that <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burr_puzzle.html" title="Burr puzzle">burr puzzles</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disentanglement_puzzle.html" title="Disentanglement puzzle">disentanglement puzzles</a> and maybe packing puzzles (where you have a couple of pieces and the task is to put them into a box or square or make a cube from them) are different large quite well-defined categories, which are actually used commonly in practice. We could argue about exact names, but this is a fact, which you would quickly understand if you visited some puzzle shop. It's also very hard to argue about all these pages together. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamohyl_Jan_6337.html" title="User:Samohyl Jan">Samohyl Jan</a> 7 July 2005 17:07 (UTC)</li>

<li>Packing problem is not about the mathematical issue, which even the article notes is at <a href="../../../s/p/h/Sphere_packing.html" title="Sphere packing">Sphere packing</a>, it is about how they constitute a (non-standard, i.e. original research) class of puzzles. Note the highly abnormal terminology used in the article. <a href="../../../p/a/c/Packing_problem.html" title="Packing problem">Packing problem</a> consists solely of Karl Scherers original research definition of different classes of such problems, the problems are not divided in this manner in mathematics - see <a href="../../../s/p/h/Sphere_packing.html" title="Sphere packing">Sphere packing</a> (which also covers circle packing).

<li>The only content which is not at <a href="../../../s/p/h/Sphere_packing.html" title="Sphere packing">Sphere packing</a> is his own definition of how to break down packing problems into different types, and his own claims about how this connects to puzzles.

<li>When it comes to mathematics, there is a very fine line between original research and old research. Unlike most other endevours, math is "timeless"; 2+2=4 was as true 10,000 years ago as it is now. When mathematicians look at wikipedia with an interest in a subject, they don't limit themselves to topics that were known 50 years ago. Yes, it would be nice if he could provide some link to an article in <i>Mathematical recreations</i> or some such journal, but sometimes one can be quite expert and still not be aware of citations. Anyway, if you want to delete original research, I suggest you start with articles on Pokemon, TV sitcoms and rock-n-roll albums. There is a boundless quantity of the stuff in those articles. There's far, far more stuff in WP that is more frivolous and ephemeral than this. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 14:06, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>Article is an advert. <i>Zillions of Games</i> has only 602 non-Wikipedia-mirror hits.</p>
<p>N.b. there has been a lot of Zillions-based spam (e.g. over 100 articles created) on wikipedia for the last 2 years, that was only recently discovered and VfD'd at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Zillions_games_a7c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Zillions games">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Zillions games</a>. Consequently, there was time for there to be many different IPs used to create the articles, and the creator's edit pattern seems to be to use an IP/user-name for a while, then bin it and use another, creating a potential army of dorment sockpuppets.</p>
<p>As a result, some editors with over 200 edits, who have been here for more than just a few days, are potentially sock puppets of the Zillions-article creator. This complicates determining whose votes are permissible immensely, and a developer would probably need to check out each voter when the voting is closed. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 3 July 2005 14:58 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, it's a good idea to check out everyone who votes here. -Ril- has been pointing out users with few prior edits. But this is relevant only for users without verifiable identities. When a voter is using his real name and has an established presence on the web beyond Wikipedia, we can be fairly certain that he is not a sockpuppet, and when he refers back to his Wikipedia profile from his homepage, as I have done, and that homepage is in a domain registered under his name, as mine is, we can be certain beyond any reasonable doubt that he is for real and no sockpuppet. The number of prior edits is relevant mainly for those without verifiable identities, such as those who use pseudonyms, as -Ril- does, or have not established any presence on the web beyond the Wikipedia. In this case, more edits raises the probability that a user is not a sockpuppet, though it never makes it a certainty. The nature of the prior edits and how recently the account has been created are also factors to consider. For example, a couple of the accounts that have voted for delete were opened last week, and one has been involved mainly in VfDs. --<a href="../../../f/d/u/User%7EFduniho_42d9.html" title="User:Fduniho">Fergus</a> July 8, 2005 18:27 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now, I could claim on my talk page that I was <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Adams_4bdd.html" title="Douglas Adams">Douglas Adams</a>. And, apart from the fact he is dead, there is no proof that I am not. Nethertheless it would be a lie. There is no reason to take who people claim they are to be true, as it is easily a lie, and particularly likely for Sockpuppets to do, to try to establish a different identity.</dd>
<dd>I can register any number of homepages and claim them to be different people, then use them for sockpuppetry. Their existance is no evidence at all. The only convincing evidence would be the individuals physically in front of me stating what their usernames are.
<dl>
<dd>And even in this case, their votes would not reflect the opinion of the Wikipedia community at large, but of a small, highly biased, clique, only recently arrived within it, which is reason enough to discount it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It is not <i>more</i> edits that establishes individuality, but a distinct personality difference between editors and their editing styles and interests. More edits makes a comparison possible, and it harder to fake such differences. Under 200 edits is too easy to fake. I myself was accused of being a sockpuppet of <a href="../../../r/i/l/User%7ERil_57ed.html" title="User:Ril">User:Ril</a>, but my editing style and other behaviour, together with my over 3000 edits at the time, strongly indicated that this was not the case to a member of the arbitration committee.</dd>
<dd>Nethertheless, it is also a major sockpuppet behaviour to edit in a noticably distinct style. This is also detectable; by the fact it is much more different to each other than would be statistically likely for two seperate people - i.e. it is obviously someone trying to make themselves appear as different as possible. Indeed some occasionally make votes opposing themselves elsewhere, using paper thin arguments for the case that their true opinion contests.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Between these two factors, I see <b>nothing</b> to indicate that those editors below of few edits are distinct people. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 8 July 2005 19:57 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You might create any number of homepages, but are you wealthy enough to register any number of domains? Of course not. No one is. It costs money to register a domain, and that is why I brought up the point of having a homepage in a domain registered to oneself. My homepage is in a domain registered to myself, which you can verify with a whois search. If you compare it with the whois search for wikipedia.com, you will even discover that mine is older. That should erase any doubt that I registered the domain only to create a sockpuppet here. But even without having your own domain, a homepage that is part of an established web presence can go a long way toward establishing the credibility of a user. For example, Andreas Kaufmann has a geocities homepage, but he has included a picture of himself, has programmed games and a winboard adapter for Zillions, and has been playing games against various people, including myself, on various websites. Moreover, his activity here has been consistent with what I know of him beyond Wikipedia. So I'm certain beyond any reasonable doubt that he is who he says he is. Perhaps there are others here I would come to the same conclusion about if I did the research, though, as yet, I have not. In short, the extremity of your skepticism toward people with few edits is unjustified. --<a href="../../../f/d/u/User%7EFduniho_42d9.html" title="User:Fduniho">Fergus</a> July 9, 2005 00:13 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: This issue was discussed over 2 years ago on the article's talk page. The number 602 non-Wikipedia-mirror hits comes from a 2 year old comment on the articles talk page. See the 08:40, 20 April 2003 article talk page; it reports "8,740 hits on google - though only 602 of those are non-duplicates". Currently there are ~67,000 Google references, but I do not know how many are non-mirrors. <a href="../../../w/e/n/User%7EWendell_2f4b.html" title="User:Wendell">Wendell</a> 3 July 2005 19:26 (UTC)

<li>Karl Scherer's spamming of Wikipedia on the other (now deleted) articles started some 2 years ago, that probably has quite a lot to do with the increase in google hits. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 3 July 2005 22:02 (UTC)</li>
<li>This page seems to have taken a negative tone, so let me be clear. I think the page is a <b>Keep</b> on its own merits, regardless of Google counts or SockPuppets issues. Although I have never used it, I enjoy games and board games, and wish I was a better programmer. This tool seems like a good introduction into prototyping algorithms, regardless if it comes with dozens of built in games and hundreds of user created downloadable games. My reference to the 2 year old talk page and its Google counts was meant to highlight that <i>someone had not done recent research, just repeating older discussion</i>. <a href="../../../w/e/n/User%7EWendell_2f4b.html" title="User:Wendell">Wendell</a> 5 July 2005 23:39 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hmm... i take your point. I've just seen all the other things by this guy up for deletion, and I totally appreciate spam and advertising has been a big problem with this. I still do wonder, however, why the program should deserve no representation on here at all. I fully agree removing countless links in other articles, and rewriting this to ensure an NPOV, but I still just feel that it's notable enough to be represented. However annoying the spam has been.

<dd>The behavior of one anonymous zealot is regrettable. Nonetheless, as Dr. Karl Scherer once argued at length and in explicit detail, this article is not a damned ad. Zillions Of Games is the only fully-universal, user-friendly program for creating and playing chess variants of any architecture. In other words, the ZOG program is as indispensible to board game inventors as Microsoft Windows is to most IBM-compatible computer owners (and I sure as Hell do not wish to advertise for Microsoft). By the way, my name is Melvin Rippey. It would be nice to get some input from some Wikipedia editors who are not clueless as to what they are talking about yet strangely vocal to the point of trying to get this important page deleted. --BadSanta

<dd>I'm not sure that BadSanta's edit history is relevant to this discussion. The fact that a user votes in a VfD discussion that relates to his or her area of interest is hardly suspicious, and the fact that one of this user's absences from Wikipedia coincided with VfD discussions related to another user's contributions is only circumstantial grounds for suspicion. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatusRoma_5ad4.html" title="User:NatusRoma">NatusRoma</a> 3 July 2005 18:58 (UTC)

<dd>The issue is that Karl Scherer's edit pattern (see the IPs) is to use them for a reasonable period, then move on, and occasionally resurrect them. This was over a period of 2 years. This suggests he is capable, and may be likely, to have set up sockpuppets which now appear to be established, though do not make frequent edits, and can then be used to sway a VfD by appearing to be different editors. Consequently, the only way to see if someone may need to be checked out by a developer for sockpuppetry is by flagging up an edit pattern conforming to what would be expected of Karl Scherer. Obviously this could, and is likely to, catch innocent editors, which is extremely unfortunate, and I would have preferred not to need to do this, but developers should soon be able to determine the guilt or innocence of each, when it comes to tally up the vote. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 3 July 2005 22:02 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I gather that a few conscientious editors have been thru Hell over the sockpuppetry. The temptation to get angry and nuke the problem is to some extent, understandable. However, we have a responsibility as editors to not let the unethical behavior of one individual provoke us into spitefully flushing down the toilet relevant material of interest to many. The bottom line is it is difficult to discuss chess variants without mentioning the Zillions program in the modern era. So, it belongs, notwithstanding. --BadSanta
<dl>
<dd>The issue is, is it noteworthy to more than just people who work for Zillions in some manner, and their sockpuppets, i.e. is it more than just <b>fancruft</b>? Given the state of google on the matter 2 years ago before this spamming started - only 602 non-mirror hits, many being message board edits by karl scherer + company themselves - I would say that it is fancruft, and not noteworthy. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 5 July 2005 08:29 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Chess variants are variants of chess, which require only a board and chess pieces, and someone who knows the rules. I don't see where Zillions is a necessity there. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 5 July 2005 08:29 (UTC)

<dd>No, that is a naive understanding of Chess variants. They may be played on boards of varying sizes, shapes, and geometries, and with pieces not used in Chess. Zillions of Games enables the play of countless Chess variants that cannot be played with the standard equipment of Chess. --<a href="../../../f/d/u/User%7EFduniho_42d9.html" title="User:Fduniho">Fergus</a> 01:55, July 10, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As a side note, while it is not an indispensable feature, I would state that ZoG's ability to try all possible moves within a vertain depth is certainly useful in finding holes in one's developed game. For instance, in a chess variant I created (name not mentioned here for fear of being accused of advertising), I originally allowed for a destructive effect on surrounding pieces when two pieces of a certain type were adjacent. I ran the game in ZoG. Four moves in, the computer had moved his pieces into mine in such a way as to devestate my ranks with an explosion. I found that it was something that was impossible to properly defend against, providing a definite advantage to anyone playing the first to move. Two years of playing the game with friends (before I tried plugging it into ZoG) hadn't revealed that move sequence. Maybe not a "necessity" but pretty darn useful in chess variant development. -<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanDuggan_af73.html" title="User:SeanDuggan">Fuzzy</a> 05:20, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are mistaken to the extreme upon one of your key points of argument. The Wikipedia definition of <b>gamecruft</b> refers to fan or fanatical devotion to a single game. Recall that Zillions Of Games is a universal board game program. Just see how radically inconsistent your allegation of <b>fancruft</b> (imprecise word used) is with the broad definition of chess variants. Note that chess variants is a compound noun which carries a very distinct meaning from literally "variants of chess". Chess variants refers universally to a class of board games which include chess and many other chess-related games. I wish the main protagonist on the other side of this argument was minimally coherent on this subject. --BadSanta

<li><b>Keep</b>. My name is David Bush. I am not, nor ever have been, a sockpuppet. Perhaps my <a href="http://www.geocities.com/twixtplayer/" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/twixtplayer/" rel="nofollow">home page</a> (such as it is) would provide sufficient evidence about this. Zillions has great value to me as a tool for analyzing lots of abstract games, not just chess variants. It helps me get a handle on basic tactics, which form the basis for deeper understanding. There are probably hundreds of ZoG script writers who have added to the ever increasing body of work. It costs money to "join the club," but once you have the software, all third-party packages are freely downloadable. I have been a playtester for ZoG, which means I got an upgrade for free. I received no money. I don't know Jack about IT issues, sock puppets and the like. But I am very upset about the flame war that has grown up here. Insults don't help. They really don't. Ignoring the guidelines for posting on Wikipedia doesn't help. It really doesn't. Those who manage this site have a valid concern that future additions to the ZoG page should observe the rules which are clearly listed for anyone who takes the time to read them. Is it worth their time to continually correct violations, just to keep a page which apparently is read by relatively few people? Can we all get along? Everything you might want to tell the world about ZoG can be done <b>within the posting guidelines.</b> If you are not certain your edit is correct, Wikipedia has a "preview" option as well as a "sand box."</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. My name is Fergus Duniho. I am well known as one of the editors of the Chess Variant Pages <a href="http://www.chessvariants.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chessvariants.org" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. Zillions of Games is not just any commercial product. It is a one-of-its-kind product, an interpreter of a computer programming language for playing countless board games against a personal computer. It deserves as much attention as any other computer programming language. Furthermore, Zillions of Games is so much more significant than the games that come with it. More importantly, it has been used to program countless games that no one has ever been able to play on a computer before, and it has provided game creators with a tool for developing and creating new strategy board games. In fact, its existence has resulted in a boom in the creation and availability of new strategy board games. In the world of strategy board games, and especially in the world of Chess variants, Zillions of Games has been of monumental and far-reaching consequence. Both Andreas Kaufmann and Karl Scherer are well-known to me outside of the Wikipedia. Karl Scherer is a New Zealander who has published numerous Zillions rules files (ZRFs) of several games and puzzles of his own invention, and Andreas Kaufmann is a German developer of ZRFs and a well-known member of the Chess Variant Pages, against whom I have played several games online with my own invention, Game Courier <a href="http://play.chessvariants.org/pbm/" class="external autonumber" title="http://play.chessvariants.org/pbm/" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, and against whom I am presently playing a game of Grand Chess online. If both men have posted to the Wikipedia only on related subjects, it is only because they share a common hobby. I share the same hobby and have also posted only on Wikipedia pages related to Chess Variants. But I am also a separate person with a verifible identity. In fact, you will find a separate link to each of our websites on the Zillions of Games page linking to other websites <a href="http://zillions-of-games.com/moregames.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://zillions-of-games.com/moregames.html" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - While my list of articles which I've editted is fairly random and includes a large number of minor edits to fix spelling, grammar, and word choice, it is fairly evident that I've been editting articles outside of ZoG (Heck, my editting experience with ZoG was writing up an article on <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungle_%28Board_Game%29_b5fc.html" title="Jungle (Board Game)">Jungle</a> and changing the link in the ZoG entry to refer to it...). Zillions of games has been a godsend to me in the area of testing out new abstract board game designs. If nothing else, it helped me develop a chess variant, <a href="http://www.chessvariants.org/diffmove.dir/fantasy-revised.html" class="external text" title="http://www.chessvariants.org/diffmove.dir/fantasy-revised.html" rel="nofollow">Fantasy Chess</a>, that I wrote back in middle school.

<dd>But Alexa doesn't really indicate notability. It only serves to record a <i>traffic rank</i> for a given website - ie how many visits a site may be getting, in comparison to any other. As such, you're only recording the number of visits to one website (discounting other language versions, mirror sites, other sites mentioning it, and crucially any download sites). You've got no measure of the number of downloads, nor of the user base. There are plenty of websites which rank worse than Zillions, despite their subject being considered noteworthy. If you wanted to use Alexa to proove to me the notability of a given <i>website</i>, then I would accept what you are saying. It does not, however, prove the notability of a given subject matter, in this case the Zillions of Games system. <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> 7 July 2005 08:23 (UTC)

<li>That is a false dichotomy. World War II does not have an official website, and there are certainly more discussing solely or mostly it than worldwarii.com, so the alexa ranking of the group rather than the individual site would need to be taken into account. This is not the case with Zillions. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 8 July 2005 07:38 (UTC)</li>
<li>That was exactly my point, Chuck, well put! -Ril- of course this is the case with Zillions, allbeit to a much lesser extent. There's plenty of websites about the software, and plenty of download sites, and sites for the games (hence the need for a categories, etc on Google). There's also other language versions of the site such as ZIllions.de. Also, you mention so-called "official websites" so here's another example for you. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> city of <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading%2C_Berkshire_0865.html" title="Reading, Berkshire">Reading</a> most certainly has an official website: <a href="http://www.reading.gov.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.reading.gov.uk" rel="nofollow">Reading.gov.uk</a>.

<dd>No, that's the official website of the city's <i>council</i>. Which is definitely unnotable (but 1/3 more notable than Zillions - as Alexa confirms). Also, Reading doesn't exist predominantly on computers, and so a more reliable measure of its notability is non-computer based, e.g. newspapers and books. This is not true for Zillions. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 8 July 2005 20:14 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I am getting increasingly annoyed by <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">User:-Ril-</a> (aka silly 4-tilde signature)'s repeated arguing on this page. This is intended as a VfD, everyone is entitled to make their point of view. I fail to see why every point needs to have a response made by -Ril-. I feel these comments are unneccessary, and serve only to ensure that the vote appears skewed towards a deletion. I would also point out that he seems to be willing to remove positive comments about Zillions of Games which clearly differ from his point of view (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Zillions_of_Games&amp;diff=18203974&amp;oldid=18189334" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Zillions_of_Games&amp;diff=18203974&amp;oldid=18189334" rel="nofollow">this</a>). For the record, there are plenty of Google results for "Zillions of Games", even discounting those from Wikipedia and it's mirrors. I fail to see how such volume of results could be generated merely due to advertising and spam. In addition, as quoted previously there are plenty of valid reviews etc (such as <a href="http://wired-vig.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,17001,00.html" class="external text" title="http://wired-vig.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,17001,00.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>) which are clearly genuine and not spam. Zillions is also sufficiently notable to gain it's <a href="http://www.google.com/Top/Games/Video_Games/Recreation/Board_Games/" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/Top/Games/Video_Games/Recreation/Board_Games/" rel="nofollow">own category</a> on Google. Now, I do not doubt that there have been numerous problems of spam from certain editors here on Wikipedia. Nor do i doubt that there may be sockpuppets in use, including on this VfD. However, this is no reason on it's own for the Zillions article to be deleted. Of course, sockpuppet votes should be discounted, in accordance with policy, but I do not find -Ril-'s constant accusation to be merited. It is perfectly believeable that editor's voting here are likely to be the same editors who may have only edited articles similar to this one, if this is their field of interest. <a href="http://www.chessvariants.org/index/listcomments.php?subjectid=save+ZOG" class="external text" title="http://www.chessvariants.org/index/listcomments.php?subjectid=save+ZOG" rel="nofollow">Messages</a> posted on external bulletin boards will also have ensured that editors who may have never used Wikipedia significantly before have been driven to vote. Whilst their votes (assuming they have never edited before) should be discounted, this is no reason to "Bite the Newcomers". Perhaps we can continue to let voting take it's course, without the need for a running commentary as to -Ril-'s latest opinion of a comment. This is a VfD, and everyone can make their say. <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> 6 July 2005 21:49 (UTC)</li>

<dd>ContiE's comment was left at 14:07, yours much later at 18:51. For that to have been an edit clash, you must have clicked to "edit the page" before 14:07, and then not saved it until 18:51. This seems unlikely, and even so, the system would prompt you that there was a clash, and another user has edited the page in the meantime.

<dd>I totally don't give a damned! The person(s) who notified the chess variant community of the reckless behavior at Wikipedia (i.e., the move to delete the most important entry in the subject matter) were obviously acting out of loyalty to their fellow hobbyists instead of loyalty to their fellow Wikipedia editors. Otherwise, these involved people with an irrefutible right to know would not have known. Ultimately, it is the destructive behavior of a Wikipedia editor who has zero respect for the hobby of chess variants which compelled this betrayal. By the way, Wikipedia does not have any legitimate right to control every aspect of a person's life who happens to be an editor. In life, unfair conflicts sometimes cause people to choose their most important loyalty at the sacrifice of others. --BadSanta</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable. We don't need hundreds of stubs advertising Zillions, but it deserves an article. The article is not an ad, and <i>Zillions of Games</i> has more than 602 non-Wikipedia-mirror hits, contrary to Ril's claims.

(Full disclosure: I once downloaded the trial version of Zillions and tried it out for a bit, which may disqualify my comments in the eyes of some, even though I decided not to purchase the full version. And yes, I have fewer than 50 edits.) The software is passably good for analysis of positions in chess variants.

So, when the article you voted for deletion is fundamentally improved, expanded, detailed, objectified to the point that it nullifies most reasonable grievances as well as no longer resembles what you originally voted for deletion, you do not reconsider and withdraw?

<dd>-Ril-, there is no fact at all that most people who have voted to keep this article "are likely sockpuppets trying to pretend to be individuals". Most of them have identified themselves by giving both their names and their websites. I visited several of these websites last night, and you can go do the same. Some, though not many, of these websites even included references back to their Wikipedia accounts. I particularly liked seeing the pictures of Rush Rhees on Ben Heaton's website, because it brought back fond memories of attending the University of Rochester. --<a href="../../../f/d/u/User%7EFduniho_42d9.html" title="User:Fduniho">Fergus</a> 03:20, July 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is not a Solitaire variant, the game is played since at least middle ages, see here for more info <a href="http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Tafl.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Tafl.htm" rel="nofollow">The Online Guide to Traditional Games</a>.

I added a link to <a href="../../../z/i/l/Zillions_of_Games_5a41.html" title="Zillions of Games">Zillions of Games</a> and made a screenshot from Zillions.

<p>It uses a half-empty solitaire board with pegs, thus a solitaire variant. The creator of the page added minimal content, and appears to be from an IP that looks like one of the open proxys that Wikipedia had some trouble with a while ago, so you are effectively the creator, even if you are not the editor from the IPs. <b>You</b> yourself claim <i>This article was written by me [i.e. Andreas Kaufmann], not Karl Scherer</i> in the article's edit history. Karl Scherer's trademark editing style is to create an article on a puzzle, or "type of puzzle" (as per-Karl-Scherer), and add "links to zillions of games". This is remarkably similar to your edits here. Your edits elsewhere also bear a similarity. While you may be innocent of sockpuppetry, you may also not be - a developer <i>should</i> be able to check it out to confirm either way, but they don't seem to keen on doing this lately. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 3 July 2005 22:21 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, you are right the game uses the same board and the same pieces as Solitaire. Still the play is quite different, so that I wouldn't call the game a "Solitaire" variant. Yes, 90% of article is written by me, so I could call myself the author of it. Certainly, it is impossible for me to prove that me is me (I am using my real name here in Wikipedia) and that I am not a Karl Scherer. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas_Kaufmann_2b14.html" title="User:Andreas Kaufmann">Andreas Kaufmann</a> 3 July 2005 22:32 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whoever made this article has no idea what s/he is talkign about, and has obviously never read the Area 51 series. 1) It's a work of fiction by Robert Doherty, not a historical treatise by "Dr. Cary Fitzgherald." 2) The part about Qin Shi Huangdi are relatively minor and only in several of the books. 3) The series isn't organized in "volumes." 4) The Mongols were not the Huns - this doesn't really have anything to do with the series, but should help illustrate that the writer of this page has no idea what s/he's talking about. I think it's too far gone to just simply reword, and besdies, having the name be the "Area 51 book series" is a bad page name. <small>(Unsigned nomination by <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuralyov_a64e.html" title="User:Kuralyov">Kuralyov</a> (<a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKuralyov_3e84.html" title="User talk:Kuralyov">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuralyov_a2fe.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuralyov">contribs</a>))</small></p>

<li><s><b>Keep</b>. Laxius Power is quite notable and has been reviewed by quite a few PC gaming websites. The total number of downloads is also quite high. If the nominator feels so strongly about the implication that the game enjoys success, why not removing the affirmations instead of sending the article to VfD? --<a href="../../../s/n/0/User%7ESn0wflake_8d39.html" title="User:Sn0wflake">Sn0wflake</a> 3 July 2005 22:02 (UTC)</s> <b>Abstain</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Laxius power is a VERY popular and well known game, both within and out of the amateur game production community. This article is not particularly informative, though I've let the creator of the games know about this entry, and he is interested in editing it to include a lot more information, as long as it doesn't get deleted first. <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealmKnight_75f6.html" title="User:RealmKnight">RealmKnight</a> 3 July 2005 22:02 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Michiel: Because the author can add stuff to the article, like pictures and informations.
<ul>
<li>Anonymous editor: I absolutely do not believe that the author of this game will be able to present it objectively. The page will be reduced to a personal advertising outlet this way. Anybody can see that coming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Laxius Power is one of the most famous free RPG. The website has had 5 millions page views in one year and 4500 registered members. There is also a lot of following going on from the fans, not fading since November 2001. Success is undeniable.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Seems that the page was edited to be even more subjective. <i>"Random returns to resume his fight with the Demons, this time in the fiercest, most dreaded incarnation of his enemies, in the most thrilling and epic of his adventures so far."</i> -- is this an objective encyclopedia entry?</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichiel_Sikma_a1b1.html" title="User:Michiel Sikma">Michiel Sikma</a> 5 July 2005 19:39 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Michiel, you seem to miss the point that the comment relates to HIS adventures. For instance, "The most thrilling of HIS adventures". "Most dreaded incarnation of HIS enemies". How come this is subjective? Play the games and you'll see this is nowhere subjective. However the summary (overall) might be toned down a little in order to fit better the goal of an encyclopedia.
<ul>
<li>You don't seem to realize that "most thrilling of his adventures" is not objective at all. This is the author of a game abusing an encyclopedia to cite catch phrases. For that reason alone, this article needs to be cleaned up severely, if not deleted. Basically, what you're telling me right now is "but the games REALLY ARE GOOD!" I don't care about that. This is not a rave review site. It's obvious that people who are part of Laxius Power's fanbase are going to be making these comments to try and keep this article up to hype standards.

---Kiyoumi: Excuse me for asking, but if this is fancruft and it's gotta be deleted, can you tell me how to make it better so that it's not opinionated and does not need to be deleted like information of the other Fruits Basket characters?</p>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Comment</b>: I think the more important issue here is that it's a copyvio. Fruits Basket is well known enough that it's probably ok to have articles on individual characters like this, and I'll vote keep if the copyvio issue is resolved. Kiyoumi, please rewrite the article so that it doesn't use wording from external websites, as this causes copyright problems. It's fine to get your information from whatever (reliable) sources you want, just not the wording. <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYelyos_5db4.html" title="User:Yelyos">Yelyos</a> July 3, 2005 18:12 (UTC)</s> <b>Keep</b>.

<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I've rewritten it and removed the image due to lack of information on its source. It's <i>not</i> fancruft. Please see articles on other Fruits Basket characters on the character template I created <a href="../../../f/b/c/Template%7EFBCharacter_f467.html" title="Template:FBCharacter">here</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESango123_0773.html" title="User:Sango123"><font color="#3D9140">Sango</font></a><a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESango123_3e3e.html" title="User talk:Sango123"><font color="#006400">123</font></a> July 3, 2005 18:16 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b> it might be considered bad form to remove the VfD before letting the votes finish... I appreciate that it doesn't deserve deletion (my vote above reflects that), but in that case it will clearly get a Keep vote overall. There's no evidence the VfD was added maliciously as it stands... why not just let the vote run its course? <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> 3 July 2005 20:08 (UTC)

<dd>It is one thing to defend the existence of an article on something obviously notable in the case of a nomination by an established user who just hadn't understood the significance of the topic (possibly because the article was badly written, which is often the case). But this nomination is vandalism by an anonymous user. This particular vandal apparently discovered that if he adds some garbage to a page, he will be reverted in a couple of minutes, but by adding a VfD tag and going though the trouble of setting up a vote, he can keep dozens of wikipedians occupied for days voting and debating his little prank. I see no reason why we should play according to those rules. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 3 July 2005 20:28 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Well here comes my SECOND edit. The only reson I went anywhere near this site is because I was told that "the weird band we saw in Austria" had a page on it. Regardless of who (or what) this Malistator is, 30 year old (and still virgins) Star Wars nerds (<a href="../../../k/r/o/User%7EKross_94e2.html" title="User:Kross">Kross</a>) don't have the right to tease anyone. It is them who deserve to have their heads flushed in a toilet. Personally I couldn't give a damn whether or not these pages are removed.

<li><b>Delete</b> While I am a fan of digg, diggnation, systm, and the rest, this article is not encyclopedic. diggnation has released one audio and one video file.

As for redirecting to <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revision3_Studios_5717.html" title="Revision3 Studios">Revision3 Studios</a>, there is nothing linking this project to Revision3 aside from its creator and the hosting of its files.

<li><b>Keep</b> I thought the idea of Wikipedia was to give people access to the sum of all human knowledge? This podcast has a lot of listeners, has two notable hosts (Rose and Albrecht) and is about a notable website (Digg.com). Very worthy of an entry on Wikipedia. And may I ask, why was the original Digg entry deleted? Digg is as worthy of an entry as Slashdot. Quite frankly, those of you who are saying these things are not notable should really pull your heads out from under a rock. — <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McGinley_c64a.html" title="User:Peter McGinley">Peter McGinley</a> 7 July 2005 00:19 (UTC)</li>

<p>They are a non-standard (i.e. original research) categorisation of a class of puzzles.</p>
<p>Although the history includes many other editors, careful examination reveals that they mostly performed copyediting rather than adding content (except for a picture or two of a puzzle that fits the definition in the text).</p>
<p>It should be noted that <b>over 100</b> articles (about 200 including images) created by Karlscherer3 were deleted simultaneously in a single VfD, by a 90% majority (see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Zillions_games_a7c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Zillions games">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Zillions games</a>).

<li>I am not clear on your vote - do you wish to keep the content of the article or just the existance of <i>an</i> article on the subject with possibly different content? <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 4 July 2005 18:19 (UTC)

<li>The only content I support deletion of (apart from Zillions spam links which I have already cut from one or two articles, should be none now) is in <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanical_puzzle.html" title="Mechanical puzzle">Mechanical puzzle</a> because it looks like someone's pet research. All content of all the other articles is relevant information about notable subjects and I see no reason to remove it. I'm sorry if this wasn't clear from my previous post, but I suggest if you see problems with particular articles you should list them on VfD individually explaining your concerns rather than conducting an indiscriminate smear campaign against all articles by one author regardless of merit. —<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlotwell_e987.html" title="User:Blotwell">Blotwell</a> 5 July 2005 06:06 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: can someone take a look at Convex tiling and see if it needs to be VfD'd as well, it was created almost 100% by Karl Scherer, and I'd have thought the mathematical term for anything remotely like this would have been something like <i>planar tessallation</i>. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 4 July 2005 18:22 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've never heard of the term "convex tiling" in the context of <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tessellation.html" title="Tessellation">tessellations</a>, or anywhere else<a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22convex%20tiling%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22convex%20tiling%22" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> for that matter. I don't think the phrase even makes sense; it apparently applies to a tiling <i>of</i> a convex area, not a tiling <i>using</i> convex polygons. A lot of the text seems to come from <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/mathmagic/0499.html" class="external text" title="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/mathmagic/0499.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which is original research, at best. I think it should be added to the list of deletion nominees. —<a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorsePunchKid_a248.html" title="User:HorsePunchKid"><span style="font-family: monospace; font-variant: small-caps;">HorsePunchKid</span></a>→<a href="../../../h/o/r/User_talk%7EHorsePunchKid_fa6d.html" title="User talk:HorsePunchKid"><span style="color: #070;">龜</span></a> July 4, 2005 22:10 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now convex tiling <i>does</i> look like original research, especially in the history where it credits Karl Scherer with discoveries in this field. I would happily vote for its deletion, so please <i>don't</i> add it to this VfD which is already confusing enough. —<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlotwell_e987.html" title="User:Blotwell">Blotwell</a> 5 July 2005 06:24 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> people, i can garantee you that the Abu Bakt article will not accept that info, it will be deleted on sight. I tried to add that Abu Bakr was beated by his cousin, but no chance, no way, Zora own that article now, "it ruines her prose"...</li>
</ul>
<p>Man c'mon, its wikipedia, the info is relevant to her, some may read a book and add more to her biography... its not rubish, its a legit article!</p>
<p>Just cuz its not much to be said dosent mean its not worth saying!

<li><b>NOT delet</b> Its me that is adding them.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I would have said keep, but if (as that article currently claims, very implausibly) there were 100,000 sahaba, they can't very well all be intrinsically notable. Google doesn't reveal much more than a couple of hadith he narrated and some Christian sites calling him one of the first copyists of the Qur'an. I think a little more evidence of notability is in order. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 4 July 2005 18:04 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Coment</b> It does exist more than 100 000 companions, 120 000+ where gathered in Gadire Khumm. Ther is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_by_country.html" title="List of schools by country">List of schools by country</a>. the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_the_United_Kingdom_3d80.html" title="List of schools in the United Kingdom">List of schools in the United Kingdom</a> has more entries than the <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">sahaba</a> list.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Being a Sahaba just isn't encyclopedic on its own if 100,000 people were Sahaba. What makes this one more notable than the rest? Did he spend more time with the prophet, say? Did he narrate a particularly important hadith, or play a major part in some battle? Or was he promised Paradise, say? If he's just some guy that met the prophet for an hour, he's not worth having an article on. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 4 July 2005 19:24 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Coment</b> Why not? If it was a encyclopedic book i would agree with you 100%, but now we are talking about an electronic encyclopedia. Note that not all schools listed in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_the_United_Kingdom_3d80.html" title="List of schools in the United Kingdom">List of schools in the United Kingdom</a> are very big...</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for having an article for every one of them is simple: If a person has a wife, child and father, and he is not supposed to have and article by himself, then the relative small info that we have on him must be duplicated to every notable relative he has. And that would just clog all those articles with info that is not very relevant for them. And take up much more space than just adding any info to each person. Note that when a Sahaba narrates a hadith, even if there is no info on the sahaba himself, it can help to see in which family he was brought up in and which people he associated with. further, if following a family tree from one person to another, it is important to have an unbroken chain to see how everybody are related. That is not possible if everybody don't have their own family tree. The alternative would be to have one HUGE family tree of 100 000 people, but that would be unreadable, even if ti where in 3D.</p>
<p>Arguments for havin a article for each sahaba:</p>
<p>1) They all matter. many narrated or where in narration chains.</p>
<p>2) To see how they are related with other in case there is not much data available.</p>
<p>3) To see how the more prominent sahaba are related to each other without loosing readability.</p>
<p>4) WP is not a book! If there can be a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_the_United_Kingdom_3d80.html" title="List of schools in the United Kingdom">List of schools in the United Kingdom</a>, why not a complete list of sahaba? How much data can that be in total? the whole article right now is 1,68 kB big. Of whe have 90 000 equal sahaba, that would make 150 000 kb = 150 megabite. How much does that cost? 20 dollars? Isn't that worth for having a complete list of Sahabas, with a article for each one of them?</p>

<li>Well, I just wanted to tell you that non of you will never be like him. I also wanted to tell you that I am not going to waste my time in this because I have 4 companies myself to take of. Fortunatly I do have alot stuff to do instead of wasting my time bothering people. Also it dosent bother me that you say his not notable becuase you are never going to even be near him. O one more thing I am sure going to see him here soon because he is shortly going to be running for governor of the largest city in the world. Mexico city. With no more to say, best wishes. (p.s. - I am sure that someone with nothing to do is going to erase this. But it dosent matter atleast I know that I am never going to be in the need of wasting time bothering people.) <i>... added at 05:51, 4 July 2005 by 66.68.202.116</i></li>
