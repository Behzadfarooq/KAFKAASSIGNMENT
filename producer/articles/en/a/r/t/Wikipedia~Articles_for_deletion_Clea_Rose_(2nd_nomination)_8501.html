<li><b>Keep</b> with regrets. I would ordinarily say that the article could be merged into an article on the alleged perpetrators, but they are all minors who can't and haven't been named. Wikipedia has sufficient articles already about noted criminal misconduct to which this article is similar that it would be inconsistent to remove this one. If the names of the perps were known, it would be a different matter entirely. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 19:46, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

If I may quote him, he said "There is some implications in that the tapes from the security cameras in Civic (the CBD of Canberra) are missing and that there is some indication that there was a police chase underway when she was hit. The underaged driver of the vehicle is facing manslaughter charges as the result of her death. There will be a coronial inquest into her death. This case has been newsworthy in the ACT and raised in the Legislative Assembly." <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F_6995.html" title="User:Yamaguchi先生">Yamaguchi先生</a> 23:33, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b> as bad faith nomination. This nomination is simply a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> revenge for my votes to delete <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Battaglia_18ae.html" title="Stephen Battaglia">Stephen Battaglia</a> and Zazz. The Rose case has received much media attention here, sparking an inquiry, a coronial inquest, much political wrangling, and a review of national police procedures appears to be coming. To this extent, it was the subject of a nationally televised television program aired only two nights ago. This is very clearly notable, which is why I'm trying to get it to featured status, and I really don't appreciate this useless stunt. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 01:53, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No need to accuse the nominator of bad faith - the article reads in many ways like what he or she accuses it of being, and if the accusations were true, deletion would be appropriate. The nomination may have been <i>hasty</i>, but it's not rediculous. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:14, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - Rebecca's evidence establishes sufficient notability. Maybe we haven't heard of her on a worldwide scale but in her home country she is big news. This article is also really well sourced and researched. <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;"><b>Cyde Weys</b></span></a> 02:11, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There was an Australian Story piece on the ABC last Monday. There are 49 returns for "Clea Rose" on an Australian media database - if it included the <i>Canberra Times</i> it would be 100. Contentious coroners inquiry to start soon. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 03:34, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - would this article be better served by turning it into a legal case article about the crime itself? That would cement its validity as an encyclopaedic article. If it's an important ACT case it should be notable. (<a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 05:57, 9 August 2006 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>The crime itself is not particularly notable (people get run down every year), and if that were the issue, it would have never had one to begin with. The issue (and the focus of the media attention) here has been the responsibility of police for the death, and the subsequent inquiry, inquest, calls to change police procedures nationally and ongoing political ramifications stretching on for more than a year, as well as the Walk for a Rose brain injury awareness event, which saw a lot of media attention here. This is why there is only a section of the article dedicated to the actual legal proceedings. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 06:07, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as a noteworthy case. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 08:19, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and tidy up to be more explicitly an article about the noteworthy case not an apparent bio.
