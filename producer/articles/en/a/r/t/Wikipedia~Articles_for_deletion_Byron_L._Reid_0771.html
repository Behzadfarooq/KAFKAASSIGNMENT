<p>Music by Dr. Reid that has been published and recorded included, "Heaven Will Be Worth It To Me" by Stamps-Baxter music, recorded by company group. "On One Glorious Day", recorded by Joe Roper as piano solo in 1979 on Stamps-Baxter album, "No Tears Over There", recoreded by Arthur Watson in 1981 published by Stamps-Baxter in 1980. There are other songs more current, but thats all for now.</p>
<p>Back Again! Other songs for which he is known include, "Unto Our Great King", (another recorded song), "Sing A New Song for Him" which is still being sold on sheet music today, "Heaven" recorded by Ben Speer and published by Stamps-Baxter music 1987.</p>
<p>Other songs, like, "Don't Be Late", "He's My Guide", "In Heaven My Eternal Home", "In Stormy Weather", and "I'll Never Understand" have been reprinted in various congregational songbooks over the last 15 years. "I'll Never Understand" has been recorded by various church groups and choirs in Tennessee and Kentucky.</p>
<p>Both "I'll Never Understand" and "Because Of Jesus" were recorded by the Cumberland Valley Quartet, a group which Dr. Reid and his wife Betty-Marie B. Reid sang in before the birth of their son Nathan.</p>
<p>In the area of children's music, "Jesus Loves A Kid Like Me", "Close You Eyes and Sleep", "We Shine For Jesus", and "God's In Control" have all been published by Leoma Music Co. between 1993 and 2005. All have been recorded and performed by various childrens groups at various singing schools. Also they have all been recorded by the Leoma Singers.</p>
<p>Ben Speer Music published and recorded, "Peace For My Soul" in 1993. Again in 1994, they did "Peace, Joy and Love".</p>
<p>Got to Go!</p>
<p>The Jeffress Family Singers recorded, "Strike The Tent" 1999, "One God, One Faith, And One Salvation" in 2000, "Heaven, Home For Me" in 2001 and "Only Jesus Had a View From The Cross" in 2002. All four songs were published by jeffress/phillips music in those same years.</p>
<p>"Inside Heaven's Gate" was publsihed and recorded by the Cumberland Valley Music and the Cumberland Valley Singers in 2002. Again they recorded and sang "We'll Shout and Sing" in 2003.</p>
<p>Music published and recorded by Leoma Music Co and the Leoma Singers included, 2001: "One More Day", and "Service To The Lord" in 2002: "Singing In Glory", He'll Know My Name", "Oh What A Blessing", "Jesus, Our Lord and King", and "I Know". In 2003: "Moving On", and "Jesus Is The Way". In 2004: "Celebrate", I'll Hear Jesus", and "Jesus, My Friend". In 2005: "Peace", "Wide Will Swing The Gates", "It's Forever", "We Won't Wonder".</p>
<p>This was all we could come up with on short notice, and it may be a week or two before we can get back with you all. Hope this will give you something to chew on in the meantime. As you may have found out, a lot of folks in this area do not get any recognition or fame, thus little written record of what they have done or what they are doing. Dr. Reid is not the most famous by any means, and you folks would do a world of good to find out more about him and many others involved in Southern Gospel Convention Singing. For an easy to reach source, try Arkansas State Senators Jimmy Jeffress and Gene Jeffress. They are first cousins to Marty Phillips and of the jeffress/phillips music company of Crossett, Arkansas. You can email the State Senate in Little Rock or just give them a call. Like any elected official, they would love to get your attention! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.38.40.106 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__66.38.40.106_fa70.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 66.38.40.106">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Don't delete yet</b>, <b>not sure</b>; I'm not sure that the article should be kept, but think it might possibly be salvaged into something useful. Some have noted that this doesn't meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria. I followed the link and read it. I suppose that if we strictly follow that criteria, very little in the southern gospel music field would rate an article. - <a href="../../../r/l/v/User%7ERlvaughn_1973.html" title="User:Rlvaughn">Rlvaughn</a> 04:25, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have just pared the article down quite a bit, trying to keep "bare facts" and remove what appears to be promotion and/or name-dropping in order to make it appear more like an encyclopedia article. Perhaps this is a foundation that can be built on for making a decent article, and if not, it probably should be deleted. - <a href="../../../r/l/v/User%7ERlvaughn_1973.html" title="User:Rlvaughn">Rlvaughn</a> 04:56, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
