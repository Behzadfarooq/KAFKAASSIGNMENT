<li><i>Comment:</i> Answer: I am just a friend of Alejandro Zamora introducing him to Wikipedia. He meets several criterias for insertion, so please let me finish my job and dont edit his page again. Thanks.</li>

<dl>
<dd>Alejandro Zamora cannot be deleted from Wikipedia for the following reasons:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He born to be a musician. He is a new age musician now, he does have composed and recorded several albums on his country, and he does have a website on the Internet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, he meets several of the criterias for inclusion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Has won or placed in a major music competition.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4. Has established a tradition or school in a particular genre.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>5. Has composed a number of melodies, tunes or standards used in a notable genre, or tradition or school within a notable genre.</dd>

<p>Please do not remove the deletion notice from the article. See Wikipedia:Guide to deletion as per the notice. If I were you, I would continue to improve the article, in style and substance, but leave the notice there. Other users of Wikipedia will then contribute to the debate about whether the article should be kept - the better the article, and the more justification you can find, the more likely it is to be kept. Stephenb (Talk) 21:54, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you are notable, someone else will write an article about you.

<p>Answer for MKoltnow: I am a fan of Alejandro Zamora, and I am introducing him to Wikipedia, so please do not delete it again. Thanks.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well this brings up somewhat of a conundrum.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let us assume that you are, indeed, not Alejandro Zamora. We will also, for the purpose of this discussion, assume that Zamora is notable, per wikipedia guidelines. Therefore, your <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERNAME_bbd4.html" title="WP:USERNAME">username</a> is somewhat inappropriate, as it implies that you are someone well-known, when you are not. It will also always give the impression of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> when people look at the edit history of an article such as the one on Zamora. (We avoid conflict of interest, when possible, since one of the wikipillars is having a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, something which is a challenge when you write about <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">yourself</a> or someone you are close to.) As a possible remedy, consider changing your username to Zamorafan or something which makes it clear you are not Zamora himself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The other possibility is that you are actually Zamora himself. We <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> until we have reason not to. At the same time, edits to an article by the subject of it will always seem suspicious. Autobiographical articles tend to have trouble with POV, and sometimes get away from what the author intended. (<a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> states this better.)</dd>

<dd>SO, case closed. I am going to remove the deletion tag because I dont get any answer from you.

<li><s><b>Weak Keep</b></s> - your arguments for notability are compelling but that does NOT make it CASE CLOSED by any stretch of the imagination.

<dd>OK. I am agree, but trying to erase an artist like him or Yanni from Wikipedia, or from another place, is impossible. He is an new age musician, and he must be included on the list of new age musicians of Wikipedia. Furthermore, he meets several criterias for the insertion on Wikipedia. Now, if you are agree, and all the world here is agree, we can reach a common agree. So, I will be glad if the case is closed, and you can leave me to do my job.

<dd>I think there's a possibility that the author didn't mean it like that. Based on their gramatical style it appears that the author's primary language is something other than english and they're not fluent, so there's a good chance the author doesn't fully understand the definition of the word "job" (then again that's a pretty good argument for them not editing the english version of wikipedia, though that's probably outside the scope of this discussion as a poorly written article can be cleaned up by a native speaker rather than being deleted). <a href="../../../p/l/y/User%7EPlymouths_dcb2.html" title="User:Plymouths">Plymouths</a> 23:43, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> There is enough proof of notability and he meets several criterias for insertion on Wikipedia. #1 He does have recorded several CDs, #2 he does have won several awards of music on his country, #3 he does have performed public concerts, #4 he does have composed music for radio and tv shows, #5 and he does have a website on the Internet... so, what more you want? an interview with LARRY KING on CNN to get notability? He is not so notable like Yanni, but he already meets several criterial for insertion on Wikipedia, and to be honest, anyone who is unable to see that he is a new star, is a blind person.

<dd>You are not in a position to dictate whether or not something must be included in Wikipedia. Rules and guidelines exist to make that determination. And given that Mr. Zamora does not meet those guidelines, and given that you, by your own admission, flaunt those rules and guidelines, the page should be deleted. And attempts to influence this by way of creating multiple accounts to act as separate people is also a violation of the guidelines of Wikipedia, and is eligible for punitive measures as dictated by WP rules. In short, you have driven a hole in your own boat. Enjoy the sinking. --<a href="../../../m/h/k/User%7EMhking_b8d7.html" title="User:Mhking">Mhking</a> 19:08, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, DGG is using YOUR ARTICLE - YOU haven't provided a single reference in the article. It is your responsibility to do that if you want to prove notability, not ours. Please find some references to this guy somewhere and post them in the article! And that person MEHDI you linked to has albums for sale at Amazon.com. I search amazon.com for Alejandra Zamora and I don't find anything. Is there anywhere one can actually buy music by this guy? What is his record label and do they have a webpage?

Questions are generally answered within hours, but I would be glad to answer your questions now: #1 you can buy his CDs from his website. #2 The record label does not have a website. #3 If you want more references I recommend to travel to Venezuela.

<dd><i>Answer:</i> If you want to get reliable independent references besides his website, you will need to: #1 buy his CDs, from his website, or from selected music shops of his country, #2 you will need to travel to Venezuela and listen the local radio AM/FM networks to catch his music, or #3 tuning local TV networks to catch his music on the background of ads or TV news, #4 joining his music school, and #5 perhaps if you travel to Venezuela you would have the luck enough to catch him doing a public performance in a national event. I rememeber you that Google or WP is NOT a reliable source to know if a musician is notable or not. There is still a lot of notable musicians that Google or Wikipedia produces no results or unrelated hits like MEHDI<a href="http://www.soothingmusic.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.soothingmusic.com" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> or another notable musicians.

<dd><i>Comment #1:</i> There is a lot of musicians on Wikipedia without websites on the Internet or any kind of external links, without album information, and without biographies or with poor or no information about the artist. He at least meets several requirements to qualilify for insertion in Wikipedia (although only one is needed). Furthermore, I remember you that MEHDI began to sell his CDs from his website, of the same way that Alejandro Zamora, before of selling his albums on Amazon.com. The label record printed on his CDs is Z-records, and apparently this company does not have website. However, you can order his CDs directly from his website, or you will need to travel to Venezuela to buy his CDs on selected music shops as said <a href="../../../z/h/a/User%7EZhakira_8680.html" title="User:Zhakira">Zhakira</a>.

<dd><i>Comment #2:</i> About the differences between notable musicians, the merits of how they reached to be famous is a thing very important when judging the notability of a musician. In my humble opinion (and from a neutral point of view), <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yanni.html" title="Yanni">Yanni</a> had to travel from Greek to the USA to be a notable musician , MEHDI traveled from Iran to USA to be a notable musician. <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedro_Eustache_01de.html" title="Pedro Eustache">Pedro Eustache</a> the venezuelan flutist traveled from Venezuela to USA and joined to the Yanni orchestra to be a notable musician. Alejandro Zamora has not traveled to USA to be a notable musician, of the same way like Raul Di Blasio was famous from Argentina without traveling to USA, or <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitaro.html" title="Kitaro">Kitaro</a> from Japan. So, you can see that too much people think that the easy way is travel to USA to be a notable musician. Perhaps, Alejandro Zamora chose the hard way to be a notable musician from a socialist country where Internet access is really very expensive, latin music is predominant and piano or new age music is very rare, so I believe that he is at least doing his best effort to reach the top of mountain from the bottom, without using a copter to reach the top, or traveling to USA, to be notable.

<dd><i>Comment #3:</i> However, if you travel to this country you can listen his music on local AM/FM radio networks and like backgroung music on local TV ads and news. He often made public perfomances in some national events, and does have a music school on his country where I had the opportunity to meet him. He knows to play several musical instruments besides of the piano, and he always repeat to his pupils that he himself learnt to play piano "without a teacher" when he was very young with his own computer using a system that is not available today, called the Miracle Piano Teaching System.

<dd><i>Final Note</i>: I still guess that we will reach a common agree to keep this musician in Wikipedia because he meets several requirements for insertion (although only one is needed). Furthermore, there are a lot of musicians on Wikipedia without websites, no external links, no album information, and without biographies or with poor or no information about the artist. So, if this musician is deleted from Wikipedia, we would have to delete a lot of musicians or whole categories from Wikipedia too (including a lot of people from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_garage_rock_bands" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_garage_rock_bands" rel="nofollow">The List of Garage Rock Bands</a> or from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Punk_Bands" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Punk_Bands" rel="nofollow">The List of Punk Bands</a>).
