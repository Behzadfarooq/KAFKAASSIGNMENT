<li><b>Comment</b>—It doesn't look like there is much independent content there, so maybe redirection would be proper, but that wouldn't require AfD, just a sound editorial decision by the contributors familiar with the topic. I don't understand the prefaced comment that the storm was "non-notable." If it is non-notable, why would it be documented at all on Wikipedia? Do we have a precedent on this regarding named tropical storms? It isn't like it's the November 9, 2005 New York City Metropolitan Area Rain Shower. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 00:53, 10 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's non-notable that it only caused three deaths, and it's covered at the main hurricane article. The current consensus on creating TC articles is if the storm was notable (<a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical_Storm_Allison_6fc8.html" title="Tropical Storm Allison">Tropical Storm Allison</a>), or did major damage (<a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Stan_f641.html" title="Hurricane Stan">Hurricane Stan</a>), or there is enough information to warrant its own article (<a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Ophelia_d46e.html" title="Hurricane Ophelia">Hurricane Ophelia</a>). <a href="../../../n/s/l/User%7ENSLE_4a42.html" title="User:NSLE"><font color="#FF2020">NSLE</font></a> <sub>(<a href="../../../n/s/l/User_talk%7ENSLE_f7ec.html" title="User talk:NSLE"><font color="darkorange">讨论</font></a>)</sub> \<sup>&lt;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NSLE_ad4c.html" title="Special:Contributions/NSLE"><font color="darkblue">extra</font></a>&gt;</sup> 00:56, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Can you point to the discussion(s) that established that consensus, or by what criteria "notability" and "major damage" are judged for storms? I'm not trying to be difficult, it's just that for most of us who have never edited a meteorological article, it would be nice to have some context. A named tropical storm, to me, seems like it could stand alone as an article, and this one seems to be able to. And the name of the article seems a rather obvious one, so I don't understand that comment either. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 01:01, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. If it's not notable, why do we have 6 paragraphs, 2 pictures, and 4 external links for it? Sure we can <i>merge</i> it back into the main article, with a redirect...that wouldn't be the same as deleting it...but if that means cutting some of the info out of the article, then this is a step backwards. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdorje_69b6.html" title="User:Jdorje">Jdorje</a> 01:46, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Also, and as a side note, there is no consensus on what justifies having a separate article for a tropical cyclone. Everyone has their own opinions. Current practice is that storms that are not <i>historically</i> notable are simply covered by the main season article. However this runs into trouble when non-<i>historically</i>-notable storms accumulate too much information about them (many of these storms kill people and do millions of dollars in damages, so they're definitely worth writing about) and begin to clog up the season article. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdorje_69b6.html" title="User:Jdorje">Jdorje</a> 01:50, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

More can be added. Given Wikipedia's major coverage of <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> with multiple articles, having this article is a useful adjunct given the effects of this "mere tropical storm"'s key role in prompting over 80% of New Orleans to evacuate ahead of Katrina. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 01:51, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The duplicate-article claim is not a good argument, for two reasons. One, it is not a full duplicate of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season_0b33.html" title="2005 Atlantic hurricane season">2005 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, because it has information (including the infobox and added picture) that aren't on the main article. Two, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season_0b33.html" title="2005 Atlantic hurricane season">2005 Atlantic hurricane season</a> is 58 kb long and needs to be made shorter; moving information on that article into sub-pages is a good way to do that, <i>particularly</i> information which (like this storm) you consider not to be notable. If we were to make a new sub-article <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season_storms_bcbf.html" title="2005 Atlantic hurricane season storms">2005 Atlantic hurricane season storms</a> populated with all the information about all the non-notable storms, then we would have a way to move this excess information off of the season article without having to worry about clutter; however, I don't see why this would be any better than one article per storm. Remember Wikipedia is not paper...non-notable information should be moved <i>off</i> of the main season page, not <i>onto</i> it, so that if people don't want to read it they don't have to. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdorje_69b6.html" title="User:Jdorje">Jdorje</a> 04:44, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I would disagree with that criteria - hardly anyone "talks about" most of the articles on Wikipedia. For example, I doubt people often "talk about" what happened in the year <a href="../../../1/1/3/1139.html" title="1139">1139</a>, but it's something that is worth having an article on, and most topics for research (this is an encyclopedia, after all) probably don't correlate with what is being "talked about". <a href="../../../a/y/s/User%7EAySz88_15e3.html" title="User:AySz88">AySz88<font color="#FF9966">^</font></a><a href="../../../a/y/s/User_talk%7EAySz88_f90d.html" title="User talk:AySz88"><font color="#FF6633">-</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AySz88_57ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/AySz88"><font color="#FF3300">^</font></a> 06:07, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The issue isn't if this storm should be documented. Instead it is where. There is a difference. I don't see that <a href="../../../1/1/3/1139.html" title="1139">1139</a> is going to be part of an article on the "1130s", or even expected to be there. However, 2005 AHS is an obvious container for this storm. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 06:52, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think we'll have to agree to disagree on that (and the other response to my comment below). To me, merging Tropical Storm Cindy into 2005AHS is exactly the same as trying to merge 1139 into 1130s. It's not that 1130s might not be a useful article as an overview of the events of the decade - but it'd have to be <i>in addition</i> to 1139, where 1139 contains more details. The articles are more organized and easier to drill down. I think the analogous would be appropriate for 2005AHS and Tropical Storm Cindy - get rid of detalis in 2005AHS and keep them in Cindy's article. (See <a href="../../../2/0/0/Talk%7E2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season_e377.html#Season_Summary_Section" title="Talk:2005 Atlantic hurricane season">Talk:2005 Atlantic hurricane season#Season Summary Section</a> for discussion on distinguishing between the amount of detail appropriate between 2005AHS and specific storms' articles, and <a href="../../../2/0/0/Talk%7E2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season_e377.html#Radical_reorganization" title="Talk:2005 Atlantic hurricane season">Talk:2005 Atlantic hurricane season#Radical reorganization</a> for taking this to the conclusion.

<dd>If there is a consensus on placing all storms (or maybe just all severe and/or landfalling storms) into seperate pages, I will not object. Such an agreement should include a clear deliniation of responsibilities betweenthe main article and the storm pages however. I see no such agreement at this time, nor will I anticipate one. As-is, this is best considered to be a piece of the 2005 AHS. That is my two-cents worth. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 16:35, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I see that some are voting to keep this article separate because it is too big to merge back into the season article. Maybe that means that the article needs to be tightened up and shortened. It seems to me that the length of articles should be roughly proportional to the importance of the subject. We don't need to shovel every last little known tidbit on a subject into its article. I also see a tendency to inflate articles about recent events compared to articles about past events. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and should not be biased towards very recent events. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury">(talk)</a> 10:01, 11 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>About the last point: It seems that would warrent expansion of the past storms as opposed to shrinkage of current storms, which means that doesn't further the argument (that this article should be shrunk) much. <a href="../../../a/y/s/User%7EAySz88_15e3.html" title="User:AySz88">AySz88<font color="#FF9966">^</font></a><a href="../../../a/y/s/User_talk%7EAySz88_f90d.html" title="User talk:AySz88"><font color="#FF6633">-</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AySz88_57ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/AySz88"><font color="#FF3300">^</font></a> 18:57, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia is inevitably biased toward recent events, if only because there is more secondary material from which to draw. It is impossible to maintain the same level of detail on articles from different eras. Maybe this means we must try harder on old topics, but it can't mean that we stifle ourselves on new topics! <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 19:18, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
