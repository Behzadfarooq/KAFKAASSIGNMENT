<p>The result was <b>keep</b>. The article, as it stands, is perfectly reasonable; most of the previous reasons for deletion (eg excessive detail) are invalidated. The only other argument here is screeching about "notability", despite the fact that the article clearly fits within <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">our guidelines on fiction</a>.

<dd>While I had no <i>personal</i> opinion in this as the deleting admin, my careful examination of the arguments presented says this comes down to a bun-fight between <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a>. This material is a very high level of detail regarding a theme which does not appear to be in common parlance, thus falls squarely into <i>"Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information."</i> This has been countered with <i>"Non-notable minor characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be merged with short descriptions into a List of characters."</i> This counter argument is an incomplete quote however as the guideline goes on to say <i>"This list should reside in the article relating to the work itself [...]"</i> In this case the work itself is the episode in which the charater appears. As there is nothing meaningful to merge (minor characters have very little information, plot-important charaters already have more information in the parent articles) and the article title would not serve as a meaningful redirect I recomend deletion.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b> While there is some conflict between this and the episode articles, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Simpsons_3821.html" title="List of characters from The Simpsons">List of characters from The Simpsons</a>, and occasionally the articles on the fictional families, I don't think deletion should be the answer. An AfD crowd won't necessarily have full understanding of the Simpsons project. If it's decided to merge this or that it's unneeded, it can be harmlessly redirected to the character list. As it is, a person could navigate with this list in the sense that he doesn't know the name of the episode in which his/her favourite character appeared, or even the season of the episode, and thus opens this list to find his/her favourite character and the link to the article about the episode- thus making this list serve as an odd form of disambiguation page. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 17:07, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Split to episode articles</b>. I have thought about this for a while now. I still believe that it is an example of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> #2, but I do think that the list is really long and would be too long if it were complete. It is not my favorite page on Wikipedia, but it does serve a purpose. As long as we have this list we don't have too hunt down Simpson stubs about minor characters. I think the best compromise would be to split the list, move the information to the episode articles, and create/change the redirect so that it would go to that article. If we decide on this I will personally split the list (although it would be nice with some help from others). --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMaitch_8373.html" title="User:Maitch">Maitch</a> 17:18, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete'</b>. While they are funny, one time characters still aren't notable. I suggest (if it's not made already): a Simpsons Wiki for this. It doesn't belong on the regular Wikipedia, period. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 18:06, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Conflicting guidelines, defaulting to <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> also says <i>[Not] Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as ... persons (real or fictional)</i> with the disclaimer <i>Merged groups of small articles based on a core topic are certainly permitted</i>, but counters with <i>Plot summaries - Wikipedia articles should not act solely as a summary of the plot of a work of fiction</i>. <a href="../../../1/s/p/WP%7E1SP_77c6.html#Check_your_fiction" title="WP:1SP">WP:1SP#Check your fiction</a> says <i>If the subject, a character in a TV show, say, is too limited to be given a full article, then integrate information about that character into a larger article.</i> etc., etc. I can't take from this that there is unambiguous grounds for deletion so I vote keep, but clearly this article might be the catalyst for the creation of a Simpsons Wiki. Guidelines or not, there should be limits to the detail we go into on even the most popular topics. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 18:25, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a>. This is a textbook case of how to handle the subject. Comments above regarding WP:NOt are not applicable. There is nothing indiscriminate about the subject matter here, which is linked to one of the most important shows of the last 20 years. Furthermore, the WP:NOT "indiscriminate collection" clauses are specific, not elastic. This article is not even close to the specific examples in the policy. I also think a merge is a poor idea and would greatly reduce the utility of the article since those seeking minor characters are not going to know the episode. This lists puts these characters all in one place and that's a good thing. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:32, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm curious how this is a "textbook case" when the suggestion of "keep" contradicts that guideline? As to finding the characters, the likelihood that someone will <i>not</i> know the name of the episode but will know that they were in <i>only one episode</i> is pretty close to zero. A whole swag of redirects from the name of the character to the parent episode solves that problem easily enough, as well. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 23:30, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Does not contradict anything because the Simpsons is long. That's why we have <a href="../../../t/h/e/Category%7EThe_Simpsons_b7f9.html" title="Category:The Simpsons">Category:The Simpsons</a>. The rest of your points regarding redirects are nonsensical given that you are arguing for deletion of the material rather than a merge. The list is a convenient resource as a standalone per the guideline. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 23:44, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Err, what? Please actually <i>read</i> my comments, where I explain why merging is not appropiate and creation of a redirect to parent episodes <i>for the character names</i> is also seperate from the article. What does "the Simpsons is long" mean anyway? The guideline clearly and <b>explicitly</b> states that the appropiate place for minor characters in in the parent work. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 23:59, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, exactly. Please actually <i>read</i> my comments, where I explain why keeping the list is appropriate. The Simpsons is the parent work for all its daughter articles, and the episodes are just chapters in an ongoing saga. This list gives an overview of the use of minor characters across the entire series that surpasses the reach of an article on an individual episode. It is perfect as a jumping off point to the episode articles if greater detail is required. A very similar example is <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Shakespearean_characters_60d7.html" title="List of Shakespearean characters">List of Shakespearean characters</a>, which is full of minor one-off characters. I would point out that I have no <i>personal</i> opinion in this; my thinking is based on careful examination of the best way to organize encyclopedic information on notable topics at wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:24, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ugh. That list you gave is a useless cruft. And it doesn't matter that it's about Big Bill Shakespeare. (By the way, you should've put <i>five</i> asterisks instead of three to have the right indentation. I've put six for my comment so that it would look right should you decide to correct yours.) --<a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 02:20, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks. I disagree. That's not "useless cruft". It's useful information. Every serious reference work should have a list of all Shakespeare and Simpsons characters. After all, they have both been going strong for quite some time. Certainly longer than many of our editors and readers. Your comment looks good btw. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:30, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Useful information!? If I wanted to know more about the drunken porter's monologue in <i>Macbeth</i>, do you really think I'd go to that list and look for "Porter"? No, I'd go look in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macbeth.html" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a> for the aftermath of Duncan's murder. (Or, I'd go read the play itself.) You can pretend that an indiscriminate character list is a result of scholarship, but really it is raw notes stapled together with no context. (By the way, I've fixed the indentations for you.) --<a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 14:22, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are missing the point. Where do you go to find a summary listing of all the characters from all plays? Or to find Reynaldo if you can't remember the play? There is nothing "indiscriminate" about these types of lists (please review WP:NOT), and "indiscriminate" can not be a catch-phrase for "I don't like it". They are well defined and useful reference tools. After all, we don't all have time to "go read the play" as you suggest. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 14:36, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Indiscriminate" is tantamount to "put together in such an unwieldy manner that it is very difficult to use," which is what this list is. As for your example, it goes back to Brenneman's point a while ago -- The chance of someone knowing Reynaldo without knowing about <i>Hamlet</i> is nearly zero. It is much, much more likely that someone would ask, "What was the name of the servant to Polonius in <i>Hamlet</i>?" For this kind of question, this list would be useless. --<a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 19:06, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongest possible Delete</b>. The article's own title proclaims the non-notability of its subject. A list of characters who only appeared <i>once</i> in the course of a long-running TV show is such a extreme form of trivia and cruft I can't believe we're even discussing it. There has to be a point at which we say "Just because it is Simpsons-related, it is not automatically notable". I don't think we'd be doing this much hair-splitting over List of one-time characters on Gunsmoke or List of one-time characters on Green Acres. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 20:04, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>What do you mean, detailed write-ups? If you're asking for character stubs, wouldn't that require a merge?

<ul>
<li>Scratch what I wrote above. Upon looking at the list one more time, I find it as cumbersome and crufty as the one in discussion. What we need is a "List of celebrities" <i>ordered by the name of the celebrities</i>, instead of the characters they voiced or the episode numbers of their appearance. That way, very casual fans could easily look up, say, the characters that <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Hartman_c9e9.html" title="Phil Hartman">Phil Hartman</a> voiced. --<a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 21:44, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per Brenneman. This list is useless for a layperson who wants to look up a character in <i>The Simpsons</i>. How is a non-fan supposed to know that Lyle Lanley is a one-time character but Lucius Sweet is not? For that matter, is he/she supposed to search the list for "Lyle Lanley" when the character is better known as "The Monorail Guy"? This list is of interest to the fans only. --<a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 20:39, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> is their notability due to the fact that they are one-timers? if not, but due to their celebrity voices as suggested by another editor, why wouldn't there be List of two-time characters from The Simpsons, List of three-time characters from The Simpsons, <i>ad nauseum</i>? Moreover, if we have the precedent of this we'll have List of one-time characters from Star Trek, List of one-time characters from Sesame Street etc., and the analogous List of Biblical characters who appear in only one verse, List of Harry Potter characters who appear in only one book, etc. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 21:37, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Move</b> or <b>merge</b> to List of minor characters from The Simpsons, or something like that. The fact that a character appeared one time is far too specific a criterion for a useful list. You might as well have a list of characters who wear green hats. A list of minor characters is quite useful and I believe already exists somewhere. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 22:33, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've made a few responses to above, but they all say the same thing. The guideline clearly says that these characters belong in the related work, why is that being ignored? - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 23:30, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Useful information about an important cultural topic that should appear even in a <i>discriminating</i> encyclopedia. A separate article seems like a reasonable organizational choice, but obviously it could be merged wherever regardless of the AFD result. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 05:36, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I agree wholeheartedly with Brenneman and wikipediatrix. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 09:24, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Reluctant <b>delete</b>. I would wholeheartedly support the retention of this information, but the delete position has well-formed arguements sourced from policy while the keep side is a weakly formed arguement based on logic that ignores policy. On a personal note, I do hope that the Simpsons wiki gets formed and I'll be right there when it does. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37"><b><span style="color:#DF2F2F">Big</span><span style="color:#3F3F3F">Nate</span><span style="color:#DF2F2F">37</span></b></a><sub><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html" title="User talk:BigNate37">(T)</a></sub> 18:46, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>- The information is useful and relevant, and of significance on a cultural level. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Zulu_5acb.html" title="User:Commander Zulu">Commander Zulu</a> 16:15, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Can you expand on this? One of the keys to a valid argument is <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falsifiability.html" title="Falsifiability">falsifiability</a>, and these are vauge enough it's difficuty to do so.
<ol>
<li>Useful - To whom, and by what metric? If this is just an opinon then give us some examples of what you'd consider <i>not</i> useful to make us better understand what your judgment is based upon.</li>
<li>Relevant - Again, how are you making this decision? Looking for <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22one+time+character%22+-wiki+-springfield&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22one+time+character%22+-wiki+-springfield&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">"one time character"</a> on Google, for instance, I'm not seeing much substance. What is this relevent <i>to</i> is the question.</li>
<li>Of significance on a cultural level - Sorry to be repetative, but based on what? A claim that the <i>series itself</i> was of cultural significance would be trivial to substantiate simply by (as an example) counting the number of published academic works. Where are the published works on <i>this</i> subject?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>More to the point, what are the sources used to create this list? Looking over the article talk page and even the last deletion discussion it appears that characters are put here based upon <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> alone. I thus amplify my original "delete" with the rider <b>"and if kept, remove any character without <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> naming it as non-recurring"</b>.</dd>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per JJay and others. Wikipedia is more than just a holding place for facts, we also filter and organize those facts into unique ways (some of which are just not possible on paper), and Lists are one of those ways. Nothing about this list seems "indiscriminate", and I can't understand how anyone could argue that this page should be deleted - what is the harm? Does it make Wikipedia look bad? Does it violate one of our core principles? Does the fact that this about a fictional television show somehow make it less worthy? <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 13:53, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, this is notable since many of these are guest appearances by celeberties. Merging it in with the main article would be a bad idea since it'd simply lead to an overlong main article. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarberio_8f89.html" title="User:Barberio">Barberio</a> 14:18, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> please per jjay and others this list is noteworthy and too long to merge <a href="../../../y/u/c/User%7EYuckfoo_5ab6.html" title="User:Yuckfoo">Yuckfoo</a> 17:28, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
