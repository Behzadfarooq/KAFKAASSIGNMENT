<p>This article should be kept for numerious reasons. Not only is it only controversal because it is a sexual stimulator, but taking it down would be precident for complainers to ask for the deletion of other "obscene material." Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that aims at increasing knowledge, and I managed to get to this page by reading and following links. The educational value is there, proven that it is more than just an advertisment, but more importantly, the free speech value is there as well. Furthermore, the fleshlight IS the best known product in that category, and deleting the article just takes away from wikipedia as a whole. The best arguments for keeping IMHO are that it is like the ipod vs. a mp3 player (as stated below) and also, if this is deleted, then precident will follow and people will demand other objects deleted as well (like the sybian, mentioned below) Just my two cents. This page should stay.</p>
<p><br />
This is a product design, this is not a term , or a word or anything other than an advertise for a spesific product. Leaving this page alive is just like leaving a page for "Sony TV" rather than a page for the term TV or a page for Sony company.</p>
<p>furthermore, the "official site" for that product is nothing but a store an affiliate program for selling that specific product.</p>
<p>i don't see any educational value to that page, or any value whatsoever to that page other than advertising the maker of that product. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bigsexyguide (<a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigsexyguide_83f1.html" title="User talk:Bigsexyguide">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bigsexyguide_eca2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bigsexyguide">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Moderate keep.</b> I might say it's a bit more like having <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a> instead of <a href="../../../m/p/3/Mp3_player.html" title="Mp3 player">Mp3 player</a>; sure, there are probably other brands, but Fleshlight is by far the most notable and well-known, in my experience. Educational? It answers a very basic question: "What is this thing?" Advertisement? There might actually be your best point, though that may be more of a case for significant copyediting, than deletion, if the product/brand is notable. If the article is deleted, I'd suggest a redirect to a suitable main article; in the event there is no suitable article to redirect to, I'd say that should tell us something. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 20:41, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> If a product is chosen i don't think it should be the "Fleshlight" everybody knows that the most popular sex toy ever is the "Jack Rabbit" and that's a fact. if any product should receive a seperated page it should be the "Jack rabbit".The only reason that the "Fleshlight" became popular so fast is because of their good SEO and marketing peaple tha among other activities also getting their product into directories like this one. 20:54, 21 June 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bigsexyguide (<a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigsexyguide_83f1.html" title="User talk:Bigsexyguide">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bigsexyguide_eca2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bigsexyguide">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well, yes, that's rather the point of advertising. Fleshlight have a good marketing strategy, which has lead to their product becoming well-known (which is what we, at Wikipedia, should base our decision on), and (presumably) to increased sales. Should we delete <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford Motor Company</a> because Henry had a good marketing strategy, too? <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 21:14, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> No i wouldn't remove Ford, but I wouldn't let them add "Explorer" as an Wikipedia term. And that company didn't do to their field what Ford did to theirs. You can't just let every company list every product they have, in that case "Doc Johnson" will list 10,000 products that has a unique design, and "California exotics" will add another 15,000, there should be starndards and whatever standard you will make that specific product will not cut it . 14:20, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, yes, I agree with you there. We should only list products that are <i>notable</i>. In my opinion, and in the opinion of other contributors to this discussion, Fleshlight <i>is</i> a notable product. There are other brands of latex sex-doll, but <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realdoll.html" title="Realdoll">Realdoll</a> is notable. I don't see how this case differs from it. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 21:28, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The comparison doesn't quite work, though -- Ford Motor Company has an article, but Interactive Life Forms does not appear to. In this case, the product is not only notable, but is in fact <i>even more notable than the company which makes it.</i> <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 22:21, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Moderate Keep</b> There's no generic name for a device like the Fleshlight, it's unique. . As long as the informaiton presented doesn't advocate use of it because of how good it is, etc. and remains neutral, it's as good as any other entry for a branded device. I also agree that it's a slipperly slope once you get into individual products.

<li><b>Delete</b> No I don't suggest to remove all products and companies. I suggest that you leave notable companies, in sex toys i would add Doc Johnson, Fun Factory (Because they are extremely uniqe), California Exotics(or Swedish Erotica) , but i wouldn't include ILF Inc. or whatever their name, since they are just another company in that market, and they only have one hit, and that due to aggressive marketing methods. And about the product, you can't compare it to iPod that became a fashion statement and a huge trend. And furthermore you can't add Fleshlight - a product just like you wouldn't add "Explorer" (Ford's SUV) as a term for a car, even though it's way more popular, notable and worthy for a page then that product.21:14, 21 June 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bigsexyguide (<a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigsexyguide_83f1.html" title="User talk:Bigsexyguide">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bigsexyguide_eca2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bigsexyguide">contribs</a>).</small></li>

Note that while "Fleshlight" is a brand name, the Fleshlight is a unique design type of artificial vagina incorporating suction and increased manipulability. (More than you want to know, I'm sure.)

<dd>It could (Personal View) be possible to improve this article with concerns to it's history and how it a breakthough design that has influence the 'sex toy' market to avoid the advertising feel it currently has. For example although the iPod is a individual product (part of a music player group,) it's release has a historical value in that it made a huge impact on both music players and futher increased music downloads, plus restored Apples furtunes. It is quite possible that the Fleshlight can be proven to of increased sex toy sales, and maybe improved other sex toy materials, but in this article that isnt clearly shown. Getting the article changed as a historical article and not a statistical would require a request for improvement and not deletion? I suspect that the fleshlight was more a mould of excising technology and ideas then a complete breakthough. Unless someone can improve this article, it would (Personal View) seem far better to simply merge it with the empty looking <b><a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_vagina.html" title="Artificial vagina">Artificial vagina</a></b> and forward the Fleshlight article to it. It would still be possible to keep most of the information, and even include a link to a Fleshlight related site.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The arguments in favour just do not convince me over the blatant advertising that the article really is. It is a notable product, but the article is way below standard. The device is emulated in the psycho-sexual counselling field for male orgasm training. But the article itself is insufficiently general - generic? - to be considered encyclopaedic. This is trade puffery, not notability.

<li><b>Delete</b> I can't see how this product is notable, artificial vagina are already in the market for many years, and they even looks just the same, the only difference is that they put it inside of a flashlight look like body.

I actually wouldn't assert {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-copyvio_e567.html" title="Template:Db-copyvio">db-copyvio</a>}}, because advertising brocures are meant to be copied, but there's nothing encyclopedic there.

<dd>It does meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and everyone that has stated they believe the article should remain has agreed that this needs to be drastically rewritten. I recommend, looking at the nom's contribs and the highly possible sockpuppetry occuring both here and on the talk page. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> <sup><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox">(talk)</a></sup> 14:33, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not convinced it <i>does</i> meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Are those sources known in the field, and are the reviews contributed (possibly by the manufacturer) or by (quasi-)employees of the web site? As I was going to point out, <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epinions.com.html" title="Epinions.com">epinions.com</a>-like sites should be disregarded, even if the reviews are <i>apparently</i> non-trivial, because there's no way to determine whether the reviews really are submitted by someone other than the manufacturer. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 23:26, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, the sources need not be known in the field, only "non-trivial," which seems to leave a fair amount of wiggle room -- while, of course, a source known very well in a given field is more likely to be notable, that's hardly the only route to take. Sites like <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nerve_%28website%29.html" title="Nerve (website)">Nerve</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/k/AskMen_1ae6.html" title="AskMen">AskMen</a> are hardly trivial, and both have posted Fleshlight reviews (<a href="http://www.nerve.com/PersonalEssays/Maynard/fleshlight/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nerve.com/PersonalEssays/Maynard/fleshlight/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://www.askmen.com/love/product_guide/39_product_review.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.askmen.com/love/product_guide/39_product_review.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>). <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babeland.html" title="Babeland">Babeland.com</a> lists the Fleshlight as one of its most popular items (<a href="http://www.babeland.com/page/TIB/CTGY/men-top-picks" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.babeland.com/page/TIB/CTGY/men-top-picks" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>). There's a few other points remaining -- it's my belief that the "Fleshlight" brand is by far more notable than the company which makes it; how many people can remember "Fleshlight" off the top of their head, compared to the number who would even recognize "Interactive Life Forms, Inc."? Going back to the earlier Ford Explorer example, would now be a good time to point out that the Explorer <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Explorer_e5c0.html" title="Ford Explorer">does in fact have an article</a>? Is it worthwhile to note that everyone who's entered this debate has apparently done so with prior knowledge of the product, indicating they've heard of it before? I think I can see where you're coming from, but at this point I have to disagree.

<dd>Actually, I'd heard of it because they'd also spammed the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_Directory_Project_505b.html" title="Open Directory Project">Open Directory Project</a>, and I noticed that multiple retailers for the same product were listed.

<dd>Fair enough, but I made quite a few other points, and I can't help but notice that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> is neither a guideline nor a policy. Not to say we can't explore that, I'm just not sure if it brings in anything new that <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> wouldn't have already established.

<li><b>Delete</b> Reading arguments for delete and arguments for keeping this article, it's pretty obvious that my vote goes for delete, i saw number of arguments to delete this page, but i didn't see any argument to keep it other than "notable product"- argument that got shuttered by the arguments for deletion. --68.7.151.192 03:13, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Let me second that question, what exactly is the argument of leaving that product online? I can see why people want to remove it, but I can't see why anyone would want to leave it. Wikipedia should refurbish it's guidelines to prevent companies to use it as a free advertisement like in this case.--Mikespike 03:27, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I totally agree with Philo, we should also remove Sybian, we should be objective, but sensitive to trends and for that reason i think that the same judgement should go for both sybian and fleshlight, they both should be deleted. However since I am working in that field for so long, let me state the difference between those two&#160;: the sybian has a unique mechanism! and unique functions, on the other hand the Fleshlight took vagina mold, not different from what every other manufacturer selling, and placed it in a flashlight body. So I will refresh a question that was asked here before, what is so notable and what is so special about this product that it should be include as a term in an encyclopedia&#160;?, did it make a difference, did it invovled any kind of invension? if that product goes online, than you should be objective and every product designer should upload all of his / hers unique designs.And if I nerrow it to that field, just imagine what will happend to the integrity of that encyclopedia if DocJohnson will decide to upload tomorrow 5,000 products, each unique in the combination of looks, materials and fanctionality. --Bigsexyguide 08:22, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, please stop logging multiple votes; it's not that you can't talk, or that we don't want you to, but since bolding a "delete" is similar to ticking your choice on a voter's ballot, it's better to only do it once, if that's alright with you. Also, you may wish to read <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, a guideline for notability as regards corporations and related topics, which includes questions of product notability <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html#Criteria_for_products_and_services" title="WP:CORP">here</a>; there've been a few arguments using the guideline, above. In this case, the Fleshlight has been the subject of both non-trivial reviews, and has experienced some degree of trademark genericization. While I can appreciate your arguments, to be sure, my understanding is that notability is more important than uniqueness when it comes to articles (it's not like we'll run out of paper, after all) -- further, attempts by editors to judge the unique merits of a product are unfortunately pretty likely to run afoul of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and/or <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.
