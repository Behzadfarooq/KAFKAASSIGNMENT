Just because <i>some</i> might disagree with the validity of the term doesn't mean that the term doesn't exist, nor that documenting it is inherently invalid! Pejorative terms have encyclopaedic entries, f.ex. compare <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">Nigger</a> &amp; <a href="../../../n/-/w/N-word.html" title="N-word">N-word</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> because the focus of the article is not on the term, but on the idea behind it. The content would best be placed in a context that allows for <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> discussions of all perspectives rather than a <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talking_point.html" title="Talking point">talking point</a> jargon title that implies de-facto agreement with one side of the argument, and this article a discussion of the evolution of the term (if there's enough to say about that) or a redirect to the more general article if there isn't. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font>iggurat</a> 01:37, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Agree</b>. After consideration of your comment, I now agree with most aspects of your suggestion. It certainly makes sense to move the <i>Grievance Industry</i> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/diatribe" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:diatribe">diatribe</a> over to <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Waitangi_claims_and_settlements_f7e6.html" title="Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements">Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements</a> and leave the page solely as a discussion on the evolution and <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymology.html" title="Etymology">etymology</a> of the phrase.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I've done a quick Knowledge Basket search on the term. It shows up maybe 50 times (compared to 200 for <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helengrad.html" title="Helengrad">Helengrad</a>, which was considered to be sufficient to avoid deletion). It mainly appears in ACT press releases until 2004, when it started showing up in National statements, with the variant of Winston Peters' "gravy train". That's about all you can say on its etymology. I don't think it needs a page on its own to explain this. --<a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETirana_4bab.html" title="User:Tirana">Tirana</a> 00:44, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The wikipedia archives state: "Obscure content isn't harmful, Wikipedia is not paper and (practically) has no size limits, and so should include "everything" that fits within its other criteria. There is room for articles on any and every verifiable subject. There is no harm in including an obscure topic, because if it is truly non-notable, people simply won't search for it or link to it. It will not create a significant server load as such.", " "Detailed obscure topics hurt no-one because it's pretty hard to find them by accident, and Wikipedia isn't paper" (from Wikipedia:Importance).", "Limited content is not in itself a reason to delete if there is enough context to allow expansion.", The article on Jay McConnell can be improved or reduced to a stub, the information provided is accurate and will be expanded over the following days, this article through error may have started out as a memorial, but it is now a valid encyclopedic addition.Tristan 18:01, 20 June 2006</li>

<li>I am troubled that it appears the woman in the Nebraska license, alias "Francesca A. Sample, M.D.", appears to be the same woman in the Nevada license, going under the name "Suzy Driver".

While this may well be a useful resource, that in itself is not a reason for it to be in Wikipedia. There are many types of useful resource which we do not include: telephone directories are useful, but we do not include lists of phone numbers; marriage registers are useful, but we do not list every wedding in the world; dictionaries are very useful, but we do not include mere dictionary definitions. The question is not "is this useful", but "is this an encyclopedia article?" And the answer is, "no, this is not an encyclopedia article, it is a collection of pictures". Therefore, we should not keep it in its current form.<br />
If the pictures were cut down to a representative sample, and the list was replaced with an actual article on the history of state drivers' licenses, the cultural significance of their differences, the controversy surrounding their use as ID, etc etc., then we could keep <i>that</i>.

'Ham-sa' is a form of <a href="../../../p/r/a/Pranayama.html" title="Pranayama">pranayama</a> which is related to the 'Hong Sau' technique taught by Sri Yoganandaji. Type that in google and you'll find links to Ananda why it works as a technique and SRF who offer the technique through a paid prescription. the 'm' in sanksrit is not exactly a labial 'm' but rather a cerebral closer to 'ng' as in 'sing'. Some say 'samskrit' and some say 'sanskrit'. 'Hong Sau' is actually how Yogiraj Gurunath Siddhanath pronounces it. 'So-ham' is another pranayama technique - but the change in bij syllable will confer a different effect, as well as, the corresponding visualisation and intent will give slightly different results generally. Alan Veredgraal publisher of Tantra Magazine equates 'Hong Sau' and 'So Ham' to a Kriya technique and calls it 'So Ham Kriya' in his articles on Kriya.

This one remains impartial to deletion or keeption - just offering something on the matter of whether Hamsa Yoga is a technique or not. It must be said that most 'yogas' are being copyrighted to stand out from the rest - ie. Sahaja Yoga, Sudarshan Yoga, Bikram Yoga/Hot Yoga. Should not these be addressed also for their promotional advertising on Wikipedia and crude marketing tactics? Happy Summer Solstice! 213.106.1.25 11:44, 21 June 2006 (UTC)Shaninath</font></li>

Both therefore exceed the average circulaiton of such well-known magazines as US News &amp; World Report, Entertainment Weekly and Money (to name a few notables). True Time is #16 and Newsweek is #16, but these rankings show Glamour and Seventeen are both in the league of the most widely circulated magazines. None of the Linux-type magazines (or similarly narrow-interest magazines) you mention as an anaology are even in the top 100, so the analogy is pretty useless. As for your "elitism", many (myself, an Economist reader, included) consider Time and Newsweek to be very low-brow and trashy (I wouldn't waste a minute on either, they read like they were written for idiots and just don't dig too deep), so I imagine your assertion that Time and Newsweek are so much "better" than Glamour and Seventeen truly is a matter of perspective. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a> 13:04, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</font></dd>

You also assert that the Economist &gt; Newsweek (I agree completely). I therefore embrace and extend Ecomomist &gt; Time =&gt; Newsweek &gt; Glamour &gt;= Seventeen. Which brings us back to Glamour and Seventeen not being very good sources of notability.

<p>There is no particular reason why an incomplete list of cities in Africa in different languages is in any way relevant or notable to an English-language encyclopaedia, particularly as it violates <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. While some articles include the name of a place in different languages that may be relevant to the place in question, there is no reasonable reason why a Wikipedia user needs to know what Cape Town is called in Hindi. If anything; this should be either deleted as irrelevant or moved to WikiDictionary or WikiSource. <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN"><b><font color="#000000">Páll</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/z/f/User_talk%7EPZFUN_5839.html" title="User talk:PZFUN"><font color="#FF66CC">(<b>Die&#160;pienk&#160;olifant</b>)</font></a></sup> 05:00, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Hmmm. As a student of Hindi, and a person who tries to be reasonable, I can easily think of many contexts in which someone would want to know what Cape Town is called in Hindi. As a teacher of ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) at the university level, such a list would have come in handy occasionally for me and very often for my students, who are forever struggling over problems of translating geographic proper nouns. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup></li>

<dd>Not to discount the other arguments for deletion but the "inter-lingua link redundancy" argument is specious. First, not all of the foreign language variants have Interwiki pages. Second, foreign language using non-Latin alphabets do not usually contain transliteration or pronunciation information. E.g., Capetown has no Hindi article and the Chinese article does not tell how to render 開普敦 into something readable to a non-Chinese.</dd>
<dd>In general, Interwikis are very Eurocentric whereas lists such as these have the potential to include important non-European forms. <a href="../../../a/j/a/User%7EAjaxSmack_7ea4.html" title="User:AjaxSmack">AjaxSmack</a> 17:55, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair comment, but I don't think Wikipedia is or should be a translation service, other than in the limited sense of providing interwiki links. With pages like this, perhaps it could attempt to become one, but it would be a very ad-hoc attempt. Would "Food names in different languages" be an appropriate article? I think not, although some might find it useful, but Wikipedia is not only about being useful. It's about being an encyclopedia, which means selecting carefully what to include. <a href="../../../z/a/i/User%7EZaian_7381.html" title="User:Zaian">Zaian</a> 18:25, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, per nom and Zaian. These cross-language articles cause huge problems for verifiability (OR), and Wikipedia isn't a translation service. If you want to know what Cape Town is called in, say Portugese, then follow the inter-wiki links to the relevant language Cape Town article -- which has a much better chance of being verified and correct. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 10:31, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

If we delete this list, the information should be moved piecemeal into the individual articles for fairness but I hardly think it's worth the effort; we'd rather keep this list. Also, names of cities say a lot about the history of the counties that speak those languages (eg Hungarian names often reflect German influence, due to historical reasons), they are not just a random collection of data. Moreover, most names <i>are</i>, in fact, verifiable from the interwiki links of the specific cities. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 19:11, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per the European page discussion. In addition (from that discussion) I add my comment -- and yes, I know Berlin is in Europe not Africa, just subsitute Benghazi and German if you feel the need -- The mere fact that some editors cannot verify some of the contents of some pages (because of their <b>OWN SHORTCOMINGS</b>) is no reason to delete a page. Perhaps, some users would not be in the best position to police that particular part of WP -- I don't verify whether the descriptions of various drugs have the reputed effects on their WP page; I'm just not qualified. Most of us are similarly not qualified, so should they be deleted? All of them? WP is not the lowest common denominator. For quick verification of nearly the entire page, we can always look to the interwiki links to many of the articles on the cities listed; I will assume that the editors of the Japanese wiki know what Berlin is called in Japanese better than I and if WP:ja has Berlin as ベルリン that's verification enough. For the rest, if one is doubtful, you can discuss the matter on the discussion page. But note: just because a source is not in English doesn't make it useless especially when it is the <b>name</b> by which one place is known in another language not some kernel of truth waiting for someone to translate it. The outright arrogance demonstrated by the <b>ENGLISH</b> only crowd never ceases to amaze and disappoint me. &lt;sigh&gt; <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 21:00, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Strong <b>Keep</b>. Let me explain. Suppose you wanted to know the etymology of the English word <i>algebra</i>. What would you do? You would of course look it up in an etymological dictionary. That is precisely what an etymological dictionary is for: to answer that kind of question. You would find that it is a word of Arabic origin. However, suppose your question was not "What is the etymology of <i>algebra</i>?", but rather "What words are there in English that have an Arabic origin?", a very different question. At this point, an etymological dictionary would be of little use. What you need is a <b>list</b>. Sure enough, the Wikipedia does have precisely such a list: the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Arabic_origin_739f.html" title="List of English words of Arabic origin">List of English words of Arabic origin</a>. (There are also a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Sanskrit_origin_c3c8.html" title="List of English words of Sanskrit origin">List of English words of Sanskrit origin</a>, a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Portuguese_origin_7778.html" title="List of English words of Portuguese origin">List of English words of Portuguese origin</a>, and possibly others.) Why is it useful to have such lists as <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_of_European_cities_in_different_languages_2346.html" title="Names of European cities in different languages">Names of European cities in different languages</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_rivers_with_alternative_names_3bd1.html" title="List of European rivers with alternative names">List of European rivers with alternative names</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_regions_with_alternative_names_7ff9.html" title="List of European regions with alternative names">List of European regions with alternative names</a>, and others? Precisely because it is extremely unusual, in the universe of all city names, river names, region names, etc., in the entire world, for these to have such multiple names (exactly in the same way as it is unusual for English words to be of Arabic origin). Consider the map of any country, Britain, for example. While <i>London</i> has a variety of names in foreign languages, there are thousands of place names such as <i>Acton</i>, <i>Brixton</i>, <i>Croydon</i>, <i>Kilburn</i>, <i>Luton</i>, <i>Paddington</i>, <i>Tottenham</i>, and so on, that don't. While <i>Cornwall</i> has a variety of interesting names in foreign languages, most English counties don't, e.g. <i>Essex</i>, <i>Middlesex</i>, <i>Sussex</i>, <i>Norfolk</i>, <i>Suffolk</i>, and so on. Ditto for river names. And it would be exactly the same if you considered the map of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain, etc. In order to use a dictionary (such as the Wiktionary) to find the foreign-language forms, you would have to know <i>a priori</i> which forms to look for, i.e., you would have to know already which place names have foreign-language forms. But how can you know that in advance? In other words, the purpose of these lists is to answer questions such as: "What European cities have alternate forms in foreign languages?", "What European rivers have alternate forms in foreign languages?", "What European regions have alternate forms in foreign languages?", etc. These are all very different questions than "What names does Paddington have in foreign languages, if any?" (which you can look up in the Wiktionary), but those are precisely the questions that linguists, historians, toponymists ask. Why? Because the fact that a city has a multiplicity of foreign-language forms has great historical and linguistic implications, and it is the responsibility of the linguist, the historian, and the toponymist to study the reasons why that happened. To repeat, these lists answer a completely different type of questions than the ones that are answered by dictionaries, such as the Wiktionary. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 21:29, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>That argument is based upon an exceedingly limited if not downright false conception of an etymological dictionary. An etymological dictionary such as Wiktionary has categories, and indeed has categories that duplicate, and in the main far exceed, the articles that you list. (Wiktionary has an auto-categorization system that categorizes words by etymology using templates.) Indeed, we had a discussion about those very articles a year or so back.

<p>There is no particular reason why an incomplete list of cities in Africa in different languages is in any way relevant or notable to an English-language encyclopaedia, particularly as it violates <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. While some articles include the name of a place in different languages that may be relevant to the place in question, there is no reasonable reason why a Wikipedia user needs to know what Paris is called in Hindi. If anything; this should be either deleted as irrelevant or moved to WikiDictionary or WikiSource. <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN"><b><font color="#000000">Páll</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/z/f/User_talk%7EPZFUN_5839.html" title="User talk:PZFUN"><font color="#FF66CC">(<b>Die&#160;pienk&#160;olifant</b>)</font></a></sup> 05:04, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not to discount the other arguments for deletion but the "inter-lingua link redundancy" argument is specious. First, not all of the foreign language variants have Interwiki pages. Second, foreign language using non-Latin alphabets do not usually contain transliteration or pronunciation information. E.g., Madrid has no Irish article and the Greek article does not tell how to render Μαδρίτη into something readable to a non-Greek.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>, Yes, they cause major verifiability problems because of the (mass) cross-language nature of the page. How can I judge the edit someone has just made, when there are (at least) a dozen languages on that page? I've had this problem before when someone added an "international section" to <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cookie_Monster_c348.html" title="Cookie Monster">Cookie Monster</a>. People kept adding names... but there was absolutely no way to verify any of it (not least because they didn't provide sources, and even if they had they would probably be in the language in question). How was I supposed to know what his name was in Hebrew? I couldn't even search for it because the alphabet is incomprehensible to me. For all I know, it could be vandalism and/or someone's school nickname. This is the English Wikipedia... we can only rely on verifiablity in English, without extreme hassle (which is multipled when you have that many different languages on the page). That's why I say they can find the city's article, then click on the inter-lingua link and go to the page on the relevant langauge wiki... where the information will have a better chance of not being vandalism/gibberish. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 18:02, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The mere fact that some editors cannot verify some of the contents of some pages (because of their <b>OWN SHORTCOMINGS</b>) is no reason to delete a page. Perhaps, Motor would not be in the best position to police that particular part of WP -- I don't verify whether the descriptions of various drugs have the reputed effects on their WP page; I'm just not qualified. Most of us are similarly not qualified, so should they be deleted? All of them? WP is not the lowest common denominator. For quick verification of nearly the entire page, we can always look to the interwiki links to many of the articles on the cities listed; I will assume that the editors of the Japanese wiki know what Berlin is called in Japanese better than I and if WP:ja has Berlin as ベルリン that's verification enough. For the rest, if one is doubtful, you can discuss the matter on the discussion page. But note: just because a source is not in English doesn't make it useless especially when it is the <b>name</b> by which one place is known in another language not some kernel of truth waiting for someone to translate it. The outright arrogance demonstrated by the <b>ENGLISH</b> only crowd never ceases to amaze and disappoint me. &lt;sigh&gt; <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 20:46, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This page has, what, a dozen languages on it? To verify any changes made to this page needs an editor (or editors) who can speak those languages. It is a maintenance horror and a vandalism hotspot. How, exactly, do you expect recent changes patrolling to work? I'm guessing that you don't, and you haven't thought it through properly and you'd rather get angry about some perceived snub. Anyway, I'll ignore the rest of your bad tempered rant and just repeat what I've already said: Wikipedia is not a translation service... it is not setup to be one. The way it works, and its reliance on editors to check and verify material added or changed, makes articles like this virtually unworkable and a verifiability nightmare. Someone has to maintain this page when "you" get fed up and leave. Someone has to check the changes across all the languages. It just does not belong here. I'll just add one more thing here: <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">User:Carlossuarez46</a> has also been on my talk page basically accusing me of being part of some "English-only movement". I would say exactly the same thing about this article if this were the French or German Wikipedia. Articles like this, with lots of translations, do not work on Wikipedia because of the way it is informally edited and checked make it a maintenance and verifiablity nightmare. You may imagine it as part of some grand conspiracy if you like, but it is simple practicality. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 22:43, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree that the inability of one user to read a particular language does not render a fact unverifiable. But I'd also like to echo the sentiment just left by Goldom, below, where he or she cautions against letting this discussion become personal.

<dd>Response to Motor: You misrepresent what I said on your talk page, if anyone cares about that sideshow that can look for themselves. This article is <b>right</b> for WP for the numerous reasons already mentioned. I don't claim to be the sole maintainer of the article; all editors are maintainers of all articles they think they are capable of. Someone who isn't up on geography or cannot verify a foreign language addition to an article probably is not the person best to take on responsibility for this article, just as I couldn't contribute much to the Starfleet conjectural ranks and insignia article you have because I am not a trekkie and have no idea what ranks are merely conjectured to be part of the story. We choose our interests and sometimes I look at recent changes/creations but what I don't understand and what is not clear vandalism -- like the anon who was adding BLAHBLAHBLAH to a bunch of pages yesterday -- I move on to work on what I do understand. I think the number of editors of that page and those who seem to care enough about the article to support keeping it means that if I get run over by a bus tomorrow, it'll still be maintained. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 01:04, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Even though I couldn't care less about Starfleet conjectural ranks and insignia, I can still spot gibberish or vandalism... and "I" (meaning anyone on the English Wikipedia) can do a bit of research using google, or read any references supplied. As for me misprepresenting you... I did not, considering your posts here and on my talk page. Furthermore, I haven't claimed you are the sole maintainer. This article needs editors familiar with every one of the languages used... and this is the English Wikipedia. It is not practical because Wikipedia cannot and does not work as a translation service, and is just not setup to deal with it. The fact that it is also, essentially, a near-limitless list is also a problem. From reading the "keep" comment on this page, I get the strong impression that none of them have them have even considered the practicalities of the matter... but such is the nature of AFD. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 07:14, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Arguments about incompleteness and verifiability can be levelled at absolutely every article on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> because this information was deleted from several articles about cities, based on the fact that they are available in this list anyway. If we delete this list, the information should be moved piecemeal into the individual articles for fairness but I hardly think it's worth the effort; we'd rather keep this list. Also, names of cities say a lot about the history of the counties that speak those languages (eg Hungarian names often reflect German influence, due to historical reasons), they are not just a random collection of data. Moreover, most names <i>are</i>, in fact, verifiable from the interwiki links of the specific cities. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 19:03, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s>Regretful <b>Delete</b></s> (vote changed, see below - comment still kinda stands) This sort of case... I can see how it's useful, and agree with most of the comments to keep, but even so, it just doesn't feel like encyclopedic material to me, not even as a list. In reply to a few above comment, I don't think it is "arrogant" (And would warn against personal attacks) to want an English encyclopedia to be in English - there are other language ones for just that reason. That being said, it is perfectly reasonable to, on an article, name it both in English and its native language(s). Naming it in every language one can think of, though, seems too broad. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 21:12, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To claim unverifiability when this is about the most verifiable article seems odd. And naming an article with <i>only</i> its native language(s) leads to a POV debate in nearly every article Gdańsk vs. Danzig, Kosova vs. Kosovo, Ephesus vs. Efes, etc., etc. In order not to burden each article with every (minority and/or historical) language associated with each city, it seems appropriate to collect them centrally. It tends to avoid the fights, so we can know that what the Polish call Gdańsk the Germans call Danzig, and if the user is burdened by accidentally being bombarded by what the French (who invaded and occupied the city) or Russians (ditto) or Swedes (ditto) and Chinese (who did none of the above) call the city, where's the harm? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 21:20, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Strong <b>Keep</b>. Let me explain. Suppose you wanted to know the etymology of the English word <i>algebra</i>. What would you do? You would of course look it up in an etymological dictionary. That is precisely what an etymological dictionary is for: to answer that kind of question. You would find that it is a word of Arabic origin. However, suppose your question was not "What is the etymology of <i>algebra</i>?", but rather "What words are there in English that have an Arabic origin?", a very different question. At this point, an etymological dictionary would be of little use. What you need is a <b>list</b>. Sure enough, the Wikipedia does have precisely such a list: the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Arabic_origin_739f.html" title="List of English words of Arabic origin">List of English words of Arabic origin</a>. (There are also a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Sanskrit_origin_c3c8.html" title="List of English words of Sanskrit origin">List of English words of Sanskrit origin</a>, a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Portuguese_origin_7778.html" title="List of English words of Portuguese origin">List of English words of Portuguese origin</a>, and possibly others.) Why is it useful to have such lists as <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_of_European_cities_in_different_languages_2346.html" title="Names of European cities in different languages">Names of European cities in different languages</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_rivers_with_alternative_names_3bd1.html" title="List of European rivers with alternative names">List of European rivers with alternative names</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_regions_with_alternative_names_7ff9.html" title="List of European regions with alternative names">List of European regions with alternative names</a>, and others? Precisely because it is extremely unusual, in the universe of all city names, river names, region names, etc., in the entire world, for these to have such multiple names (exactly in the same way as it is unusual for English words to be of Arabic origin). Consider the map of any country, Britain, for example. While <i>London</i> has a variety of names in foreign languages, there are thousands of place names such as <i>Acton</i>, <i>Brixton</i>, <i>Croydon</i>, <i>Kilburn</i>, <i>Luton</i>, <i>Paddington</i>, <i>Tottenham</i>, and so on, that don't. While <i>Cornwall</i> has a variety of interesting names in foreign languages, most English counties don't, e.g. <i>Essex</i>, <i>Middlesex</i>, <i>Sussex</i>, <i>Norfolk</i>, <i>Suffolk</i>, and so on. Ditto for river names. And it would be exactly the same if you considered the map of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain, etc. In order to use a dictionary (such as the Wiktionary) to find the foreign-language forms, you would have to know <i>a priori</i> which forms to look for, i.e., you would have to know already which place names have foreign-language forms. But how can you know that in advance? In other words, the purpose of these lists is to answer questions such as: "What European cities have alternate forms in foreign languages?", "What European rivers have alternate forms in foreign languages?", "What European regions have alternate forms in foreign languages?", etc. These are all very different questions than "What names does Paddington have in foreign languages, if any?" (which you can look up in the Wiktionary), but those are precisely the questions that linguists, historians, toponymists ask. Why? Because the fact that a city has a multiplicity of foreign-language forms has great historical and linguistic implications, and it is the responsibility of the linguist, the historian, and the toponymist to study the reasons why that happened.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> apart from the obvious practical uses and the simple demand for it, there's a good (rather bad) number of disputes and even edit wars concerning the mention-or-not of names in other languages (often fueled by prejudices against specific languages, historical rivalies etc.) in main articles, for which in several cases a referal to this page has proven the only realistic modus vivendi. Another aspects is that de facto the English language Wikipedia had a unique function going with the language's status as lingua franca: other languages mainly refer to the English version, but cannot do so (and often then provide access to informatio worth using in the Engkish wikipedia)) when they don't find the equivalent in their own languages <a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastifex_6571.html" title="User:Fastifex">Fastifex</a> 05:38, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not to discount the other arguments for deletion but the "inter-lingua link redundancy" argument is specious. First, not all of the foreign language variants have Interwiki pages. Second, foreign languages using non-Latin alphabets do not usually contain transliteration or pronunciation information. E.g., Damascus has no Kurdish article and the Japanese article does not tell how to render ダマスカス into something readable to a non-Japanese.</dd>
<dd>In general, Interwikis are very Eurocentric whereas lists such as these have the potential to include important non-European forms. <a href="../../../a/j/a/User%7EAjaxSmack_7ea4.html" title="User:AjaxSmack">AjaxSmack</a> 17:58, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A Greek, Japanese, or Chinese would have no need for a phonetic rendering of something in his own language -- that's something only appropriate to a foreign wiki.

If we delete this list, the information should be moved piecemeal into the individual articles for fairness but I hardly think it's worth the effort; we'd rather keep this list. Also, names of cities say a lot about the history of the counties that speak those languages (eg Hungarian names often reflect German influence, due to historical reasons), they are not just a random collection of data.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per the European page discussion. In addition (from that discussion) I add my comment -- and yes, I know Berlin is in Europe not Asia, just subsitute Tokyo and German if you feel the need -- The mere fact that some editors cannot verify some of the contents of some pages (because of their <b>OWN SHORTCOMINGS</b>) is no reason to delete a page. Perhaps, Motor would not be in the best position to police that particular part of WP -- I don't verify whether the descriptions of various drugs have the reputed effects on their WP page; I'm just not qualified. Most of us are similarly not qualified, so should they be deleted? All of them? WP is not the lowest common denominator. For quick verification of nearly the entire page, we can always look to the interwiki links to many of the articles on the cities listed; I will assume that the editors of the Japanese wiki know what Berlin is called in Japanese better than I and if WP:ja has Berlin as ベルリン that's verification enough. For the rest, if one is doubtful, you can discuss the matter on the discussion page. But note: just because a source is not in English doesn't make it useless especially when it is the <b>name</b> by which one place is known in another language not some kernel of truth waiting for someone to translate it. The outright arrogance demonstrated by the <b>ENGLISH</b> only crowd never ceases to amaze and disappoint me. &lt;sigh&gt; <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 20:56, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Strong <b>Keep</b>. Let me explain. Suppose you wanted to know the etymology of the English word <i>algebra</i>. What would you do? You would of course look it up in an etymological dictionary. That is precisely what an etymological dictionary is for: to answer that kind of question. You would find that it is a word of Arabic origin. However, suppose your question was not "What is the etymology of <i>algebra</i>?", but rather "What words are there in English that have an Arabic origin?", a very different question. At this point, an etymological dictionary would be of little use. What you need is a <b>list</b>. Sure enough, the Wikipedia does have precisely such a list: the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Arabic_origin_739f.html" title="List of English words of Arabic origin">List of English words of Arabic origin</a>. (There are also a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Sanskrit_origin_c3c8.html" title="List of English words of Sanskrit origin">List of English words of Sanskrit origin</a>, a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Portuguese_origin_7778.html" title="List of English words of Portuguese origin">List of English words of Portuguese origin</a>, and possibly others.) Why is it useful to have such lists as <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_of_European_cities_in_different_languages_2346.html" title="Names of European cities in different languages">Names of European cities in different languages</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_rivers_with_alternative_names_3bd1.html" title="List of European rivers with alternative names">List of European rivers with alternative names</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_regions_with_alternative_names_7ff9.html" title="List of European regions with alternative names">List of European regions with alternative names</a>, and others? Precisely because it is extremely unusual, in the universe of all city names, river names, region names, etc., in the entire world, for these to have such multiple names (exactly in the same way as it is unusual for English words to be of Arabic origin). Consider the map of any country, Britain, for example. While <i>London</i> has a variety of names in foreign languages, there are thousands of place names such as <i>Acton</i>, <i>Brixton</i>, <i>Croydon</i>, <i>Kilburn</i>, <i>Luton</i>, <i>Paddington</i>, <i>Tottenham</i>, and so on, that don't. While <i>Cornwall</i> has a variety of interesting names in foreign languages, most English counties don't, e.g. <i>Essex</i>, <i>Middlesex</i>, <i>Sussex</i>, <i>Norfolk</i>, <i>Suffolk</i>, and so on. Ditto for river names. And it would be exactly the same if you considered the map of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain, etc. In order to use a dictionary (such as the Wiktionary) to find the foreign-language forms, you would have to know <i>a priori</i> which forms to look for, i.e., you would have to know already which place names have foreign-language forms. But how can you know that in advance? In other words, the purpose of these lists is to answer questions such as: "What European cities have alternate forms in foreign languages?", "What European rivers have alternate forms in foreign languages?", "What European regions have alternate forms in foreign languages?", etc. These are all very different questions than "What names does Paddington have in foreign languages, if any?" (which you can look up in the Wiktionary), but those are precisely the questions that linguists, historians, toponymists ask. Why? Because the fact that a city has a multiplicity of foreign-language forms has great historical and linguistic implications, and it is the responsibility of the linguist, the historian, and the toponymist to study the reasons why that happened. To repeat, these lists answer a completely different type of questions than the ones that are answered by dictionaries, such as the Wiktionary. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 21:27, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per Erik the Rude. This doesn't enter into the decision, but the eunuch fetishists are more disturbing to me than any other paraphilia, including pedophilia, as their fantasies usually include children getting their penis, testicles, labia, clitoris or breasts cut off, almost always against their will. They are often tortured and/or killed as well. Unfortunately, Wikipedia has many links to a site with tons of stories like that and a few pictures and videos of baby circumcision, female genital mutilation and mutilated adult genitals (the pictures and videos are usually hosted offsite on members' websites and such, but they are linked to and sometimes loaded on the website). -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:46, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree. I do not see any real evidence of linkspam nor would term him as "non-notable actor/writer/whatever". As a worker of the Kansas City Renaissance Festival, I know his Seymoure character is well-known and, frankly, talked about with reverence by long-timers. -- jslicer</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Rimbo, I have found that most of the folks who participate in AfD perform their own research before voting on a nomination. Personally, I would never vote without doing so. I think your statements do not represent reality.

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree that merely being notable "to someone" doesn't make someone notable; a co-worker may be notable to me, but that doesn't make him encyclopedia-worthy. C. Wayne Owens has a large cult following within the Ren Faire circuit, which fits WP:BIO. It is difficult to find references on the web, given that the Ren Faire circuit is not what you would call <i>heavily documented on the internet</i>, but one internet reference would be the inclusion of his quotes in several of the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brobdingnagian_Bards_dad3.html" title="Brobdingnagian Bards">Brobdingnagian Bards</a>' newsletters. That he's a significant influence on the Bards' humor is a thing of note in itself.--<a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimbo_882b.html" title="User:Rimbo">Rimbo</a> 00:19, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> His career is embryonic, but professional nonetheless.

<li><b>Keep</b> He is not just prolofic in the small press (writing, editting and publishing) but 2000 AD saw fit to showcase his work in the 2000 AD Winter Special which was dedicated to highlight the talent of the next generation of writers for the magazine (having previously been published in 2000 AD). So even if you don't wish to count the small press as being notable (despite its importance to 2000 AD which is in turn important to the US comic industry) he is actually a professional comic writer which is notable.

Granted anyone can scribble out some cartoons and run off some photocopies which hardly anyone sees and they can call that a small press comic. That shouldn't reflect badly on things like FutureQuake which has become a publishing house producing a range of anthologies (to professional standards) with contributors drawn from the mainstream and small press worlds. It has got awards and great reviews as well as being a place that future talent is nurtured. Which combines to suggest that while not all small press publications are notable this one is.

<li><b>keep</b> The book was one of several small press books to attempt American-format storytelling, as opposed to the traditional anthology-based magazine-format typified by the Eagle and 2000ad (listed as influences in the article), and both contributors have extensive credits with many notable small press and indie books and magazines (between them, they have appeared in the Judge Dredd Megazine, Fortean Times, FutureQuake, The End Is Nigh and MangaQuake among others). The book was also featured prominantly in a Redeye review, and featured in Comics International.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a completely unrelated note, it should also be noted that 'Scott Nestle' is a notorious serial troll who has been banned from the 2 main official and unofficial 2000ad fansites on the internet (the creators of the book this article describes are contributors to the same websites), and has been banned repeatedly, under several usernames, from both. Going to either website (2000adonline and 2000adreview) and typing the name Scott Nestle (or his original username on both websites - 'Scojo') should easily verify this. This has the faint whiff of the slightly stalker-esque behaviour where he made a nuisance of himself to professional writers and artists on the forums where he was banned. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.92.171.123 (<a href="../../../8/4/2E/User_talk%7E84.92.171.123.html" title="User talk:84.92.171.123">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.92.171.123_ef86.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.92.171.123">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>No, I'm not "that" Scott Nestel. And I realise that some of the deletion nominations I've just made may be a little controversial with a small clique of people who've invested quite some time in them (checking your contributions shows you to be one of them, as well as showing some "comedy"" contributions to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Losers_e7bb.html" title="The Losers">The Losers</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Timson_b557.html" title="Matt Timson">Matt Timson</a> which are a little questionable).

<p>Apologies - I didn't realise you were the 'other' Scott Nestle involved with the online 2000ad fan community. As you say, it's a small clique of people... However, small cliques of people are the only group that can be relied upon to write articles about subjects outside mainstream appeal - otherwise we wouldn't have Wikis on Star Trek's made-up science of Warp Field Theory, and it's a small clique which can actually write the Wiki on Quantum Theory, I'll wager. It was the somewhat 'focused' nature of the the group of your nominations which confused me. I'll put my hands up to the comedy vandalism, though.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I admit I am the one responsible for writing the entry on Negative Reinforcement.

I truly believe in what he is trying to do. I believe in every word he says. If you are upset over the creation of this page, please put all on the blame on me, not him. Don't create a backlash towards the Podcast itself just because an entry based on the site was created and violated the site's rules and regulations. If you truly think the existence of this entry causes a disturbance in the balance of this website, feel free to do so. I will not stop visiting this site just because of a deletion.

<li><b>Keep</b> This one is a real mystery to me and confirms, for me, the suggestion made above that there is a wider agenda with the half dozen entries ScottNestle has put up for deletion (some kind of fatwah against the 2000AD-connected small press?). Adrian Bamforth is an upcoming professional artist who has drawn a number of strips for 2000 AD including some of their flagship titles by some of their leading writers. This would be enough t make them notable in anyone's book. He appears to have been put up for deletion because he has also done some work for <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_small_press_comics.html" title="British small press comics">British small press comics</a> (which itself is widely cknowledged as a breeding ground for the next generation of talent - so would count as a plus not a minus).

<li>Just for clarification, is the Project standard that the artist should be included or the song? Imho there's no reason to do both, especially since 99.5% are one-appearance wonders.

<ul>
<li>The Project standard <i>was</i> to make separate articles for "[Country] in the Eurovision Song Contest [Year]", however given that a number of artists (not all of them winners by any means) already have their separate pages, I think making a separate page for each song, rather than the general appearance makes more sense. What would otherwise appear on the would-be page can then be moved to the song page. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 22:34, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>In view of the above, I've tracked down the source for the notability of the song (the protest against its length) and added same to the article.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - It is a song which has won a national competition, the Austrian selections for the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurovision_Song_Contest_3be1.html" title="Eurovision Song Contest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>, which would mean that it satisifed most of the criteria in the songs policy proposal at least. The selection is via some kind of TV show, and is at least as notable as a national version of Idol. Also, I need sources, but during the commentary in 2004 when this song was at ESC, the commentator noted that it was apparently close to being the subject of legal action by the second place group, as the song lasted 3m 9sec? and the rules stated that the maximum length was 3 minutes.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 08:21, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>With respect, you've missed the point of <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a>'s post. The "legal action" was a reference to the fact that the <i>song</i> was either subject to legal action or going to be subject to it (I'm trying to find a source on that to find out whether anything was filed). By having an article on it, Wikipedia isn't going to be subject to anything. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 11:04, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Huh? A song can't be subject to legal action. Wikipedia can be. Stanfor<font color="green">d</font>andson 18:35, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A song can very easily be subject to legal action. <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Sweet_Lord_d35d.html" title="My Sweet Lord">My Sweet Lord</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bittersweet_Symphony_5ce4.html" title="Bittersweet Symphony">Bittersweet Symphony</a> are probably the two most famous examples of cases in which the recording artist was accused of plagiarism. As part of the judgement in the latter case, the money earned by the band was forfeit. Also see the case of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gray_Album_ea1b.html" title="The Gray Album">The Gray Album</a>, in which an entire album was subject to legal action. In the case of this particular song, the fact that it had gone over the 3-minute mark was in fact the subject of a legal challenge. The external link in the article makes this quite clear. Further, I'm yet to see what makes you think that Wikipedia is remotely in danger of legal action as a result of hosting this article. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 22:57, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>The recording artists were accused of plaguirism, <i>not</i> the song.

Stanfor<font color="green">d</font>andson 02:02, 22 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I never said that - I said that the groups involved in this song was subject to legal action - which caused extra controversy and notability for this already notable song - what does this have to do with WP having legal action taken against it.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 02:09, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>And if you want to split hairs about it, fine. The song (specifically whether or not it was plagiarised and whether or not it exceeded the length allows) "was the subject of legal action". The performers "were subject to legal action" and the song "was the subject of legal action".

<li><b>Keep</b> or delete <i>all</i> the Eurovision Song Festival contestants (which would be a pity of the hard work done by the editors). The Eurovision Song contest is one of the biggest TV events in Europe, so an appearance there does give notability to a song.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Well, I don't think the latter option to delete all contestants is feasible. The ESC is a major competition and event across Europe and in the case of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_N_18e0.html" title="Marie N">Marie N</a> and probably other winners as well, she was feted with a parade on her return to <a href="../../../r/i/g/Riga.html" title="Riga">Riga</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latvia.html" title="Latvia">Latvia</a> as well as a presidential reception, et al.

<li>If merely being part of a major TV event was enough to give an article notability, we'd presumably have to have dozens of editors sitting day and night in rooms filled with hundreds of televisions writing millions of articles about things no-one could possibly care about. Sorry, but that simply isn't a criteria that can be used to prove notability. I'm also worried about the informality of the name 'Du Bist', as this is an encyclopaedia and is deserving of formal language. If we do keep this article, I strongly recommend we move it to the formal equivalent and redirect <a href="../../../d/u/_/Du_Bist_bd35.html" title="Du Bist">Du Bist</a>. Stanfor<font color="green">d</font>andson 10:53, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it was not "merely being part of a major TV event", it was the winning entry in a nationally televised competition - which would be the equivalent of Austrian Idol. As for the legal action, it was considered by the second placed artist(s) as they believed that Tie-break's victory was invalid.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 23:57, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not quite sure what you mean about "the informality of the name" here, since that's actually the name of the song in question. To rename the article "Sie Sind" (which would be the formal equivalent of the song title) would be silly in the extreme, since that isn't what it's called and neither would it make sense to call the song that. It would be like going through a back catalogue of jazz or blues songs and renaming "Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby?" to "Are You Or Aren't You My Love Interest?" <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 11:02, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd also suggest that the "dozens of editors sitting day and night...writing millions of articles about things nobody could possibly care about" is kind of what goes on at Wikipedia <i>anyway</i>. You mightn't be a fan of this particular event and its songs/artists/whatever, but other people are. Likewise, there are articles on all kinds of other aspects of popular culture and otherwise. I could argue that some of the articles on actors, actresses and computer games which have even reached Featured Article status are "things nobody could possibly care about", but patently they are.</li>
<li><i>If we do keep this article, I strongly recommend we move it to the formal equivalent and redirect <a href="../../../d/u/_/Du_Bist_bd35.html" title="Du Bist">Du Bist</a>.</i> With all due deference, this might be the most <strike>clueless</strike> uninformed comment I ever read on WP. The name of the song is <i>Du bist</i>, which is standard German for addressing a friend, relative or lover. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 16:54, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is exactly my point. Is Wikipedia addressing its reader as though they were a 'friend, relative, or [God forbid!] lover'? Nope. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENot_131e.html" title="WP:Not">not</a> any of those things. Also see <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html" title="WP:MoS">WP:MoS</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>.
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia isn't addressing its reader in any particular manner, particularly not if (as you say later on) the native language of the wiki is English. It's the <b>title of the song</b> that we're talking about. I didn't choose the title of the song, but given the subject matter I would've chosen something similar if it had been my responsibility. The article makes it perfectly clear that it's a song and nothing else. Would an article on the song "Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby?" be construed as the Wikipedia asking its readers if they want to have a relationship with it? I would sincerely hope not. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 22:56, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm sorry, I don't get your point at all. If we keep the article, why would we move it to another title? What title, what article name, do you suppose someone will look for when coming here? I don't see anything in the Manual of Style that suggests that we have to use a different title because it is too informal... Will you also propose to change things like <a href="../../../a/i/n/Ain%27t.html" title="Ain't">Ain't</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/n/Ain%27t_Too_Proud_to_Beg_f9cc.html" title="Ain't Too Proud to Beg">Ain't Too Proud to Beg</a>, <a href="../../../g/i/m/Gimme_Shelter_565a.html" title="Gimme Shelter">Gimme Shelter</a>, or <a href="../../../g/i/m/Gimme%21_Gimme%21_Gimme%21_%28A_Man_After_Midnight%29_53a9.html" title="Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)">Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)</a>? <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 14:43, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd suggest we move it to Sie Sind. The MoS does indeed recommend against using informal, unexcyclopaedic language, and indeed we put this advice into practice. <a href="../../../d/x/m/DXM_a876.html" title="DXM">DXM</a>, for example, redirects to <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html" title="Dextromethorphan">Dextromethorphan</a> and not the other way around even though 'DXM' is the much more popular term, because, while popular, it is also informal. Stanfor<font color="green">d</font>andson 16:11, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Have you looked at mu examples? They are much more relevant. You give an example of a thing that has both a formal and an informal name. This (a song) is not comparable. Would you actually redirect <a href="../../../g/i/m/Gimme_Shelter_565a.html" title="Gimme Shelter">Gimme Shelter</a> to [[Give Me Shelter]? If there is a formal and an informal name, use the formal one. If there is only one title (as with most songs), use the title and be done with it. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 18:00, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The difference is that the examples you cite are in English, the 'native' language of this wiki. Since this is the case, the titles lend special artistic meaning that should not be modified. However, most English speakers do not know German, and so the title is bereft of any artistic meaning and, not having any overriding reason to do otherwise, we ought to use the formal version.

<li>Because you simply formerly did not know of Druvianism, does that automatically constitute its necessity for deletion? Is not that the purpose of an encyclopedia? To educate, to spread knowledge to other people around the world. I could not think of a better venue for knowledge than an online encyclopedia that can be edited by every single person around the world. I think Druvianism is exactly the thing wikipedia was created to serve. To be a highway for knowledge, to support it and spread it and make it available to everyone for not a single penny at their cost. For the sake of deleting an entire article, something that so much work and dedication has gone into, ask yourself this - "Is it really necessary?" The whole purpose of this discussion is to answer that very simple question. I agree whole-heartedly that wikipedia is not the place for random and nonsensical articles to spread about, that serve no purpose but diluting the already very diluted knowledge pool and draining it of its potency, however Druvianism is clearly not one of these cases. Take a moment and think about this, and do not respond out of passion but rather respond with logic and reason. -- <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrewry_9e4f.html" title="User:Drewry">Drewry</a> 14:04, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>"Is it really necessary?"</i> Yes. Every week somebody has a new philosophy or movement or religion that basically nobody has ever heard of, and wants to use Wikipedia to let people know about it. Become notable first. Then get the article. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 14:11, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I do not doubt that the above mentioned happens regularly and I understand your voice for concern. However this is not the case with Druvianism. Druvianism has about as many supporters as the extreme <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-nazism.html" title="Neo-nazism">radical movements</a>, however these articles are allowed to exist un-contested. My case is that simply because you may or may not have formerly heard of Druvianism, that alone is not enough to constitute the destruction of an entire article.

To try to compare yourself with a movement like neo-nazism, the link you posted, is ludicrous. They have tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of followers.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Even though the article is well written on its own terms (organized, clear, etc.) that isn't enough for it to merit being on an encyclopedia. It needs verifiability, neutral point of view and lack of originality. That last one might seem odd (why would we only want things that lack something good, like originality), but it's what an encyclopedia does, and it's what makes an encyclopedia different from periodicals, pamphlets and other media of communication. The author of this article wants a wider audience, and I support that. No one here, even those urging a delete, is denying the author the right to express his/her opinions. There are many sites on the Internet for precisely this kind of ORIGINAL research, but that's not what Wikipedia is about. I wish the author the best of success in spreading the ideas of Druvianism, and once it achieves sufficient coverage so that there are secondary (not primary) sources that can be used as citations, the author by all means should re-submit an article on this topic. Until then, I'd like to invite the author to participate in the many other aspects of Wikipedia that need dedicated editors. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 15:44, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>While I cannot say I fully agree with the above said, I do fully understand the reasoning behind it. In my effort on the movement's behalf, I will proceed to follow consensus. Druvianism as a movement will pursue new outlets for spreading the ideas stated in the movement, in order to gain credibility and notability. When if in the course of the following days this community finds that the article should be deleted, given that such was decided after fair and meaningful debate, no permanent damage would be taken to me personally - and I feel strongly that the same could be said to the supporters and leaders of this movement. Despite the statements of some, my intentions have always been focused on the advancement of the encyclopedia as a whole. If the decision of this discussion is in favour of deletion I would like to apologize having failed wikipedia as a community. The future of my editions to this community I hope will be prosperous, and I can only hope that no hard feelings have been made as a result of the decision of this article, or the creation of it herein. -- <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrewry_9e4f.html" title="User:Drewry">Drewry</a> 16:56, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> First of all, I would like to remind everyone here that the Wikipedia serves a different purpose than you all think. It is not a dictionary where you can find hogwash neologism uttered by a corrupt, technically illiterate, low-profile and nonserious <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> politician. If any low-<a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">caste</a> user likes this word then he may have it listed in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">wiktionary</a>. Remember, this is an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia.html" title="Encyclopaedia">encyclopaedia</a> and has been created to share great knowledge. I do not see the reason why such things should occupy valuable space on the already overloaded <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> server. Another point to note that even if the word exists (though I doubt it), it is an abbreviation and the 'article', if continues to exist (if some ignorant fools have their way), should not have anything more than who was the hick who coined the term and what is the expansion of this word. The vandal <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolywarrior_ee67.html" title="User:Holywarrior">User:Holywarrior</a> (who is also a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandala.html" title="Chandala">Chandala</a> / <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandal.html" title="Chandal">Chandal</a> by the grace of <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> as he has confessed on <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khatri.html" title="Khatri">Khatri</a> talk page) is notorious for cleverly defacing the pages of almost all the upper <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">castes</a>. I find it inappropriate fo him to question the origin of certain castes when he has no sound basis for that. How can he add "historians are not certain of the origin of these people"? He can discuss such things at the repective talk pages of these castes and not on this boorbaal (or whatever it is) page. I would like to ask him: "Are historians sure of the origin of your caste (<a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandala.html" title="Chandala">Chandala</a> / <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandal.html" title="Chandal">Chandal</a>)? If so, how? If yes, why do you not write about it on its page?

<li>How about deleting Wikipedia/RC patroller-Everyone seems to be having dubious records there.How can one deny affiliation from this and Vnadal Control Units are the first target of Vandals/Scoundrels to get listed there so as to impersonate as respectable editors/admin and also acts as a link page for vandal interaction.I am not a bit amazed to see development on Bhurabal page and comments here.Perhaps this has become modus operandi of vandal groups in which admins too are participating.Sad but true.<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolywarrior_ee67.html" title="User:Holywarrior">Holywarrior</a> 07:50, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

In my opinion both versions are of equal merit: the 'schedule' looks prettier, but the 'calendar' is easier to read at a glance.

<li><small><b>Keep</b> Timwi, get off your high horse. 1) I did not originally make the calendar. 2) It's a <i>calendar</i>. Your layout is hardly more readable. Having it listed as a long list makes it harder to figure out what games are on what day and what times they're at. I think people should have a choice as to the format of the calendar. I guess this is in conflict with wikipedia's policy on "duplicate" pages so it will probably be deleted. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDav2008_92ce.html" title="User:Dav2008">Dav2008</a> 13:48, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I originally placed the {{db-bio}} and {{hoax}} tags, but I accept that an AfD vote is probably a better route. The reason for the hoax tag wasn't that the person didn't exist, but that the events attributed to them seem unlikely - particularly as a Google search turns up nothing. Even if it's not a hoax, they're clearly not notable, which is adequate grounds for deletion.

<dd>Hmm, the 503 was derived from searching for "Solomon Tulbure" through google.co.za, which shouldn't give wildly different results from google.com, but i guess 503 vs. 5000 is pretty different. Regardless, my vote stands. A google search for my name, "Moe Aboulkheir", comes up with roughly 1k results, and I am far from notable. <a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoe_Aboulkheir_cc7f.html" title="User:Moe Aboulkheir">Moe Aboulkheir</a> 19:24, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Even for someone who pretty much hates TV, I like this article. It's a fun, conversation-provoking piece which happens to have no place on Wikipedia for all the reasons mentioned above. Perhaps the author could start over. (<b>FEEDBACK</b> from more experienced editors would be appreciated for what I'm about to write: is it acceptable in Wiki-policy for me to urge the author to do what I'm going to urge s/he do?) Write something on "Innovative American TV Shows in the Major Genres" but then find an already existing article to include it in, rather than having a stand-alone article. In writing something like this, you'll have to be very careful to use NPOV and to avoid OR. The best way to do both, most likely, is to make ample use of citations to reputable publications. Get half a dozen academic books on American TV and cite them for each show that you mention. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 15:52, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep:</b> I have heard the name Gohulan being used before as both a person's name (Google "gohulan") and as a popular Melbourne based word. True, it is not in the dictionary -- but if Wikipedia is trying to define terms across the world, maybe it should let this article develop. It seems that the author is new to Wikipedia, and might try the sandbox approach.

<li>I'm saying people have hacked IPs before to make it appear as though different people support XYZ article, and it wouldn't be the first time.

<p>The page seems like a completely non-notable bio, and it's a totally self-promoting vanity page to boot (check out the username it was created by).

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). The article here is a fairly long one, and I cannot see any good way of merging this without removing about 90% of the article. The closure here does not mean that the article cannot be merged, but only that I will not do so. Regarding the possible merge targets, I think that <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_slang.html" title="Internet slang">Internet slang</a> is a poor merge target since that article is about internet slang in general, not about specific terms. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_internet_slang.html" title="List of internet slang">List of internet slang</a> is perhaps better but that article only has short descriptions. <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leet.html" title="Leet">Leet</a> is also a reasonable merge target, but would again require serious trimming. I will leave that discussion to the talkpages. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:23, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article contains substantial information about the term in question far exceeding the scope of a dictionary definition and is of much greater length than would be appropriate for inclusion in a general article on slang. I initially found the article trying to figure out if there was any specific meaning to the word. Had it merely redirected an article on slang in general, I would have found it utterly useless, as I already knew that it was internet slang at that point.

<li>I second this rationale - it may not be as objective as the one I said above, but to be honest, this is my case as well. Back when everyone was saying this, I had no clue what it meant or where it came from, and you can just imagine trying to find that info on google or someplace.

<li>That's actually untrue also. The article was appropriately removed from AfD by an administrator following 12 votes and two weeks on that list, and of the 10 voting to keep the article, almost all of them offered compelling reasons for keeping it. A proposal to rename it is not unreasonable, but that is not the nature of the AfD nominator's argument, which he or she now attempts for the second time in less than a month. <a href="../../../m/i/a/User%7EMiamiDolphins3_3973.html" title="User:MiamiDolphins3">MiamiDolphins3</a> 23:42, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Careful study shows that only 4 of the 10 gave reasons (ignoring "insufficient reason for deletion", and "for reasons listed above" (without further comment), and "an article thatis NN does not attract editors"), which is probably still enough for a "Keep" result, but is not a majority of the "Keep" "votes". — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 18:19, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Careful</b> study shows that only 2 of the 10 said "keep for reasons listed above" or the like, without offering new arguments. My math says that 10-2=8 users who did offer reasons to keep. (If you discount the 3 you do, that leaves 5 users with new arguments to keep, and not the 4, 3, or 2 you've mentioned in your comments.) And I would not discount this reason several listed: that the motion to delete was frivolous, lacked ground, etc. That fully counts, IMHO. It's an important part of the process of protecting articles from frivolous VfDs. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversitytruth_ac59.html" title="User:Universitytruth">Universitytruth</a> 21:46, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> - noteworthy event covered in sufficiantly significant news media. Had the prior AFD been closed as a delete and then brought to deletion review it might well have been overturned. No consensus was a possible outcome given the number of IP participants, but so what. Either way, we are here now. The article is better than many I've seen. It cites sources, attempts NPOV, and is anything but a stub. I don't see any reason for deletion. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:22, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><s><b>Delete</b> per nom. Also question POV, and unverified nature of most of the statements in the article. Note that links all go to pro-strike sites. Yes, this was a local news story, but there's strikes every year in all sectors, and there's no assertion this strike is any different from any other.

<li><s>If you mean the three external links at the bottom, you should note that one link was to UNICCO's website (the anti-strike one) and two links were to separately organized pro-labor websites (one by faculty, another by students). This disproves your claim that "all" links go to pro-strike sites. If you mean the links embedded throughout the article, you should then note that many links go to UM administration responses (and these were anti-strike from beginning to end). I would like to assume good faith, but it would be great if it felt like you had read the article more closely. Also, it's not clear what you mean by the "unverified" "nature" of most of the statements... which ones? On a positive note: why does this strike have to be "different from any other" in order to merit an article? What are your criteria for determining this difference? Last note: this was more than a local event. It drew national attention and the involvement of Jonathan Edwards, Charles Steele, and others. This strike marked the SEIU's first establishment of a union in a historically anti-union city, and this has implications for new immigrants to the U.S. And this is why there was so much national attention. But anyone who's read the article knows this. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversitytruth_ac59.html" title="User:Universitytruth">Universitytruth</a> 12:13, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</s></li>
<li><s>I mean the three external links, of which the <i>one</i> anti-strike link goes to a passworded site which cannot be accessed by outsiders.

<li><s>Dear Tychocat, the UNICCO link was fully functional from the beginning of this article's creation until the strike settlement. Once the strike was settled, UNICCO decided to 'decomission' its site and password protect it. Surely, you aren't blaming the wikipedia editors for that, are you? Trust me, I wish they had left their site open. Meanwhile, feel free to tag statements you believe require citation.

<p><s><b>Strong Keep</b> This was a notable event that affected not just UM, but the entire city of Miami. UNICCO workers did not only strike at the University, but also at <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami_International_Airport_7437.html" title="Miami International Airport">MIA</a> and at other locations that they were contracted in the city (in the best of my knowledge). It also appears to be a bad faith nomination from the discussion (I was unaware that the article had been put up for deletion already). <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 22:09, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</s></p>
<p><s><b>Keep:</b> This was a historical strike which is likely to affect all labor in South Florida and university labor nationwide. If it's any indication, the significance of this strike is proven by the continuing persecution of the student activists involved, and the fact that various books and articles on it are in progress. 74.225.65.143 03:08, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</s></p>
<p><s><b>Keep:</b> This was a historic moment in South Florida. The entry on it in Wikipedia is an important document that should be preserved. 74.225.65.143 04:23, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</s></p>
<p><s><b>Strong Keep</b> This strike was a model for cooperation among "contract workers" at the university, who were not employed by the university but by a contractor, faculty members who were employees of the university but without affiliation with any union, and students, who did not have any direct ties either to the contract workers or unions other than enjoying the services of the workers. The faculty and the students supported the strike because they recognized the need for corrective action based on the facts as already stated in this Wikipedia article. This strike with dramatic expressions of support by sympathizers, including a long hunger strike that led to hospitalizations, considerable press coverage that showed a highly visible strikers' camp site at the edge of campus along a major thoroughfare, was possibly the first of its kind for social action in decades and may encourage other unfairly treated groups of workers to seek corrective action for their grievances. The strike at the UM in 2006 is likely to become a major milestone in the reactivation of the union movement in the USA. 70.149.46.43 06:06, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</s></p>
<p><s><b>Keep:</b> The strike had a significant effect on thousands of people within and without the university community - not only the workers, but all the students who had their daily routines disrupted by demonstrations, all the faculty who had to make choices about whether to keep classes on campus, all the parents who were concerned about the credibility of a university that so resolutely fought to not treat its janitors with humanity, or who were just concerned about the strike's and its associated events' effects on their kids' educations - this strike mattered to many, many people. The question of whether or not it has any national or global significance does not make it worthy of deletion. Personally, I feel that it does have something of a national importance, since the allegiance of college and university students and faculty with the low wage workes on their campuses to gain better treatment for the latter seems to be a growing trend, of which the UMiami campaign as exemplary. --65.60.141.115 08:39, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</s></p>
<p><s><b>Keep:</b> In addition to its significance nationwide and worldwide for the labor movement in general [google it and you will see press references in many nations and many languages] and for the unusual coalition of community, student, and faculty groups, the strength of a primarily immigrant workforce in a predominantly antilabor city is remarkable -- reminiscent of Cesar Chavez and the farm labor movement involving migrant workers. This strike will become one of the landmarks of a revitalized labor movement revolving around a largely Hispanic workforce that has come to dominate the lowest paid jobs and most exploited class in many urban settings. Hence this article will be a landmark reference point. 65.13.41.73 11:17, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</s></p>
<p><s><b>Strong Keep:</b> Add your reasons here. Tuvulu 13:34, 23 June 2006 (UTC) This event was not only significant for all of South Florida including Miami, one of the largest cities in the US with the greatest disparity of wealth and non-wealth, but was also impactful throughout the US. The fact that 100% of these downtrodden workers were of color with the majority immigrants is very impressive. They stood up to one of the richest universities in the country with strong national political ties and were triumphant. This strike was reported on not only internationally but in national papers such as the Washington Post and the New York Times. It's simply not possible to sweep such an event under the rug.</s></p>

(Edit conflict) On further reconsideration, <b>Keep:</b>. Although "Improper reason for deletion" in the previous AfD is false and not a reason to keep, the previous AfD appears to have been properly closed after all, as votes with actual reasons ran 4-1 or 4-2 for keep. That being said, it needs a POV tag. (I'll add one.) It seems clear there's enough material here for an article, and it's not inherently biased, so any dispute about the article should no longer be in an AfD. (I almost deleted Tuvulu's comment, which probably would have been a good thing for the article. If <b>any</b> of that were in the article, and likely to remain, I'd have to go back to <i>delete</i>, as strong evidence the article was inherently biased. I would suggest that he/she clean out his/her comments.) — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 13:46, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</s></p>
<p><s><b>Strong Keep:</b> This article documents a major event that impacted South Florida tremendously. It was more than just a minor strike, it was the beginning of a chain reaction that raised the awareness of workers' rights not only in the University of Miami community, but also throughout the nation as the story circulated the national news wires. The article carries enough detail and information to be kept online for the education of others, and should not be deleted.Ju-ju 16:55, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</s></p>
<p><s><b>Strong Keep:</b> The argument for deletion is incorrect and biased as <a href="../../../d/s/j/User%7EDSJ2_1ec3.html" title="User:DSJ2">DSJ2</a> stated it was a run-of-the-mill strike. If you ask anyone from any side of the issue surrounding this janitor's strike, it was very unique in its form, scope, and other aspects. For one, unions do not exist for property service workers in Right To Work states very often, and certainly not in Florida. THis alone makes it history worthy, and also Wikipedia worthy. --Justiciaparatodos 18:26, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</s></p>
<p><s><b>Strong Keep:</b> The claim that this is a run-of-the-mill strike is ludicrous. (Do we have those any more?) This was the make-or-break strike for the SEIU in South Florida, or more likely the whole state. The result is being used to leverage work actions in several other local universities and at least one local mall also. The way it was settled -- having a card-check ballot with a 60% super-majority requirement -- is also an important departure.

<p>Another non-notable crackpot science-writer, associated with the same ultra-nationalist Greek-supremacy "grecoreport"/"Davlos" website/journal as the recently deleted <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Elias_Tsatsomoiros_4342.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Elias Tsatsomoiros">Elias Tsatsomoiros</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Joseph_E._Yahuda_e132.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joseph E. Yahuda">Joseph E. Yahuda</a>. Effectively unsourced, as the only fact reported about this author in the article is taken from the notorious grecoreport website, which is known to be extremely unreliable about quotes. Even if it was verified, that fact (a claim published by Spandagos about <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copernicus.html" title="Copernicus">Copernicus</a>) should go in the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copernicus.html" title="Copernicus">Copernicus</a> article and wouldn't make Spandagos himself notable. Another "achievement" of Spandagos seems to be that in 1997 he claimed to have discovered a lost work of ancient Greek philosopher <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diogenes_Apolloniates_a715.html" title="Diogenes Apolloniates">Diogenes Apolloniates</a> (<a href="http://omega.cohums.ohio-state.edu/mailing_lists/CLA-L/Older/log97/9708c/9708c.5.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://omega.cohums.ohio-state.edu/mailing_lists/CLA-L/Older/log97/9708c/9708c.5.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>). If true, this would have caused an earthquake in classical scholarship, but ever since, nobody except Spandagos seems to have seen the document and no other medium except Daulos and some gullible newspaper have ever published anything about it. A charlatan, apparently. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 16:14, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Very well, <b>Delete</b>. However, I maintain that since it is not one of the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSDs</a>, it ought to be. Information put on the encyclopedia specifically to deceive the reader should be kept for as short a time as is humanly possible. Material that compromises Wikipedia's integrity is harmful to the project as a whole, and in my opinion, speedy deletion should most certainly be applicable to hoaxes. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 12:46, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Neutral.</b></s> <b>Keep, as a result of AYArktos' edits.</b> The case may be notable both for the court case and for the issue about the lack of government assistance given, but if so, it really does need to be rewritten to focus on those things rather than in a Wikinews-like description of the alleged crime itself, which is not particularly notable. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 10:54, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I have worked on it some more. I really think this article should be about the court case and not the person. Firstly there is a matter of respect for living people. Secondly, he isn't notable, the case is. The article probably should be renamed. I have two different citations for the case though&#160;:-( Would some of Wikipedian law students like to have a go at it when they have finished their exams? There really isn't much yet on Fijian law, and no case law articles on Wikipedia that I found.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 23:16, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>.This article is not a recreation of deleted material. No record exists of the deleted article so there is no proof to support this assertion. All calls for deletion of this article must direct criticism solely towards the content of the article. I believe this is only fair. Also, questioning the notability of artistic output is subjective and the above comment that "anyone... can do that" is not only false but constitutes an unfair attack. Again, one can look to the press release for Bapudi Films' "Rise and Fall of Irvine Meadow West" for a verifiable and reliable source. Another source is the OC Register, a major newspaper in Southern California, which discussed a screening held at the University of California.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Jll, wow, that has to be one of <i>the</i> most ignorant things I have ever read. Art can't be notable unless it gets an award or sells millions of copies? The Mona Lisa didn't win a single award, I guess thats crap. Sex pistols barely sold anything in their heyday, I assume they posed no notable mark in musical history. Did you know Kurosawa never won an Oscar? I guess he was just another hack with a camera, right? Anyone can make a film or <i>some music</i>? Have you ever tried? Ever filmed something for more than 30 minutes with a crew? Ever composed an entire album?. I'd like to see you come up with a <a href="http://bapudi.com/cinema.php" class="external text" title="http://bapudi.com/cinema.php" rel="nofollow">handful of movies</a>, much less <a href="http://www.bapudi.com/music.php" class="external text" title="http://www.bapudi.com/music.php" rel="nofollow">multiple albums</a>. Its not easy, and for you to belittle ANY artistic work is moronic and small minded. <i>local papers are full of inconsequential local stories.</i> Uhm, excuse me, WHAT? First of all the OC Register has a circulation of over 350,000, so its not just some local paper. Second, what <i>you</i> might find inconsequential may be life changing for others (did you even bother to read the news article?). You already made up your mind about this article, and that within itself should disbar you from paritipating in this process. -Japhar8181

<li>Please don't call me moronic and small-minded - it is against Wikipedia policy to make <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attacks</a>. I cited two examples (that's why I wrote <i>for example</i>) of things that indicate that Wikipedia should have an article on the artist concerned - I could have provided a much longer list - e.g. a piece of work known to many people (Mona Lisa), having heavily influenced many other figures in their professions and built up a large following (Sex Pistols and Akira Kurosawa). But I don't see any evidence that these apply to Bapudi either. If you have such evidence then present it. If it is credible then I will certainly reverse my opinion. Should the criteria for a Wikipedia article be that someone has simply managed to make a film or an album? There must be tens or hundreds of thousands of people who have done this. The Orange County Register is a local paper serving Orange County. The story appears to be inconsequential because there don't seem to be any follow up stories, and the national or international press didn't pick it up either. <a href="../../../j/l/l/User%7EJll_a192.html" title="User:Jll">Jll</a> 22:46, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The notability guidelines are a way for an average Wikipedian to determine if an article's subject is or isn't appropriate to have an article about. The notability guidelines for biographies, companies, etc. are to prevent every interested party, no matter how tiny, from deciding to create an article about themselves. Without notability guidelines in place, the encyclopedia would be overflowing with articles about garage bands, <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">things that people made up in school one day</a>, etc. The verifiability guidelines also go a long way in helping in this respect. It's important to remember that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and should thus be held to strong encyclopedic standards. It's not paper, either, but that just means that the signal-to-noise ratio can climb to unsurpassed levels, as is evidenced by the new pages watch. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 12:35, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I can speak to the issue of the grant from the California Council for the Humanities (NOT the State of California, as someone erroneously stated -- has anyone actually followed and read the link??). I produced the film in question, and wrote the grant proposal. The receiver for the grant was Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, as Bapudi is not a non-profit organization (501c.3) and thus cannot receive grant funds. However, the film was produced under the aegis of Bapudi. I would be happy to provide a copy of the film, as well as copies of any relevant grant paperwork to prove that this is the case. The California Council for the Humanities is a major organization, and I believe their support of a film that bears the Bapudi name should be sufficient to establish notability. The film has also been mentioned in the Orange County Register, rated 32 in a list of the top 100 daily newspapers. I cannot speak on the history of this wikipedia entry, as I have not been following it closely, but as the entry stands now, it is accurate and correct. As I peruse the article history, I come to believe that some of the vitriol directed toward this entry is due to the flippant tone in which the original article was written.

<li><b>Comment</b>.The fact Bapudi is not explicitly mentioned on the California Council for the Humanities (CCH) webpage is an error of omission. The CCH entry for the film simply makes no mention of the production organization behind the film. However, the webpage www.trailerparkfilm.com clearly establishes that the film is produced under Bapudi's aegis (see the links near the bottom of the page). I can use the grant paperwork to prove that the film was in fact awarded a grant. Thus, although the word "Bapudi" is not mentioned on the California Council for the Humanities webpage, the link between the two organizations is factual and verifiable. Some effort should be made on the part of Wikipedia admins to verify this information with me before considering deletion.Styliztic 06:05, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. That Bapudi has been funded or credited by the CCH is not necessarily the issue at question here. The issue is that there has been no evidence presented that Bapudi has notability sufficient to guarantee it a place in the encyclopedia, which neither your, nor the other above keep votes bothers to address. One instance of an example that might mark an organization as notable (according to our <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">guidelines</a> is being the subject of multiple nontrivial organizations, or being part of mainstream cultural thought, or having a major effect on the intellectual world in which it resides, none of which any evidence has been presented that Bapudi has done. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 12:41, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>.I believe the fact that we have been funded by the CCH does make us notable. The notability guidelines make it clear that notability is not the same as fame, but is more related to importance. I believe that being credited and funded by a major humanities granting organization (CCH is part of the NEA) qualifies us as important and therefore notable. The notability guidelines also state that notability is not a rigid wikipedia criterion, but a guideline, and that the concept is "somewhat contentious." Therefore, I must contend that Bapudi is notable because of its association with other notable organizations. I'll write more on this later, I don't have time at the moment. Just let me make it clear that I AM addressing the issue of notability -- our position as an artist with an NEA grant makes us notable.Styliztic 19:58, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>.I missed Japhar's last comment. I was wrong, notability is not a wikipedia guideline. Thank you for the correction, Japhar. This strengthens Bapudi's case for legitimacy within Wikipedia, unless we are to be deleted on the basis of an essay. We are a legitimate entity which has been recognized by an affiliate of the NEA. We exist for positive aesthetic and social reasons. What does our entry in the Wikipedia harm? Is there some danger that people looking up Bapudius, and accidentally finding Bapudi? Is the four kilobytes of data that our entry comprises going to fill Wikipedia's servers? This notability complaint sounds like an easy excuse for erasing an aesthetic which certain people find distasteful.Styliztic 05:35, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Bapudi has been shown to be plenty notable. To anyone who has checked out some of the reference links, Bapudi is obviously not a farce. I find more value in Wikipedia's Arguments Against Deleting Articles For Non-Notability (found in the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability guidelines</a>) than I do in the Arguments For Deletion. Topics concerning the deletion of valid content, the lack of subjective criteria, and the benefits of even obscure content are especially important. I understand the urge to prevent pollution. This Bapudi page is not pollution; it's clearly not an article some kid wrote about his dog. The internet is evolving the process of information exchange. I vote to support it, instead of being afraid of it. I vote to KEEP this article. Netwait 23:53, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Kuzaar's last post says, "....the voters who have expressed a desire to keep the article have provided no verifiable evidence that it, as an aesthetic, exists." Kuzaar, please explain to me how Bapudi could receive a grant from an affiliate of the NEA if it doesn't exist? I can submit clear and convincing evidence to prove that a) Bapudi has produced a film called "The Rise and Fall of Irvine Meadows West" and that b) the California Council for the Humanities awarded that film a $5000 grant. Additionally I can prove that Art Center College of Design, one of the most prestigious design schools in the world (www.artcenter.edu) granted the film an additional $5000. Ask me, and I will submit our grant paperwork for review. So I ask again: Kuzaar, by what logic can you claim Bapudi's nonexistence? If you can submit a reasoned argument by which you show that a non-existent organization can receive a grant from the CCH, I will withdraw from this argument immediately and accept the deletion of this entry with humility. Otherwise, I do not believe you are participating in the consensus-building process in good faith. You are not participating in an exchange of ideas; you are merely stating the same nonsensical argument over and over: that Bapudi does not exist. A reasonable argument for deletion would be that our association with the CCH is not enough to establish our notability; the argument that Bapudi does not exist is unreasonable, as there is clear and convincing evidence that it does. Even if you were to argue that a CCH grant is insufficient to establish notability, deletion is hardly a lead pipe cinch. Bapudi's entry meets the three Wikipedia standards for inclusion: it is verifiable (the physical existence of the film and its grants), it is not independent research (or in fact research at all), and the entry is written with a neutral point of view. I would like to point out to all administrators that, on the basis of Wikipedia's rules and guidelines, there is NOT a consensus about the removal of this article. The article's critics have failed to show that the article violates Wikipedia's rules, and have not directly addressed our claim that recognition from an NEA affiliate is sufficient to establish notability.Styliztic 02:48, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have yet to see a verifiable source that names Bapudi the recipient of any grant. On looking at each and every one of the links provided in the article, Bapudi is only mentioned in two, and that is as a musical artist. You have persistently failed to provide any evidence for Bapudi's existence (except possibly as a music artist?), much less notability within its field. Further, the sock/meatpuppet flood that has persistently plagued this AFD as evidenced by each of the users that have voted keep (I point out that you yourself have less than 10 edits, all to this AFD) is outstandingly suspicious. I remind you that Articles for Deletion are not a vote, but a discussion in which Wikipedia editors attempt to decide what should be done about a marginal article. Lastly, I want to bring up one more point. You have insisted multiple times that the film, a recipient of a grant, is associated with Bapudi. I have yet to see any evidence of that, either. If you can link me to some third-party, verifiable information regarding my concerns, and if the flood of newly-registered users cools down a bit, I would feel less strongly about the deletion of this article. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 03:18, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> First off, I welcome user Netwait. Howdy to ya. I hope you become a contributive editor of Wikipedia. Secondly, what happened to the "famed bapudian canon" that this article was originally created off of as a source? Incidentially, what is the name of that local community college that's being worked with? Who's the contact there? You know, when I first voted, I thought this article was a farce, a joke worthy of speedy deletion. But, I saw efforts being made to change it. It's not even the same article, really. It's changed meanings and interpretations several times. And now... I still think that something is fishy. First edits being made here, of all places? It's odd. I've been trying to avoid thinking sockpuppet all this time, trying to assume good faith, but, this just doesn't sit right with me. I'd like to take this opportunity to cite UrbanDictionary.com. "Bapudi is the crystallized consciousness of Hegelian Mind, embodied through the creative excretions of an underground collective with operatives all over the United States. Privately funded, Bapudi represents one of the last schools of independent thought and action not yet assimilated into True Being. Inchoate and ever-flowing, Bapudi will knock your boots off. Bapudi.com is the official homepage to Bapudi activities, gatherings, and happenings this side of the Peiking Delta." The Wikipedia page links to Bapudi.com. While this is not authoritative, conclusive, or really reputable, it in my mind contributes to the many flaws that make this faceitious house of cards topple. My original vote stands and that's my final answer. Thank you. <a href="../../../j/j/j/User%7EJJJJust_79de.html" title="User:JJJJust">JJJJust</a> 03:26, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> The name of the community college is Saddleback Community College. You can contact Charlie Myers, the film professor, at 949-582-4209 or cmyers7@saddleback.cc.ca.us. We also produced "The Rise and Fall of Irvine Meadows West" with the Art Center College of Design. You can contact my professor Gabor Kalman (a renowned documentary filmmaker -- see <a href="http://architettura.supereva.com/image/festival/2000/en/works/2000160.htm" class="external free" title="http://architettura.supereva.com/image/festival/2000/en/works/2000160.htm" rel="nofollow">http://architettura.supereva.com/image/festival/2000/en/works/2000160.htm</a>) at 213-200-8179 or gkalman@cinema.usc.edu. Incidentally, we won three separate awards at the Saddleback College Film Festivals in 2003, 2004 and 2005. You are welcome to ask Charlie Myers about that. I don't see how my inexperience as a wikipedia editor or a weird quote on the urban dictionary (of which I was unaware) invalidates our argument. I also don't see how reasoned arguments based on the wikipedia rules and guidelines -- which we have been carefully studying -- constitutes "muddying the waters".

<li><b>Comment</b>. Check the talk page of the AFD, please, this page is more than 30kb long.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Again, I think we need to involve an admin. Kuzaar has taken this personally and he his shown his bias multiple times. He has deliberatly misinterpreted wikipedia by saying that notability is a guideline, when in fact it is neither a guideline or a policy (he has yet to apoglogize for his error). He has used personal offences against us (please see the <i>The Way of Bapudi</i> incident). And now he claims that Bapudi is <i>pitiful</i>? (Kuzaar, can I say that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Kuzaar&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Kuzaar&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">you</a> are pitiful, using your own metric?). As for the claim of sockpuppetry, again I am insulted. I personally know both GoDelfin and Styliztic, however I'll admit I do not know NetWait. Next time look at our ips and you'll see that we are all in quite different locations. For these offenses I would like to formally request that an admin review this thread as you seem to have taken matters personally.

As to sockpuppets, that you personally know them is worrying, as asking other people to rally to a cause is a variety of sockpuppetry called "Meatpuppetry", or using others to proxy your vote. I am fully in favor of an admin having a look at this AFD, as I am entirely confident of how I have represented policy and pointing out the article's present violation of the rules as outlined at Wikipedia's policy on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 16:19, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And one last thing, regarding Sockpuppets. The reason I am led to suspect unscrupulous activity is this: Looking at the editors who are arguing to keep on this AFD, I notice that all of them have exclusively edited the article, the article's talk page, or in most cases, this AFD. For many, editing the AFD to talk about how Bapudi's article should be kept is their first action, which is something I nearly always regard as suspicious. That disinterested third party editors somehow gain knowledge of Wikipedia's regulations and processes, and come to talk about it in this AFD, of all places, is not only suspect but an almost irreparable blow to my attempts to assume good faith in this AFD. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 16:27, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So which puppet are we? A meat puppet or a sock puppet? If you're going to be contentious then make your suspicions official and investigate the matter. Otherwise your attacks are just slanderous. And you have yet to correct yourself when you posted multiple links entitled <i>guidelines</i> that pointed to the notability <i>essay</i>, when in fact, the very essay clearly states it is NOT to be used as a guideline, much less policy. And despite your numerous attacks using it as a guidline you've changed your argument.

<li><b>Comment</b>. You are making an ad hominem attack, Kuzaar. Why should our editing status matter more than the evidence we present and the arguments we make? You have repeatedly ignored my questions. You have not looked at the sources I offer. This process is deperate need of an audit. You write, "That disinterested third party editors somehow gain knowledge of Wikipedia's regulations and processes, and come to talk about it in this AFD, of all places, is not only suspect but an almost irreparable blow to my attempts to assume good faith in this AFD."

<dd>Also, Kuzaar has yet to address any of my arguments. I have offered concrete evidence (a 40 minute film and grant paperwork) of verifiability, and he seems to have no interest in even looking at it. How can you continue to claim that we have no third party sources when you refuse to look? The CCH webpage clearly lists "The Rise and Fall of Irvine Meadows West" as a grant recipient (<a href="http://www.calhum.org/programs/story_rise_fall.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.calhum.org/programs/story_rise_fall.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.calhum.org/programs/story_rise_fall.htm</a>) and lists my name as the project director. The film's website (www.trailerparkfilm.com) has clear reference to Bapudi Films (see the bottom of the page). At least look at the sources we present! If you refuse to even consider the sources or our arguments, how can you claim to be participating in the AfD process in good faith? For the record, your issues with the article are unsubstantiated. The article clearly explains the nature of the subject: "Bapudi is an identity given to creative works that have included filmmaking and electronic music."

<li><b>Response</b>: Kuzaar, I will answer your questions one by one. 1) "What are you referring to when you say Bapudi" Bapudi is an organization that produces music and films. It states this in the entry. 2) "What verifiable evidence that you have that Bapudi exists?" Our film has been awarded a grant by the CCH. Here is the web URL: <a href="http://www.calhum.org/programs/story_rise_fall.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.calhum.org/programs/story_rise_fall.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.calhum.org/programs/story_rise_fall.htm</a>. The CCH website does not mention Bapudi Films, but I have emailed them to ammend our entry. It does mention my name (Robert McLendon), and I am the director and manager of Bapudi Films. If you wish, we can put a big banner of the film's website that says "Produced by Bapudi Films". Would that clear things up for you? 3) The Search Engine Test page says: "Q. What is the minimum number of matches you should see if a term is not made up? (3? 27? 81?) A. Perhaps a few hundred, but this depends on several things:" We have more than a few hundred. Also, the page makes it clear that the search engine test is subjective, and that entries with as few as 15 hits have been accepted, and that, "some claim that this undermines the validity of the Google test in its entirety. The Google test has always been and very likely always will remain an extremely inconsistent tool, which does not measure notability. It is not and should never be considered definitive." 4) I can't speak to the nonsense that had been on the page. I didn't post the original entry, nor ask for it to be posted. I only came into this when I learned that the entry made mention of my film and my production company. As far as being credited on a film, I CAN SEND YOU A COPY OF THE FILM.

<dd>I apologize if the AFD process is any more protracted than it has to be. Ordinarily it is closed after five days, but there is currently a backlog. Here is my response, as copied from the talk section, to the above users: In light of the new clarity that your answers have brought to the situation, your organization does not pass inclusion guidelines as set out in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> (regarding the musical aspect of Bapudi, or the <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> proposed guideline.

<li>I would like to offer my own view of the history of the band. Rosemary's Babies. I personally knew all he members. Yes one memeber did go on to do some notable work with Danzig (Glen Anzalone from Lodi NJ) Eric Stellman. AKA Eri Von. The band was tight, exceptional passionate, very fast, and had a great deal to say about important relevant topics that still apply more than 23 years after I saw the last show. I should know my best friend was Lead vocalist. JR. I wouldn't want to see the particular entry removed. While the information could have been a little more in detail it is quite precise. I could write quite a bit more here but I will leave that open for now. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.116.164.37 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.116.164.37_1b32.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.116.164.37">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A lot of electrons are spilled at AfDs about whether or not a topic is real or notable or important. While one would think they were based on their use, there is no policy regarding notability or importance, just guidelines and suggestions. The real question ought to be: "<i>is it encyclopedic?</i>" Does this article provide understanding of the topic at hand so as to its meaning and how it relates to the broader field of knowledge of which it forms part? In pondering this, I read the entry for <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>. I know that's not a policy either, but it certainly provides some guidance.

<dd><b>Comment</b> (1) This is <i>not a vote</i>. No good comes from calling it a vote when it isn't. This is a discussion, designed to see what the community consensus on the future of the article is. Votes are unwelcome in such a discussion. In fact, <i>votes</i> are likely to be discounted by the closing admin. (2) It is not common for nominators to "vote". It has been uncommon for a while now for nominators to express <i>their opinion</i> outside of their nomination text. And no nominator has "voted" since we abolished voting last year and introduced this consensus method.

<li><b>Comment</b> Woah Woah. I object to this 'spamming' thing. Can I just give you a run down with what I did? I’m a member of Skywards and have an interest in the whole Emirates/Sri Lankan tie. I noticed a few weeks ago that there was no entry for Skywards. I noticed there was entries for alliances such as SkyTeam and oneworld and although Skywards isn't really an alliance. It is an agreement to collect miles via both airlines as they both have an equal part in Skywards. I also thought I knew quite a bit about the frequent flyer program so I could write a fairly decent article. The Skywards destinations was simply meant in the same way SkyTeam has a page of where their member airlines fly to, I created a page for where the members of Skywards flies to. I wasn’t trying to be malicious. In response to this ‘spamming’ thing. I didn’t mean to ‘spam’. It wasn’t pointless vandalism across random entries. I only did around 5 entries where information on alliances had already been brought up. I put a 2 sentence paragraph informing that flyers could earn miles with Skywards as well. It wasn’t meant to be malicious or Spam. I’m just trying to create a more detailed entry. -<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolmark18_a409.html" title="User:Coolmark18">User:Coolmark18</a>00:01, 21 June 2006 (BST)</li>

<p>Yes, this entry should be deleted. The only argument I could see is for indirect inclusion if it were mentioned <b>in passing</b> in a single article or stub discussing university and junior college local-access TV programming, with a link perhaps to the NTTV article. I live in Denton and have seen the show and although it's not my cup of tea, the work ethic of the producers, somewhat ironically, is notable insofar as they keep cranking out content. Still: there are <b>many, many thousands</b> of local-access tv programs being produced all over the country, and most do not merit their own entry. Should every program aired by a local television station in the US get a wiki entry? It has nothing to do with the point(s) of view expressed or production values, but the questions of</p>
<p>1.site bloat and ensuring that the finite,nonprofit resources of wikipedia are not squandered on ephemera, and</p>

<li><b>Commment</b>. I tried to find out what popularity the blog at <a href="http://garfreed.blogspot.com" class="external free" title="http://garfreed.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://garfreed.blogspot.com</a> has, but Alexa aggregates all the pages at blogspot.com rather than listing individual blogs separately. Is there some other way to measure the significance or readership of the site? I'm raising these points because I think a well-read or influential blogger can be notable and I suspect that Gary Freedman might be. See <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_bloggers_9ef6.html" title="Category:American bloggers">Category:American bloggers</a> <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> 22:56, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Commment</b> I always think a good rule of thumb is the number of comments that a blogger gets - notable bloggers tend to get 100s of comments on each of their entries. The best I can find for Gary is 15 comments on one of his entries and if you look those seem to be generated by spamming other blogs. On the actual "novel" he produced, there are only 4 comments - 1 is from him, 2 says "please stop spamming other blogs and the last says "don't get it. What's criteria or methodology have you used to suggest to you that he might be notable? --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 23:02, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for bearing with me. I revised the entry again to state expressly that the blog is a "notable modern example of the medieval Hebrew literary device known as melitzah." The blog is notable not because it is well known, it is notable as one of the few axamples of an existing literary device.--Garyfreedman 18:49, 22 June 2006 (UTC)--<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGaryfreedman_8ad4.html" title="User:Garyfreedman">Garyfreedman</a> 19:12, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand.

<li>Please provide sources to back up these claims. Particularly the one that states Zortam, which was releaed in 2002, was "developed way before iTunes", which was released in 2001.

It might be that download numbers at download.com or tucows.com can be fudged for short time, but my opinion is that they are pretty much real.

<p>A pointless, 38kb-long list on movie clichés. It is biased (who defines what is a cliché and what is not?), unverifiable (how do you verify a cliché?) and is the kind of list that will just keep growing without serving anything inside Wikipedia (it is neither a navigational aid nor a development mechanism, it just exists for its own sake.) <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 22:41, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I suppose I lean towards keeping if this gets a little more verifiability as much of it appears to be true and recognised, but perhaps a better solution is to simply have a separate page for each genre, and have this as an index page with a brief explanation (or merge into <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clich%C3%A9.html" title="Cliché">cliché</a>. Some already do have their own lists (e.g. action). I don't think its a bad idea to have this information in some form. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">Jammo (SM247)</a> 23:24, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>And what is the criteria for deciding what goes on the list? Who decides what given recurrence is a cliché? <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 23:29, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Citing well-known movies and well-known parodies is a start. I can't give another solid air-tight reason other than my above to keep, but instinctive synthesis tells me this should be kept in some form. It isn't my job to work out such criteria, but I am sure somebody can do a good job. Difficulty is not a reason to delete. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">Jammo (SM247)</a> 00:42, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not saying it is <i>difficult</i>, I'm saying it's <i>impossible</i>. Let's take a random entry. For instance, under "Disaster movies", one reads: "The first victims of the disaster include a young couple, and usually when they're having sex." Now, how can we verify that it is a cliché? <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clich%C3%A9.html" title="Cliché">The cliché article itself</a> defines it as "a phrase, expression, or idea that has been overused to the point of losing its intended force or novelty, especially when at some time it was considered distinctively forceful or novel." So, in order to prove that this is a cliché, the page should prove that it is an idea that has been overused. How can you prove that? By reviewing all the disaster movies ever made? By making a sample of them? And then how do you make such a sample? Someone else could always argue that this idea has been used a lot of times, but has not been <i>overused</i>. This list is simply not verifiable. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 00:54, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, this is just a list of loosely associated topics, very much like a list of aphorisms, though actually less useful.

<li><b>Delete</b> original research, unverifiable POV as to what a cliche is.

<li><b>keep</b> A cliche is something familiar through re-use or reproduction in one genre, or transposed from one genre to another - which means that far from being unverifiable, this list is badly incomplete, and will remain so for the forseeable future. Simply because someone does not understand a visual reference or narrative cliche, does not mean that it is not so - this arguement is the equivalent of sticking one's head in the sand. A list of cliches is invaluable, as apart from identifying repeating memes in fiction, it also helps paint a picture of what is acceptable as internal logic within certain genres of writing/film-making, etcetera. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.92.171.123 (<a href="../../../8/4/2E/User_talk%7E84.92.171.123.html" title="User talk:84.92.171.123">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.92.171.123_ef86.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.92.171.123">contribs</a>).</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_film_clich%C3%A9s_by_genre&amp;diff=60024901&amp;oldid=59971285" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_film_clich%C3%A9s_by_genre&amp;diff=60024901&amp;oldid=59971285" rel="nofollow">[30]</a></li>

<li>I have heard the Lad Laika name mentioned on the college station here (KFSR, Fresno), but I do not know if it was "Guillotine" that they played. The website for Decovo says that it is launching this month. If it does not launch by the start of May, then this article should be deleted, probably. That website has been actively advertising for student media contributions on my campus, so I do not think they are vaporous. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.54.72.155 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.54.72.155_b96b.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.54.72.155">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<p>Non-notable software company. Although the article mentions that they "<i>won several awards on the then popular web site www.windows95.com</i>" and created an "<i>utility to work with Trader Media Group web sites in 2006</i>", a Google search finds that there are no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that mention this company. There are only 730 hits for <i>jps IT -wikipedia</i>, all of them irrelevant except the first - the company's own website. To top it all, there is nothing on the company's own website other than a single ad image. This is surprising given the company has had 10 years to become famous. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimchi.sg_959a.html" title="User:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi.sg</a> 23:46, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
