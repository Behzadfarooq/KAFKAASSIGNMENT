<p>The result of the debate was that it is broken beyond repair.

Further, I've never even <i>seen</i> an instance where someone so misunderstood the purpose of these discussions as to <b>number</b> the arguments. These are deletion discussions, we are not voting here. In many cases, the numbers are meaningless, and may in fact <i>distort</i> the process. For example, here several accounts whose status is fairly dubious have made recomendations. A late comer, following the advice on the main AfD page to <i>not</i> take part when consensus appears to have formed could be misled by the raw "count" and choose to remain silent.

<li><b>Keep</b>, while it would have been better for another user to have been the initial author, that is not a requirement. Notability and NPOV are requirements. WP:WEB includes as criteria #3 "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." Google news is certainly well known and independent of the creator. I didn't find in my review proof that they were picked up by Google News, but this news.google.com/news?as_q=Israel&amp;svnum=10&amp;as_scoring=r&amp;hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_nsrc=Israel+News+Agency&amp;as_nloc=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_drrb=q&amp;as_qdr=&amp;as_mind=23&amp;as_minm=4&amp;as_maxd=23&amp;as_maxm=5 search for articles from them shows that they are picked up. 02:26, 24 May 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> (<a href="../../../g/r/b/User_talk%7EGRBerry_d7ba.html" title="User talk:GRBerry">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GRBerry_c9d8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GRBerry">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> If we are to judge notability by deeds, being the first Israeli government accredited source of online news in 1995 speaks volumes. To judge by association the hundreds of international media organizations and blogs using the Israel News Agencys materials is substantial. To judge by impact using Alexa.com and Google web / Google news reaching millions world wide the INA appears more than notable on all three accounts.<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnei_0e73.html" title="User:Karnei">Karnei</a> 06:18, 25 May 2006 (UTC)<small><b>Comment:</b>This is user's 6th edit to Wikipedia</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> From what I know about the Internet and Alexa.com "link density" that is the number of links linked to a site boosts its ranking. This translates into that the INA being a "popular" site. One can count the number of links to the INA and the quality of those sites which link to it, i.e. - CNN, Israel Min.

<li><b>Keep</b>, as this is a verifiably notable news agency, sockpuppetry notwithstanding. Any issues with non-neutral point of view should be worked out through the editing process, not deletion. The placement of {{<a href="../../../i/n/u/Template%7EInuse_2e6a.html" title="Template:Inuse">inuse</a>}} also seems premature at this juncture; this renomination was made just two days ago. <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F_6995.html" title="User:Yamaguchi先生">Yamaguchi先生</a>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> a scanned press card is not proof of accreditation. I have several press cards of my own, they are not that difficult to come by, and the image was altered (passport and ID numbers are not visible), who knows how else it may have been tampered with.--<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 14:11, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b> 1. Not sure how objective Woggly can be in this discussion given her and Israelbeach's RfC on one another. 2. A scanned press card or copy thereof is proof of accreditation, as I am also a working journalist in Israel who carries a GPO press card. 3. Not reasonable to request that anyone publishes their passport and or ID numbers on the Internet. Card looks good to me. If in doubt, speak with Danny Seaman, director of the Government Press Office in Jerusalem. 4. Do not ask of others what you would not do yourself. Leyden aka Israelbeach has been honest and transparent in his identity. <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotterseesall_25f6.html" title="User:Potterseesall">Potterseesall</a> 20:24, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't expect anyone to put their passport or ID numbers online, and I wasn't asking for that. I was just pointing out that scanning the card is pointless, and proves nothing. Good proof of accreditation would be a link to a government list of accredited news sources (or indeed, any source that is not simply repeating information from the INA). As for my objectivity, please stop hinting that I may possibly be unreliable. If I have written anything that is not true, come out and say so directly so that I can address your objections point by point. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 21:28, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> but clean up and include coverage of criticisms. The article has generated a great deal of attention but most of the negative comments reinforce my inclination to keep it. It appears to meet minimum standards for inclusion. The article could use some good coverage about disputes regarding the agency's origins, affiliations, reliability, etc.. I would hope that the WP community is able to include such criticism without it turning into mere rants or name-calling. Perhaps that's hoping for too much! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B</a> 23:57, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and assure that the article is up to Wikipedia standards. I've followed this entity for some time for news from Israel, and while they may be just as bad as the rest of the media, they do exist. The level at which they exist should be in the article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am voting to keep this article despite my concerns about the notability of this news agency (no mentions in the New York Times since its founding, one mention ever in the Washington Post), primarily because it is a Google News source.

<li><b>Keep</b> but it needs editing. Cut down on the puffery that's sourced only to the site itself; add the fact of the Alexa ranking to help readers judge the agency's importance. Reasonable people could vote to delete this one, by the way. Accusing "delete" voters of anti-Semitism or censorship is absurd.

<li><b>Delete</b> despite the protests of <i>Israel News Agency</i>, we are not censoring anything. I say delete from Wikipedia as it's hardly notable (I don't in particular find that the INA's "news reports directly from the scenes of the Passover Massacre in Netanya, Israel, the Tel Aviv terror attack on the Dolphanarium, and the 9/11 terror attack in New York" are <i>exclusive</i> to only the INA).

<li>Being listed on Google News is not very difficult and probably not enough to make something "notable" by our standards. The Alexa ranking is low and there are few unique Google hits. No reliable sources are presented for the information in the article. Currently it seems to me that the article doesn't qualify for inclusion, but I'm willing to be convinced if evidence to the contrary is presented. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 21:55, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>How is notability being measured in this case? Are we applying <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, or another standard? Þorgeirsson states that getting listed on Google News is a rather trivial task; how does one accomplish this? For the moment, I am leaning toward <b>keep</b> due to its frequent citation by the press, but am open to discussion. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 00:38, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Just for the record, with regard to issues discussed in the previous AfD, the Israel News Agency is not a government-controlled press agency in Israel, just a private entity, and it is not even the leading press agency in Israel -- that would be Itim which Wikipedia doesn't yet have an article about. The Israel News Agency appears to be a relatively small operation although the Google News connection should be considered a point in its favor. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:22, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The fact that Israel News Agency comes up ranked highly in Google searches might be more significant if its publisher were not a professional search engine optimizer. www.israelnewsagency.com/joelleyden.html Also, I don't know whether Alexa.com is evidence of INA having significant impact, given that INA's Alexa rank is 251,401. --Metropolitan90 13:59, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I draw people's attention to all pages which refer to Joel Leyden where <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> at every twist and turn attempts to discredit Leyden, following in the footsteps of user Woggly. We can also conclude that <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> is a sockpuppet of Woggly and or Danny Wool. Bonnieisrael is transparent. She has revealed her personal details both here in Wikipedia and on Goggle News. Furthermore, she has made direct contact with Danny Wool after being blocked and unblocked by Danny after personal contact. We can suspect anyone of anything. What we must do is deal in fact. Is the Israel News Agency "notable"? One vote was already taken a few months ago with the community saying Keep. I would simply rely on this one page to decide www.alexa.com/data/ds/linksin?q=link:israelnewsagency.com/&amp;url=israelnewsagency.com <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotterseesall_25f6.html" title="User:Potterseesall">Potterseesall</a> (<a href="../../../p/o/t/User_talk%7EPotterseesall_9ca1.html" title="User talk:Potterseesall">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Potterseesall_a3bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Potterseesall">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:For any readers of this debate, please be aware that the opinions of anonymous users and users with very little edits during deletion debates are almost always disregarded unless a very valid point is made. This policy exists for two very valid reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, participants of a deletion debate think it is a vote and so try to gather all of their friends and aquaintences in order to try to influence the debate's result. The outcome of a deletion debate is determined by the opinions of whoever shows up, and so whoever engaged in this practice would be negatively affecting the practice. Secondly, users with very few edits may be accounts of users that have already had their say, trying to make their opinion sound more prevalent than it really is.</p>
<p>For this reason, the opinion of 71.102.46.200 will most certainly be disregarded. It is likely that user is "trolling," trying to evoke reactions and emotions among those that are sensitive to certain issues, and revelling in the chaos that results. Please do not see the actions of one anonymous user as being equivocal of the sentiment of the entire Wikipedian community.</p>
<p>The ban on legal threats on Wikipedia exists for a very good reason as well. During a deletion debate on a famed potter, and an author of scholarly research on <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herman_Melville_9326.html" title="Herman Melville">Herman Melville</a>, the grandson of the subject of the article up for deletion came and reported that he would sue another user for libel, for saying that his grandfather "wasn't notable enough to be in Wikipedia." Lawsuits used as threats in these situations may make other users feel uneasy and inhibit honest, open debate.</p>
<p>As a result of the ban of Israelbeach, assumedly for legal threats, it seems that the user tried to evade the ban and post as another user, in order to still have a voice. While I can see reason behind this, it is still a violation of official Wikipedia policy. Please try to understand actions of administrators blocked you, Israelbeach, if for that reason. I have limited knowledge of discussion that led to the ban, because it appears to me that the user page and the user talk page of their content.</p>
<p>The people that want this article to be deleted aren't anti-Semitic or anti-Israel. They are using Alexa as the standard for a website's notability, but this may be inaccurate because the rating of a site on Alexa is entirely dependant on how many people viewing that website have downloaded an Alexa toolbar, which may have less prevalence in Israel. Maybe the website has a higher viewership in its Hebrew edition. If I wanted to speak my mind with a user account---I really don't feel like getting involved in "wikipolitics"---I'd vote to keep this article, and the article on Joel Leyden.</p>
<p>As for WP:OFFICE, and an example of United States censorship that may be affecting Wikipedia, if one article had information about two author publishing untrue allegations against a subject, this may be considered republishing libel in California and Europe, and so Wikipedia would have to take that article and its entire edit history down to prevent legal action, even if the information that those allegations were made was in itself true.</p>
<p>No matter where Wikipedia's servers are, there may be statutes prohibiting its free expression. If they were based in Canada, Wikimedia could not legally publish election results before elections are over. Canadians were advised when reading the article on their parliamentary elections that reading this article may not be legal in their country. You may have heard that Wikimedia was sued in Germany for containing the first and last name of a child inventor and hacker that had developed a voice-encrypted public phone. Luckily it had won that lawsuit.</p>
<p>It may surprise you to learn that the Japanese Wikipedia complies with both statutes in the United States of America, where the servers are hosted, and in Japan, where most of their userbase is. They cannot publish personal information about certain figures in the national media that would be considered public figures in the United States. A Japanese teenager decided to go to Iraq---to see "what was happening over there"---and he was beheaded in a video released by his kidnappers. The English Wikipedia on him has his first and last name. The Japanese Wikipedia article's title, as I remember it, translated as something like "17 year old Japanese death in Iraq." That could be censorship right there, and in all of these cases, it is not Wikipedia's fault. I hope Joel Leyden can come to an understand the position of the management of Wikipedia and their viewpoint. 65.244.171.35 02:12, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>In response to: <i>Maybe the website has a higher viewership in its Hebrew edition.</i> I'd like to point out that the website <b>does not have</b> a Hebrew edition. I have worked as a journalist in Israel and never heard of this website before encountering it here, nor has my husband who is a news-junkie and regularly checks some offbeat alternative news-sources as well as monitoring the mainstream press. It does not have an entry on the Hebrew wikipedia. And the few "articles" I have read have either been copied from other sources, or rather poorly written (poor style, poor spelling, repetition, faulty logic). Joel Leyden, the so called editor in chief, is also the main writer, and often also the subject of his own articles. He often quotes his own articles to support himself. He reports to no one but himself. I consider this terrible journalism. You don't have to take my word on any of this: browse and see for yourself. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 14:23, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Please also take note of Wikipedia's policy on original research and autobiographies. When someone creates an article on himself or something he is personally affiliated with, bias may unconsciously seep into the article's content. If not, unconfirmed knowledge may slip into the article's content, such as the subject's birth year. Because the subject's birth year was only known to the author of the subject before it was put into the Wikipedia article, it can't be cross-checked against any other independent media publication. Because of tendencies such as these, Wikipedia takes a special approach to pages where editors may be personally involved. Also, sometimes subjects may overestimate their notability---not at all that I think that's the case here. Regardless, it may lead to dispute, controversy, accusations of creating a "vanity page," and all-out nuclear edit war. Please understand that sometimes it is better to let things on Wikipedia arise as they naturally do, and let them be created on their own. 65.244.171.35 02:47, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This quote came from an Israel News Agency article by Joel Leyden: "So now I was intrigued to see how Wikipedia would respond to a page on the Israel News Agency and on myself. I expected trouble. And I was dead right. Why would an open public miss a chance to throw a stone at an Israeli let alone a news site coming from Israel." Your attitude was unnecessarily pessimistic, and the problems that came after you first created this article, Israelbeach, might have been prevented if you had come across <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a> earlier. Thanks for trying, anyway, hope this long droning message has softened up any hard feelings, and so long. 65.244.171.35 03:19, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> For any of you who may still be wondering about the INA's status as a primary news source, here is a brief overview of the ten most recent releases on the INA's site:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>www.israelnewsagency.com/wikipediacensorshipisraelnews480527.html Wikipedia Attempts To Censor Israel News - Again an editorial authored by Joel Leyden, about the current AfD. Entire passages lifted verbatim from Wikitruth, The Village Voice, and other critics of Wikipedia.</li>
<li>www.israelnewsagency.com/jerusalemdayisraelolmert48480525.html Olmert Addresses Jerusalem Day supposedly "By Israel News Agency Staff... communicated to the Israel News Agency by the Israel Government Press Office". In fact communicated to the whole world on Prime Minister's official website:www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/Communication/PMSpeaks/speechjeru250506.htm Prime Minister Speech at the Jerusalem Day Ceremony at Ammunition Hill</li>
<li>www.israelnewsagency.com/shimonperesisrael480525.html Israel Peres Meets French Minister for Regional Development Estrosi the news part is quoted verbatim from a government press release:www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Communiques/2006/Vice+PM+Peres+meets+with+French+Minister+for+Regional+Development+Estrosi+24-May-2006.htm Vice PM Peres meets with French Minister for Regional Development Estrosi. The only unique contribution of the INA are biographical details about <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shimon_Peres_8663.html" title="Shimon Peres">Shimon Peres</a>, which can be found anywhere.</li>
<li>www.israelnewsagency.com/israelolmertcongress48480524.html Israel's PM Olmert Addresses US Congress this is labelled: "Special to the Israel News Agency". Again, lifted verbatim from the Prime Minister's site: www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/Communication/PMSpeaks/speechcong240506.htm Address by PM Olmert to Joint meeting of US Congress</li>
<li>www.israelnewsagency.com/palestinechildterrorismisrael88480521.html Israel Tears For Palestine Child byline is "by Joel Leyden". It is, at best, an editorial and not a news story. I believe the general tone and style to be representative of Leyden. Also note that the INA website makes no disticntion between news stories and editorials in general.</li>
<li>www.israelnewsagency.com/israelknessetchristianallies4890521.html Israel Knesset Christian Allies to Present KCAC Women’s Council not a verbatim lift as far as I can see, but compare to a press-release issued two days earlier by the Israeli Parliament for this rather minor event: www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=29349 Knesset Christian Allies Caucus to Present Newly Created Women's Council</li>
<li>www.israelnewsagency.com/wikipediacensorshipchinalahav.html Wikipedia - The Weakest Link an editorial "by Debbie Lahav", who identifies herself as <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonnieisrael_553e.html" title="User:Bonnieisrael">user:Bonnieisrael</a>.</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Thank you for taking the time and effort to post the above links. You have just illustrated beyond any doubt that the Israel News Agency is a news agency with major impact. As all news agencies i.e. - AP, Reuters, AFP, the INA collects and then disseminates information - both original and copied. That's the purpose of news agencies. AP and Reuters carry advanced copies of speeches and events provided to them by the public affairs' offices of corporate and political world leaders every day. As the Israel Government Press Office does not have its own Web site (PM site is not the same - ask Danny Seaman, director of the GPO in Jerusalem) the INA also serves as a clearinghouse for news from Israel's various ministries. And does so without profit! From I have seen, the INA has published several hundred news stories over the last 11 years. Including several exclusives such as [Al-Qaeda&#160;: The 39 Principles of Holy War www.israelnewsagency.com/Al-Qaeda.html]. The Israel News Agency has proved "notable" to millions of readers worldwide, to me, the Israeli government and to ... Google News. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnei_0e73.html" title="User:Karnei">Karnei</a> 14:25, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - What it does prove, is that yet again, Google news has it wrong. They even listed QuakeAID's PR machine, OfficialWire as a news source. Google News gets it wrong all the time, I have even seen forum posts on Google News. The Israel News Agency is one man and a failed SEO mission. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 16:43, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
