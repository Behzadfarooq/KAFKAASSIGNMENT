<li>My response:</li>
<li>This is not an ad, they are not selling any thing. The article is about a famous classic manufacturer of sportfishing boats, best known for its work in the 50's and 60's. There are countless articles written about them, entire online discussion forums dedicated to discussing them with thousands of messages posted daily and hundreds of photographs, etc. The article is just getting started, you should not delete this article. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Angusdavis (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angusdavis_d996.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angusdavis">contribs</a>) 01:00 31 January 2006.</small></li>

<ul>
<li>Then you should you make that case in the article by writing an encyclopedia article, instead of (as it appears you are doing) creating a catalog of every boat Merritt has ever built. That level of detail WILL be deleted and condensed by subsequent editors, so you best not invest the time in doing so. For the moment <b>keep</b> -- as long as it doesn't degenerate into list of boatcruft ("The 1963 models, as opposed to the 1962 models, began using mahogany instead of teak for the cabin trim..."). --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:24, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, BUT get rid of the list of boats, except for those which have some significance. Boats as far as I am aware, are just private possessions like cars. I bet you we couldn't find a single Wikipedia editor who would think that the encyclopaedia should contain a list of all car registration numbers with details of their first owner, even if we could find that information out. At risk of breaching <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, I have to ask, does the author have a commercial interest in this particular boatyard? How else would they know who bought each boat? Or are boats required to be registered in a public register under U.S. law? If they DO have a commerical connection and there is no such registration requirement, this seems like an unbelievable breach of commerical confidentiality. Rant rant rant.

<li><b>Keep</b> and, there are a number of Yachts which are individually notable out there in the world (due to manufacturer, owner, specific characteristics, history, design example of something, etc). Whether these particular yachts are sufficiently notable or not is an open question, but I suggest letting the article editors work that out over time. Standards will prevail. No reason to delete or apply premature chainsaw effort to the article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 01:12, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Data on boat ownership for boats that are or have been federally documented by the <a href="../../../u/s/c/USCG_b1ba.html" title="USCG">USCG</a> is a matter of public record, so there is no confidentiality issue here. I am the author and I am an enthusiast of these boats as are many other folks. Feel free to delete the article or edit it as you see fit. In its defense, I will say that if magazine articles have been written about the history of these boats, tracking down each one, etc., it is silly to say it is not appropriate. For example, if Sinclair had built only 10 computers, would it not be appropriate to document the provenance of those computers, who owned them, how they were used, etc.? Anyway, it was just a quick attempt at an article. I came here after reading about the congressional staffers abusing the system and I decided to try for myself to create my first article by writing about something on which I had some very unique and deep knowledge. I agree the writing is poor and could be improved. The unique contribution I have made here is the research. Do with it what you will. --Angusdavis 01:57, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>For example, if Sinclair had built only 10 computers, would it not be appropriate to document the provenance of those computers, who owned them, how they were used, etc.?</i> Nope. And you listed <i>25</i> boats, none of which seem particularly distinctive for reason of ownership, history, precedence, or technological or design advances; nor as exemplars of any trend in boatbuilding design evolution. What the list and its content (generally) is, to put it bluntly, trivia. (Besides, if Sinclair had built only 10 computers, I doubt they'd get an article here to begin with.)</li>
<li>This site is an encyclopedia, a <i>digest</i> of knowledge, acting as an <i>introduction</i> to or overview of subjects. Writers should put in the article what's most important, distinctive, and telling for the layman: "Why are those boats worthy of an article?" is the question that you should be answering in the article, and leave the fine-grained detail for the specialist magazines and coffee-table books. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:02, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The debate here is about whether the article is to be deleted immediately, never to return. Debate on what the article should or should not contain should be directed to the article's talk page, as it is not relevant here. Ikkyu2 22:09, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>keep</b> - fast and convenient, a notable search engine</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b> - The original site is quite difficult to reach, but the article provided two new websites that are <b>easy to reach</b>. I think the search engine is quite good because it can search Google, MSN and Yahoo at one time. As it is newly developed, I think the article should <b>keep</b> so that more people can know more about this search engine and the ranking in Alexa will boost.
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia isn't to promote new sites and boost rankings. It's to document things that already have a proven track record. Has any national or international news outlet published about this site?

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> pending verifiable information on accreditation and government licensing. I'm not clear on whether this is a real school, or just a collection of homeschooled kids in a church program. More signficant than its status, is the verifiability of status, which doesn't seem to exist yet. The links provided don't mean much. Also, I don't understand why the church web site, say nothing of this. I may well be missing something, so correct me if I'm wrong, and I'll happily switch to keep. The one place I could find a little info was at <a href="http://www.acsi.org/web2003/default.aspx?ID=2065&amp;ConstitID=0001304" class="external text" title="http://www.acsi.org/web2003/default.aspx?ID=2065&amp;ConstitID=0001304" rel="nofollow">ACSI</a> (which accredits K-12 Christian schools), but that wasn't helpful, as they're listed as a member, but not accredited.

<li>The problem isn't poor writing, or need of cleanup. Nobody can fix this article without verifiable information. Currently, there's no confirmation this church operates this school, as the church doesn't even mention the school it supposedly founded. It's worth noting that the Seattle Times entry for the school, mentions the church's web site, but gives a dead-link. If we can't tell people if the school is currently open, how can we tell them useful information? --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 19:35, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

Based on the size of the staff, the enrolement estimate seems reasonable. Not sure where the (now deleted) reference to $450 tuition comes from, as that was what was making me suspicious; for it is listed as $4,125 to $4,550 on the website.

<ul>
<li>Uh, "might be true", doesn't cut it. Verifiably true is the standard. There is something seriously wrong, when somebody makes an unverified statement about an organization, that's not sourced, which could do serious harm to the organizations reputation. Declaring in public an organization has financial problems has a great way of becoming a self-fullfilled prophecy. If somebody decided not to send their kids to a school, or not take a job there, because they read it was closing at Wikipedia, the school would be more than justified in holding us to blame for any such harm. I realize it is a harsh thing to say, but the original version of this article, should never have been written in the form it was, and was of net-negative value to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 01:36, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Rob, I know you mean well, but please, try to stay calm for two seconds. See above where I said that <i><b>editing</b></i> was the solution. That to me is the better approach as opposed to deleting an article on a school based on a vague unreferenced line on "financial problems". <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> applies to newbies as well, so instead of tagging the article after two minutes, a further option would have been to question the submitting editor. You also need to realize that not everyone has your skills in concocting these school articles. People contribute based on their abilities. Until the wiki completely changes the rules regarding article creation, you are going to have to live with the fact that many articles start as pathetic little stubs that do not meet your lofty standards. That is the nature of the beast. It is a net positive. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:55, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's a beta, and was taken off the search engines by its owner until testing is complete. The article clearly states it's a beta. Secondly, blogs are not adequate measures for anything as they are owned by individuals who can not possibly view every single news site out there (especially if it has been temporarily taken off search engines), so it makes sence that it would not be mentioned on blogs. Furthermore, NewsReel is a free service and does not promote its owner's company, and gives all article credit to the respective sources. Finally, NewsReel recieves quite a bit of traffic from the public domain (even in its uncomplete state). Howeve, if you wish to delete the article please do not remove any redirects as NewsReel will soon be listed on Google, Yahoo, other search engines, blogs and will be ranked by Alexa. I think that it is too much of a hassle to delete something that will just need to be rewritten in a month or so. This adds another problem as by Wikipedia policy, you cannot re-post a deleted article. This would force others to take more time to reword a perfectly fine article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I think that the article should remain standing or be temp. removed and allowed be re-posted in its exact entirity when it is seen on other sources. 68.196.163.237 02:13, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as NN. The article should not be posted until in "its exact entirity" and notable.

<li>Yes. To quote <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, "A personal website or blog may be used only as a primary source, i.e., when we are writing about the subject or owner of the website." Since Sophomore Conspiracy only makes very limited claims, those claims can be verified simply by looking at the Geocities website. The problem as I see it, again, is that it is not a <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> notable website.

<p>I'm renominating this page for deletion. This is the second nomination; the page was first nominated on January 22, 2006. The result of the debate was keep. The archive of the debate is <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_David_Seaborg_9be4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David Seaborg">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why it deserves to be renominated so soon:</strong> Many people voted keep out of concern that the nomination was bad faith and a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">WP:Point</a>. The previous nominator nominated 18 biographies of people in category:atheists for deletion after his own articles on Christians were nominated. I count 8 "keep" votes in the original debate that cited "bad faith nomination" as a reason. Hopefully, this time we can debate the merits of the article.</p>
<p><strong>Why it deserves to be deleted:</strong> Besides being the son of a Nobel laureate - hardly an accomplishment - this person hasnt done anything notable. Hes the president of an organization not notable enough to have a wikipedia page. And he has <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22david+seabog%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22david+seabog%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">a little more than 400</a> google hits. <b>Delete</b>--<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierremenard_b03f.html" title="User:Pierremenard">Pierremenard</a> 02:15, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><strong>Comment:</strong> he shook President Johnson's hand once; Ameritrade didnt want to let him bid on google and someone wrote up an article about it; published an academic paper; and gave a speech at an atheist convention.

<dd>To delve further into that vein, he's also listed in Who's Who in Science and Engineering, and Who's Who of Emerging Leaders in America.

<dd>Well, I confess I am not sure of his importance as an "emerging leader" - you may be right about that. Nevertheless, as far as science in engineering, google scholar records <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=author%3A%22d+seaborg%22&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_allsubj=all&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=author%3A%22d+seaborg%22&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_allsubj=all&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1" rel="nofollow">2 publications, 5 citations</a> which definitely rules out his importance as a scientist/engineer. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierremenard_b03f.html" title="User:Pierremenard">Pierremenard</a> 04:40, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd say it's a bit extreme to say that this "rules out" his importance -- it weakens his notability as a published scholar, but that's not the only facet of this individual. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Lamo_094a.html" title="User:Adrian Lamo">Adrian Lamo</a> ¬∑ <a href="../../../a/d/r/User_talk%7EAdrian_Lamo_87da.html" title="User talk:Adrian Lamo"><small>(talk)</small></a> ¬∑ <small><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Adrian_Lamo_7380.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Adrian Lamo">(mail)</a></small> ¬∑ 22:01, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Note: This is not nonsense. I am a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the phrase, "Brick Monster" is used in the same way as this article discusses it. While some might consider the post to be stupid, publication must start somewhere. This is why I co-authored the article. If you do not believe that people actually discuss the brick monster, listen to this: over 120 UNC students on the popular website facebook.com believe in the brick monster, according to enrollment in the "groups" section of the page. This, of course, is a minimum number of students, because this is the number of people who clearly know there are groups for people who believe what they do. There could also be other people out there that do believe, but do not know that they are part of a larger group of people.

<dd><b>Comment (again)</b>, Facebook has tons of usergroups with hundreds of members. Joining one doesn't mean that they all believe in the same thing; it is like myspace where some people join just for the fun of it or to have a zillion group listings on your profile. While I consider this article to be nonsense, there is always the avenue of trying to include "popular" (yes, this is probably POV dangerous) facebook groups on the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facebook.html" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> article.

<p>just because Facebook has a popular group doesn't mean the article is notable for its own article on Wiki.</p>
<p>You are correct. A Facebook comment or group may not be justification for the article, but in the same right, Wiki has an article about the Flying Spagetti Monster. Belief in "pastafarianism" has no basis in reality. Does it make it wrong for the author of that article to have posted it. How about Christianity? The religion has basis in fact, in the sense that we know a man existed and was executed by Roman guards. Other than that, there is more faith in it than there is fact. Should we then delete all references to Christianity? How about other religions. When you start drawing lines, they better be concrete and for good reason. I challenge you to find many differences between a belief in a "Brick Monster" and any mainstream religion's belief in a G-d or pantheon of gods. <small>‚Äî<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 52.23.192.126 (talk&#160;‚Ä¢&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_52.23.192.126_dd12.html" title="Special:Contributions/52.23.192.126">contribs</a>) 23:04, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>Thank you for restoring the comments that were deleted. The original AfD Discussion was not deleted by either myself or my co-author, Nidiron. I understand the concern that this page is not valid, but the concern seems based in illogical thought patterns. If people can put articles about religions, spoof religions (i.e. Flying Spagetti Monsterism), or general beliefs, this article should be allowed on precedent. Looking into the situation further, the article clearly states that there are multiple theories behind the idea of the Brick Monster, and one of these ideas is that it is not real. If you have suggestions about changing the entry, I would be happy to take any advice you might be willing to give, discuss it with my co-author, and correct any basic problems. It falls into the "legend or myth" idea, I suppose. I would gladly make comment at the beginning. This would allow people to look up what a "Brick Monster" is, but it would let them know that the actual existance of such a creature is actually under debate. --Mneidich 07:13, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I learned that the hard way. I hate the tour line in there. What constitutes a tour? Playing in two different clubs in two days? What constitutes a national tour? Do they have to play from one end of the country to the other? If they only do half the country, is that only a half-national tour? What is a medium-sized country? If they played a gig on one side of Malaysia and then played one on the other side of Malaysia the next day, they're in?! How about one that got me - if they're an <i>opening</i> act or a headliner of a tour? Some opening acts barely even get on posters <b>in</b> the concert venue where they're playing!

<li>Fuck I can pronounce. Fuck I know the meaning of. If I want to rave about how great Fuck is to my friends, I can finish saying their name before they get bored and wander off. 'Fuck' commands a bit of respect - personally I think it's childish, but to some it says "We're edgy, we're cool, we don't care what your parents think". Those other band names just say "We're a bunch of medical students" and "We have disgusting acne".&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 16:28, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> well i'm sitting here in a coffee shop in the heart of VT hearing them for the first time--i had to ask who they were. apparently they're notable enough for me which lead me here to find you worrying if they are <i>notable</i> enough for you rather than questioning why you don't have more information about them!! kind of ironic a site which has bypassed the traditional publishing mechanisms is using the same to choose to limit what they allow! no doubt the major labels appreciate your support! as online self publishing grows i guess you'll choose to ignore those who choose that far more enlightened route.</li>

<p>Searched on Google, found nothing on this; seems like a hoax to me, though I may be completely wrong.

<li><b>Keep</b> She was (is?) a full member of Neverland Express, Meatloaf's group. Being a member of a notable band is criteria for keeping I think?

<li><b>Comment</b>: Well, there's no mention of "Neverland Express" anywhere else in Wikipedia, including <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meat_Loaf_28f2.html" title="Meat Loaf">Meat Loaf</a>. In fact, there's no mention of it on Amazon either. I've seen a few similar articles (relatives of notable people) deleted as hoaxes ---- maybe this is another one? Whatever Neverland Express was, the article says she was a touring member, not necessarily a full member. This is why I nominated - everything sounds very suspicious. ‚Äî<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 11:46, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Now I see Neverland Express is Meat Loaf's touring band or something? How notable could it be if I had to find that out on Google instead of Wikipedia? So basically Pearl Aday was a backup singer on the touring band of a guy that hasn't had a hit in a decade?... ‚Äî<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 11:52, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You mean you've never had to make an article about a very notable band before? Just because WP doesn't have an article on it doesn't automatically mean it's not notable. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 14:43, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I assume your question is rhetorical - but the answer is no, I haven't. Is there something notable about this band that wouldn't just be in <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meat_Loaf_28f2.html" title="Meat Loaf">Meat Loaf</a>? Regardless, the question is whether someone who has essentially been a backup singer needs a separate article.

<ul>
<li>My question actually wasn't rhetorical, but it probably should have been, given the amount of deletions you've been putting up the last few days.

<li>Regardless, if it is or not, I've cleaned it up somewhat and added wikilinks.

<ul>
<li>Isn't copyvio in the edit history still an issue? Anyway, my vote is <b>delete</b> regardless. It's still a vanity piece, referenced only from her own site, which is not a good source. Not convinced singing backup on a couple albums is any more notable than playing 3rd violin some recording of Beethoven's 4th symphony that you'd find in a bargain barrel at music store.

<li>I'm sure it can be dealt with without deleting the entire article. Also, there's an interview with her and Meat Loaf available from the UK Times here <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2099-1456744,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2099-1456744,00.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> that helps further establish notability.

<li><b>Comment</b>: One simple test I have regarding reflected glory is, "would this person have an article if they weren't related to X"?

<li>After doing some research, it's a certain maybe, and that's without mentioning a sort of precedent regarding children of famous people. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 18:40, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The answer has definitely been maybe as far as my Afd track record goes with such scenarios. Louis Osbourne was an article about Ozzy's son who had at least done some DJ'ing at clubs and was in a documentary about children of rock stars. His article is gone - merged into Ozzy's as a section (and I see has since been removed altogether). Eduard Einstein was the son of Albert and his only notability was being a schizophrenic who spent most of his life in institutions. His useless article remains - mostly on the basis that his name appears in www.schizophrenia.com. Those two establish no pattern whatsoever. ‚Äî<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 19:01, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: "Forthcoming album" argument is a little flimsy. It certainly wouldn't be the first planned album that never materialized.

<li>If her forthcoming album was her only point of notability, then you might have a point.

<li>There's far worse things on wikipedia. Human judgement is sufficient for the length of the ML article. Take away the "Forthcoming album" and she's still notable. How many non-notable people have fan sites? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS">The JPS</a> 02:33, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Lots of good points here. I'm just saying an alleged forthcoming album isn't one of them. And neither is the Meat Loaf article supposedly being too big for a merge.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> -- as someone with experience on both sides of the news media, it bugs me how "local man killed" gets two column inches while far less notable events get features. An encyclopedia is the place for this.

<li>Not that I know of. My own rule of thumb is that if someone's murder results in riots, national outrage, triggers a civil war, or the passage of legislation to keep it from ever happening again (such as <a href="../../../a/m/b/Amber_Hagerman_af90.html" title="Amber Hagerman">Amber Hagerman</a>), then the victim certainly rates an article. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 06:56, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as notable. Nominator should remember that notability is how notable /the world/ finds a topic, not whether or not we feel it deserves an article.

<li>This is a real term used in the domain business. The definition is accurate and not self interested at all. -Unsigned comment from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=70.104.175.24" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=70.104.175.24" rel="nofollow">70.104.175.24.</a></li>
<li>I can not beleive anybody would try to strike an accurate entry such as this from Wikipedia. This simple example illustrates the weakness of search engine's and central repositories of info.. they can be undermined by special interests. Oh well, better get a domain name and publish the truth myself. -Unsigned comment from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=63.130.192.13" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=63.130.192.13" rel="nofollow">63.130.192.13</a></li>
<li>Positively ridiculous. Google this term and see how many listings appear. Deletion requests such as this undermine the spirit of Wikipedia. What a pity. -Unsigned comment from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=63.130.192.13" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=63.130.192.13" rel="nofollow">63.130.192.13</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, I really think it should be replaced with the much more famous Benjamin Bradley (<a href="http://www.harcourtschool.com/activity/biographies_science/bradley/" class="external free" title="http://www.harcourtschool.com/activity/biographies_science/bradley/" rel="nofollow">http://www.harcourtschool.com/activity/biographies_science/bradley/</a>) A black slave who in the 1850s invented the steam engines for warships. He used the money he made from selling the patent of the engine to buy his freedom.

<ul>
<li>Deleting an article to replace it with one of the same name is not a Wikipedia protocol. The Wikipedia protocal is to give one article (the one for the less famous person) a disambiguated name, e.g. "Benjamin Bradley (porn star)" or "Benjamin Bradley (inventor)", and put a note at the top of the main article directed readers to the disambiguated article. Alternatively, both articles can have diambiguated titles, and the main "Benjamin Bradley" article would consist only of links to the other two articles with a little text to help the reader find the right article. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 00:08, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree, it would make more sense to move this page to "Benjamin Bradley (porn star)", as soon as the inventor pages is ready. -- <i><a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProveIt_5236.html" title="User:ProveIt">ProveIt</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProveIt_ca2d.html" title="User talk:ProveIt">(talk)</a></sup></i> 02:05, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Okay, I will work on the Benjamin Bradley, inventor of steam engines for ships, article and then maybe someone can help me learn how to put it up and create the disambiguated titles. <a href="../../../c/i/p/User%7ECiperl_9472.html" title="User:Ciperl">Ciperl</a> 17:21, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't think that we can move the current article while there is a vote for deletion underway. It will probably have to wait until the vote is complete. If the article survives, it can be moved. In the meantime, Ciperl can start his/her article by clicking here: <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Bradley_%28inventor%29_39fc.html" title="Benjamin Bradley (inventor)">Benjamin Bradley (inventor)</a>. Don't forget to add the article to a category or two, e.g., <a href="../../../i/n/v/Category%7EInventors_2219.html" title="Category:Inventors">Category:Inventors</a> and <a href="../../../s/l/a/Category%7ESlaves_e6cc.html" title="Category:Slaves">Category:Slaves</a> by placing [[Category:Inventors]] and [[Category:Slaves]] at the bottom of the article. <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeromacnoo_1a90.html" title="User:Zeromacnoo">Zeromacnoo</a> 17:28, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Just tag it is a copyvio. Blank the article, and replace it with {{copyvio|url= ADD THE WEBSITE HERE}}. That will expand to a tag which gives you instructions for adding an entry at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>. Then just say at the AFD that it has been tagged. Two things can then happen when the AFD closes:
<ol>
<li>If there was a consensus to delete anyway, it will be deleted through AFD.</li>
<li>If there is <i>not</i> a consensus to delete, the article will stay until the copyright process runs its course, giving the contributor a chance to explain (perhaps the contributor owns the copyright). <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 15:51, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's a hoax. "Chug" as a word <i>does</i> exist, but in my experience it refers to skolling a drink, not "deviant sexual practices". Meanwhile, according to <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=chugging&amp;btnG=Search&amp;hs=ErB&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=chugging&amp;btnG=Search&amp;hs=ErB&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial" rel="nofollow">Google</a>, there are a variety of other meanings for "chugging", including begging for money, sickness, or even the sound of an engine (remember trains "chugging" along?).

<p>This article was nominated before. It's been listed on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>. This Newfoundland rap group has attracted national interest and appeared on a flagship arts program of Canadian national radio, This fact was noted by the person voting keep on the original AfD but seems to have been disregarded, which in my opinion was probably an error.</p>
<p>I think it may well be a good idea to arrive at a consensus on this. I'll note that, while I'm unsure about how Wikpiedians will react to this kind of content, I think it may well be worthy of an article. Since there are some people who seem to want it to be deleted without a proper discussion in <i>this</i> forum, I thought I'd like to make sure that it gets a chance, --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 10:47, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm glad to play ball and elaborate on this, but is seems that explaining the non-notability of somebody who has never done anything of significance is akin to proving a negative. What do you want me to say? He's a writer whose byline appears in no magazines in ProQuest, or on any books in Amazon.com. He's an actor who has never been in any movie. He participated in a small town improv group for a couple of years. I feel as though I'm just re-typing the bio here -- he hasn't done anything noteworthy. <a href="../../../u/u/c/User%7EUucp_ab6c.html" title="User:Uucp">Uucp</a> 15:26, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You, presumably experienced with the ways of AfD, I, presumably experienced with the ways of AfD, and Uucp, who will soon be experienced with the ways of AfD to the point where he nominates instead of votes, may know enough to interpret "vanity". Not everyone who comes across an AfD subpage will; some of them will be the author or subject of an article, and might take exception. Also, "non-notable" these days means nothing more than "I want the article deleted"; nearly <i>everything</i> that comes up before AfD, pass or fail, is "non-notable". An explanation is far better than a vote. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 15:12, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hold on a second - investigating further..........................</p>
<p>Okay, I just noticed the "This date in recent years" section on the existing day pages, which links to January 28, 2006, <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_28%2C_2005.html" title="January 28, 2005">January 28, 2005</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_28%2C_2004.html" title="January 28, 2004">January 28, 2004</a>, and <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_28%2C_2003.html" title="January 28, 2003">January 28, 2003</a>. I hadn't noticed this before. Is it a Good Thing? Is it just intended for inclusion on the Current Events pages?

<li><b>Delete</b>, bypasses preferences. We have a standard in the manual of style about dates.

<li>I've put a list of all such pages I can find on my Playpen - in particular, there seem to be a lot of pages included as templates on monthly pages for the first six months of 2003, 2004 and 2005. Is there some sort of organised project that's creating these pages? I'm tempted to withdraw this AFD until more is known. ‚Äî <a href="../../../s/j/o/User%7ESjorford_d4b9.html" title="User:Sjorford">sjorford</a> <a href="../../../s/j/o/User_talk%7ESjorford_13fb.html" title="User talk:Sjorford"><small>(talk)</small></a> 17:19, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>As was discussed the last time this came up, the developers (specifically at the time, Tim Starling I believe) said it was trivial to adapt the MediaWiki logic so that prefences are respected for this date types too. I am actually kind of surprised that it hasn't been turned on yet&#160;:(. Even so I think the single date pages are a great idea <b>Keep&#160;:-)</b>. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 20:33, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>NB at that time I wrote <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_Date_FAQ_ce95.html" title="User:Pcb21/Date FAQ">User:Pcb21/Date FAQ</a>. It attempts to explain why the current method of linking is next to useless, and why the single date method is much better (but perhaps not perfect).

<li>Thanks, that's good info...okay, so what do we do about this page, and also January 24, 2006, January 25, 2006, and January 26, 2006 which have all been blanked? If they're going to be part of your new system, fine, but at the moment, these four are kind of a dead end, and aren't included in the <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_2006.html" title="January 2006">January 2006</a> page. ‚Äî <a href="../../../s/j/o/User%7ESjorford_d4b9.html" title="User:Sjorford">sjorford</a> <a href="../../../s/j/o/User_talk%7ESjorford_13fb.html" title="User talk:Sjorford"><small>(talk)</small></a> 23:54, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note this stuff has been part of Wikipedia from the beginning - the only question is to lay it out in a big gloop (as a single month), or more finely grained (single day).

<li>I feel the whip!&#160;:-) No. The definition of new investigator is quite extended across other funding agencies, not just the NIH. But, yes the entry is too short. I need a bit of time to collect some more material (see latest changes). I would like to deal with the problems of investigators starting their careers as independent researchers in a very competitive environment with limited funding. The NIH graph is quite worrying. I wonder if there are other studies for other grants that show similar trends.--<a href="../../../m/i/g/User%7EMiguel_Andrade_a990.html" title="User:Miguel Andrade">Miguel Andrade</a> 00:44, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems that Chloe's song Crash charted in Australia last year - I vaguely remember hearing it on the radio although not who it was from.

According to her site, the album is due for release in Australia early this year. While some might consider an article on this premature, the fact that she has enjoyed chart success with "Crash" going top 10 justifies an article for mine. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 17:46, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I am the Andrew mentioned in the entry. The piece is a ton of fluff, characterized by extremely poor writing and containing little of importance. I took the liberty of making certain changes (such as the removal of my last name) in the article.

I have read the Deletion guide and found no fault my article may have to warrant deletion. I first wish to express my understanding that Wikipedia is a wide-ranging service meant to contain a wealth of information about the widest array of respectable topics possible. I have written this article bearing in mind the rules of Wikipedia. For several reasons, I believe my article has a place on Wikipedia.</p>

<li><b>I object to the claim of <i>non-notable game(?)</i>.</b> To this I answer: In the Related Links section I have supplied sufficient proof of the existance of the topic on which I chose to write an article. Furthermore, though Emergalv is not a commercial product, it has nonetheless been playtested using the <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dungeons_and_Dragons_fd83.html" title="Dungeons and Dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a> system. As such, it can be first defined as a game, and secondly can be described as a valid campaign setting available for testing to whoever asks.</li>
<li><b>I also object to the claim of <i>advertisement</i>.</b> I have chosen to share my intellectual property on Wikipedia by presenting objective content and clear, intelligible definitions of the world I have written about. This is not a vanity article, though credit must be given to the people who have worked on Emergalv, including myself. Emergalv is not a product to be sold, just as Wikipedia is not to be used as a platform for advertisement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Should it be found that I cannot provide satisfying answers to the claims leading to the deletion of this article, I will radpidly withdraw without complaint.</p>
<p>Now I ask this&#160;: Does deletion include the possibility of establishing a wiki site outside of Wikipedia? I cite in example the <a href="http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Homestar Runner Wiki</a> and the <a href="http://www.ufopaedia.org/index.php?title=Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.ufopaedia.org/index.php?title=Main_Page" rel="nofollow">UFOPaedia site</a>. If my article is to be removed from Wikipedia, I would like to learn the procedure to creating an outside Wiki site.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, but there's always Wikicities. It's not directly connected with Wikipedia but I believe it uses the same software. That said, if they don't take you they have links to other Wiki providers. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 02:54, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am going to see the the decision we take here before making a complete move (or not), but I have already set myself up a mirror of this article on RPG Wikicities. Thanks for the idea, however&#160;:D AvianSavara 03:49, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Good luck with that. The problem is that a lot of people come in here thinking Wikipedia is something it's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and get into big arguments over it. A lot of misunderstandings happen over that issue that boil over into accusations of censorship and other assorted nastiness.

<li>You can count on my participation on other topics. Whatever the outcome of this debate, I will continue to read and edit Wikipedia. Amidst all the (let's face it)trash that can be found online, I believe Wikipedia is the best thing to ever happen on the internet. AvianSavara 04:49, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Why? Is there anything inherent in the language that makes it less reliable than English?&#160;:-) Seriously, that seems a rather dangerous statement to me, and not at all compatible with Wikipedia policies against Anglo-Saxon bias. This guy seems to be an - admittedly minor - figure on the national political stage, probably regarded more as a clown than as a serious player. Why would foreign media want to report on him?

<li>The <i>New Order of Druids</i> is a website with Alexa rank near 194000.

<li><b>keep</b> This article is not in violation with Wikipedia policy. Notable organisation New Order of Druids. Is mentioned in "The Solitary Druid: Walking the Path of Wisdom and Spirit" by Rev. Robert Lee (Skip) Ellison (Archdruid-Ar nDraiocht Fein (ADF)) page 245. This was in the talk page, you could have read this yourself if you had done your homework. <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVorak_5e11.html" title="User:Vorak">Vorak</a> 19:41, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> One mention on a single page of one book? That seems awfully thin. If "The Solitary Druid" is considered to be a major defining work on Neopaganism, that might establish notability, but given that the book doesn't have a page of its own, that seems unlikely. Vanigo 20:01, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that that is very thin, but do not agree that a book used to establish notability should have a Wikipedia entry. It would help if we knew what the book actually says (for example, that information could be in the article). <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(Ë®éË´ñ)</a> 18:17, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's not exactly what I meant. If there was an entire chapter devoted to the organization in a not-particularly-notable book, that'd establish notability, or if there was even a single sentence in an extremely important book, that'd do it, but a single reference in a book of questionable importance? That's two strikes and you're out, IMHO. Vanigo 22:07, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I completely agree with that. I had justed wanted to point out that the absence of a Wikipedia article does not mean a book (or anything else) is not important / authoritative. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(Ë®éË´ñ)</a> 22:59, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not surprised to see that the same thing happens here as has happened to almost every other article I ever contributed to Wikipedia... whatever valid proof or argument is given is waved away or minimized in order to get the article deleted at any cost. Well I can tell you already that it has been the very last time I have ever contributed to Wikipedia, and I won't be the only one leaving. By the time you people are done deleting everything, Wikipedia will only consist of your own User article pages, hope you'll have fun with them.

<li><b>Delete</b> unless importance in the neopaganism community can be shown (disregard my vote if I forget to change it in that case).

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm not seeing anything indicating any actual impact -- however small -- on the world and plenty of puffery. And Gad, that "Overview" sounds like it was translated from the Japanese. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:08, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> References? That's a good one, as if any reference whatsoever would be taken serious. The reference of the book, for example, is waved off just because the book has no article on Wikipedia. Why do you think that is? Because either you already deleted it, or because you would end up deleting it anyway so people stop bothering to contribute. Aside from the book, The Druid Network (TDN), Eadhadh and ADF find NOD or its sub-organisations important enough to give it a webpage of its own. Or it could be mentioned that NOD was founded on the same day as TDN, already has set up one local grove and is in the process of setting up more local groves in Europe and North America, or that it currently has over 600 members, and offers a free online Druid college that currently contains over 250 students worldwide (NOD and its Grove of Dana college is one of the very few Druid organisations in the world that offer teaching online and believe it should not come at any monetary cost!). But of course, all this will be regarded as is predictable, and I could go and work on an actual list of references, but honestly, why would I? Just to see it being trashed? No, thanks. It's not taken serious anyway, whatever any contra-delete vote comes up with, and you will keep digging until you find another reason to get an article deleted. If Alexa ranking won't give you a reason, you'll keep looking until you find another reason. Oh and nice template on top of this page, you might as well just say that any "keep" votes whatsoever will be disregarded anyway and that the nomination for deletion is just a formality because it's already a decided cause from the start (as it always is). Of course, it's easy to gather some Wikipedia members and get them to vote delete as well, but when people do the same to obtain keep votes, it's suddenly a disgrace. Sorry, but I really won't play along those games any more, and I'm sure that others feel the same way. By the way for your information, we did contribute other articles too, such as <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merlin%27s_Oak_0a37.html" title="Merlin's Oak">Merlin's Oak</a> and the English translation for <a href="../../../g/w/e/Gwenc%E2%80%99hlan_Le_Scou%C3%ABzec_7a42.html" title="Gwenc‚Äôhlan Le Scou√´zec">Gwenc‚Äôhlan Le Scou√´zec</a> by Vorak, but of course it all doesn't matter. If you want to delete this article, so be it, I won't be around to put it back up anyway, but Wikipedia's loss is our gain. Wikipedia will only decrease in number of articles (and as a result, degrade in quality) and let other wiki sites grow larger instead. So, keep up the good work! Aneirin 13:06, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, knowing how many members you have (from the website it was difficult to tell if there were 60 or 600) is helpful. However how many of those 600 are defined from mailing lists? <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> likes to have online organizations written about by others, and to have a large member base for forum-type sites. If it was 600 local/active folks, it'd be easier to verify your importance. Honestly, the fact that most of your copy comes straight from N.O.D.'s website or members makes people all the more suspect of the actual importance. As I said, I'm checking on the Solitary Druid reference; however I could find no mention on <a href="../../../%C3%A1/r/_/%C3%81r_nDra%C3%ADocht_F%C3%A9in_ab5c.html" title="√År nDra√≠ocht F√©in">ADF</a>'s website of your organization, as you claimed: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=new-order-of-druids+OR+n.o.d.+site%3Aadf.org&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=new-order-of-druids+OR+n.o.d.+site%3Aadf.org&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>. Am I missing something, or is it in the members-only section? I searched there as well but maybe you know the page where it's listed. We're trying to help you, but you do have to understand how things work here; it's not based around what we know, it's what we can prove. -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 14:44, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> What the hell is you're problem? All of you? Do you really think that the only good druidic website is one you should pay for? Then you people are nothing near druids you're just plain kapitalists. About this article itself. What is you're problem with it? Why don't you people want to connect yourself in anyway anymore with the NOD. Especially since you made the article larger not so long ago. I said this once before... You people are not worthy of being called encyclopedia you are something to laugh with. Ravenlady 18:03, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete or prune to stub</b>. I checked with Skip himself, and the original submission for the book, or close to it, can be found <a href="http://www.dragonskeepfarm.com/druid_groups/DG/NOD.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.dragonskeepfarm.com/druid_groups/DG/NOD.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> (site is framed, main page is <a href="http://www.dragonskeepfarm.com/druid_groups/start.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.dragonskeepfarm.com/druid_groups/start.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>). The material was sent in by David Dom and edited "all of them to drop down to just a paragraph or two". I get the impression therefore that this was part of the laundry list of groups at the end of the book, and as it was submitted by the founder, it suffers the same circular-verifiability problems as anything off of the N.O.D. website or <a href="http://druidnetwork.org" class="external text" title="http://druidnetwork.org" rel="nofollow">The Druid Network</a>. Until this group achieves success outside their own circles, I can't see us having a page on them, especially ad copy. I would be willing to help them prune out things that can't be verified from outside the group, but I fear they won't like the result. -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 14:23, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Andy Saunders' google search was inaccurate. If you google Schaller and Thune, the 2nd posting is from an article which references Schaller's involvement in Thunes historic victory. From the February 2005 edition of Campaigns and Elections Magazine, ""John Schaller has been promoted to vice president of political services at The Lukens Company after five years with the company. John has been a leader in the expansion we've had. This promotion is a testament to the significant contribution he's already made," LTC president Walter Lukens said. In his new position, Schaller manages the 13 people on the political staff, Lukens said. <b>As political director in 2004, Schaller ran the direct mail fundraising for U.S. Sen. John Thune's campaign, which raised more than $8 million in less than eight months.</b>" I think this is evidence enough to <b>KEEP</b> Schaller on Wikipedia. -Seinfeld01</li>

His bio is a who's who of left wing, liberal viewpoints and his opinion is merely a partisan smear tactic against someone who helped a Republican candidate for office. --Seinfeld01 22:47, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Made up musical genre. This supposed 'genre' is a neoglism of bands from both the Power Metal, Black Metal and Death Metal genre. It draws no distinction between the bands, except to state that several bands from the genres all use themes akin to war, which is already stated in all three articles <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_Metal_bc72.html" title="Power Metal">Here</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Metal_8e27.html" title="Death Metal">Here</a>, and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Metal_8348.html" title="Black Metal">Here</a>. A scene doesnt exist for this supposed genre either, and the term is not in wide spread use. The only band that refers to themselfs this way is Bal-Sagoth, and that is in open mockery of the term. Delete and redirect to the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Music_db3b.html" title="Metal Music">Metal Music</a> page, as this genre is Neoglism, Unsourced, Non-Existant and Advertisment. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 19:22, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep as is.</b> Comment Podcast notability methods need discussion. Not knowing how to assert notability is not reason enough for deletion on any topic. There is a hostile attitude on wikipedia towards all things radio, internet radio, and podcasting mostly due to a lack of knowledge on the subjects. I would think in general, if external sources (other than the website for the podcast) can be cited, then the articles should stay until some other way to judge notability is determined for topics in these categories. Randomgenius 04:07, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Neutral comment</b> I think there is a bare consensus that licensed radio stations should be kept, though it isn't universally accepted. When you get into media like internet radio and podcasting, though, you have several problems. First off, they're DIY media, which inherently is going to generate a large quantity of garbage and a few gems (much like, say, garage bands, which are wikied and deleted by the legion every day). Second, there's no easy way to measure such things -- there are no sites that measure podcast or webcast popularity to any reasonable degree of certainty (though Yahoo Podcast is helpful in that regard). Likewise with Internet radio -- you could probably make a decent case for anything included in the iTunes radio tuner, but beyond that, how many stations are there on Shoutcast that have no listeners at all, ever? Ultimately I agree with you, and I'm sure others would as well -- there does need to be a discussion on the issue. But what you percieve as prejudice is AfD voters saying "Oh, no. Someone else's pet project. Make it stop..." Haikupoet 04:28, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Podcast notability methods need discussion. Not knowing how to assert notability is not reason enough for deletion on any topic. There is a hostile attitude on wikipedia towards all things radio, internet radio, and podcasting mostly due to a lack of knowledge on the subjects. I would think in general, if external sources (other than the website for the podcast) can be cited, then the articles should stay until some other way to judge notability is determined for topics in these categories. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomgenius_aa15.html" title="User:Randomgenius">Randomgenius</a> 04:07, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think there is a bare consensus that licensed radio stations should be kept, though it isn't universally accepted. When you get into media like internet radio and podcasting, though, you have several problems. First off, they're DIY media, which inherently is going to generate a large quantity of garbage and a few gems (much like, say, garage bands, which are wikied and deleted by the legion every day). Second, there's no easy way to measure such things -- there are no sites that measure podcast or webcast popularity to any reasonable degree of certainty (though Yahoo Podcast is helpful in that regard). Likewise with Internet radio -- you could probably make a decent case for anything included in the iTunes radio tuner, but beyond that, how many stations are there on Shoutcast that have no listeners at all, ever? Ultimately I agree with you, and I'm sure others would as well -- there does need to be a discussion on the issue. But what you percieve as prejudice is AfD voters saying "Oh, no. Someone else's pet project. Make it stop..." <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 04:28, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Randomgenius, though we disagree at times here at AfD, I shall fully support the creation of Wikipedia:Notability (podcasts) (or maybe adding it to the neglected <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28broadcasting%29_78c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (broadcasting)">broadcasting guideline</a>). This might even lead to a {{nn-podcast}} speedy tag. --<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerfecto_bf9a.html" title="User:Perfecto">Perfecto</a> 04:33, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thanks Perfecto. I did actually start working on an <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomgenius_Internet_Radio_Project_ddab.html" title="User:Randomgenius/Internet Radio Project">internet radio project</a> under my user page for now. I don't know if it should be moved into a real wikipedia project yet tho. It could be modified slightly to include podcasting as well. Either way, the discussion needs to happen somewhere. Podcast and podcruft are obviously synonymous in the wikipedia community already and that's extremely unfortunate. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomgenius_aa15.html" title="User:Randomgenius">Randomgenius</a> 19:56, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>This is a neologism. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Post-scarcity+economics%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Post-scarcity+economics%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">Google</a> shows only 60 distinct hits. Apparently it is a phrase uttered by <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cory_Doctorow_79af.html" title="Cory Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a>. From an economic perspective, this phrase is sheer nonsense (I'm an econ prof), and it is <i>certainly</i> not used in the profession. The article lists a few examples of near-zero marginal cost of production, an important and well-studied economic phenomenon. However, a techno-hipster neologism of no widespread use is not the place for a discussion of those issues. Also, this content is not a useful basis for such an article, it's just a couple of examples. Should this be deleted, I would be willing to write a proper economic article on this issue. (I usually avoid writing economics articles, because that's what I call work.) I have contacted the original author asking for some evidence that this term is notable, but received no reply. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 23:38, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>OK</b>, a redirect to that works for me, as it is quite clear about the <i>sci-fi</i> context. What worried me was seeing wikipedia used as a platform to spread this nonsense as a term about our <i>actual</i> economy (as it was written). I'll just redirect then, as the objection was mine, and that's a perfectly reasonable resolution. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 01:14, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It's certainly not a neologism; I heard the term as far back as 1971. It apparently fell out of fashion after the mid-70s oil shocks demonstrated that we weren't headed for a post-scarcity economy anytime soon. But it certainly was influential in some circles; one guy who believed in, talked about, and apparently acted on the concept was <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitch_Kapor_e4eb.html" title="Mitch Kapor">Mitch Kapor</a>. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 01:19, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmmm, Kapor got mighty rich off something that wasn't scarce; wish I could figure out how to do that (economist joke about defn of scarcity). He wasn't the first either, guys like <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Hemingway_f01d.html" title="Ernest Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> did the same thing a long time before. Anyway, I didn't say the term "post scarcity" was a neologism, because I didn't look it up. "Post-scarcity economics" is, or at least it's a oldogism that hasn't been used in a long time per google. My point is that this is <i>certainly</i> not a branch, school, or tradition of economics as a science. It's fine as a sci-fi term. It may even be a notable "popular economics" term, though google thinks otherwise. If someone can properly source this article as being of some notability, I'll concede. I don't want to sound high-handed or snotty here, but frankly this is the sort of junk article that makes experts doubt the credibility of wikipedia; it made me cringe anyway. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 01:43, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure I'd say it's purely "sci-fi", but it is by definition highly speculative. There's no solid reason to think we'll reach a point where scarcity of all kinds will vanish.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.
