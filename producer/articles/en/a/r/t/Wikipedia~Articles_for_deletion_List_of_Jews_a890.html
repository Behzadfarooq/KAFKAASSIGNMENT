<p>I do not see the encyclopedic value of classifying people according to religion or ethnicity. This list strikes me as a black list of individuals that can be used in Anti jewish propaganda or reeks of prejudice. I can see the value of mentioning the ethnicity in articles when it has relevance to their work or career but to go as far as saying that an individual is classified as Jewish because an ancestor is believed to be Jewish or their name sounds Jewish is going too far. We are also introducing an element in Wikipedia of racial or ethnic discriminatory conduct. Any one with any sense can see that this is just wrong. 65.144.141.7</p>

<li>Fair enough. But the ONLY and ONLY way this should be deleted would be if ALL "Lists of [insert ethnicity]" are deleted. And again - using phrases like "ancestor is believed to be Jewish or their name sounds Jewish is going too far" is just plain wrong - every person on this list has been individually confirmed as Jewish by reliable sources - and in fact it can stand as one of the sole accurate lists on the net - considering how wrong all the lists of all those stupid anti-Semitic sites usually are.

<li><b>Comment</b>. As it stands this list apparently tries to list every Jewish person ever who is even slightly known. If that's all it does it should be a category, since there are almost no entries with a qualification why someone is considered Jewish, or why it should matter at all. I didn't know <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Bolton_0102.html" title="Michael Bolton">Michael Bolton</a> was Jewish—and why should I care? It's not even mentioned in his article, or the biography that links to, and it's not like he's notable for being Jewish.<br />
There's no point to a huge list with zero references other than the articles themselves. (I notice some of the external links could conceivably have been used as references, but there's no way to know.) While not completely pointless and not something I'd outright vote to delete, this list as it stands has little added value. A very similar issue plagued <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_atheists.html" title="List of atheists">list of atheists</a> before the Great Reform. By contrast, that list is now one of the best I've seen. (And I'm not a major contributor, so I think I'm reasonably unbiased.) It's not perfect, but at least it tries. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 12:22, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Any single <i>List of [insert your favorite religion/sexual orientation/political party here]</i> is relatively harmless. However, the information, unless the listing criterion is tied to the individuals listed in some substantive way, just doesn't belong in any encyclopedia. Information about any individual's religion, politics, etc. isn't encyclopedic, unless that information is part of what makes that person notable, a la <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Falwell_c0ca.html" title="Jerry Falwell">Jerry Falwell</a> and the like. It just doesn't matter that, for example, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cordwainer_Smith_4a28.html" title="Cordwainer Smith">Cordwainer Smith</a> was a non-observant <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a>, because it doesn't say anything about the man. And the same is true of almost everyone on every <i>List of X</i> here, where <i>X</i> is any label by which people have conventionally divided into "us" and "them". <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenwarren_49e7.html" title="User:Kenwarren">Ken</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKenwarren_3f39.html" title="User talk:Kenwarren">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kenwarren_de12.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kenwarren">contribs</a></sup> 13:02, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Clearly this list has not been well-monitored as it is busting at the seams with entries like "Dr. Zoidberg". Although the recent edits by User:24 have removed all non-wikilinked people it is still incredibly long. This is not merely a troll causing mishief; if you look at the talkpage you will see this is being debated by several users. At the very least this page should be reduced, if not deleted. I would also like to point out once again that <b>Jews are not an ethnicity</b>. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreestylefrappe_d689.html" title="User:Freestylefrappe">freestylefrappe</a> 22:23, August 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, thanks a lot for pointing that out. It's nice you feel that way. However, Wikipedia acknowledges that "Jewish" is, indeed, an ethnicity, whether you put your sentence in bold or not. It is widely recognized as an ethnicty (heck, otherwise a mis-directed phrase like "he doesn't look Jewish" would not exist) and is indeed a mediterranean-originated ethnicity, which is why most ethnic Ashkenazi Jews share similar facial characteristics to those of other mediterranean ethnicities - like Italians or the Spanish. Dr. Zoidberg was in a category which was obviously meant to be humorous. As for it being long - well, the plan is to split it up to sections - i.e. the separate list of actors. Also, someone has unfortunately reverted my edit and all those with no Wiki entry are back in.... not productive. -24.141.149.226</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This list is just as valid as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people.html" title="List of people">List of people</a>.

<li>Sjakk: By definition this <i>is</i> a list of notable Jews (ethnically or by religion). If they were not notable they would NOT be qualified to be on Wikipedia in any form. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 13:20, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I know. But sometimes I think users are worried that such lists are made with the intent of mentioning absolutely everybody, and adding a "notable" may alleviate some of those fears. For example, there is a reason why the list of chess players is at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_notable_chess_players.html" title="List of notable chess players">List of notable chess players</a>. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 13:23, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Some of the subsections really aren't necessary, but as a journalist student I think this is a useful reference to look up which politicians/celebrities/whatever are Jewish. The more obscure sections aren't really necessary though. The claim that this is a blacklist is outrageous; anyone hellbent on discovering the identities of as many Jews as possible would, I'm sure, be able to find equally or more comprehensive lists elsewhere.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Even among the delete votes, I'm mostly seeing things like "...unless criteria can be nailed down...." In other words, that this article <i>can be</i> appropriate doesn't really seem to be in question. As per JRM's comments regarding the <i>Great Reform</i> over at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_atheists.html" title="List of atheists">list of atheists</a>, this list simply needs a stronger and clear-cut set of criteria for inclusion. In fact, it looks to me like that process had already been started on the article's talk page before this VfD was started...which makes this VfD listing look suspicious, imho. Let's let the articles editors see what they can do to quell objections to the list. The talk page is the first place the nominator should have gone to, not VfD. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func">Func</a>(&#160;<a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func">t</a>,&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Func_dbc4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Func">c</a>,&#160;<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Func_6e40.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Func">e</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;user=Func" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;user=Func" rel="nofollow">&#160;</a>&#160;) 17:43, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Per IZAK and Func, except that while I'm not going to protend that the merit of the nomination is anything but dubious, however, I think some of the "Delete"-related comments demonstrate that there are some pretty serious flaws with the list. My main concern against deleting it outright is that my crystal ball says that if it's deleted, it will come back later, and in a much more horrific form. I have solicited assistance in reforming the article on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Jews_bb79.html" title="Talk:List of Jews">the TALK page</a>, and thus far, while there are clearly people watching the discussion, so far it's mostly just me and 24.anon looking into reforming the list.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> useless having it on an encyclopedia. Many Jews in the list were born and brought up in other countries other than Israel and carry mostly european names and europena and north-american cultures. In this sense being a Jew is only and question os religion. To be fair, it should be done a list of catholic notable people. This list is just not fair to other religions, ethnic groups or nations, once it makes people think Jews are 'better' or more 'inteligent', when actually they are from afluente families.

<dd>1.There are lists of Catholics, Muslims, Buddhists, Lutherans,..</dd>
<dd>2. Jews are a compound of historical memory, religion &amp; ethnic identification. In short, they are a people characterized by specific cultural identity religion has been <b>the</b> crucial identifier of, but is not necessarily any more. As with other peoples- the identity is best described by participation in collective destiny. And here is the shortcoming of this list: it contains names of many individuals who are of Jewish heritage or extraction- but are not Jews in any rational meaning of the word. They have no Jewish identity of any kind. A part of Clint Eastwood's ancestors had been, I think, Dutch. But-it's a nonsense to count Eastwood among "Dutch Americans". Some half-forgotten ancestor is not enough for identity. So, this list needs to be rearranged, but not deleted. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 17:46, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>-This article, while techinically true is in pretty poor taste. Although I'm sure the author considers it important, I can't find any factual use for the information in this article other than as an roll call of Jews-including many ethnic Jews who would not consider themselves religiously so. Finally, there is not a clear criteria for the persons listed here other than their "Jewishness"-an article titled "List of Anglos-Saxon Christians" would probably be too long for any useful purpose whatsoever, and this article is already far past the point of serving as a reference source. If you find yourself perusing this article to for the names, you're either way too pro- or anti-Jewish.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There does not seem to be a concise or specific argument against this list other than disorderly squabbling about being "in poor taste" or "non encyclopedic". What makes something "Encyclopedic"? This is evidently information that people find interesting, is factual (for the most part). The only thing that is "poor taste" that I can think of about it, is people being upset by the idea of a list where the "accomplishments" of Jews can be found. What isn't encyclopedic about it? --208.228.103.165 04:46, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Why anyone should get upset at being identified as something that they are is quite beyond me. You can put <i>me</i> on a list of Anglo-Saxons, atheists, leftists, or beer drinkers if you like. An educational work such as an encyclopedia is no place for censorship of facts. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelisi_9a88.html" title="User:Kelisi">Kelisi</a> 17:32, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Why are Jews commonly afraid (ashamed?) of stating their nationality? They suffered more than many nations relative to their overall number, but otherwise are fine.</li>
