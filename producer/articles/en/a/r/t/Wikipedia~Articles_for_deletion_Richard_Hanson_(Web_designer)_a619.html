<p>Non notable vanity pages. No real google results for various combinations of Richard Hanson, EarlyBird, Manchester, etc. Article doesn't establish notability, and this person has spammed links to eb.cx in various articles. Also relevant, see <a href="http://www.eb.cx/about/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eb.cx/about/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Attitudepc_d183.html" title="Special:Contributions/Attitudepc">Special:Contributions/Attitudepc</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_6aa9.html" title="User:CryptoDerk">CryptoDerk</a> 23:48, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Vanity, vanity, and more vanity. I wish this garbage could be speedied. <a href="../../../g/w/k/User%7EGwk_0d52.html" title="User:Gwk">Gwk</a> 23:52, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> You'll actually find dozens of pages related to this person. I think this is a simple case of user bias against the person. As you can see, other people have already shown an interest in the article, adding information to it.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b>Note, this unsigned vote is by the creator of the articles. IP is from England, surprise. Within minutes of posting an article the other person on the EarlyBird design team edited the article, surprise. Please stop spamming and self-promoting. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_6aa9.html" title="User:CryptoDerk">CryptoDerk</a> 23:58, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b>Do you not think it's a bit arrogant and presumptious to assume that the other editor was from my team? A friend maybe, a member of my team certainly not.</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b>OK look! I am not on his team whatsoever... Friend is what I am and nothing more... if you would notice. if you put my screen name into google, you'll find more links for my s/n than just his website... I'm also friends with a guy named brandon, who's website is exonyte.dyndns.org and my screen name appears for hits for his website thank you very much</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> because it provides biographical information about someone that some people on the internet may have an interest in. - attitudepc

<li><b>Comment:</b> I smell <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppets_c28f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppets">sockpuppetry</a>... <a href="../../../g/w/k/User%7EGwk_0d52.html" title="User:Gwk">Gwk</a> 00:14, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> That's kewl... - attitudepc</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> And I'd consider that comment defamatory. It's easy enough for people to check based on IP addresses if we are the same person and I'd caution you against making claims that impact somebody's reputation without having evidence to back it up.</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Wait, were you making the claim that my IP is from the UK? If so, you're mistaken... I am very much in America. Houston, Texas to be more exact
<ul>
<li>Nobody claimed that. The two people involved with eb.cx are from Houston and England. The two IPs that have edited this page and the Richard Hanson page are from Houston and England. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_6aa9.html" title="User:CryptoDerk">CryptoDerk</a> 00:26, July 16, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>People shouldn't make assumptions about situations when they don't know what is going on. There is only one person involved in EarlyBird Web Design. EarlyBird. That is why the site is in England, the telephone number is in England, the fax number is in England and the address is in England. Attitudepc is only listed on the site because it was the only way to give her a blog on it.
<ul>
<li>This has nothing to do with the VFD. Vanity pages, self promotion, etc. are not allowed on Wikipedia. The fact that the IPs match with the locations listed for the people involved and the name "attitudepc" matches with what is on the eb.cx website are just meant to add evidence to my claim that this is vanity and self-promotion. That you two have continued to comment on here just backs up my proof. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_6aa9.html" title="User:CryptoDerk">CryptoDerk</a> 00:44, July 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. To "Richard " or "Richard's friend" - Stop wasting your time. There is no way this is going to survive the VfD unless you include verfiable information that Richard Hanson has actually done something noteworthy. And it doesn't matter how many votes you or your friends cast here because WP is not a democracy anyway. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbis_377c.html" title="User:Bobbis">Bobbis</a> 00:41, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Richard is responsible for the world's first URL redirection service. The ruling on this site is that you shouldn't vote on subjects unless you have knowledge of the subject. If you had knowledge on this subject you would know of this person.
<ul>
<li>Well, TinyURL was around in Feb 2002 <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020212130833/http://tinyurl.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20020212130833/http://tinyurl.com/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and eb.cx domain wasn't even registered until 6 December 2003 <a href="http://www.nic.cx/whois.jsp?whois=eb" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nic.cx/whois.jsp?whois=eb" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Perhaps you need to provide evidence of where the EarlyBird URL redirection service was hosted prior to Feb 2002 to backup your claims? Furthermore, the Alexa rank of TinyURL.com is 1582 <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=tinyURL.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=tinyURL.com" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which compares to an Alexa rank of "no data" for eb.cx <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=eb.cx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=eb.cx" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. You didn't really make the most of that first mover advantage, did you? P.S. nice work plugging your own site on Amazon reviews. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbis_377c.html" title="User:Bobbis">Bobbis</a> 01:15, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, wouldn't find him notable even if his invention claims are true, since no proof has been given that this accomplishment made him especially well-known.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia isn't a business card holder. There are too many pages which are in effect mini biographies of persons who haven't established their noteworthiness. Just a hint to all aspiring brilliant persons: If you are noteworthy, someone else will write the article about you without prompting. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPosthocergopropterhoc_2235.html" title="User:Posthocergopropterhoc">Posthocergopropterhoc</a> 05:35, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
