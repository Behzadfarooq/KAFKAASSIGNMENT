<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. Among the established users here (i.e. who have numerous other contributions apart from contributing to this debate) the consensus is quite clear.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I created the BBBA page. I have also created various other Big Brother pages including <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Mathew_5a43.html" title="Greg Mathew">Greg Mathew</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Mathew_c6d4.html" title="David Mathew">David Mathew</a> and <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Brunero_f66e.html" title="Tim Brunero">Tim Brunero</a>. The site in question is non-commercial, very popular, and is in opposition to the commercial Big Brother website. In fact the site is so popular, Australian Big Brother contestants are forbidden to mention it because it is significatant opposition the the offical Big Brother site. I am EXTREMELY suspicious that this is called for deletion only hours after it first appeared. I created the first draft in 15 minutes &amp; I'll be adding additional content in coming days.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> In regards to the person who said that this isn't a well known site, in fact it is, with thousands of hits a week and 11,000 registered users on the forums you can hardly say it's an unpopular site. This article has been posted to inform users of the BBBA community information on the site and there is still more information to come. By the way, why does a site like Miniclip (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniclip" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniclip" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniclip</a>) receive allowance to have an article, if this is an encyclopedia then who gives a crap about a games website. You are contradicting yourselves here Wiki Nazis, let BBBA be! And for the record, there is thousands of sites here, so how can you honestly say Wikipedia isn't a listing for website history. Thanks. - realityJunkie RealityJunkie7 12:28, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thanks mate, the site actually has had some noted media attention in the past here (Australia) and I have found it funny that some people in this discussion who don't even live in Oz are willing to dismiss it just because they never heard of it.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It is a no profit website that is quite popular and allows groups of people to chat about BB. It has attracted controvesy and is quite informative. The request to delete this page because it is 'advertising' is a rubbish. BBBA stands to gain very little from the Wiki listing other than informing those who are interested. Should Rove McManus' page be deleted because it seeks to advertise him, his business and show? NO. Should any AFL team;s Wiki entry be deleted because it postively high lights its good work and skills because it could be seen as advertising or self promotion? NO. Should the BBBA wiki entry be deleted because it is simply providing info on a popular site? NO. Kirsty.maree 13:00, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>"dissenting voice to the BB media machine"?...LOL - I'm sorry, but I just had to wonder if you were actually saying that with a straight face. I mean it's not like we're talking a dissenting voice to a monopolistic news/information sourse laustv.com.auike FOX/CNN/NBC/ABC/CBS - we're talking about a silly reality TV show. The way most people "dissent" against them is to simply not watch them, ignore them, and not care about them. And this site isn't even a site <i>opposing</i> the show - it's a fan site! <a href="../../../e/n/p/User%7EENpeeOHvee_d3f3.html" title="User:ENpeeOHvee">ENpeeOHvee</a> 03:38, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And your experience with the Australian media is??? Big Brother is on up to 5 hours per day on prime time television, and BBBA is the major alternative to the official Endemol tv/radio/internet advertising blitz Gtoomey 10:57, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
