<dd><i><b>Note:</b></i> I will not be voting, merely administering this vote. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 8 July 2005 03:14 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The GNAA site is seen by many as not notable, and not a suitable topic for Wikipedia. There have been numerous VfDs submitted, however each one has had irregularities. In a final effort to put the whole thing to rest, I am submitting this article to VfD one last time. I am dividing up the page into 5 sections: <b>Delete</b>, <b>Keep</b>, <b>Redirect</b>, <b>Comments</b> and <b>Disqualified votes</b>. Usually we do not place these into sections due to limitations of VfD, however an exception will be made for this article, mainly due to its controversial nature.</p>
<p>No sock-puppets, anonymous users or <i>very</i> new users will have their votes counted in this VfD. To make this the final GNAA VfD, if you had less than 100 edits as of the time you submit your vote then your vote will not be counted. This is to stop people from gaming the system and to stop <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppets_376f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppets">sock puppets</a> from voting. Further, comments that are seen to be personal attacks will be deleted immediately by any admin not participating in the vote. <b>However as per VFD policy, all logged in users are able to cast their vote, even if they do not meet our desired 100 edit limit.</b> Please note that though the users may cast their vote, if they do not fulfill the criteria they will be moved to disqualified votes and their vote will not be counted.</p>
<p>One last comment. VfD is decided by consensus to delete. The vote is not counted by a straight 50/50 split, where the side who gets greater than 50% of the vote "wins" (I shudder at this term). Deletion will only occur if there are around 70% of the votes to delete.</p>

<li>I strongly object to construing <i>discounted</i> to mean <i>not counted</i>.

<li>Er... how is disqualification any less of a term than discounting? Disqualification means that their vote is not valid also. Just a point. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 04:35, 12 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>'Disqualification' makes reference to a set of rules, whereas 'discounting' denotes a disbelief or disregard of the vote (or opinion) entirely, as innacurate or irrelevant, detracts from it? <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeeaxid_b28b.html" title="User:Seeaxid">Seeaxid</a> 05:07, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Wish to point out that this is not correct: the GNAA are not just of interest because they are trolling Wikipedia. Firstly, considering their entire purpose for existence, the GNAA have been remarkably restrained when it comes to this site (I have seen what they do to other website). Though they have vandalised the odd article, they have mostly focussed their attention on the Gay Nigger Association of America article. The GNAA are notable because they faked OS X screenshots, have been a significant subculture on Slashdot, and have crapflooded, trolled and generally been malevolent on many websites and community forums. They also have their own IRC server, have a radio show (TrollTalk), a website, a crapflooding script and a growing user base. I don't like them, but they are notable for things other than what they do on Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 9 July 2005 02:10 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Glad to at least clear things up that you are not biased. BTW, in what other case has having a website, an IRC server, or having written a script been considered notable? None. (And if they have a "radio show", it isn't even important enough to list in their own article.) If this were any other group other than these guys you seem to admire, you would laugh them right off of the site. I would not be having such a problem with this if it wasn't so blatently ridiculous and two-faced. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarvin01_3da7.html" title="User:Marvin01">Marvin01</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarvin01_56aa.html" title="User talk:Marvin01"><small>talk</small></a> 9 July 2005 03:54 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I do try. Would argue that all those things establishes that they are an organised group and that this <i>helps</i> to establish their notability. The fact that they are a well-know and organised group that performs trolling and crapflooding make them notable. This is disputed, and one of the reasons for the VfD. In fact, it was established in the previous 5 VfDs that this is a notable enough reason to keep the article, but something has always happened to make someone object. Do not wish to say any more as I am administering this vote and as such not actually voting. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 9 July 2005 04:13 (UTC)</li>
<li>Quick note: It's the l0de Radio Hour, and I *did* add it to the article, but it got removed at some point; not sure why. As soon as it was linked from the GNAA article, it was added to VfD (kept, I might add; don't bother trying it again). It's produced by a member and is *not* an official GNAA project.

<li><b>delete</b>. perfect example of our flawed perception of 'notability'. what's notable in WP: namespace is not necessarily notable in article namespace.

<li>We STILL got this? Sigh. The article is well-written, but it's pith, if you know what I mean. The heart of it is basically a rewording of what I'd find on their own site, and the references/history is likely proudly paraded there.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Removing this would be contrary to the very essence which Wikipedia thrives on. This is information about something; even if you guys haven't heard about, find it offensive or "not notable" it does not mean that it's not "worthy" of being on Wikipedia. All information is worthy of being here. <a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a> 16:59, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That's not true. Our most fundamental policy is NPOV. Information has to be written about neutrally. In order to do that it has to be verifyable, it has to be able to be written about by anyone. Non notable topics that are not verifyable cannot go in. I'm not saying this is true of the GNAA website, I'm just pointing out that not all info is worthy of an article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(a tenth stroke)</a> 17:05, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But if it's deleted it has no chance of being verified. Does Wikipedia rely on the use of ex. Google when verifying it's articles? Who are anyone to decide what type of information is worthy being keept or not? All information is worthy collection, isn't that what Wikipedia is all about, collection and sharing all information in existence. I feel deleting something because of notes like "Vanity", "Non noteable" is wrong on all accounts. Even if YOU don't like it, or you find the information to be stupid, that does NOT mean that someone won't find a use for it. Even if only one person finds anything informational, that one person should be taken into account. Removing something is killing the flow of information, which really is a shame. <a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a> 17:34, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sarcasm is unnecessary. One difference you might note is that Adolph Hitler and the KKK are both entities of historic significance. A clan of Internet trolls, on the other hand, exists solely as a kind of memetic cancer. Their purpose is to incite a reaction and make an impression, and giving them a "legacy" on Wikipedia is like feeding them. They feed on attention. Their presence on this Wiki is the only reason most people here know about them, and the very controversy that has brought a lot of new voters to the deletion page paradoxically is the reason why a lot of people are voting in favor of its notability. That is unfortunate reasoning, since agitation about a group devoted to creating agitation is only to be expected. I've also noticed somebody soliciting "Keep" votes in Wikipedia Chat, and that is also unfortunate. --<a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Billion_29e9.html" title="User:Mr. Billion">Mr. Billion</a> 07:18, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yet the response to your vote was made irrespective of notability (in terms of verifiability), similarly as you had indicated was <i>your</i> vote by this little statement here: "even if they <i>were</i> notable", suggesting that you would still advocate the deletion of the article if the topic had sufficient verifiability (from your perspective of course). What you fail to realise is that the vociferous and continual opposition (and thus attention) displayed by some towards the existence of this article contributes more to "giving them a "legacy" on Wikipedia", than leaving it forgotten in a corner, such that your own vote, and manner of doing so, one could say, did more harm for your cause than good. <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeeaxid_b28b.html" title="User:Seeaxid">Seeaxid</a> 08:30, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>My point is that it does not deserve even a dusty corner. Simply being an idiot on the Internet doesn't make one notable.

Seriously now, is this going to be the last attempt to delete this article? Continually calling for deletion of this article is sadly reminiscent of a corrupt government attempting to retry an individual until the jury returns a verdict of guilty, justifications of "irregularities" notwithstanding.

<dd>Ah, but I, for example, was attracted to this vfd for the rather odd name of the article. Moreover, it seems quite possible that while "over 125 legitimate votes here is enough to tell it is notable", perhaps this notability has much more presence on Wikipedia than in the world at large. Thus why 125 <i>Wikipedians</i> have so far legitimately voted. <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeeaxid_b28b.html" title="User:Seeaxid">Seeaxid</a> 03:39, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Removing this would be censorship. Wikipedia is about gathering all information in the world, and this is information.

<li>The article exists on the French Wikipedia because I translated it (and a few other contributors fixed it). As for why it is still here, it's probably because no one there ever imagined it was not a suitable article. But in fact I think the main reason is that the GNAA has never been disrupting the French Wikipedia (TTBOMK; we have had Autofellatio attacks but I don't know if they were from the GNAA), hence no one VfDed the article <i>as an attempt to retaliate over the GNAA</i>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Hocevar_dccf.html" title="User:Sam Hocevar">Sam Hocevar</a> 8 July 2005 08:54 (UTC)</li>

<li>Anybody can make webpages or flood weblogs and chat rooms. It is easy to make a nuisance of yourself online to a lot of people at once. Lacking the decency not to does NOT make you notable. Trolling does not make you notable. Not even if you and your buds think you are really good at it.</li>
<li>"[GNAA] was rumored to be mentioned on CNN" Is this really the level of reporting that you want to have in your encyclopedia? Do you think WP could ever be taken seriously with this content included?</li>
<li>"Interesting phenomenon"? Are you kidding? Two or three of these kiddies spring up every week. There is nothing interesting, unique, or even mildly surprising about a group of annoying teenagers or college dorks.</li>
<li>"Precedent has been set"? So what. Unset it. Get rid of all of this crap. Make a WP:AYBABTU rule or something. If you are not bigger than AYBABTU, you don't get in. Forget it. Or go troll some more message boards and hold your breath for that CNN story.

<li>Would suggest to you that it would be bad faith of an administrator to remove those votes if the editor has previously voted keep with a specific reason relating to why the article should be kept. Also, I suspect that if we apply this we would need to apply it to the delete votes also. I can see at least one vote that states that "I don't think trolls deserve that much server space, if at all.", which is clearly invalid because this has nothing to do with notability, and is merely a vote for deletion based on the fact they are trolls. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 12:44, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wow. Again. Ok, I say keep for two main reasons. 1) this was VfD'ed all of a few weeks ago. This is also its 6th VfD, and its managed to survive all of them. Shouldn't that be a hint that the article should stay? 2) It's proven that this is not *just* a bunch of /. trolls, this is a seperate entity that has gained fame for other things (the leaked Tiger screenshots for example). Thus it is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoThermic_6d72.html" title="User:NeoThermic">NeoThermic</a> 8 July 2005 21:01 (UTC)

<dd>I actually expected this, seeing as I don't have many edits. But I've been here for a long time, and its not like I've made 49 quick edits just to vote here. My first edit in this account (I used to edit anon for a while) was 22 November 2004. So please don't treat my vote as if it doesn't matter. Evidently I have a voice, and I wish to express it as I see fit. Finally, if you can provide me with a link to indicate that one shouldn't partake in a VfD until x amount of posts, then I'll agree that my vote can waste away here. But as <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a> stated in his comment, votes shoudn't really be discounted unless you can *prove* Bad Faith. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoThermic_6d72.html" title="User:NeoThermic">NeoThermic</a> 9 July 2005 03:35 (UTC)

<dd>Because of the nature of this vote, it is not what I would class as an ordinary VfD. Our voting criteria for an article that has been submitted <i>six</i> times is now a lot stricter. This has been necessary, if unfortunately so, because IMHO there has been considerable bad faith edits on both sides (keep and delete). Keep because they refuse to accept the vote after 5 times, and delete because of sock puppets and harassment. I am running this vote with some very clear, set rules. Regrettably, any user who is very new might be deemed to be a ring-in of either camp or perhaps a sock-puppet of an existing member. Thus, I must discount votes of all people who have had less than 100 edits. I'm sorry that this includes you, but I can't show you any favour on this. If you would like, it is perfectly valid for you to add a comment to the <a href="#Comments" title="">#Comments</a> section. I would also suggest you refer to Theresa Knott's comment above. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 9 July 2005 03:41 (UTC)

<dd>I just feel that concentrating on <i>just</i> edits is a bit, lacking any better words at 4:50am, shallow. Shy wikipedians (those who have few edits, but have been here for a while) have opinions, and they shouldn't be squashed due to their shyness to edit articles. I'm (very) sure that discounting my vote isn't personal, since you've outlined a simple policy, but it has to be said, this is its sixth VfD, its survived (possibly with conterversy) them all so far. I just felt that, despite my lack of editcount, that my time registerd here would hold more weight, allowing me to have a say in ending this (increasing) set of VfD's&#160;:) <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoThermic_6d72.html" title="User:NeoThermic">NeoThermic</a> 9 July 2005 03:51 (UTC)

<dd>The requirement is a common one. Admins routinlely ignore users with only a few edits, they just don't normally spell it out in advance. Note that delete votes are also being removed. I understand that it is frustrating for you. You are clearly not a sockpuppet. But remember that the purpose of the vote is to gauge consensus. The voting among editors with &gt;100 edits is likey to be similar to that among all editors, and the 100 edit minimum does rule out an awful lot of sockpuppets.

<dd>No one thinks it was made in bad faith. I know it's harsh, but please believe me it's not personal. I hope that you understand that if we allow your vote in we'll be forced to allow god knowns how many votes from trolls editing from proxy servers. Also anyone who wanted to could vote twice, once logged in and once as their IP. Now most regular Wikipedians would never do such a thing of course but detractors would claim such a thing and the matter would not be settled once and for all. This way we can put an end to the constant vfds. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(a tenth stroke)</a> 18:11, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Your vote was disqualified because you are voting as an anonymous editor. I have not done this out of spite or for personal reasons. How can I? You are an anonymous editor and I have never met you before! However, I have no idea whether anonymous editors have voted before, therefore their vote does not count in this VfD. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 00:50, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think you are being a bit harsh here. As unpopular as Ta bu's rules might prove to be, you must agree that they disqualified far more keep votes than delete votes.
