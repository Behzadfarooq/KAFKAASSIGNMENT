<p>If you read the CNN and the BBC articles, you will see that they are almost identical, no doubt because they will have been drafted from the same Reuters article. Without having paid to look at the Cape Times article, I would guess it will be the same Reuters article a third time. I would look for more than this before we should have an article on it. Wait a month or two and see what happens. You should have no problem getting more than this (effectively) <b>one</b> news report of a new website by then. Or it will have sunk without a trace, as a lot of these things do. It is so easy to set up a web site, we need to be especially careful in applying our guidelines to our articles on them.</p>
<p>I also, as I said, get the queasy feeling that Wikipedia is being used here, to garner respectability for this scare site. Transwiki to Wikinews perhaps? --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 22:11, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wouldn't describe the BBC and CNN articles as "nearly identical", and it's worth pointing out that the BBC article does not credit Reuters. Incidentally, I was wrong about the Cape Times article and the article (which does credit Reuters) is avaliable <a href="http://www.capetimes.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=271&amp;fArticleId=3327822" class="external text" title="http://www.capetimes.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=271&amp;fArticleId=3327822" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In any case, whether or not the original source was the same is irrelevant, what's important is that 2 major news organisations and assorted newspapers and lesser news organisations saw fit to report on the subject. As for the issue of garnering respectibility, I'd agree that it's a concern with the article as it stands but being the fact that an article may be written in a promotional way isn't grounds to delete it, but can be grounds to extensively rewrite it.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 23:12, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I'm not sure that "the queasy feeling that Wikipedia is being used here" is a factor we should be considering. Either the subject of an article is notable or it isn't. If it's sufficiently notable, then it should be covered. If we start to say 'Well, yes, it's notable, but it's notable for the wrong reasons', then we set ourselves up for selection bias. Yes, we often delete articles for being advertisements. I've certainly rejected dozens of AfC articles for that reason. But when an article is <i>deleted</i> on that ground (as opposed to being rewritten), it's not just because it's an advertisement; it's because it's an advertisement <i>of a non-notable subject</i> -- in other words, it's an attempt to use Wikipedia to help the subject <i>become</i> notable. If the subject is already notable, then we rewrite, not delete. Otherwise, every article about a company, product or service on Wikipedia would become an instant candidate for deletion, since undoubtedly those articles help bring attention to the subjects of the articles. So in this case, if the website is notable (and it appears to be), then the article shouldn't be deleted just because it may have been written with the intent to draw people to the website. If that intent shows up in the article itself, then edit or delete the offending portions of the article. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 05:13, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well, sure. As I (and several others) have said, I think its current notability is marginal at best, and this Wikipedia article is an attempt to raise its profile and make it notable. If we delete the POV from the article, we are left with a URL, two external links (which read like they were based on the same Reuters article, or maybe the same press release, and so are counted by me as one), and a summary of the one-man site's sensationalistic content. Not a very encyclopedic article!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also count the website's novelty against it; as I said, why not delete for now and see if it attracts any other comment in the coming months, or if it sinks like a stone as many of these yellow press sites do? I agree with you that if the article is allowed to stay on Wikipedia it will have to be <i>very</i> extensively edited to conform to NPOV. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 12:51, 5 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Why not delete for now and see if it attracts any other comment in the coming months?" Because Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a crystal ball. What needs to be established is if there are sufficient verifiable sources to claim notability now, if the website generates no further press then the article can remain a discussion of the one issue that did generate press. And, no, the article would not just be a URL, external links and a summary of content; if that were all that could be written about there'd be no possible claim to notability as no major news organisations would have written about such a topic. The fact that news organisations have written about it, however, means that there is something that can be added to the article. I have to ask, if you have such an issue with the article's current format why not simply <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a> and write your own, less POV version? --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 13:25, 5 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, we obviously have different views on the "not a crystal ball" thing. I would interpret it (and this was what I meant above) as meaning we should delete the article for now, until or unless it attracts more coverage and comment, and thus more notability. You have a different view; that's fine, I suppose that's what these AfD discussions are about.</dd>

<dd>As to being bold, I don't think you'll find many editors who will put a lot of work into rewriting an article that they have proposed for deletion. If the proposal was successful, it would be an awful waste of time, wouldn't it? But don't worry, even if this proposal is unsuccessful I will be watching it closely and, yes, my first action would be to completely rewrite it to conform with NPOV, MoS etc. I hope you will join me in this, should my first wish (to expunge what I stil think is a bid for notability from our encyclopedia) be unsuccessful. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 14:06, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I went and looked at the site. It has a fair amount of material on it - probably several hundred messages from crime victims, plus lots of statistics, other stuff. There was a list of the most recent reader comments, and there had been about 10 in the last 6 hours. The crime victim messages each had from 50 to (the highest I saw) 2000 page reads. A message from the site owner claimed that many recent victim letters had not been put up yet due to a website move.--<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 19:24, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

The attestations to notability in the article at the time of me writing this show that it a sensation-- for the present. They do not demonstrate sufficient notability to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. We will see. For now, the creator should park a copy in his user space and try again if the site continues to become more well known.

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a news station.

<li><b>Keep</b> Dlohcierekim, your argument is misleading. There is more than 1 search engine on which info can be found. Then you can enter "Crime Expo SA" as well as "Crime Expo South Africa", or just "Crime Expo". All these refer to articles on the same subject. A Google search on just "crime expo" reveils about 15200 hits. <a href="http://www.google.co.nz/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22crime+expo%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.nz/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22crime+expo%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, As an example not all the hits uses SA or South Africa, such as the Google results that linked to a political party in South Africa. This means that the website even received political attention <a href="http://www.id.org.za/newsroom.php?id=771" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.id.org.za/newsroom.php?id=771" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, a amazing achievement, that shows notability.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jackes (<a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJackes_10c5.html" title="User talk:Jackes">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jackes_62e7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jackes">contribs</a>).</small><small>(fourth 'keep' from this user)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Dlohcierekim, how many G-Hits would you consider to give notability? Is 700 hits not sufficient.
