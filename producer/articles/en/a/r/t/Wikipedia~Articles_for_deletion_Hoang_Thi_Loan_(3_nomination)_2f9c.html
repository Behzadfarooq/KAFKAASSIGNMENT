<p>This article was nominated earlier today, but the nom was quickly withdrawn. However, for the life of me, I cannot see what is notable about this person other than the fact her son was famous. Verifiability isn't the issue; notability is. Being the mother of a notable person does not confer notability in the absence of any other reason. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 01:56, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../h/o/_/Ho_Chi_Minh_43ed.html" title="Ho Chi Minh">Her son</a> was not just famous, he was one of the most influential historic figures of the twentieth century. Her humble origins and tragic early death have been referenced for decades in Vietnamese propaganda. So great is her value as a (albeit manufactured) cultural icon that the Communist Party of Vietnam has spent millions of dollars to renovate her tomb. Including an article about this woman is, to me, a no-brainer as it helps battle the <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">Wikipedia's systemic bias</a> toward coverage of Eastern culture. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 02:15, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, the linked news article says that they're spending about US$20mm (their conversion rate is wrong) over 4 years to renovate an entire historic site which includes the mother's tomb but also includes 3 or more villages of historic importance (so multiple buildings across multiple locations), at least one temple, a monument, other family tombs/graves plus there's plans to create 4 or 5 new museum houses. (the wikipedia article says that this four year project was completed in 2005 but references the news article which says the 4yr project began in 2004). Oh I don't think there's blanket system bias in WP against "Eastern culture" (whateva da heck that is), given the key role that Pokemon/Yugioh/Sailor Moon/Nintendo etc etc etc has in wikipedia content <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 03:09, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I was trying to make a semi-humourous point about "Eastern Culture" or whatever being not really much of a Wikipedia backwater.

<dd>Wikipedia's coverage of eastern anime/videogame culture is far more comprehensive than its coverage of Vietnamese traditional culture or political history. If a status of notability is granted to each one of the 400+ fictional pokemon simply to appease a few geeks, denying such coverage to a real historic figure seems obscene by comparison. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 03:30, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. This nomination has nothing to do with "eastern culture". I don't care what part of the world someone is from, we don't need articles on the mother (or father) of every famous person unless that person has done something notabile in his or her own right. If the tomb is the big deal, then an article on the tomb <i>might</i> be encyclopedic. The article itself continues to lack or denote any notability. As for Ho Chi Mihn being "one of the most influential historic figures of the twentieth century", that's a matter of opinion. I suggest he's much further back in the queue. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 02:33, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is a clear double standard here. Consider the well-written article on <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Clinton_Kelley_8338.html" title="Virginia Clinton Kelley">Virginia Clinton Kelley</a>, whose only notable achievement was giving birth to Bill Clinton. By the way, asserting that being the mother of a notable historic figure does not confer notability is also a matter of opinion, many biographers would staunchly disagree with such dismissal. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 02:44, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I gotta agree on this one.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 02:55, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No double standard here. I was unaware of the Kelley article, and if it were up for nomination I'd be saying delete it, too. Two non-notable persons do not make a notable one. As for what most biographers have to say, argument ad nauseum does not prove anything, but to be more to the point, if you're writing a biography, the mother is <i>relevant</i> (not necessarily notable) to the subject matter of the biography. In that case, anything that can be said for any of these non-notable mothers can be said in their children's articles. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 08:05, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Too many details about family members would bog down the main article. However if there is enough well-sourced information to create a succinct biography of an immediate family member of a historic figure, then creating a short supplemental article will improve the overall coverage of that figure. In any case it seems clear that we are looking at this issue from two completely different vantage points, so I'll just say that I don't agree with your reasoning. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 21:51, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There is no way can a person get a government memorial without being notable.

<li>I'm not giving an opinion in this AFD, but I have to respond to your comment "please stop relisting this for deletion." There's nothing procedurally wrong with this AFD -- it raises a valid notability concern that has not been discussed in almost a year. Note that the first AFD was in January and resulted in no consensus, and the 2nd AFD didn't address notability (it addressed verifiability due to my stupid mistake and was quickly and trivially resolved). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 03:12, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
