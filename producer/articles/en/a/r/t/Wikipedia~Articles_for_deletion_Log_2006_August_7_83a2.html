<p>I kind of have second thoughts about this article that I created - it may have been a mistake to create an article on just one individual digital camera.

<dd>I should point out that in any case, it technically wouldn't be a speedy candidate anyway; the G7 'author requests deletion' criteria is only supposed to apply for accidentally-created pages. In practice I suspect deleting admins tend not to not press the point when the only person involved in a recently-created page wants it deleted, though. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 23:19, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm inclined to say <b>keep IF (and only if) you are willing to put the time and effort into expanding it</b>. A quick google search brings up lots of information that could be incorporated into an article. Get the basic information, the 5ws and h, (Why did Sony make this camera, what's different about it then other cameras, etc.), get a picture of the camera, and it could become a decent article. As for Wikipedia becoming a "catalog of individual model numbers", it's already a catalog of almost every videogame ever made for a consul (though it seems to draw the line at internet-only-flash games), so why not for cameras too? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> (<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>As someone who's worked on a lot of Wikipedia's camera articles - certainly many camera types are quite enough to fill a whole article, and in fact there's a featured camera model article (<a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_T90_47cd.html" title="Canon T90">Canon T90</a>).

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm not very happy about Islamic politics or Christian politics-articles either. Whats the point of arbitrary attributions a wide religious tradition to political currents? --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 09:28, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Surely, though. if a political party or movement is inspired by the ideals of a particular religion, that's a useful thing to discuss? The "Christian right" is a phenomenon in America without which it's quite difficult to understand their politics, and similar comments can be made about trying to understand Iran or Saudi Arabia without the conception of "Islamic politics". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 09:35, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> there is little difference between deleting the article and throughly rewriting it to remove its obvious POV-agenda. There is of course a great scope of having one or more articles dealing with Hinduism and politics. What would be highly interesting would be an article on Hinduism in political discourse, how Hindu symbolisms are used in political life in India (and other countries with Hindu populations), not only by the Hindutva movement but by practically all political forces in the country. I was quite suprised that an article titled 'Hindu politics' lacked any mention of how Hindu concepts were introduced into modern political discourse for mass mobilisation by <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandhi.html" title="Gandhi">Gandhi</a>. One could also discuss issues relating to how awodly secular groups like <a href="../../../l/t/t/LTTE_021c.html" title="LTTE">LTTE</a> include Hindu mythology into their discourse (in the case of LTTE it mainly relates to ideas of self-sacrifice for a higher cause). Another topic that might actually deserve a separate article would be Hindu minority politics (in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, etc.). Caste in Indian politics (as well as Caste in Nepalese politics) would be another given article, if a similar one doesn't already exist. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 08:14, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This seems like a pointless article - the topic is not specific, as there have been many conflicts in Southeastern Turkey throughout history, and as of now it's only serving as a place for people to argue about the terrorist status of the PKK. If it's supposed to be about the conflict between the PKK and the Turkish government and others, that's already covered in the PKK and related articles. This topic doesn't seem specific enough for an article. <a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwiseman_3fe1.html" title="User:Awiseman">Awiseman</a> 06:40, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - the conflict it's talking about is certainly notable, but should be included in articles on the PKK and friends and/or a better-titled article than this. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 07:43, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - the article as it stands has serious issues, including a revert war. Right now its a very short stub, with way more sources then are warranted by the limited amount of content. It is in need of expansion, clean-up, and probably mediation... but as the delete vote above mentions, the conflict it's talking about is notable. If it needs a better title that can be accompished by a move. In short, this is a lousy article on an important topic that should be kept and improved upon; not deleted out of hand. <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> 19:47, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Awiseman. There isn't much meaningful content—even on "better" versions of the page—that is not already recapitulated elsewhere. A meta-article as to the sundry PKK-Turkey disputes might be in order, but at a differently-titled page; inasmuch as there's nothing substantive here, the page needn't to be kept, although perhaps a request for a meta-article should be essayed at <a href="../../../r/a/_/WP%7ERA_a7f5.html" title="WP:RA">WP:RA</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> these "in culture" lists deal with notable topics, namely the media on the one hand, and in this case, a religion which has a sufficient sense of "otherness" to it that it produces many varied portrayals. The list just needs work. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 01:33, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Do you actually believe that can be done?- in terms of deleting the article now and recreating it later (although I see that's not necessary now). After the Brian Peppers incident, there could be a crowd of people saying it's a repost, and therefore speediable. Jimbo Wales deleting the article despite its total rewrite would reinforce such an argument. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 06:19, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's worrying about a scenario that is vanishingly unlikely. This article is nothing like Brian Peppers, Jimbo Wales isn't going to step in here, and administrators are careful about checking to see whether new articles really are the same as the old ones that were deleted. Compare the article as it was with the article as it stands now (or even as it stood after the first rewrite edit). Do you <i>really</i> think that any administrator in xyr right mind would have considered that to be a re-post of deleted content? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:28, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm tempted to say keep, but hesitant because the article has serious pov issues, and in many cases seems bent on attacking and disparging its subject. POV issues are not reason to delete, but attack pages are, and the article on Jason A. Haap was deleted as an attack page. This seems like another part of someone's effort to attack that person, so I have to say <b>weak delete</b>, but leave unprotected in case someone later wants to write a neutral, non-attacking article on this cross between a newspaper and a blog. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> (<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">contribs</a>) 2006-08-07T20:18:09 (UTC)</small></li>

<p>I <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Michael_Adler_75af.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Michael Adler">previously nominated this article for deletion</a> but this is probably such a low-trafficked article that I will go ahead and do it again. The previous AfD failed on account of people believing that as the chief financial officer of <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expedia.html" title="Expedia">Expedia</a>, he is inherently notable enough for a Wikipedia article. If that were true, you'd expect the CFO's of much larger companies such as Coca Cola (<a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Fayard_1a5c.html" title="Gary Fayard">Gary Fayard</a> <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?cid=6550" class="external autonumber" title="http://finance.google.com/finance?cid=6550" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>), IBM (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Loughridge_f344.html" title="Mark Loughridge">Mark Loughridge</a> <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=IBM&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=IBM&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>), and General Motors, Corp. (<a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Henderson_57a8.html" title="Frederick Henderson">Frederick Henderson</a> <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=GM&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=GM&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>) to have their own articles as well. (I am not cherry picking here; I just looked up the CFO's of the first three giant corporations I thought of). Evidently while the CFO is a tremendously influential and important person within a company, he is generally not of individual notability outside of it unless there are special circumstances that make the person notable, which does not appear to be the case with Mr. Adler.<br />
<br />
We do have a few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Chief_financial_officers" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Chief_financial_officers" rel="nofollow">other articles</a> for the CFO's of some other companies, but as far as I'm concerned those articles should be candidates for deletion as well. I'd prefer this AfD discussion to center around why a person holding the position of CFO merits mention in an encyclopedia above and beyond a listing on the company's page.<br />
<br />
Finally, for what it's worth, I will note that the creator of this article claims to have been <a href="../../../s/i/l/User_talk%7ESillysailor_2b15.html#Michael_Adler" title="User talk:Sillysailor">assigned</a> the task of writing the article by his employer when Mr. Adler was announced as the new incoming CFO. — <i><a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a></i> 00:05, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> normally I do not argue to keep mods, but this is a mod community, plus it made a very notable mod for Sims users, on top of that it was given the official thumbs up from the games creator and company, and finally they have had articles written about them in gaming sites for the mod. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 12:28, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>:Simtropolis is THE source for everything related to Simcity4. The official website is no longer maintained ( for over two years ). The Simtropolos community is very active with daily additions of new content to the game. The site is also "known" by the creator and the publisher of the game and had their approval.

<li>My preference is <b>Delete.</b> If kept, move all the unsourced entries to the article's Talk page—which at this point is all of them, effectively blanking the article. State at the top of the article that entries are to be inserted only if accompanied by source citations, meeting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> guidelines, which describe the person as "eccentric," using that word. The list then becomes a list of people who have been called eccentric, with source citations showing who called them that.

<li>This either shows a disdain for religion or a lack of understanding of history. Either way the people you name are not self-described eccentrics nor did they get famous because they're eccentric.

<li>Is this a list of self-described eccentrics we're debating? I don't think so. These aren't people who got famous for being eccentric either. That's not what's going on here. History is in the eye of the beholder, too, when such soft labels as "eccentric" are thrown around. Some guy who calls himself the son of God and runs around in the desert with 12 men, eschews sex, but hangs out with prostitutes, seems eccentric by most standards (and if you disagree, that just proves the point that there is no subjective criteria for inclusion). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 19:43, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's a difference. American Idol is a very popular, very public competition and comparisons between contestants who did the same song are inevitable. The purpose of this list is for <i>comparison</i> - of different versions, different styles, etc.</dd>
<dd>The first three shows you mentioned aren't like that - the performers just went on, performed <i>their own</i> songs, and away they went, making them more in common with the Tonight Show. As for Name that Tune, that's not a valid comparison either. Nobody's ever going to talk about "contestant X did a better job guessing song Y than contestant Z" on that show. And Name that Tune contestants, questions, aren't nearly as remembered by viewers as performances on Idol (or other reality talent shows like Rockstar for that matter). It's like how we have articles for every Idol finalist but barely any Jeopardy contestants. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirjtc2_8434.html" title="User:Kirjtc2">Kirjtc2</a> 23:34, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's another case of vanity/nn musician but since it isn't painfully clear like most cases I thought it would be best to AFD it. First, the article was created by User:Benvan, whose only edits are related to Ben Van de Geyn and a google search for "Ben Van de Geyn" only gets 7 hits. There's nothing at Allmusic.com for Ben Van de Geyn or any of the bands he is mentioned as being a part of in the article (other than completely unrelated bands sharing the same name). The article makes some claims that make it seem like he might pass <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> but none of them are referenced and are very vague. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMidnighters_8ade.html" title="User:TheMidnighters">TM</a> 04:41, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Encyclopedic Value? Are you kidding me?! Search drinking games as a general subject on Wikipedia and tell me how many hundreds of entries there are! I assume that those, however, ARE of "encyclopedic value." This was very clever and I vote that it stays. I had it forwarded to me, and I have since forwarded it on to several family members and friends. With the Tigers gaining so much television and media exposure, and all with Rod Allen and Mario Impemba as the faces of these great Tigers, I would say that it falls into the category of current event relevance. As far as it being "verifiable," I verified it at Buffalo Wild Wings on Saturday night with a group of friends - what a great and fun game.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.233.57.149 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.233.57.149_f1dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.233.57.149">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Submitter is a life-long Tigers fan and has nothing but respect for both Rod Allen and Mario Impemba (worthy successors to George and Al!).

<dd>Since you raised the issue, I went and checked <a href="../../../d/r/i/Category%7EDrinking_games_ed39.html" title="Category:Drinking games">Category:Drinking games</a>. Yes, it's well-populated ... but looking at a random selection of articles there, I was astounded at how many are utterly unsourced. And the one Google I did, on Thunderdome (drinking game) turned up one hit independent of Wikipedia or its mirrors, at barmeister.com, which I do not have the time to check for reliability.<br />
I think it's time to go through and winnow this category down some ... it's far too vulnerable to <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>-type stuff. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 14:06, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm going to have to agree that the category needs to be whittled down a bit. Wikipedia shouldn't become a drinking game repository. For reference, barmeister.com is of the "Submit a drinking game" variety, so its reliability is questionable; it's best as a backup source. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 14:57, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>you obviously didn't look hard enough, because I was able to find independent existence of this game.

<li>The so-called "independent existence" is the blog post linked to up top. As you'll note, it is three days old.<br />
As a rule you'll notice there are <i>no</i> TV-based drinking games in the drinking games category, because not only are they quintessential fancruft, they never really catch on and I doubt anyone actually plays them (Besides, they're not really games, just observations about the show's clichés made in the form of a drinking game.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Unfortunately, pretty much every link mentioning it is a blog, which do not count as reliable sources. And unless the Rod Allen Drinking Game becomes an enormous sweeping phenomenon, or outrageously popular, it won't merit an article. It is still not notable, not verifiable, an inside joke, and is basically something <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">made up at school one day</a>. The fact that it's barely half a week old is only one of the many, many reasons it should be deleted. I could just as easily create a <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Lange_abee.html" title="Mike Lange">Mike Lange</a> drinking game with drinks based on every time he says something outrageous, and it would just as easily be worth deleting. Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, nor should it become a catalyst for insignificant fads. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 21:24, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>who the heck is Mike Lange and why would you want a drinking game for him?!?!? That's preposterous. Like it ot not, Rod Allen is an excellent sportscaster and this article is without-a-doubt-relevant. And maybe one of the 10 links returned from google was a blog, the others were not; they were message boards. There is a very big difference between the two. --<a href="../../../x/9/6/User%7EX96lee15_8d24.html" title="User:X96lee15">X96lee15</a> 03:56, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This pretty clearly illustrates my point. Mike Lange is significant to the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Penguins_65f5.html" title="Pittsburgh Penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> and to <a href="../../../n/h/l/NHL_5702.html" title="NHL">NHL</a> fans and has his own drinking games. There's no difference between his significance and that of Rod Allen. About message boards: If you'd like I could make a post on hfboards (hockey fan boards) to spread the Mike Lange drinking game to prove message boards are also unreliable sources. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 12:12, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>While I don't care about Mike Lange, you have the right to create a Wikipedia article on him and/or his drinking game, if it's significant enough. If there is significant message board chatter, then I'm all for it. --<a href="../../../x/9/6/User%7EX96lee15_8d24.html" title="User:X96lee15">X96lee15</a> 13:25, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, quite the opposite is true. I do <i>not</i> have the right to create an article on a Mike Lange Drinking Game if there is significant message board chatter; message boards are not reliable sources. It would be very easy to create a message board fad- this is why articles like Happycat are constantly being deleted.

<li>Yeah, I agree with what you're saying. My only beef with this whole deletion is that there are other less-relevant (IMO) "Drinking Games" already on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> I first saw the term Rod Allen Drinking game on a Myspace comment that dates back to 7/6/2006. So the game wasn't invented 3 days ago, just posted on a blog a few days ago. I understand that Wikipedia does not feel like Myspace and blogs are good sources. But no matter how the game got notable, the fact is now the game is notable. People play the game. It was mentioned in the Free Press. If you search Rod Allen on Yahoo, the first "Also try" is "Rod Allen drinking game" <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Rod+Allen&amp;prssweb=Search&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2&amp;x=wrt" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Rod+Allen&amp;prssweb=Search&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2&amp;x=wrt" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> If you don't watch the games or know who Rod Allen is, I don't feel like you should decide if the game is notable or not. I dont expect people in California to find it notable, but in Detroit it is. Just because a thing is new, does not preclude it from a Wikipedia entry. --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatsHowIRoll_aada.html" title="User:ThatsHowIRoll">ThatsHowIRoll</a> 03:04, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>We have different opinions on the news piece. You seem to think it is about how the game got an article on Wikipedia. I feel like the article is about telling more people about the game, hence the <i>another Tigers-based fad is sweeping the state</i> line. Followed by the rules and an example of the game quoted from the Wikipedia article. Its not a nation thing, it a Michigan thing. I'm sure most people don't know the importance of <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_League_Chew_2167.html" title="Big League Chew">Big League Chew</a> to the Tigers, but in Detroit, everyone knows. The problem is that the Wikipedia article has become the sole source of the game.

<li>The "sweeping the state" line gains a lot of support based on the fact that it has a Wikipedia article.

<ul>
<li>I know. I also know that the game was widespread enough for someone to have thought about a news article about it, check wikipedia about it, and then note that Wikipedia has an entry on it. The game is obviously notable if you need notability to make a decision, and the game is now verifiable.

<li><b>Comment</b> I also want to remind people, one newspaper article does not make anything 'notable'. Notability standards usually require citing more than one major news source. Please look at a few of the Wiki guidelines. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wiki is not a Publisher of Original Thought</a> - Specifically - <i>Original inventions: If you invent the word frindle or a new type of dance move (or drinking game), it is not article material until a secondary source reports on it. Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day!</i> Since the newspaper article was written after the Wiki page, and refers specifically to the wiki page, the article is in violation of this rule. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Sources cite on an article must be Reliable</a> - Specifically - Wikipedia cannot cite itself as a source—that would be a self-reference. The newspaper article references the wiki article as a source, hence the wiki article would be self-referencing by using the newspaper article as a source to verify this game. The fact of the matter is, this article fails two of the Wiki policies on Article Standards. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">No Original Research</a>, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>, and the majority of anons in this discussion are not basing their statements on the Wiki Standards but on their personal feelings for a sports team.

<ul>
<li>So are you trying to say that the article would be okay if the Detroit Free Press had written the article and I created it today? The point is simple: this article does not run afoul of any sourcing as the subject has been reported about in a third party publication. We are not citing the article as a source, the Detroit Free Press is the source. Whether they relied on Wikipedia for part of the article isn't relevant. My stand is entirely within policy and guideline here. Just because the article was created two days earlier than you may have preferred doesn't mean it's a bad article now. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:08, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Jeff, the article most likely would not have been written if the wiki article was not here. But beyond that, one mention in one newspaper does not make this notable. Notability, as a guideline, usually requires three or more major news sources for verification. There is only one local newspaper mentioning this 'game' in only one small article. That, by most standards, is not enough for notability...especially as the article was written after the wiki article, and the 'game' has been shown to have few ghits. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 16:41, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Speculation as to whether the article would exist without the wiki article coming into play is idle speculation at best. Notability, as a statement of fact, has <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">no official policy</a>. The article, as it stands, is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> by a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, so it should stay. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:50, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you will throw out the few ghits and the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> citations as not worth paying attention to in this discussion. Because one Local newspaper gave a small article to this game, it should have an article? Well, I have been mentioned in the Fargo/Moorhead Forum numerous times, so I should have a large article as well, right? It's Verifiable by a Reliable source right? No, we have to look at the trinity of the Standards and the wiki article must meet all three..Neutral POV, Verifiable, AND No Original Research. Since the only source for this game (before the newspaper article) was a blog where the author admitted to making up the game, and there are no media mentions before the wiki article (or this DFP article) was made, this falls into OR. The DFP article only refers to Wiki as a source, which makes citing the DFP article in the wiki article self-referencing. There is no mention of the blog on this DFP article. We may also want to look at the fact that the DFP newspaper may fall into a 'trivial' newsource. It is not a national paper (it's local only) and is not nationally known. No other newspapers or media have picked up on this 'game'. The game itself is only a locally known thing, and only because of the wiki article and this newspaper article. Nationally or world wide, it is just unknown. If you dismiss all that, the wiki article does fail OR, and if an article fails any of the three main Standards so harshly, then I believe there really isn't any reason for the article to exist.--<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 17:13, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, we're just running around in circles at this point. The article is verifiable by the Detroit Free Press (highly non-trivial and nationally known), it's NPOV, and no longer/doesn't fail original research. I'm failing to see the problem. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:36, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article is trivial in both length and content, it sources Wikipedia, and the Detroit Free Press is "nationally known" on the basis that it has "Detroit" in its name. It is still a local newspaper- it just happens to be in a large city. The original research still stands- where did the material come from? Blogs and message boards. What did the news article add to the wikipedia entry? Nothing. It apparently can't be stressed enough that this article is <b>self-referencing</b>. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 17:54, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So it's a stub in reality. No problems there. As for the Detroit Free Press, it's the 12th largest paper by circulation in the US, that stands for something. Whether the material came from blogs is irrelevant, truly - the information was important enough to be used in a newspaper article. The news article itself may not add anything new to the article proper, but it does infer notability and verifability that may not have existed before. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:09, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, we are running around in circles, but I am not willing to concede to your point, jeff, that it somehow magically passes OR. Looking at the history <s>through untinted glasses</s> [Edit: I don't know if you are a Tiger's fan or not]] shows that this was OR when the AFD was created. The DFP article (trivial or not) still has the article falling short of multiple third-party sources. Since the article references Wiki as the source of this game, I can't, in good faith, accept the DFP article as a mention of notability or Verfibiliy. If the article had mentioned the blog AND there were other newspapers that had picked up on the story before the AFD, I would concede this had merit. As it stands, there isn't an article that references the blog (only verifiable source of this game outside of wiki), and so...it fails OR. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 17:58, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, this Red sox fan disagrees. It doesn't "magically pass" OR. It passes WP:OR easily, note the key phrase that applies here: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is <b>verifiability, not truth</b>." WP:V states "Articles should rely on credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy." The Detroit Free Press, <i>even if it notes the Wikipedia entry for this article</i>, meets this. The part you're attempting to cite here is at WP:RS: "Wikipedia is a tertiary source. Wikipedia cannot cite itself as a source—that would be a self-reference." Wikipedia is not citing itself in the article in question. The DFP article uses Wikipedia as a source, but that does not run afoul of policy. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:09, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Then you run into issues with verifiability. Who do we have to verify this by? A few blogs and message boards, which are not reliable sources. What does the local newspiece say? That Wikipedia mentioned the game, so therefore the game must be notable because it is on Wikipedia. This is very circular logic. Please also take into account the length, relevance, and content of the article and not just the fact that it mentions the game. If the circumstances were the same, but the subject in question were a dog winning a local dog show, would you consider it notable? --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 18:39, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The newspiece cites Wikipedia as an example of how widespread the game's popularity has gotten. That doesn't mean they're treating Wikipedia as a source, nor would that disqualify it. If the circumstances were the same, but the subject in question were a local, unknown dog, maybe it'd be different. This isn't about a dog or a little-known event, though. People who don't watch dog shows typically don't know the names of the dogs. The Detroit Tigers aren't a dog show. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:43, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The newspiece is citing Wiki as an example of how 'widespread' the game's popularity is...but a google search does not back up that claim nor is Wiki an example of popularity as anyone can make an article here. Just look at all these AFDs around this one. Are they automatically 'popular' because they are on wiki? And the DT's are not a dogshow...Yes, you are correct in that, HOWEVER we are not talking about the DT's nor are we talking about the merits of the game's link to the DTs. We are talking about if this Game had any notability beyond the blog that stated they created the game and it merits a page based on such criteria as only having one questionable source....a personal Blog. That stinks of OR. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 19:02, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, now we're getting somewhere. A Google search is a poor factor of notability, it's why we don't use Google as a verification tool when it comes to verifying notability. So we have to figure out what would be a proper notability situation. As it is a drinking game, it doesn't fit into the basic notability guidelines we have available, so let's look at another aspect: is it verifiable? The answer is yes. Is it original research? If it was before, it isn't now that it has the DFP mention. To quote the nonbinding notability essay (since you're insisting on notability here): "while all "famous" and "important" subjects are notable, not all notable subjects are famous or important." The article is verifiable, it doesn't run afoul of any major policies, so what's the problem? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:13, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's still an Internet forum which is not a reliable source, not verifiable, and personal, which qualifies as original research.

<li>This is not anywhere near hairsplitting at all and is actually a completely valid point that hits at the crux of the argument that the article from the Detroit Free Press is commenting on how relevant and popular the game has become, that there is now a wikipedia article about it. I'd also ask that you refrain from comparing innocent civilians dying due to oppressive governments to whether a newspaper article was using a wikipedia article as a source or not. For that wildly inappropriate and childish comment, I'll ask that all of your comments be stripped from the argument as they are an amalgamation of how you've been nothing but condescending, presumptuous, and pompous through out the whole debate rendering your side and those on it ineffective and exposing your arguments under the supercilious and pedantic light that you and those on your side inexplicably shine proudly from. 134.215.210.125 22:02, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article may have been tongue-in-cheek, but the fact remains that the Rod Allen Drinking Game is a real thing that has gotten quite a bit of attention (based on the newspaper article, message board posts from 2004 and the lengthy discussion here). The article was pointing out that the ALREADY EXISTING Rod Allen game phenomenon has gotten so big that it even has a wikipedia entry. It's sad that so many people want to have this article deleted. Also, it does not matter that the author of the article said it was a joke; from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>:</li>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">A good way to look at the distinction between verifiability and truth is with the following example. Suppose you are writing a Wikipedia entry on a famous physicist's Theory X, which has been published in peer-reviewed journals and is therefore an appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article. However, in the course of writing the article, you contact the physicist and he tells you: "Actually, I now believe Theory X to be completely false." Even though you have this from the author himself, you cannot include the fact that he said it in your Wikipedia entry.</td>

<li>Well, his Theory of Obscurity certainly exists, and much of the Residents' career is based upon it. He, or someone "playing" him has appeared onstage with the Residents at certain shows, and also appears in Vileness Flats, their feature film. "N. Senada" is highly unlikely to be his real name (IMHO it's a pun on "Ensenada", and in any case it sure doesn't sound like a Bavarian name). So it might be a psedonym of someone, or a character played by one of the Residents. It scarcely matters. He's been the subject of attention and speculation for more than three decades now. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 23:19, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd contend that the reason that particular citation was removed was due to its placement, more than its content. Further, Adonis Georgiades doesn't exactly leap out as a man with academic credentials beyond those perhaps in the teaching of language. William Percy, on the other hand (the man whose book review we're talking about) is a Senior Professor of History with a wide range of academic publications.

<dd>Yes. Well put.

<dd>I think there are serious problems with society if this material is taught in universities. Not everyone believes that it's true. Plato's work is not evidence and even if it was, that is one man, not an entire culture. I read that out of all the vases found, which is in the hundreds of thousands, only 30 have a homosexual theme. That is not enough evidence to support what this article is saying. If it is kept it needs a serious rewrite and possibly a different title and has to include a section about how this is debated.--<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.233.19.170.html" title="User:66.233.19.170">66.233.19.170</a> 07:57, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I have read Plato's work and other Greek literature such as the Illiad and there is nothing that implies homosexuality. There is no evidence to suggest Achilles and Patroclus were gay. There is no evidence to suggest Alexander the Great was bisexual. It is common sense biology that if you are born heterosexual you will not want to participate in sexual acts with someone of the same sex. A thousand years from now what are people going to say about our culture? Are football and soccer players homosexuals for taking showers together naked and saying gay slang terms to each other? No they are not. I was never taught Ancient Greeks participated in acts like this growing up in Australia and I hope noone else was taught this disturbing material. Homosexuality in Ancient Greece seems a fabricated myth by historians who have their own agenda.--<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.233.24.105.html" title="User:66.233.24.105">66.233.24.105</a> 07:25, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps it's a generational thing - I was certainly taught it at school in Australia. Regardless of its status as a fabrication, the fact remains that it's a generally-accepted academic view.

<li>If you were taught this in Australia then there must have been people who objected since there is a large Greek minority there. Furthermore throughout this discussion and throughout the article noone has even come close to proving the material is true. I beleive, and many others for that matter, that the material is false. Evidence points that way. There is no mention of homosexuality in Greek literature. And if there is a vase or picture found depicting something homosexual, it does not mean the entire culture was. They have pictures depicting warriors fighting three headed monsters. Does that mean Ancient Greece was filled with monsters. They have pictures depicting a half-man half bull. Does that mean they existed in Ancient Greece? The material is false and false material does not belong in an encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.233.24.105.html" title="User:66.233.24.105">66.233.24.105</a> 08:09, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I was in fact taught it <i>by</i> a Greek-Australian, but that's rather beside the point. The discussion here (as I explain in response to the large number of quotations) is not the place to "prove" that something is true or false. It's the place to talk about whether or not the article should be here. Given that the academic orthodoxy is that the information contained in the article is true, it belongs here. As for the contention that "false material does not belong in an encyclopedia", I would contend that it in fact does under two conditions. Firstly, it must be marked as being false (so an encyclopedia can talk about the idea that the sun revolves around the earth as long as it indicates that nobody in their right mind believes this now). Secondly, this marking of something much be done based on evidence. If there is evidence and scholarly opinion that Greek culture was not as this article says it was, then put it into the article. Don't post it here, because that's the wrong place. Don't try to get the article deleted, either.

<p>Plato, Euthydemus 282b there is no disgrace, Cleinias, or reprobation in making this a reason for serving and being a slave to either one's lover or any man, and being ready to perform any service that is honorable in one's eagerness to become wise.</p>
<p>Platos Symposium,</p>
<p>it is our rule that, just as in the case of the lovers it was counted no flattery or scandal for them to be willingly and utterly enslaved to their favorites, so there is left one sort of voluntary thraldom which is not scandalous; I mean, in the cause of virtue. It is our settled tradition that when a man freely devotes his service to another in the belief that his friend will make him better in point of wisdom, it may be, or in any of the other parts of virtue, this willing bondage also is no sort of baseness or flattery. Let us compare the two rules 184b</p>
<p>Xenophon Symposium 8.8 [8]Now, I have always felt an admiration for your character, but at the present time I feel a much keener one, for I see that you are in love with a person who is not marked by dainty elegance nor wanton effeminacy, but shows to the world physical strength and stamina, virile courage and sobriety. Setting one's heart on such traits gives an insight into the lover's character.</p>
<p>If we continue: Xenophon Symposium [26] Furthermore, the favourite who realizes that he who lavishes physical charms will be the lover's sovereign will in all likelihood be loose in his general conduct; but the one who feels that he cannot keep his lover faithful without nobility of character will more probably give heed to virtue. [27] But the greatest blessing that befalls the man who yearns to render his favourite a good friend is the necessity of himself making virtue his habitual practice. For one cannot produce goodness in his companion while his own conduct is evil, nor can he himself exhibit shamelessness and incontinence and at the same time render his beloved self-controlled and reverent"</p>
<p>Plato's Republic 403b "may not come nigh, nor may lover and beloved who rightly love and are loved have anything to do with it? No, by heaven, Socrates, he said, it must not come nigh them. Thus, then, as it seems, you will lay down the law in the city that we are founding, that the lover may kiss1 and pass the time with and touch the beloved as a father would a son, for honorable ends, if he persuade him."</p>
<p>All of these texts give a meaning of obtaining knowledge and virtue, none of them refer to anything sexual as you can see.--<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.233.19.170.html" title="User:66.233.19.170">66.233.19.170</a> 08:30, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>All fine and dandy (although bear in mind that we're talking about translations here, rather than the original Greek of Plato, Xenophon et al. Nonetheless, AfD is emphatically <b>not</b> a place to carry on a discussion about the "other side of a debate" in relation to an article which currently exists. The object here is to talk about whether or not the article itself should continue to exist - and a failure to encompass the "no" case in this situation isn't a reason to delete so much as a reason to add such a case to the article. If the article is indeed kept, these quotations, any analysis performed on them by scholars and any conclusions they reach will be handy talking points for expansion of the article.

<dd>You may have slightly misinterpreted what I was saying. The idea is to find academic sources (historians, linguists, classicists, younameitists) who interpret the passages you've quoted in the way that you just did. Just sticking those quotes in as "proof" isn't going to get you very far and almost certainly <i>will</i> get the section deleted. The reason that this is the "academic consensus" about Ancient Greece is that a bunch of academics subscribe to it are are indicated as doing as much in the article. If you can find one who says otherwise, I'm sure we're all ears (or eyes, in this case). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 09:00, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Those quotes are proof. They come from the primary source. How would you interpret them? I feel that they have absolutely no homosexual meaning.--<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.233.19.170.html" title="User:66.233.19.170">66.233.19.170</a> 09:24, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And therein lies the problem. Firstly, the quotes may well come from the primary source, but we're dealing in translations here. I don't speak a word of Ancient Greek, although you may well and simply not have revealed it, so we're actually hostage to what the scholars who <i>do</i> speak it tell us. As far as "how I would interpret them" (or indeed how you would interpret them), that's not actually the point. Wikipedia isn't a publisher of original analysis, but rather a synthesis of a series of analyses, which is what makes it an encyclopedia. The article currently has sources indicating that 4 learned scholars interpret things in a particular way, so that's what we're saying is the case. If you can find a learned scholar who interprets it a different way, then insert his interpretation. I'd also point out that the quotes you've posted are only the absolute tip of the iceberg where the writings of the Ancient Greeks were concerned, so it's not a great idea to base an opinion on that much evidence. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 09:31, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Regarding the World War II edit-I edited that because the content below was regarding to the Yugoslav, Greek, and Cretan campaigns. It did not say Greek on the subject line and I hadn't noticed the link broke. My edits tend to focus around Greece because that is what I am interested in and that is how I found this page.

<li><b>Comment</b>, the battle is called the Battle of Cretan or whatever. Adding Greece in there was, as I said, nonsensical. The point on your fascination with the country was just to point out that you're likely the same person as all the other "Delete" users here, all of which share that trait with you.

<li>I don't think the edit was nonsense. My Grandfather sacrificed a lot in the war and I figured his story should be remembered even if it is just the subject line. As for me being the same user, I'm sure the others are, but I am not. I made the account today and I started my first edits. I came across this page and voiced my opinion. I was never taught this in school or in anything I have read and natually find it hard to beleive.

<li>When did I insult your intelligence? Anyways, it's nonsense because it's not called <b>The Battle of Crete The Battle of Greece</b>. I also incredibly doubt your story. Your account was made after I pointed out that all of the IPs come from the same ISP. If it was made before that IP did anything, then maybe it's plausible. Your argument (it is very disturbing and I can't believe it) is also almost exactly what they say as well. Add to all this that you keep using colons instead of asterisks (like the others), and that you actually know what an AfD is and how to sign pages (unlike most users who are less than a day old), and we have ourself a possible sockpuppet. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 07:27, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Student organizations that exist at only a single school are generally non-notable. From what is verifiable, this is a student organization which publishes a journal, whose name was taken from another journal published in the same city more than 100 years before.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The only documented proof of this group is in the Baylor student newspaper, and even in the article written about them, it is fairly obvious that they started in 2004.

<p><b>Delete</b>. The article's subject is a non-notable video gamer. He has not competed in major leagues, and has not had any major media coverage. The arguments towards keeping, in its talk page have generally centered around the cash winnings, and that video games should be considered a sport. The cash winnings don't really serve any purpose towards establishing notability; games of all sorts are played for cash (ie. poker, arm wrestling tournaments, etc.), but the people who play those are still fairly unknown and not altogether fitting for an encyclopedia. As for video games as a sport; they are not treated the same, plain and simple. Even minor baseball or hockey players often get mentioned in the <b>Sports</b> section of newspapers, but you'd be challenged to find even a star of a videogamer there. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 08:26, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"A sport consists of a physical activity carried out with a recreational purpose for competition, for self-enjoyment, to attain excellence, for the development of a skill, or some combination of the above.

<dd>Although Electronic Sports don't require much in the way of muscle mass, they require dexterity which is a physical property. Professional Video Gaming is an industry in its evolution phase.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I am an Australian National University alumni and I have never heard of this organisation.

<p><b>delete all</b> per nom. The success of the series, or rather the lack thereof, makes me feel that none of these pages is likely to be missed on deletion.

<li>Because several people have copied a bad idea, using the very fallacious logic that you are using ("The existence of article X justifies the existence of article Y.").

Or Criticism of KKK. The <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> article has even made it to FA-status without even the word "criticism" in it, much less a section or a "criticism" spinnoff article.

<p><b>Delete</b> for two reasons: Non-notable and violation of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. First of all, the name of the person in question here is Bob Dean, not Bob Dobbs -- though I doubt he'll actually admit to it here. He's been hanging around the fringes of the Church of the SubGenius since the late 1980s, trying to pass himself off as the "real Bob Dobbs" (note he just calls himself "Bob Dobbs" and not the true "J.R. 'Bob' Dobbs"). Over the past 20 years or so, he did run a talk show on Canadian radio and he did produce a music CD called "Bob's Media Ecology" -- but this is hardly enough to warrant a Wikipedia entry. As for the rest of his claims, please note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "Def Con" video included in the article shows a guy who may be 40 to 50 years old -- certainly not someone born in 1922 as the article claims.</li>
<li>His real name (Bob Dean) is revealed in the news article listed in the links below ("<a href="http://www.modemac.com/media2/1993_toronto-globe_3-30-93.html" class="external text" title="http://www.modemac.com/media2/1993_toronto-globe_3-30-93.html" rel="nofollow">Things get ugly in the world of underground art</a>").</li>
<li>After being tricked into contributing to his "Bob's Media Ecology" CD, Negativland then disowned the song: <a href="http://www.negativland.com/negdisco.html" class="external free" title="http://www.negativland.com/negdisco.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.negativland.com/negdisco.html</a> -- scroll down to the entry "Tribal Mandate."</li>
<li>The Narduwar radio show link consists of him spending an hour talking about himself and his grand accomplishments. In addition to claiming to have "inspired" the Church of the SubGenius, on the same show he also claimed to have met Hitler, had inside knowledge of the JFK assassination, and predicted that a wonderful technological breakthrough involving magnetic energy and "healing" would be revealed to the world by 2001 or 2002. So much for verifiability.</li>
<li>In an interview with "Gray Areas" magazine, Rev. Ivan Stang tells his side of the story: that Dean showed up in 1987 claiming to be "Bob Dobbs." ( <a href="http://www.grayarea.com/subgenius.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.grayarea.com/subgenius.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.grayarea.com/subgenius.htm</a> - search for the word "Dean" in the article and you'll find it.) There is a plethora of evidence to show that the Church has used "Bob's" image and name since 1980. Dean has never shown any evidence proving that he "inspired" the Church of the SubGenius.</li>
<li>And finally, the links listed include a video of Dean talking about himself, a radio show interview where he talks about himself, a Web site where he talks about himself, a couple of zine article about him, and a Web-based message board consisting of postings about himself. All this shows that this article on "Bob Dobbs" is nothing more than an ego page. --<a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModemac_38eb.html" title="User:Modemac">Modemac</a> 11:36, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. In addition to all the evidence Modemac provides that Dean/Dobbs' claims to notability are false, I note that he claims to have been "active in key international intelligence agencies after World War II". Intelligence work is always a popular claim to fame among hoaxers; the question of sourcing is <i>not</i> disposed of by claiming that intelligence agencies wouldn't let any such information appear in verifiable sources, but that is cheerfully skipped over by the hoaxers.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I am Douglass St. Clair Smith, pen name Rev. Ivan Stang, main author of The Book of the SubGenius (1983), subsequent SubGenius books, the SubGenius RPG, the movie ARISE!, The Hour of Slack syndicated show and the earliest SubGenius materials from 1980 and even before. I would swear in a court of law or anywhere else that the character of J. R. "Bob" Dobbs is not in any way based on this fellow calling himself Bob Dobbs. His story that he met Dr. Philo Drummond and myself in the 1970s is simply not true. There is no evidence that the person I know as Bob Dean started calling himself Bob Dobbs before 1987 or so. In 1988 he and his wife visited me in Dallas, and he announced to me that, because of various supernatural powers which he claimed to have, he was therefore the embodiment of the "Bob" character and would henceforth play "Bob" Dobbs on his Toronto radio show. I considered him a kook and politely asked that he not go around saying he was "Bob" Dobbs. He did not take my advice. Evidently it angered him to learn that rather than being fellow believers, the Church of the SubGenius was actually composed of skeptics and mockers, because since then, in his every interaction with "SubGeniuses" he has behaved like an angry spurned fan. It is distressing to me to think that this person has used the popularity of our work to convince gullible unfortunates that he is the "Bob" referred to in our books. But, were this guy the real "Bob," wouldn't we who write the SubGenius books and produce the radio shows RESPECT him? In fact, he is has been a long-time laughing-stock to the SubGenius fans at large. To me he seems at best a depressing casualty and at worst a deliberate con man. --revstang 13:23, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> because:
<ul>
<li>The man named Bob Dobbs, that is now featured on the new Bob_Dobbs page has a verifiable body of public and academic work bearing this name, including a regular radio show on CKLN radio in Toronto during the 1980s.</li>
<li>A section was added to this page describing the claim to the name. This page is called "Bob Dobbs". We include a link to J.R. "Bob" Dobbs to eliminate ambiguity.</li>
<li>The fact you seem to think that the Bob Dobbs in the video and interview merely talks about himself, is besides the point and not within the scope of whether this man should have claim to this page.</li>
<li>The School of McLuhan Studies at University of Toronto seems to vouch for Bob Dobbs' identity. See <a href="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss3/program.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss3/program.htm" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. There are also several FCC and CRTC-licensed radio and TV stations that have aired this man as "Bob Dobbs". If you need any other points resolved, let me know and I'll dig them up, otherwise, don't waste my time with these false allegations of non-verifiability and non-notability.</li>
<li>Just because the Church of the Subgenius holds a position about this man's identity does not mean it should be rammed down the throats of non-followers. Again, you have your J.R. "Bob" Dobbs page where you can post your own definition of Bob. Stang has referred to his icon as J.R. "Bob" Dobbs predominantly over the years.

<p>Do Not Delete! The Bob Dobbs page represents a neutral point of view (POV) by offering information on both sides of this longstanding tiff between the Subgenii (followers of a cartoon Bob) and the followers of the real person named Bob Dobbs. It is not necessary to prove "who" came first. Why should Wiki get involved in this dispute? It's only necessary to keep both of these posts alive. Secondly, Time Magazine's Top 100 Phonies of the Century (in 2000), in which Bob Dobbs appeared as #1, was a list of real people, not cartoons. Nowhere on this list are they speaking of a cartoon drawing. This is where Wiki's rule of patent nonsense enters and the Subgenii are the guilty ones there. Wiki must stay neutral on this by its own rule. - Tina-Bob <i>Tina-Bob (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tina-Bob_7663.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tina-Bob">contribs</a>) has exactly two edits, one to Talk:Bob Dobbs and one to this AfD.</i></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Doug, if it's J.R. Dobbs you're looking for, this is not the right article. This article was meant with all seriousness. I have been tracking and archiving Bob Dobbs material since I first heard Bob's Media Ecology in 1995. I thought that with all I have learned about him over the last 11 years, and the fact he is being asked to appear in the media more and more lately, it was time to create a Wikipedia page about him. To do this, I needed to create an account. I will be contributing more about other subjects in the future, but, for now, this is one I am most interested in. It was not an ego job as suggested above. There is actually a man with the name Bob Dobbs who is not the cartoon character you chose to represent your organization. Doug, do not abuse the deletion function of Wikipedia, unless you want to help degrade Wikipedia's integrity. Rather than deleting the page, let's work together to describe the whole situation rather than just choosing one side. I thought Monsquaz already did an excellent job of pointing out the differences. Is there just a particular fact you are disputing? Octavian1 20:07, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Modemac's use of the phrase "minor in scope" is highly subjective. Besides, is it a matter of scope or scale? Google test: There are many Google results for "Bob Dobbs" in relation to the man featured on this page. Verifiability (Some say): you will see verifiability in evidence on the pages linked to from the wiki page, as well as the Google results. I think this is turning into an issue of politics and ego from the Church of Subgenius group, rather than adhering to the principles of information integrity that Wikipedia stands for. Many of the statements in favour of deletion are examples of value judgements and subjectivity rather than scholarly objectivity. This is an act of Wiki page deletion abuse by the Subgenius straw men. Octavian1 21:07, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No-no-no! Do Not Delete</p>
<p>Time Magazine’s list of phonies and frauds (2000) was talking about the real Bob Dobbs because the other Bob Dobbs is the cartoon “religious leader” of the Church of the Subgenius. As you will see on their website, (<a href="http://www.time.com/time/time100/phonies/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.time.com/time/time100/phonies/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/time100/phonies/index.html</a>) Time excluded religious leaders from the countdown:</p>
<p>Over the past 100 years, in the midst of all the wonders of progress, there grew a thing called hype. Hype swirls and obfuscates, both hiding the truth and creating the lie. It can be as harmless as the latest pop star saturation, and as insidious as a two-faced government official. In recognition of this phenomenon, TIME.com has built a list, based on nominations from its web users, of individuals who are candidates for the title of the century's worst scammer, con artist, media manipulator, grifter, liar or charlatan. This list originally included a number of religious leaders. But we are convinced by protests from offended supporters that their inclusion, no matter how well justified in some cases by their behavior, might well stimulate an attitude of contempt for others' religious beliefs. - Tina-Bob</p>
<dl>
<dd>And then <i>Time</i> magazine made a further comment on J.R. "Bob" Dobbs himself in their February 7, 2000 issue: "A few weeks ago, we published the results of our online poll in which folks submitted their two cents' worth on the movers and shakers, frauds and bloopers of the 20th century in "Readers Speak: Down with Geraldo" [NOTEBOOK, Jan. 1]. Under the category "Phony or Fraud of the 20th Century," we listed as first-place winner J.R. ("Bob") Dobbs, who earned 20.46% of the vote (Geraldo Rivera was second, and O.J. Simpson third).

<b>Delete</b> For the reasons so eloquently put forth by Stang and Modemac. It is clear that Bob Dean is attempting to co-opt the identity of (the fictional) Bob Dobbs.</p>

<p>Do Not Delete: The Church of the Subgenius has no grounds to assert copyright infringement on a name. Bob Dobbs is a popular media ecologist, radio personality, author and philosopher who has absolutely nothing to do with the Church of the Subgenius in any way. Any similarity between them is name only. There can be many Bob Dobbses just as there are many John Smiths. Indeed, Wikipedia attempts to list many John Smiths: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_smith" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_smith" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_smith</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps if Wikipedia heard from more people named Bob Dobbs, this dispute could be settled amicably. But the problem now seems to be that there are ONLY two of them!</p>
<p>Since others have begun to repeat themselves, I will repeat Wikipedia has no grounds to get involved in a legal dispute between two characters who share the same name. Wikipedia must remain neutral, and this means having a page devoted to both Bob Dobbses. - Tina-Bob</p>
<p>Let me correct that. These characters don't even share the same name. One is J. R. "Bob" Dobbs and the other is Bob Dobbs. (Notice the initials preceding and the name in quotes. This comes directly from the Subgenius website.) Wikipedia cannot take sides in this dispute any more than it could take sides in a dispute brought by a John Smith who claimed R.J. "John" Smith stole his identity. Wikipedia must look at the accomplishments, alone and unfettered, of the one who goes by Bob Dobbs. Wikipedia can ask for the page to be edited, but there's no logical basis here for deletion of the page. - Tina-Bob</p>
<dl>
<dd>And let me correct this by noting that this deletion in process has nothing to do with copyright infringement. It has everything to do with <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which has not been improved or verified by anything said here. --<a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModemac_38eb.html" title="User:Modemac">Modemac</a> 23:53, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do Not Delete! Apparently most people understand this argument to be about identity theft so perhaps it's not as "eloquent" as it could be: (i.e. "Delete For the reasons so eloquently put forth by Stang and Modemac. It is clear that Bob Dean is attempting to co-opt the identity of (the fictional) Bob Dobbs.") I would think that if you wanted to distance your Dobbs from the embarrassing minor Bob Dobbs, you would welcome a Wikipedia page so as to minimize the confusion between them. But that's not what you want so your motives are highly suspect. - Tina-Bob</p>
<p><b>KEEP.</b> As a member of the Church who knows Mr. Dean for the fraud he is, I do not wish his falsification of character and inspiritation to be hidden anywhere.

<p>What I have and would like to raise a comment could this if allowed to must be used as a case forcing the current owner Stang out of the very Church he help setup because its influence is noted by Bob Dobbs and the Real "Bob".

I value freedom of speech and all more so with the agrugement 'ck em if they cant take a joke.

<p>"It is not necessary to prove "who" came first. Why should Wiki get involved in this dispute? It's only necessary to keep both of these posts alive."</p>
<p>Well most would consider when a topic goes for deletion that its border line flamewar, which judging how quickly my previous comment was snipped shows how quickly things are edited. Its an old issue that seems to be revisited because someone felt up to putting it up... sie, thus we look at why wiki gets involved and snip this in the butt... this is a referance book of referance books yes? what myspace does for the social realm, wiki does for the scholar world.

<li><b>Delete</b> is at present time both my vote and my personal preference, the chief reason being that Wikipedia should avoid where possible adding to the leverage of a scammer. I have had (very limited) dealings with Stang, and someone who would pirate this gentleman's good yet undercompensated work deserves no free ride anywhere. Tina-Bob's certainty is QUITE a bit more suspect and specious than Stang's character could ever be in my estimation, <i>especially since Tina-Bob's contributions are entirely limited to this discussion.</i> Sock Puppet much? Similar observations can be made about two other keep voters (temujin, Octavian), which greatly adds to the weight for the case that this is a matter of vanity and self-promotion. For this reason, I suggest that the Wiki is best off without this Bob Dobbs, no matter the tests he might marginally 'pass.' If the article is kept, it is certain to be written by these SP's. Not a good situation for the Wiki. <b>adendum</b> These parties with no posting history are also the ones pitting the "human" pseudo-Bob against a "cartoon" Bob, a theme which none of the regular users here has taken up. This attempt to devalue the genuine labor and dedication Stang has given to his work (a "joke" religion that has spread the gospel of skepticism and critical thinking in spiritual matters for decades) does not wash. The symbol of the SubGenii may be a "cartoon," but the Church is driven by a flesh-and-blood engine. Few of us have had the task of shepherding the survival of an "against-the-grain" movement like Stang's, and we only need look at the casualty rates to know what a task it must be. None disagree that Stang has been injured by so-called "Dobbs." What desperate cause motivates the parties above to add insult? "The School of McLuhan Studies at University of Toronto seems to vouch for Bob Dobbs' identity?" I hope none were too lazy to examine the link; they permitted "Dobbs" to give a 15-minute talk eight years ago. I should hope that all of us have had greater days of glory than that. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBustter_0784.html" title="User:Bustter">Bustter</a> 09:28, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>1. There is currently rampant confusion about the two Bob Dobbses. People generally believe they are the same identity.</p>
<p>2. There is an assumption being made here that when someone enters the name Bob Dobbs into a search engine they’re looking for information on the cartoon Dobbs church guy. This is an unprovable assertion. What many people may actually be looking for is clarification between the two personages or indeed they may have heard Bob on the radio. The Church of the Subgenius may even be taking advantage of this enormous misunderstanding. Perhaps the Church wants to continue the obfuscation of the two Bob Dobbses because the defunct Church is actually riding on the coattails of the real Bob, who is a more active radio/media person, and the old defunct cartoon Bob has seen better days (i.e. isn’t funny anymore).</p>
<p>3. Is Wikipedia about “famous people” or is it about “information”? If it’s about famous people, both Bob Dobbses should be excluded, because one’s not “famous” outside Toronto (do we have a definition of “famous”?) and the other is a cartoon illustration. But if Wikipedia is about information and if its task is to be the largest encyclopedia in the world, its mission should be clarification of the two Bob Dobbses so that people understand clearly that there are two of them.</p>
<p>4. Time Magazine excluded religious leaders from the Top Phonies of the Century countdown, but in their confusion about who Bob Dobbs is (yes, even they are confused!), they merged the identities of both the real and the cartoon. But in omitting religious leaders from the list, we are to understand that the cartoon Bob was shown the door.</p>
<p>As stated in #1, the Bob Dobbs confusion is pernicious and the goal of Wikipedia should be democratic clarification of the issue, not fascist obfuscation at the primary directive of the owner of one of the names! Oi-vei! 13:51, 8 August 2006 (UTC) Tina-Bob</p>

<p>Many people in the Church of the SubGenius are direct witnesses to the falsehood of his claim that he is the "real" Bob Dobbs. The 'controversy' stemmed from Dean's claim that he was the inspiration for the Church after its founders, <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Stang_e677.html" title="Ivan Stang">Ivan Stang</a> and friend Philo Drummond, first met him in Dallas in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, and his routine, unapproved use of the Church trademark and terms in his radio show on CKLN. Stang has denied this Dallas meeting<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, noting that he is a scam artist whose real name is Bob Dean.</p>
<p>Dean claimed in a 1998 phone interview<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> with <a href="../../../n/a/r/Nardwuar_the_Human_Serviette_d524.html" title="Nardwuar the Human Serviette">Nardwuar the Human Serviette</a> that there is no Bob Dean, and the name first came about when CKLN-FM journalist Bob Marshall, whom Dean associated with when working on his CKLN show with Myke Dyer, was seen in the company of Dean's wife Connie in Toronto, who supposedly took on the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pen_name.html" title="Pen name">nom de plume</a> of Dr. Carolyn Dean (after Garrett Deane, a personal friend of Bob and Connie from Nova Scotia). It was then assumed that Marshall was Connie/Carolyn's husband, and that "Marshall" was simply a pseudonym. Furthermore, Dean claimed that Stang's public denouncement is merely a behind-the-scenes cover for a "John the Baptist" type operation to provide ground for his work. Unfortunately for his cover story, which he designed in order to co-opt the "Connie Dobbs" character found throughout Church publications, Dean's 'Connie' - in addition to being his wife - was actually a registered M.D. in Toronto, registered under her actual name, Carolyn Dean. After being <a href="http://www.cpso.on.ca/Search/SearchResults.asp?SrchText=carolyn+dean&amp;Method=and&amp;Area=Entire+website" class="external text" title="http://www.cpso.on.ca/Search/SearchResults.asp?SrchText=carolyn+dean&amp;Method=and&amp;Area=Entire+website" rel="nofollow">defrocked</a> for various irregularities, she moved her <a href="http://www.carolyndean.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.carolyndean.com/" rel="nofollow">practice</a> to the US and has become involved in 'naturopathic' medicine - interestingly, on both her site and the 'Rebirth of Bob Dobbs' article referenced below, her 2005 radio show "Building Organic Bodies" was mentioned - once as hers and once as his, respectively.</p>
<p>In the meantime, in addition to his apparent regular fraudulent use of the Church of the SubGenius' trademark during his radio years, Bob Dean has occasionally pursued a low-level netstalking career centered around Ivan Stang and the Church, posting under the handle 'purple' on the Church Usenet group alt.slack, as seen <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=group%3Aalt.slack+author%3Apurple&amp;start=0&amp;scoring=d&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb=q&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1981&amp;as_maxd=8&amp;as_maxm=8&amp;as_maxy=2006&amp;safe=off&amp;" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=group%3Aalt.slack+author%3Apurple&amp;start=0&amp;scoring=d&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb=q&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1981&amp;as_maxd=8&amp;as_maxm=8&amp;as_maxy=2006&amp;safe=off&amp;" rel="nofollow">here</a>, perpetuating his virtual identity theft for effect.

He has also granted interviews under the fictitious name Bob Dobbs, and encourages the intended confusion with 'J. R. "Bob" Dobbs' by deliberately allowing those who write about him to portray him as associated with the Church - occasionally resulting in other fraudulent publications, as seen in the 'Rebirth of Bob Dobbs' article <a href="http://www.eightbit.com/rebirth_of_bob_dobbs.php/" class="external text" title="http://www.eightbit.com/rebirth_of_bob_dobbs.php/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. His 'SubGenius' act also temporarily fooled famed collage musicians Negativland into producing a spot for a Bob's Media Ecology record. Their statement disavowing this work as the result of "gross misrepresentation" can be found in their discography <a href="http://www.negativland.com/negdisco.html" class="external text" title="http://www.negativland.com/negdisco.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> (scroll down to 'Tribal Mandate').</p>

<p><b>regarding verifiablility</b></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>the McLuhan Program at the University of Toronto did indeed host this fellow 'for fifteen minutes' in 1998, as linked: <a href="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss3/program.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss3/program.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss3/program.htm</a> , billing him as 'Bob Dobbs'. I wasn't aware of this. Not mentioned is the fact that the McLuhan Program hosted him for a solo lecture on November 24, 2003, which ran for over three hours. I don't know exactly how to verify this fact, but it's on video and that mural would be hard to forge.</p>
<p>Donald Theall, in his recent book 'The Virtual McLuhan' (his second on the subject, with another on James Joyce), acknowledges first that the idea for the book 'arose out of a number of serendipitous meetings with Robert Dobbs'.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0773531548/102-3331598-4620145?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0773531548/102-3331598-4620145?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0773531548/102-3331598-4620145?v=glance&amp;n=283155</a>)</p>
<p>In fall 2004 Toronto hosted the first 'McLuhan Festival of the Future', for which Bob Dobbs (billed as such) was given a solo event at the Drake Hotel (one of the official (that is, not in any way marginal) venues of the festival), which was advertised in the official program for the festival as a lecture on 'McLuhan and the future of ESP' (that is, not advertised as performance art by a satirist or marginal jokester, but "former McLuhan archivist and broadcaster Bob Dobbs"). Coverage of this event, including the name 'Bob Dobbs', appeared in Toronto's NOW magazine: (<a href="http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2004-10-21/news_story5.php" class="external free" title="http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2004-10-21/news_story5.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2004-10-21/news_story5.php</a>), Eye Weekly: (<a href="http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_10.14.04/op/wanderingeye.php" class="external free" title="http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_10.14.04/op/wanderingeye.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_10.14.04/op/wanderingeye.php</a>), as well as in the Toronto Star, which article is transcribed at: (<a href="http://www.flyingdogshow.com/bobdobbs/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.flyingdogshow.com/bobdobbs/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flyingdogshow.com/bobdobbs/index.html</a>), though I don't know about a link to the paper itself. The Walrus reviewed the festival; Mark Federman, Chief Strategist of the McLuhan Program wrote a response titled "too bad [the reviewer] completely missed the festival!" emphasizing Bob's event as a particularly "fabulous session": (<a href="http://www.walrusmagazine.com/article.pl?sid=05/01/13/1659225" class="external free" title="http://www.walrusmagazine.com/article.pl?sid=05/01/13/1659225" rel="nofollow">http://www.walrusmagazine.com/article.pl?sid=05/01/13/1659225</a>)</p>
<p>His lengthy essay on McLuhan was also published recently in an anthology which I don't have the link for. Author: 'Bob Dobbs'.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the result of a successfully spreading fraud, but I couldn't help but not notice a single reference to the Church of the SubGenius nor its mythology in any of those contexts. Bob's audience is wider than it is usually made to seem on alt.slack, his shpiel is distinctive, and he has introduced new concepts and frameworks to his field of McLuhan studies which many in that field find valuable and in the spirit of McLuhan himself.</p>
<p>I don't know if the above reputable verifiability of a name-recognition meets Wikipedia's standards for a notable person, however.</p>
<p>But it's weird that you linked to my post on the forum</p>
<p>any reason?</p>
<p>Ad Absurdum 05:53, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Sure. See messages 7 and 8 in the thread.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, every single instance in which Dean uses the name Bob Dobbs is a specific reference to the Church of the SubGenius and its mythology. There is NO instance where he uses it before encountering the Church. Thus, each of the mentions you present are merely aditional instances of his fraudulent attempt to gain unearned reputation by referring to the Church. Pennames are fine, but I doubt that going around the vanity press presenting my spiel using the name "Astroboy" would be an acceptable reason for my fans to hijack Astroboy's wikipedia entry.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>"the vanity press"??</p>
<p>I didn't even claim anything other than 'these links are verifiable'.</p>
<p>Pardon me for being annoyed that the SubGenii would rather believe he "isn't even a proper mcluhanatic, he's JUST a rip-off" who lectured to a "canadian holiday inn meeting room" (both quotes: Rev. Ivan Stang on alt.slack) than a sometimes highly respected McLuhanatic who lectured to the one and only McLuhan Program at U of T, and the one and only McLuhan Festival.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> From what you say, it appears that he has been allowed to speak at those two venues once each, in years past. He has evidently not been invited back to either since. There are reports online from witnesses of his Feb. 2005 McLuhan Festival appearance that most of the audience walked out on his "seance" with the "ghosts" of Marshall McLuhan and Frank Zappa long before the show was over. You also neglect to mention that Dean's act was singled out, in the newspaper articles you cite, as an example of what makes the McLuhan Festival "kooky." The reason that his claim to be THE "Bob" Dobbs of SubGenius fame (or his claimed age of 84) is not mentioned in those articles is likely because professional journalists try to avoid reporting obvious untruths. If he is "highly respected," why does his name not crop up in more of the legitimate McLuhan forums and books? In fact he was banned from at least one such forum because of his abrasive manner and repeated unverified claims of personal connections to McLuhan, such as that he is in mystic contact with the shade of the deceased Canadian philosopher. He has a small reputation among some radio talk shows that he phones (i.e. at WCSB in Cleveland), but it is as a pest. I have recordings that serve as excellent examples of typical harrassment calls by him. When he is dismissed he calls back repeatedly, shrieking what he evidently considers to be powerful "code" phrases. Radio talk show hosts at New York stations, and guests on shows that he has called (such as Paul Krassner), have told me of very similar bouts of phone harrassment by Dean. The most recent one that Krassner quoted to me just last year involved Dean very specifically refering to himself as the "Bob" of the Church of the SubGenius and even adding that he was smoking a pipe like the one shown in the famous "Dobbshead" picture. -- RevStang 18:47, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

It's interesting to study the nature of Dean's two much-vaunted forays into 'academia':</p>
<p>Dean's quite fraudulent <a href="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss3/participants.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss3/participants.htm" rel="nofollow">bio</a> from the U of T appearance:</p>
<p>"Bob Dobbs was born in Paris and after World War Two worked with international intelligence agencies for many decades. He surfaced in 1987 on CKLN-FM in Toronto and began whistle-blowing. Two interpretations of Dobbs are circulating in the popular media: one is through the Church of the SubGenius that Dobbs inspired in 1978 in Dallas; the other is on two CDs, Bob's Media Ecology and Bob's Media Ecology Squared, put out in 1992 by Time Again Productions, early students of Marshall McLuhan. The best presentation of Dobbs' work is in his book, Phatic Communion with Bob Dobbs. Today, he travels the world explaining his/our victory over the Android Meme, and the tracings of these activities are regularly published in Flipside magazine."</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2004-10-21/news_story5.php" class="external text" title="http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2004-10-21/news_story5.php" rel="nofollow">description</a> of Dean's presentation at the McLuhan festival:</p>
<p>"I'm in an overseas phone seance at the Drake Hotel called McLuhan And The Future Of ESP, part of the McLuhan International Festival Of The Future. There've been films, art installations, tech businesses schmoozing for venture capital, and now someone's on the blower from England who speaks to the dead.</p>
<p>The medium, Glow, relates the doings of three ghosts, James (Joyce?), Frank (Zappa?) and Mac (McLuhan?), who communicate through sketch comedy. Apparently, they're on unicycles and have heads that pop open like beer steins.</p>
<p>On the Toronto end with a microphone is Bob Dobbs, former student and archivist of Marshall McLuhan. He can quote passages verbatim from the master's quixotic media theories like a carnival barker.</p>
<p>"The lids are on their heads?" asks Dobbs, seeking clarification from Glow. "And one of them is on the bike? Is it moving?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. The wheel is an ear; it's like a giant ear."</p>
<p>"A giant ear? Ho! That's tremendous."</p>
<p>This goes on past midnight. "</p>
<p><br />
Quite the academic, this Bob Dean. Let's face it, the guy's a con artist, and the preplanned vandalism of this wikipedia topic by his few fans - undertaken specifically to aggravate the holders of the real SubGenius franchise, whose intellectual property he routinely appropriates as his own - is just another extension of his netstalking campaign against Ivan Stang and the Church. It should not stand.</p>
<p><b>KEEP</b> This is Eli Elliott, the filmmaker who documented the Bob Dobbs in question during his 2005 Los Angeles Tour. I attended 4 different venues where Bob spoke, each event was near capacity except one which was around 50% attendance. Many individuals at the events where aware of Bob, knew him as 'Bob Dobbs', and also were well aware of his work in connection with Marshall Mcluhan and Media Ecology. Bob was also the main guest for a radio program with well known, award winning radio host, Martin Perlich. On the show he was referred to as both Robert and Bob Dobbs. One event I attended was a private Mcluhan study group consisting of individuals who for several years have met regularly for 3 hour sessions studying the work of Marshall Mcluhan; his teachings, writings, interviews, and also books from authors who wrote on Mcluhan. They all were familiar with Bobs reputation as a lecturer/teacher of Mcluhan studies, and identified him somewhere in the top 10 as most knowledgeable on the teachings of Marshall Mcluhan. And they all knew him as Bob Dobbs. Bob met with this group, spoke, and answered many questions. The group was pleased and very impressed with Bobs knowledge of Mcluhan and commented afterwards they had gained a better understanding of the subject matter. I had personally been to previous meetings with this group and gained more information and understanding on Marshall Mcluhan and media ecology from the Dobbs visit, than from the other visits combined. Through the internet, radio, documentary video, public speaking events, and private individual and group sessions, it is verifiable that this individual is known as Bob Dobbs. Through these same outlets it is verifiable that this individual is considered a leader in the field of media ecology/Marshall Mcluhan studies, and is considered as possessing strong knowledge of the subject matter in which he speaks.

<p><b>KEEP</b> Irrelevant of the former Mr. Dean's identity as "Bob" Dobbs, the controversy regarding his claims bears mention as an element of THE ETERNAL MYSTERY that is the Church of the Subgenius.

<p>The McLuhan Festival has had only one other installment, and they hardly invited anyone related to McLuhan in the academic sense, more technology and design showcases and panels.

<p>I neglect? I'm on wikipedia. I figure they're more interested in who the organizers invited than what reviewers said, except as a record of the use of the name. In precisely that sense, the singled-out opinion I did not neglect was that of the UofT McLuhan Programs 'Chief Strategist' at the time, Mark Federman.</p>

<p>In fact?? Perhaps, but you neglect to substantiate this claim, especially the second part of it.</p>
<p>If I just went to the links currently available, I'd find Federman saying the festival 'seance' was "fabulous" (that would be a 'proper mcluhanatic' who writes academic papers and that sort of thing staying to the end and not just a crowd of the curious (and, in many cases, drunk), cutting out early), and I'd find Bob's statements about this 'mystic contact' on alt.slack, which emphasized not believing them, but being willing to ask questions.</p>

<p>The average number of people who read a solo Dean announcement on his forum (<a href="http://www.fivebodied.com/viewforum.php?f=4&amp;sid=818b753951973b55cc3503651c09948f" class="external free" title="http://www.fivebodied.com/viewforum.php?f=4&amp;sid=818b753951973b55cc3503651c09948f" rel="nofollow">http://www.fivebodied.com/viewforum.php?f=4&amp;sid=818b753951973b55cc3503651c09948f</a>) is about 20. Usually it takes a couple of weeks for that many people to get around to reading a Dean post. Only about a dozen people actively post to the forum. If a post generates responses, the numbers go up as people repeatedly examine the thread to see if there's anything new, but obviously it is not a very large or active forum.</p>

<p>A click on the "website" URLs of any of these so-called "members" gets you a sleazy ad or else a nonsense site that probably carries a virus or spyware.</p>
<p>On the legit SubGenius end, there are 3 different Yahoo e-lists (subgenius, X-Day, and Euro-SubGenius), plus alt.slack, alt.binaries.slack, and alt.binaries.multimedia.slack on Usenet. Alt.slack is classified as a "high volume" Usenet group (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.slack/about" class="external free" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.slack/about" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/alt.slack/about</a>). It carried 8697 posts during July 2006. There are generally about 50 people participating.</p>
<p>The main SubGenius website, subgenius.com gets an average of 19,000 visits a day. Not hits, but visits. A look at the SubSITE links page (<a href="http://subgenius.com/contact.htm" class="external free" title="http://subgenius.com/contact.htm" rel="nofollow">http://subgenius.com/contact.htm</a>) reveals many dozens of spin-offs and fan sites.</p>
<p>The Church of the SubGenius has a mailing list of about 5,000 current active $30 dues-paying members. Over 30,000 have joined since we started in 1980, but we have lost contact with most of them over the 26 year period. We currently get an average of three new Members a day. By "member" I don't mean somebody signing up on a free Internet guest list, I mean people who sent us $30 for the ordainmant package.</p>
<p>The first SubGenius pamphlet was written in 1979 by myself and Philo Drummond, was published in January 1980, and is copyrighted that year with a copy deposited in the Library of Congress.</p>
<p>The first SubGenius radio show, Puzzling Evidence, started at KPFA in Berkeley in 1982 and is still on the air weekly.</p>
<p>THE BOOK OF THE SUBGENIUS was published by McGraw-Hill in 1983. It is still in print (now from Simon &amp; Schuster) and has sold somewhere around 100,000 copies. REVELATION X is due to be reprinted in 2007 by Thunder's Mouth Press. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671770063/104-1363251-2055919?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671770063/104-1363251-2055919?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671770063/104-1363251-2055919?v=glance&amp;n=283155</a>) Thunder's Mouth is also releasing our new book THE SUBGENIUS PSYCHLOPAEDIA OF SLACK -- THE BOBLIOGRAPHON this October (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1560259396/104-1363251-2055919?redirect=true" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1560259396/104-1363251-2055919?redirect=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1560259396/104-1363251-2055919?redirect=true</a>). The out-of-print "THREE FISTED TALES OF "BOB" anthology has stories by William Burroughs, R A Wilson, John Shirley, Lew Shiner, Mark Mothersbaugh and others.</p>
<p>Dean compiled and self-published a 130-page book (although half of it is comprised of quotes from other writers that he simply copied from other sources). It is called "Phatic Communion with Bob Dobbs" but it is copyrighted 1992 by "Robert Dean." It has not been in print for many years.</p>
<p>There is no evidence whatsoever of Dean calling himself "Bob Dobbs" before THE BOOK OF THE SUBGENIUS was published. His story of meeting Philo and me in 1978 is a lie or a delusion.</p>
<p>The SubGenius radio show called THE HOUR OF SLACK was first broadcast at KNON in Dallas in October, 1985. We are currently carried on 23 broadcast stations in the U.S. and Canada. (<a href="http://subgenius.com/ts/hos.html" class="external free" title="http://subgenius.com/ts/hos.html" rel="nofollow">http://subgenius.com/ts/hos.html</a>) We haven't tried to count the number of Internet streams and "pirate radio" outlets. We are presently on episode #1,060. Guests on the show (in the station) have included Robert Anton Wilson, Negativland, Paul Krassner, Hal Robins.</p>
<p>Dean, on the other hand, has not had his own show in well over a decade since he was fired from CKLN. (And the "SubGenius jargon" he used on that show -- references to "Pinks," "The Xists," etc. -- all came from THE BOOK OF THE SUBGENIUS.) He was on a Toronto show as guest with conspiracy theorist Nelson Thall a few years ago, but that only lasted 17 episodes before Dean was removed from the show. The Toronto station CKLN, which originally broadcast his show in the 90s, is now playing old reruns of it once per month. The same station plays new HOURS OF SLACK every week. HOUR OF SLACK showcases many new bands, sound collagists, and "ranters." It is almost entirely original material, by many contributors.</p>
<p>Notables who have joined the Church include the late Ken Kesey, David Byrne, Paul Krassner, Timothy Leary, Paul Mavrides, Robert Crumb, Mark Mothersbaugh, Jonathan Demme, Gilbert Shelton. "Bob's" face was in the opening credits of PEE WEE'S PLAYHOUSE and was part of the set. The Dobbshead face was also used as part of David Letterman's set. David Byrne put a SubGenius-themed song in his movie True Stories ("Puzzling Evidence." The SubGenius membership is heavy with artists, writers, and musicians, as is obvious from the 9 anthology albums of SubGenius music, a perusal of SubSITE's "Art Mines," and our books.</p>
<p>By contrast, the only famous people that Dean lays claim to as friends are all dead. (That hasn't stopped him from "interviewing" them, however!) Dean drops Frank Zappa's name a lot, but in Zappa's autiobiography, he specifically mentions being a fan of the Texas-based Church of the SubGenius and describes "Bob" as "some guy with a pipe in his mouth." (page 234)</p>
<p>Rev. Stang has been interviewed by so many magazines and talk shows over the years that the list is many pages long. He appeared on CNN, BBC's "Things to Come," A Current Affair, the Jon Stewart Show, directed a SubGenius "art minute" for MTV, and has worked with DEVO on two of their music videos (doing animation).</p>
<p>Stang, under his real name Douglass Smith, has been a filmmaker of note (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0808028/" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0808028/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0808028/</a>) since the age of 16, when he won the Grand Prize in the Kodak Teenage Movie Awards. That winning animation ("The Wad and the Worm" went on to garner a Cannes silver cup and many other international film awards. The SubGenius feature film, ARISE!, was distributed by Polygram starting around 1988. It is still being shown in film festivals, the most recent being the Brussels International Festival Of Fantastic Film (<a href="http://www.bifff.org/nl/archive/film1.php?id=1676" class="external free" title="http://www.bifff.org/nl/archive/film1.php?id=1676" rel="nofollow">http://www.bifff.org/nl/archive/film1.php?id=1676</a>). Stang also wrote and edited a series of documentary feature films for director Mickey grant, including the award-winning "The Cu Chi Tunnels," about the Vietnam war as seen by former Viet Cong.</p>
<p>As public speaker and performer, Stang and cohorts have led "devivals" since 1980 at such diverse venues as the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, The Stone in San Francisco, Danceteria (NYC), The Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, First Avenue (Minneapolis), Club Metro in Chicago, The Victoria Theater (San Francisco), University of Washington (Seattle), Alexandria Hotel, Los Angeles (sponsored by High Performance), Caravan of Dreams (Fort Worth), Massachussets College of Art (Boston), Bd Kuip in Amsterdam, SKAM (Hamburg, Germany), The Foundry (London). Stang has been a featured speaker at the Winterstar and Starwood Festivals (largest neopagan festival in the U.S.) every year since 1990, and since 1996 he has produced the annual "X-Day" SubGenius festivals at Brushwood Folklore Center in New York. This outdoor camping and music festival attracts from 150 to 300 SubGenius fans and has been the subject of two documentaries (one by Stang and another, "Countdown to X-Day," by Richard Darrigo). There is also an annual "teX-Day" in Texas and annual European X-Day Drills, usually held in Amsterdam. (In 2006 it was in Pisa, Italy.)</p>
<p>Noted filmmakers The Bolex Brothers made a film of Stang's Brag of the SubGenius, called "Day of the SubGenius." (See <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4585014238229810366&amp;q=SubGenius" class="external free" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4585014238229810366&amp;q=SubGenius" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4585014238229810366&amp;q=SubGenius</a> for that film and many of the others mentioned here.)</p>
<p>There have been four World SubGenius Conventions since 1980, in Dallas, Chicago, Baltimore and San Francisco. People came from as far away as Bolivia and London to attend these bizarre events.</p>
<p>For a list of SubGenius events since the middle 1990s, with text reports and many photos, see <a href="http://subgenius.com/bigfist/fun/devivals/devivals.html" class="external free" title="http://subgenius.com/bigfist/fun/devivals/devivals.html" rel="nofollow">http://subgenius.com/bigfist/fun/devivals/devivals.html</a></p>

There may be an argument for the leader of a County Council but I think borough councils are too far down the food chain. The US equivalent is leader of a city council and we have previously agreed that that is not notable. I have googled for '"Victoria Cook" councillor' and '"Victoria Cook" Brentwood' and got no independent returns so if we keep the article, as you say, it cannot be sourced. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 16:02, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am not sure I agree with the borough vs county argument in England. Here boroughs actually have a considerable amount of power and counties reduced to a rump providing rural education, transport and planning. Most metropolitan boroughs, including in London, have complete local authority with no county council at all as they are unitary authorities. My own 'borough', the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Borough_of_Croydon_a377.html" title="London Borough of Croydon">London Borough of Croydon</a>, has 350,000 residents and is larger than most counties. It's parish councils and town councils which are the non-executive, non-notable levels of authority here. In a UK context, we either would have to have no council leaders including counties, or allow counties, boroughs and districts. That said, I have no real objection in this case unless it sets a policy precedent. <a href="../../../m/t/i/User%7EMtiedemann_f8b2.html" title="User:Mtiedemann">Martín</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/t/i/User_talk%7EMtiedemann_7f87.html" title="User talk:Mtiedemann">saying</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mtiedemann_58d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mtiedemann">doing</a>)</small> 16:29, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - the huge difference is that the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Borough_of_Croydon_a377.html" title="London Borough of Croydon">London Borough of Croydon</a> has most of the broad powers of a unitary authority whereas a borough council doesn't have, most importantly, any responsibility for education. Brentwood is not a metropolitan borough (which Croydon is) (if it was I might well agree with you). I live in a similar borough (West Lancashire) and the leader of the council has low profile since the big decisions are made at Lancashire County Hall. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 17:14, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article may be valid, but it seems to be simply a commercial listing. Perhaps expansion would offer more reason why it is noteworthy enough to merit an article? <a href="../../../c/p/a/User%7ECPAScott_7db1.html" title="User:CPAScott">CPAScott</a> 13:20, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Maybe I should start with an article about Glenn Exum? The service has been inside the Teton Park for over 80 years and has assisted MANY famous people including US Presidents to reach the summit of The Grand. Many of their guides are famous climbers in their own rite. It is a commercial interprise but also VERY important to to the category I added it to.

<li>I'd assert the solution is in your answer to me. "has assisted MANY famous people including US Presidents to reach the summit of The Grand" (etc.) I think if this kind of information was added to the article, it would denote it as noteworthy. Right now, I think it is lacking that criterion. Can you expand, please? <a href="../../../c/p/a/User%7ECPAScott_7db1.html" title="User:CPAScott">CPAScott</a> 13:28, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am having difficulty finding sources for the US Presidents part so I can't add it. Maybe I should take my own advice and start with an article about the founders of the Exum Guides. Mr. Exum pasted away recently and certainly appears to warrant an article. I have to take the kiddies to the museum but will work on these atricles over the next few days.

<li><b>Comment:</b> However, what is interesting from an intellectual standpoint is the public reaction to a woman who seeks publicity by appearing nude in salacious photographs while dating/married to a famous man who is involved in politics or sports, i.e. an area which generates some measure of respect. Although it may be common to see European models seeking attention in this manner, when a woman is dating a public figure with social status, the public seems to prefer for her to act with integrity and this type of self promotion can generate scorn. Similarly, if a woman had achieved a similar level of social status, these actions may not be considered appropriate. Interesting topic for discussion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Realinformation (<a href="../../../r/e/a/User_talk%7ERealinformation_c296.html" title="User talk:Realinformation">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Realinformation_0903.html" title="Special:Contributions/Realinformation">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<p>This came up because multiple anon IP's were inserting linkspam to this site in various articles (at a guess in response to a forum post). We can't very well block links to a site that we have an article on. Here's what I find: Alexa rank is about 240,000. Google shows <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=G&amp;q=%22www.fiero.nl%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=G&amp;q=%22www.fiero.nl%22" rel="nofollow">12,900 hits</a> for the site, but it appears <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=G&amp;q=site:www.fiero.nl" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=G&amp;q=site:www.fiero.nl" rel="nofollow">8,600</a> of those are from the site itself. The article itself is, quite frankly, dreadful, with first person references and POV opinions of this forum and a competing one. Generally I want to take an axe to any article with the phrase "owning noobs" but at least it doesn't say "pwning n00bs". If kept, needs a major rewrite, but the question is, is it worth keeping? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 13:59, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think the editorial guidelines for notability, as listed, are unrealistic and outmoded. You are applying old world qualifications to new world media. Every person with an interest in Early Music who has Internet access knows Mark Moya and his contributions to MIDI (marginalized in the above reason for deletion) and the continuing discussions about the New Baroque. Mr. Moya has not only been affected by the online phenomena begun years ago, but has been instrumental in furthering the discussions. Thousands of young people have studied composition because of him. I know this because I hear from these young people frequently myself. I would like to see this article preserved and expanded. --Mike Starke

<p>Seriously, wikipedia users have more integrity than to disregard a notable film.</p>
<p>If wikipedia lists popcorn films that play in the multiplex, they have to list films that primarily exist to make a social commentary.</p>
<p>The fact it is being shown internationally shows people care.</p>

<p>LOL! Actually it does. For any short film to play more than once is very notable!</p>
<p>The different play dates spanning several countries makes it very noteable and significant for an experimental short film. We're talking a short film here. One designed not to make money. The only reason commercial films have repeat play is because of money.</p>
<p>I find it upsurd hollywood drek movies are considered more notable than a socially conscious short film that's touring internationally with nobody profiting from it.</p>

<p>Were you one of the organizers of the international tour?</p>
<p>Do you know in fact that's the play order it played in?</p>
<p>Even if it played 13th out of 17. That would be an effective way of protecting it, due to its controversial content.</p>
<p>And that is just one of the dates.</p>
<p>If you check the IMDB release schedule, it has individual dates in Sweden, Finland, Poland, Russia and the Ukraine.</p>

<li>I don't like to vote <b>delete</b>, I tend to err on the side of inclusion, but this has no alexa rating, and the only google result is the website itself. Visiting the website, it appears to be just a forum, nothing more, with about 50 members. The comment that the author of the article left on its talk page (to the effect that there has been no centralized place for members of the forum to promote their accomplishments and that is the goal of the article), makes it sound like they are using Wikipedia to try to promote the forum and make it notable. Unfortunately, things in an encyclopedia should be notable already, not become notable by the fact of their inclusion. Therefore I have to find myself advocating <b>deletion</b> for what I believe is the first time on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> 19:02, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> In reply to ONUnicorn: my comment didn't mention any need to "promote... accomplishments", so the "promotion" reason for deletion doesn't apply. As Wikipedia is user-modifiable documentation, it is the best consensual location to house the history of the group and its members (as the forum posts aren't group-editable)! Also (and in reply to Arichnad), the site isn't "just a forum" but like the best of online communities it contains a repository of specialized information in the area of web programming. There are a number of examples that can't be found elsewhere. Finally, in reply to Xoloz, there are a number of other sites that apparently fail WP:WEB that are listed (I will provide documentation that may not be complete, but exhaustive), so I wonder how strictly those standards have been applied. Also, the New Media Developer community is more than a "minor educational effort" -- maybe its not part of an Ivy League institution, but it has been ongoing for three years, with dozens of participants, hundreds of topics and thousands of exchanges. Of course, thanks for the feedback, and the opportunity to improve the article.Databoybiz 20:44, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - "<i>there are a number of other sites that apparently fail WP:WEB that are listed.</i>" Feel free to list any sites for deletion that fail WP:WEB. Also, it's a logical fallacy to say: <i>other editors have failed to meet WP:WEB, therefore WP:WEB is not policy</i>. <b>~a</b> (<a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EArichnad_d429.html" title="User:Arichnad">user</a> • <a href="../../../a/r/i/User_talk%7EArichnad_2e77.html" title="User talk:Arichnad">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arichnad_abd7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arichnad">contribs</a>) 21:11, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> to ~a, please note that I didn't state that WP:WEB is not policy, I stated that Editorial Standards have not been evenly applied. Further, as policy, I note that it is strongly discouraging advertising. The point of the New Media Developer article is to provide a neutral and objective, community-centered locus for defining and evaluating the group efforts of New Media Developer. But perhaps I was too strong in my judgment, as WP:WEB states that a site is notable for merely "Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, the times at which such content is updated or made available, a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or content descriptions in internet directories or online stores." That's really loose! With just that in mind, New Media Developer has been listed in school publications and online portfolios. It has been used in course material and in class content. I thought that the criteria was on the whole more strict, but I think that I still can press onward to justify how the online community of New Media Developer meets the standards as applied to other sites.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As a programmer and designer myself, I find much of the information on these forums invaluable. It's obvious this site does not have any commercial interest or directly benefits from advertising. True, this site does not merit the 100 million users that something like MySpace does, however I don't particularly feel that it is neccessary. The whole idea behind an encyclopedia is to increase knowledge and provide facts about subjects all over the world. New Media Devloper contains valuable information, (I've come accross some great scripts and discussions in these forums so far), amazing student work, and a friendly envoironment thus far. <i>Unfortunately, things in an encyclopedia should be notable already, not become notable by the fact of their inclusion.</i> - There is some truth to this, however I don't think that's what makes wikipedia what it is. I vote to keep New Media Developer. I hope that Wikipedia does in fact promote traffic and use of this site. It needs more members and more discussion.--Csanfo 23:10, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> to ~a: I have just read the WP:NOT guidelines, and I quote "You are free to write about yourself or projects you have a strong personal involvement in." That is a direct contradiction of what you wrote! And from the WP:AUTO guidelines, the true tests are "Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability." There is the further test that WP:AUTO doesn't apply "so long as the information is notable, not unduly self-aggrandizing, and not contradicted by other published sources." In response to the WP:WEB, hoping that the promotion of a community occurs is not the same as trying to promote the New Media Developer group. After reviewing the guidelines, I find that there is no basis for rejection within the policy, and in fact every reference to policy provides material to support the inclusion of this online community. I hope that there are editors out there who can see this as well. --Databoybiz 02:34, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Answer</b> to ~a; New Media Developer passes WP:WEB as I noted above; WP:WEB states that a site is notable for merely "Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, the times at which such content is updated or made available, a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or content descriptions in internet directories or online stores." I can reconcile statements 1 and 2 listed by ~a above with regard to New Media Developer, in that New Media Developer is not WP:AUTO because it is not auto-biographical, and it passes WP:NOT as the New Media Develoer Article is a verifiable, group-editable history of the goals and history of New Media Developer, both group and website. Thanks for your questions, and I'm still asking for editors to provide comments and feedback -- and most importantly, vote -- regarding the inclusion of this article within Wikipedia.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> No. Please reread the context. They're explaining the exception to the rule. WP:WEB states "<b>This criterion excludes:</b> Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, the times at which such content is updated or made available, a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or content descriptions in internet directories or online stores." <b>~a</b> (<a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EArichnad_d429.html" title="User:Arichnad">user</a> • <a href="../../../a/r/i/User_talk%7EArichnad_2e77.html" title="User talk:Arichnad">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arichnad_abd7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arichnad">contribs</a>) 23:17, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

There is some question of whether the article meets some standards, but those standards are based on NPOV, they are not rigid standards, there is no a black and white threshold which a subject of interest must meet. The article is about an experiment in democracy, it is a <b>new</b> idea, it is an idea which could not work without the internet, i.e. paper publication would be much to slow. It is an unusual item of interest, of potential interest to Wikipedia policy and of potential interest to internet users. Because of its potential, let's leave it as an article for a while. In time, perhaps it will grow, or it might even shrink and die.

<li><b>Comment:</b> (I don't want to vote/say <i>keep</i> because I started this project, however here are some notes: ) (1) Anarchopedia is MW site with the most language editions after Wikipedia: (I think) 23 opened, not all of them active. (2) There are at least five separate communities which maintain (very active or not so active) Anarchopedia in their own language (French, German, Danish, Polish and Indonesian) as well as some groups of individuals on a few other (such as Spanish and Italian) -- which means that it is a project which is more active project then, for example, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a>. (3) Anarchopedia is <i>now</i> notable anarchist project; website is linked, for example, from <a href="http://infoshop.org/wiki/" class="external text" title="http://infoshop.org/wiki/" rel="nofollow">Infoshop OpenWiki</a> as well as site si better ranked then <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Workers_Association_e143.html" title="International Workers Association">International Workers Association</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World_366b.html" title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the World</a> sites. (4) From <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Anarchopedia_2nd_nomination_0a88.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anarchopedia 2nd nomination">the last nomination for deletion</a> (last October), anarchopedia went from 1,500.000 to 500.000 place on the Alexa. (5) There are a lot of other projects which has less rating then Anarchopedia and which has their own articles on Wikipedia. (6) The biggest anarchist site, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infoshop.org.html" title="Infoshop.org">Infoshop.org</a> is at 84.000. place on Alexa; which means that sites about anarchism are not so high ranked; one of the most imoprtant reasons for that is that anarchists don't like to use an capitalist methods for marketing of their own sites. (7) As it is mentioned, Anarchopedia is important to Wikipedia because it is showing to Wikipedian community one of possible ways how to organize community. (8) Anarchopedia has it's own content incorporated from other sources and it is an online encyclopedia, like Wikipedia is. (9) It is also GFDL compatible (unlike a number of other online encyclopedias), which means that Wikipedia is able to incorporate texts from Anarchopedia, too (not a lot of them in this moment, but as time is passes, a number of articles which is possible to incorporate is growing). (10) Look into the keep-arguments from the last nomination. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillosh_e5be.html" title="User:Millosh">millosh</a> (<a href="../../../../sr/%D0%BC/%D0%B8/%D0%BB/%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80_%D1%81%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%7E%D0%9C%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%88_e20c.html" class="extiw" title="sr:Разговор_са_корисником:Милош">talk (sr:)</a>) 02:13, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>No context whatsoever. This is somehow connected to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a>, but you have to scroll down to see it. Nowhere in the article does it even say whether this is supposed to be real or fictional. The article Galaxy city doesn't exist. Google has about 80 thousand hits for "Flo's Diner", 57 for "Flo's Diner" + "Star Trek" (but nothing seems relevant), and 1 hit for "Flo's Diner" + "Galaxy city" (this article, obviously). I'm a Star Trek fan and have never heard of "Flo's Diner". Is this some fanfic thing, or a real restaurant with a Star Trek -themed menu? <b>Delete</b> if it isn't expanded with context and sources. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 16:53, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I was just going to say that the "not for things made in school" reason for deletion does not apply here, as that refers to ideas or words and things of the abstract nature, not specifically to projects that were made during school. There have been many notable things done in school that I am sure would make good articles on Wikipedia. Now, though, I do agree that for other reasons Split Mind probably should not be on wikipedia.

<li>We judge notability based on the subject, not the article. "Crystalballism" would apply if there <i>aren't</i> sources out there to satisfy notability, but hey, there could be in the future! But if there <i>may be</i> sources out there, we verify that. If there are, we should keep it, if there aren't, we delete it.

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. It looks like most of these roads are county roads and the rest were roads that were never built. In either case, I would expect a much higher level of notability to need an article then that of state highways, given the tens of thousands of county roads and proposed, but never built, roads. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanG_1aea.html" title="User:BryanG">BryanG</a><sup><a href="../../../b/r/y/User_talk%7EBryanG_f39b.html" title="User talk:BryanG">(talk)</a></sup> 04:28, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</s>

<li>In their current form, these articles aren't very useful - thus a deletion would not be setting a precedent. These are mostly if not all "notable" roads. In Florida, most numbered county roads were state roads until being turned over to the counties in the 1980s. In any case, "non-notability" is not a reason to delete, but to merge. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">T</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SPUI_0b50.html" title="Special:Contributions/SPUI">C</a>) 05:18, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, The majority of these are county roads, (the article titles are misnamed as well). Any numbered road is notable in my book, though they probably lack the information to justify their own articles. These should probably be merged or at least renamed (See <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Road_0342_%28Leon_County%2C_Florida%29_52a2.html" title="County Road 0342 (Leon County, Florida)">County Road 0342 (Leon County, Florida)</a> for a better naming convention). --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolderca1_0bcb.html" title="User:Holderca1">Holderca1</a> 16:47, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article says it's for a fictional chraracter, but no hint is given as to where the character is from. From a book? A movie? A computer game? Someone's unpublished work? Which book/movie/computer game? We have no way of knowing, and thus no way of judging whether this is a notable character or not. A Google search turned up nothing at all.

<li>Deciding that a candidate has "no" chance of winning with a 34% polling number is purely a judgment call.

<li>And actually, it's irrelevant. The simple fact is that there are lots of candidates, most of whom lose. Governors are notable. People who want to be aren't.

<li>First of all, it's not a policy. It's an argument that some have used against requiring notability, and one of the weaker ones. To my mind, the main problem is clutter. Do you know how many campaign ads we've got left, articles created by supporters of losers in previous elections? Neither do I. They're like those road signs that everyone volunteers to put up during the campaign, and no one volunteers to take down after the election.

<p>Article seems to have been created as part of an attempt to lend credence to edits at <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonians_%28ethnic_group%29.html" title="Macedonians (ethnic group)">Macedonians (ethnic group)</a> about 17th c. licorice farming.

<p>As has been discussed on the talk page for ethnic Macedonians, the recent reference to Dr. Hosenfeld derives principally from Igor Janev's recent work "Arid Farmland: Development of Agriculture in the Aegean." Several scholars are purportedly working to ascertain the precise whereabouts and credentials of Dr. Hosenfeld, but given Janev's high-standing in the intellectual and academic communities, his pre-eminence on the topic (which, of course, presupposes his existence,) is not currently considered to be in question by any notable scholars. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Twizzman (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Twizzman_f55d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Twizzman">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>It appears Dr. Hosenfeld was attached (prior to his death) to Indiana University. His field appears to have been post-middle ages Eastern Europe, and he was a contributor to the Oxford Journal of Holocaust and Genocide Studies (Spring 2000). While it is as of yet unclear what connection this has to his work on 17th Century farming (if any,) it should be adequate to substantiate his existence. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 208.193.132.253 (<a href="../../../2/0/8/User_talk%7E208.193.132.253.html" title="User talk:208.193.132.253">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_208.193.132.253_013d.html" title="Special:Contributions/208.193.132.253">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I found the Holocaust Studies reference mentioned above; if you enlarge the page where the name appears, you can see that it is actually Alvin Rosenfeld, not Hosenfeld - the OCR is picking it up incorrectly.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Alvin Rosenfeld is Alvin Hosenfeld. I happen to be a close friend of Alvin's neice. Although he was born in Wisconsin under the latter surname, his family (from the Ukraine) was initially associated as Rosenfeld, however they were forced to flee for government reasons (I personally am not sure what the specifications were - I can find out when I see Lara in a few weeks). They took on this slightly altered name once they arrived in America to throw off the Ukrainian government. Alvin, as he gained credence in many historical circles, began publishing some small papers under a slight pseudonym- his family's former surname: Rosenfeld, which is the name he began to be associated with. I can only assume it was that name that was put on Amazon. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.44.48.23 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.44.48.23.html" title="User talk:24.44.48.23">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.44.48.23_8483.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.44.48.23">contribs</a>).</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Alvin Hosenfeld's work was very obscure (look at the topics!) - I highly doubt you will find it on any mainstream stores, online or in real life. Perhaps if you inquire in some rare book stores or on ebay, you may find them. Please don't delete this - Lara Hosenfeld (the man's niece) and her family deserve recognition for Alvin's accomplishments. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.44.48.23 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.44.48.23.html" title="User talk:24.44.48.23">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.44.48.23_8483.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.44.48.23">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Please, you are making me cry! Poor Lara! Incidently, the name "Lara Hosenfeld" brings up no hits whatsoever on Google. And searching on "Alvin Rosenfeld" on Amazon brings up a number of scholarly works, but none on anything remotely related to food history. If you search on "Licorice" on Amazon, you do get such obscure works as "Licorice: Putting a Weed to Work" (Percy Houseman, 1944) and "Modern Practical Gum Work Manual..." (Octave Grillon, 1911 - a book on making gum drops) and "Licorice" (Barbara Briggs, 1949) - but, strangely, NOTHING by Alvin Rosenfeld or Hosenfeld or with the titles suggested for his books. Searching on "Cashew" brings up such best-sellers as "A brief story of the development of cashew nut shell liquid in the United States" by Mortimer T. Harvey (1966), but, again, NOTHING by Alvin Rosenfeld or Hosenfeld or with a title like "Cashews in the Midst: A Popular History of Cashews", which the article says is the name of Mr. Hosenfeld's book.--<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 04:46, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - His nickname may be unusual but his (former) stature on the show merits retention of his own article. If you merge his article in with Mancow's Morning Madhouse, you run a great risk of omitting crucial information about Renzetti.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> there seems to be a very hostile reaction to suspected, but completely unproven, use of Wikipedia for marketing purposes. Quite clearly it is a fairly major television show for Network Ten, so its existence is not in doubt. It's ironic that the lack of verifiable information which is making it notable at the moment is what's putting it at risk here. Ok, we could be looking at another <i>Jasmine's Getting Married</i>, but I think the nominator could have waited a few days (17 August) until the program started and found its legs. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 03:20, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There isn't a "hostile" reaction to anything. This is primarily about notability and policy and guidelines. Many people are of the opinion that an upcoming TV show does not meet notability. Also, please see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 05:31, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's all very well to cite <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> which I am familiar with by the way, but which part of it are you referring to? There are just as many people citing "misuse of Wikipedia", "quality" and "popularity" as there are "notability" arguments. Even then, I'm just not convinced that this is not notable, even though it hasn't aired. I personally think it looks shite and doubt very much I'll ever watch it, but even if it's axed after two episodes, doesn't the failure of the whole Gabbo-style campaign and Channel 10's investment make it notable? It's verifiable, it will go to air, and I don't know why we're going through this AfD when the article is just going to be created <i>again</i> in just over a week. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 07:02, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Take your pick: WP is not advertising, not a crystal ball, not for original research, not a news report, not for propaganda, not for self-promotion...Just about everything on WP:NOT can apply here. To characterise people as having a "hostile" reaction simply because they believe this article is inappropriate is incredibly unfair. I don't think keeping an article because it "is just going to be created again in just over a week" is a legitimate basis for deciding to keep or delete something.</dd>
<dd>And no, IMO Channel 10's advertising campaign does not make this notable. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 08:28, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If I <i>had</i> to pick one: crystal ball, and I think that only just <i>barely</i> applies - the other guidelines you cite, not at all! I certainly have a hostile reaction (alright, bad wording, aversion) to blatant advertising/marketing on Wikipedia, and I just don't think that's the case here. It's a natural reaction, and I don't mean to unfairly offend or characterise people who have the same reaction to this article - I just think accusations of Channel Ten meddling with the article are unverifiable and unfair. This program is quite clearly notable in my opinion, any marketing spin or bias can be removed or rewritten. We're obviously not going to change each other's minds, Sarah, hope we can agree to disagree! We'll see how it turns out I guess... --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 09:19, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, of course, I can definitely agree to disagree. I haven't seen anything that makes me think Channel 10 are <i>directly</i> involved with the articles, but they <i>are</i> engaging in viral marketing and from what I understand of the concept, that's exactly what this is. At least one of the articles I tagged for speedy deletion under G-4 was by an established Australian editor, so I'm not suggesting Channel 10 is directly involved in writing the articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> I've become quite an expert of acticle deletion, having had four of mine up for deletion. The arguments here are preposterous and its why the so-called 'debate' wikipedia is no more than schoolground prattle. From 17 Aug 2006 there will be numerous (hundreds?) of articles on this series. More than enough reason NOT to have it removed. For the people who want this article removed answer me this: Have you proposed the removal of wikipedia entries for other TV series before they air? <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wedge_%28TV_show%29_9969.html" title="The Wedge (TV show)">The_Wedge_(TV_show)</a> was advertised for at least 6 months before it started; do you want the wikipedia entry removed? Why pick on this one? Gtoomey 12:13, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I looked this show up and was surprised to see how little had been written on it. The show will be on in less than two weeks; there are articles on movies in production months before they're released. When the show comes on, it will no doubt make it notable enough to have this article recreated so it seems foolish to remove it now, only to bring it back a couple of days later.--<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregory_j_e525.html" title="User:Gregory j">Gregory j</a> 13:37, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Comment: I think some of the above are missing an important point - this article is not about the show, but a character in the show. The general idea for pages on characters is that they should only be split into their own pages when there becomes too much info on them for it to fit comfortably into the show's main page. Since this show doesn't even have an article... I would have no problem with some of this info being merged into one on the show, but right now there simply isn't one. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 05:23, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>despite a large majority of "Deletes", the page has improved much since I started it. It is feeling more like a grudge against the page. I don't really care if C10 did put a blatant ad on there, that is no reason to delete any trace of it, as if to get your own back. Which is really what I'm seeing here, that are far more insegnificant and promotional pages for things that arn't out yet on wikipedia. Even if it lasts five episodes and only 10 million people watched it and only 100 million people talked about it around the water cooler or in conversation, that seems like reason enough to keep it. I personally am not fussed over the whole thing, I love wikipedia and I like to edit and make stuff on it, like peeling potatos it's mindless fun. But the press to delete summat after a few minutes it was created (as that enough time to even edit it, or even read it?) screams of internet message board flaming and fandom, which doesn't sit well with me when I see the plethora of other "noteable" pages on wikipedia. It seems prejudice. Or at least plain stupid to let childish emotions dictate what you put on wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayKeaton_01af.html" title="User:JayKeaton">JayKeaton</a> 11:12, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>There's only around 20 million people in Australia so I think "10 million people watch[ing] it and only 100 million people talk[ing] about it" might be wishful thinking. I dout anyone here is holding a grudge against Channel 10. I think most people just don't think the show is notable YET. But maybe one day it will be. The speedy deletion of has been because it is recreation of a previously deleted article <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G4" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#G4</a>.

<li><b>Apathetic indifference</b>. One month ago I argued for this article to be kept on the premise that a Television Show is notable, <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasmin%27s_Getting_Married_0168.html" title="Yasmin's Getting Married">even if it hasn't been running for two years and has plots and characters and spin-offs</a>. At the time the article was deleted because of arguments on several accounts:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>We didn't know what the name of the television show was going to be.</li>
<li>We didn't know if David Tench was a real person or not.</li>
<li>There weren't enough sources of information to verify that it <i>was</i> an actual TV show.</li>
<li>Channel 10 were allegedly (though I've not personally seen any proof of this) using the Wikipedia article as part of an advertising campaign.</li>
<li>Most of the votes for <b>keep</b> were made by accounts that didn't have the mandatory minimum number of edits required to be eligible for voting (I'm not sure what that threshold is but it's there and we all know it).</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>As a result, the article was deleted but with I feel what was an understanding that it would be re-created again when more verifiable information came to hand. We can now verify through a number of sources items 1 through 3, so it's no surprise the article has been re-created. If point 4 is true, it's irrelevant. Several articles have and always will be targets of sef-promotion by the people behind them. Welcome to Wikipedia, the encyclopaedia anyone can edit, even those involved! <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Colbert_Report_3547.html" title="The Colbert Report">The Colbert Report</a> proved that. This is a reality of Wikipedia and is something we, as wikipedians, deal with. We don't delete articles just because someone's not playing fairly. We edit them. We modify them. <i>We make them better</i>.</dd>
<dd>As for point 5, there's nothing we can do about that. It's happening again. "User only has 5 edits, his opinion clearly can't be worthy. Listen to me more". I used to be around on Wikipedia gnome-editing here and there for about two years before I created an account. Why did I create an account? Because when I added my 2 cents to a debate (any debate) I got hit with "IP address. Don't listen to this guy". I create an account though and it's amazing what signing posts with a nonsensical phrase does for your credibility.&#160;;) Throw a few rants on your user page and hey, people finally debate the points I raise rather than using <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_hominem.html" title="Argumentum ad hominem">argumentum ad hominem</a>.</dd>
<dd>So where are we now? What do we know? My opinion is that this <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Tench_a1b4.html" title="David Tench">David Tench</a> article should be moved to <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Tench_Tonight_67bd.html" title="David Tench Tonight">David Tench Tonight</a> as we don't know enough about "David Tench" himself to warrant an article on him. What we do know would be better off in an article about the show. Problem is, I see that <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Tench_Tonight_67bd.html" title="David Tench Tonight">David Tench Tonight</a> has been vigourously deleted lest, God forbid, anyone be given a chance to add any real content to it. Apparently an upcoming TV show isn't "notable". Sorry folks, I know you don't like it but television shows are notable. Even upcoming ones we can verify. Until you have an official policy that states otherwise, you have no valid argument against notability. In actual fact, notability isn't an official policy anyway but who cares about that one, right? <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiality.html" title="Wikiality">Just so long as enough Wikipedian's believe it's true</a>.</dd>
<dd>Thing is though, I don't care what happens to the article. In fact, go right ahead and delete the article right now. You can't though, can you? You have to wait at least, what is it, 5 days after nomination before deleting it? That makes it the 12th August when this article is getting deleted again (and I assure you, it will get deleted). 5 days later when the show airs on the 17th, guess what's going to happen? We're going through all of this to "save Wikipedia" - from an article which we all <b>know</b> deserves a right to be here - for 5 days? You've got to be fucking joking. But hey, deleting the article again might give David something to talk about when his show finally airs. It's certainly generated some nice articles about Wikipedia in the Australian press. Come the 17th, there are going to be many more Australian Wikipedia editors (both new and old) adding to this article and by that stage, it'll never get deleted.

<li>I also think that the streetcar articles should be kept. Toronto's streetcar system is unique in Canada and deserves to be documented (the bus lines are unremarkable and don't deserve their own articles). However I think the 502 and 503 lines are actually sub lines of the 501 line so they should be discussed on that article rather than having separate articles. --<a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EAtrian_4bb8.html" title="User:Atrian">Atrian</a> 01:08, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not Notable; this proposed set of gender-neutral pronouns seems to exist only as a proposal; admittedly, a proposal that has been kicking around for some years, but nevertheless no more than that, since it seems to be in current use almost nowhere.

<p>I apologise for not being able to participate in the discussion regarding deletion of the original article at the time but I felt it would still be useful to have a discussion regarding the article's inclusion, hence the re-posting.</p>
<p>In discussing this I thought it would be helpful to quote from reasons given to me regarding the article's original deletion, (see my talk page):</p>
<p><br />
"Edinburgh University Savoy Opera Group The article had a prod tag which remained in place for 5 days. After this period, if no one fixes the article, it may be deleted. This is what I did. The reason cited by the user who placed the prod tag, Marc Shepherd (talk • contribs), was "This is a non-notable article about a student community theatre group. It is unencyclopedic and does not cite sources." I agree with this synopsis of the article. The subject is inherently non-notable. I hope this clarifies the matter. — Scm83x hook 'em 00:41, 23 July 2006 (UTC)"</p>
<p><br />
I am quite aware that universities do tend to be plagued by fly-by-night societies-I well remember the Hugga-Bugga Jaffa Cake Society (I ask you!) when I was at university, and that Wikipedia would be thoroughly clogged up by many articles on subjects like these.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I would dispute that <i>this</i> subject is inherently non-notable. It is of interest in a number of respects.</p>
<p>The society contributes significantly to the cultural life of the city; the society is one of only two societies that regularly produce Gilbert and Sullivan operettas in Edinburgh. It has a loyal and substantial audience from outside the university, within the city and thus has a reach that extends beyond simply the university. I would add that this is not confined merely to the city as the society has performed in the Waterford Festival. One might say that it is a community group in terms of its roots, however I would consider Edinburgh to be a substantial community!</p>
<p>I am aware that the article is a stub and is in need of more detail but it is a work in progress and I daresay it will be expanded in reasonable time.</p>
<p>On another note, it has not escaped my notice that there are many societies of a similar nature that are listed which have not been deleted, for example</p>
<p>Leicester University Theatre</p>
<p>Dublin University Players</p>
<p>The Yale Society of Orpheus and Bacchus</p>
<p>and <b>many</b> others. I would add that the last one appears to be simply a glee club within its university and thus appears manifestly of less interest as an article topic.</p>
<p>I would urge that the article is retained.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, for all the reasons given originally, and the criteria stated at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUS_d39c.html" title="WP:MUS">WP:MUS</a>. These articles tend to appear like weeds. A good half-dozen of them were deleted at around the time this one was. These others have the same problem. No one is suggesting that they do not contribute to the cultural life of their town.

<li><b>Delete</b>. There are numerous student and community theatre groups worldwide, which is a good thing, but they are generally not notable. If a student theatre group is an important part of university life, it can be mentioned in the university's article. If a community theatre group is an important part of a town's cultural and artistic life, it can be mentioned in the town's article. I would vote for deletion of all the groups mentioned above by the proponent. --<a href="../../../s/s/i/User%7ESsilvers_b573.html" title="User:Ssilvers">Ssilvers</a> 03:14, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I would like to address a few of the comments made, which I will try to address in turn: (I’ll be as quick as I can)</li>
</ul>
<p>As regards point of view, I feel the article does try to strike a neutral tone; I do not feel it seeks to particularly advertise the society, and instead merely appertains to what it is, what it does and makes some mention of alumni. If it is felt not to be neutral in tone, I would be reasonably confident that this can be remedied by editing of contentious statements after appropriate discussion on the talk page.</p>
<p>As regards verification and citations, the society’s productions have on occasion been reviewed (favourably) by critics of the national press (Telegraph, Scotsman and others): given time I can find citations for these and include them in the article. I will endeavour to do this as quickly as possible. As an asides, I note that the articles for the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_National_Theatre_9aec.html" title="Royal National Theatre">Royal National Theatre</a> of the United Kingdom and the Glasgow Citizens’ Theatre do not include any citations except for their own web pages.</p>
<p>I am less sure of how to respond to Fan-1967’s comments. These comments refer to the <i>generality</i> of such societies, however I feel we should be discussing the <i>specific</i> case of this society. Further, there are not in fact many university (not school, I think this distinction is important) G&amp;S societies as contended, indeed there are only four such societies in Scotland, including this one.</p>
<p>In terms of notability, at the risk of sounding repetitive, I would just quickly re-iterate that, it is of long standing, it has a certain notoriety and reputation at a national level, and it has significant alumni.</p>
<p>I am aware I’ve taken up acres of space here, and this all probably sounds like a bit of a rant&#160;:-) but I do feel very strongly about it: I won’t waste more space posting again unless there is anything else posted that invites further comment. I know it was probably irksome of me to re-post the article after deletion: I promise I will abide by any decision regarding deletion taken after this discussion. Having said all that I am not too proud not to beg for a stay of execution until I can include references to the critical reviews I mentioned and make any alterations of style considered necessary! Yours grovelling,&#160;:-) Rgas 18:07, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I've never seen anyone identify as an "anarcho-homosexualist". I'm getting no google hits when "anarcho-homosexualism" is put in quotes. I'd say it's OR and a neologism as there does not seem to be any established movement with this name. The term "queer anarchism" does get some hits, which I expected since there is a queer-oriented trend within anarchism (similar in nature to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcha-feminism.html" title="Anarcha-feminism">anarcha-feminism</a>). There is even a queer anarchist flag (like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Anarchist_flag.svg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Anarchist_flag.svg" rel="nofollow">anarcho-syndicalist</a> one but with pink instead of red). I wouldn't be opposed to an article on queer anarchism, but even that would probably be mostly OR since most anarchists would inherently support queer liberation anyway and few anarchists have focused on queer issues specifically. Anyways, most anarchists who <i>do</i> focus on queer issues would use the term queer, not homosexual since homosexual isn't inclusive, which casts further doubt on this article's veracity. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 04:53, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- Seriously I think there could be a good article here, about lesbian and gay anarchists/anarchism. However, this article just seems too trolled to have any hope of turning into that.... And, people are right about the "google test" -- there are feminist anarchists, and there are gay/lesbian anarchists, but people commonly call feminist anarchism anarcha-feminism, whereas no one really seems to call homosexual anarchism, anarcho-homosexualism... it seems to be too much a rare/made up term to refer to a real phenomenon. In part, I think (as The Ungovernable Force has well put), lesbian/gay anarchism is (correct me if I'm wrong) most often not sufficiently distinctive in its thought or praxis to need to be described under a specific term, whereas for feminist anarchism there is more distinction of thought/praxis. Anyway, delete this, but hope that someone will one day write a better article, under a better title as well. --<a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a> 12:04, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You guys don't know what your'e talking about. Funny how my "personal attack" was removed, but when you people slander me by saying I use sockpuppets, total silence. If Kodakfilm was my sockpuppet, WE WOULD HAVE THE SAME IP ADDRESS. WE DO NOT. STOP BEING IGNORANT. joeferret</li>
<li>As can easily be found out, my IP address is 72.134.55.158, while Kodakfilm's IP address is 75.27.239.17. Hopefully this will stop the lazy slander that you people so blatantly participate in. joeferret
<ul>
<li>So far, you've donwe nothing but hide behind a series of flimsy pretexts and strawberry arguments.

<li><b>keep</b> I actually own a copy of that publication, The Gay Anarchist. I think the confusion here is the name of the movement. I've heard some people call it anarcho-homosexualism, but it's more of a new pc term used to describe the movement, Queer Anarchy is also used in addition to less common term "gaynarchy". Many don't refer to it as anarchy at all for PR reasons, but the movement does exist. There's a movement in San Francisco called <a href="http://www.gayshamesf.org/about.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gayshamesf.org/about.html" rel="nofollow">"Gay Shame"</a> which promotes what could be described as anarcho-homosexualism.

<li><b>keep (for now)</b> I think that joeferret and that other user KodakFilm are acting very childish. This is encyclopedia, not a game. That being said I feel sorry for them because I think this article acutually deserves some attention. I think the problem here is that the page needs more work put into it. There are many entries on wikipedia that could use the same attention, yet no one ever tries to delete them. Why not keep it up for now and have some more extensive research put into it?

<li><b>Comment</b> - While <i>Terrorism</i> is in itself a debatable term, the general objection seems to lies in the timelines definition of terrorism or lack thereof. I should point out similar objections made to other timelines I've created, such as the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_organized_crime.html" title="Timeline of organized crime">Timeline of organized crime</a> and the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_piracy.html" title="Timeline of piracy">Timeline of piracy</a> (as well as the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_war_criminals.html" title="List of war criminals">List of war criminals</a>).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This specific timeline is meant to include those <b>internationally recognized</b> as politically motivated as defined by international agencies such as the United Nations <a href="http://www.un.org/terrorism/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.un.org/terrorism/" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> and Interpol <a href="http://www.interpol.org/Public/Terrorism/default.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.interpol.org/Public/Terrorism/default.asp" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>.</dd>
<dd>As for concerns of POV, there are does exist at least some Wikipedia standard regarding the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definition_of_terrorism.html" title="Definition of terrorism">definition of terrorist acts</a>, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_terrorist_organisations.html" title="List of terrorist organisations">List of terrorist organisations</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_terrorist_incidents.html" title="List of terrorist incidents">List of terrorist incidents</a> (of which many incidents in the timeline are mentioned). These same points were also brought up when both articles were nominated for deletion (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_terrorist_incidents_7376.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of terrorist incidents">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of terrorist incidents</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Militant_Organizations_delete_7cf6.html" title="Talk:List of Militant Organizations/delete">Talk:List of Militant Organizations/delete</a>). I've presently been compiling this list from no less then four separate encyclopedias on terrorism, should these be disregarded&#160;? Whereas the timeline is neither dominated by Islamic-only incidents or mentions of the Bush Administration (neither of which has even been mentioned as yet), I see no POV nor any bias present, only the concern the article has the <i>potential</i> to become one.</dd>
<dd>In my own opinion, the fact is there are terrorist organizations, those of which are recognized by international agencies. Some are politically motivated, others are for religious reasons and so on. The timeline is nothing more then simply a listing of those events (or at the very least a more detailed version of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_terrorist_incidents.html" title="List of terrorist incidents">List of terrorist incidents</a>), when and where took place. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMax_566e.html" title="User:MadMax">MadMax</a> 01:51, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's laudable that you're trying to compile lists from reputable sources. However it's likely that there would, sooner or later, be debate about what constitutes a "reputable" source. I have similar concerns about <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_terrorist_incidents.html" title="List of terrorist incidents">List of terrorist incidents</a>, but that page does not list individuals, just the incidents. Labeling someone a terrorist (as the "XXXX in terrorism" pages do) is dangerous, especially if the person is still alive, and leaves Wikipedia vulnerable to libel lawsuits. I also agree with Postdlf that "terrorism" is anacronistic when applied to years previous to the 1970s or so. --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFang_Aili_a8ed.html" title="User:Fang Aili">Fang Aili</a> <sup><a href="../../../f/a/n/User_talk%7EFang_Aili_6d94.html" title="User talk:Fang Aili"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 16:32, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While that may be valid concerning certain individuals, those such as listed in Diane Sawinski and Matthew May's <i>Terrorism: Biographies</i> are officially listed as wanted criminals regarding terrorist acts in at least one country (Wikipedia's article on the <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baader-Meinhof_Gang_f5de.html" title="Baader-Meinhof Gang">Baader-Meinhof Gang</a> has <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baader-Meinhof_Gang_Members_d89e.html" title="Baader-Meinhof Gang Members">an extensive list</a> of the very members listed in the years from 1934-1947 timeline. It should also be noted that members of recognized terrorist organizations as the forementioned are the only individuals listed in the timeline at this point. Nevertheless, all the entries (with the exception of those in the early 1940s) contain specific incidents. To delete the entire timeline based on the lack of entries seems as bit hasty given the fact they could either be reworded (i.e. wanted in Germany for bank robbery or member of the XXXX organization) or taken out entirely. As for the anacronistic reasoning, I would certainly agree when comparing to the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Tea_Party_3189.html" title="Boston Tea Party">Boston Tea Party</a> or the Liberal Revolutions of the mid to late-1800's. However, appling the same to the 20th century is highly debatable in my opinion, nevermind comparing the last 30 years. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMax_566e.html" title="User:MadMax">MadMax</a> 19:20, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also it should be noted that 1988 in terrorism is completed (and is what I think a standard page should somewhat resemble), whereas the earlier entries from 1934-1949 were in the process of being completed at the time of nomination. I would therefore assume, if taking the timeline as a whole, that the main focus would be on 1988 in terrorism rather then 1940 in terrorism&#160;? <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMax_566e.html" title="User:MadMax">MadMax</a> 01:17, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - come on Mako - You haven't contributed to Sydney's transport articles yet you seem intent on deleting anything to do with Sydney's transport that you can. Please stop. Queensland's public transport system has a list of bus routes, as does Hong Kong and a lot of other cities in the world. The information may change from time to time, but it's not so changeable that doing so is manageable. If it had times of buses arriving, then sure, it should be deleted. But a list of bus routes is common on WP and it should therefore stay. To say, as you have asserted, that the non-maintainability of a page is a reason to delete it, could easily be applied to railway and tram routes and stations too. I propose a compromise that if you merge the individual route pages into the main article and leave the list of bus routes itself I will be satisfied - so long as they are consistent and correct. If you want more reasons not to delete this, I've also found this template which is linked to other bus route lists in cities in Australia:</li>

<dd>The suggestion that this information is unmaintainable and/or a copy of the official information is erroneous and without foundation. Many Sydney-based authors update the article regularly and in advance of all changes released by the STA. After all, Wikipedia is intended to be dynamic and not static. Further, other articles use the route data, such as every railway station and some other minor pages. This is not a mirror as some may suggest, but a reference source by which the appropriate TT can be found at a glance. Another thing is that route lists are pretty common in Wikipedia and common examples are listed below.

<li><b>Keep</b> (of course, as i started the article!). I originally put up one or two individual bus routes as individual pages (the 380, 400 etc)- they were put up for deletion and the consensus was that they should be deleted (fair enough in retrospect). The consensus also was that the information could be compiled on on a single page as a list or table. This was the genesis of these articles and as has been pointed out, there is plenty of precedent (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bus_routes_in_London_60e4.html" title="List of bus routes in London">List of bus routes in London</a>, anyone?). If these pages go, then the London ones must as well. Also, the original article was split up into routes by the hundreds because the page was getting too big. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuaidy_ad92.html" title="User:Quaidy">Quaidy</a> 12:38, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not a bus schedule. Precedent is a bad example. The others should be put up for deletion as well unless there's some overriding reason to keep them.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Citing precedent without citing additional specific reasons for inclusion (like being in a template, for example) is insufficient. I can however see how there might be a single page, maybe a long one, which would discuss such matters. Such an single article might very easily qualify as significant enough. Alternately, if it were clearly established in the articles that the percentage of the population who use this system is so high as to require them as being significant to the daily life of the citizenry of the area, then maybe a small number of pages might qualify for includion. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 16:00, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Unencyclopaedic is not a principled reason to delete, nor is simply citing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> given that this is not a directory but a valid list. Precedents can apply here, reason being that many of those other articles survived AfDs and there is no conceptual difference why this should not. The information is kept up to date, is useful, there is obviously no copyright issue (it does not protect information, but form) and is obviously not a schedule or timetable. As stated, the general articles are not detailed enough and this information would detract from it if it were all on the same page. Public transport in a large city is very notable, particulkarly where the system has in excess of 170 million people travelling on public buses alone, let alone privates. As the only serious arguments invoked are 'this is unencylopedic' or 'WP:NOT' which are not arguments but a mere gut feeling with no reasons articulated, this article should stay unless a much better reason can be identified. There isn't one I can see. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 20:26, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> What makes a "valid list"? I was under the impression that the purpose of lists on Wikipedia was to group articles in a way that offered insight into how they were related, and why they are important, for example <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Masts_80b6.html" title="List of Masts">List of Masts</a>. The nominated articles do not link to other articles (as no inidividal Sydney bus routes have been deemed notable), and simply indiscriminately list all bus routes that currently exist, sometimes providing frequency and other information that to me qualifies them as either a directory or travel guide. I'm not denying that public transport is notable, but am concerned that these articles are addressing the subject in the wrong way (and incidentally, don't make any claims of notability, merely a claim of existence). The focus should be on insightful information such as the history of bus transport in the region, usage patterns, operators, published future proposals and the like, and should be articles with paragraphs and sections (much like <a href="../../../b/u/s/Buses_in_Sydney_3ffd.html" title="Buses in Sydney">Buses in Sydney</a>), and not just a list of information culled from timetables. As such I would support the replacement of an article such as Sydney bus routes 100-199 with one such as Buses in north eastern Sydney, if the new articles purpose was to provide knowledge and not just to list dry facts and travel information. --<a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako_0eb9.html" title="User:Mako">Mako</a> 22:17, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> What is the difference - all that constitutes is a name change. The purpose you have just identified could be achieved by expanding the present page. All articles are articles in progress. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 23:37, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The difference isn't just the name, it's the entire focus and content of the article. An article about what makes bus transport important in an area does not need to include detailed travel information and a list of all routes. Would there be any consensus on a proposal to rename the articles to something less bus route specific and to remove the directory / timetable type information from them? I'm not sure at this stage. --<a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako_0eb9.html" title="User:Mako">Mako</a> 00:44, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The point is that there is no "detailed travel information" as you claim. The list is a list of bus routes that came out of the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Buses_d09e.html" title="Sydney Buses">Sydney Buses</a> article (because it is far too big to be included in that article.) That is a valid article as it shows the areas where the buses run. It's not meant to be a detailed travel guide (you can use WikiTravel for that), but a list of information including the places where the State Government runs its transit network. (<a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 05:50, 9 August 2006 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>Some of the articles list: the suburb each route starts and ends in, suburbs it travels via, the depot its buses are based in, the peak and off peak frequency of the buses, the duration of the journey, and the number of sections. I think that could be described as detailed travel information. About the only details that have been left out are a list of the bus stops and actual departure times. If the intent is to describe the extent of the bus network, then all that is needed is a list of suburbs.--<a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako_0eb9.html" title="User:Mako">Mako</a> 06:38, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And it's still not a timetable. Timetables by their nature have times. Directories woul have contact details of the bus companies, on-time running information. This is a list of bus routes. It's a source of information that is useful about where buses run in Sydney. The <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> doctrine has been misused completely and this is yet another bad nomination of this.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would submit that having sections, journey duration and depot information for each route is probably going a bit too far. However, there is nothing wrong with having a route number, where it goes, who runs it and on what days it runs. No reason to delete, just cut it down a bit. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 20:36, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> The issue of other bus routes elsewhere has been raised repeatedly and will likely continue to be. It might be useful to request general comment through RfC on how, if at all, pages on metropolitan transit systems work, what data should be included, etc, etc. I personally use the local St. Louis Metrolink regularly, and have no objections to seeing articles on such subjects. However, I would argue against the inclusion of detailed bus routes in the local St. Louis system in wikipedia as being information of only local interest. On the same basis, as stated above, I personally see no reason for the inclusion of such data on a different system. However, a page or two, perhaps with links to some other site and a brief description of the routes, would not necessarily be objectionable. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 21:28, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete all</b> Taking <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnzy_60da.html" title="User:Arnzy">Arnzy</a>'s list, which I have numbered, I would rationalise that there are two categories of pages he has listed. In using the existence of them all to justify the continued presence of the proposed AfD, I believe he is misguided. Pages 1, 2, 3 (<i>up to bus routes</i>), 5, 8 (<i>2nd part</i>)and 10 should go. These consist of exhaustive but rather pointless and difficult to maintan lists which are not informative about the transport system which it purports to help to describe. [<i>Edit</i>: More relevant, up to date, and reliable information nan be obtained from the transport authority concerned, without anyone needing to waste any effort to redo something that's perfecty good from same. Here, it is clear to me that wiki's role is to inform, yet is not a bus directory. The pages subject to AfD here] exist to satisfy the completionists' desire to have everything catalogued, however trivial and irrelevant. On the other hand, pages 3 (<i>1st part</i>), 4, 6, 8 (<i>1st part</i>), [<i>Edit</i>: and each individual page under the grouping 11 is indeed uniquely] informative about the history, rationale, evolution of that route, as part of the system as a whole. Not in eithe category is Page 7, which describes the type of British double decker bus which has a signigficant part in british culture and dear to the hearts of many Britons. [Edit: Ditto page 9, which is informative as to the ypes of vehicle used (probably) not readily available elsewhere without painstaking research. ]I would say that page 10 deserves to be deleted forthwith as it is the worst offender, encapsulating all the bad points of the lists and none of the good points per my arguments.

<li><b>Comment</b> It is quite clear that 'unmaintainable' is a non-argument, as you have shown no reason why it is unmaintainable. On the contrary, people hwo are interested do keep it up to date. It is not even difficult to maintain some of them particularly the TransLink page, which has been templated). 'Pointlessness' and 'triviality' are also non-arguments as they are purely subjective and differ from person to person (i.e. they are not capable of forming a consensus) - it is likely pointless or trivial to you as you are not a local. You may as well argue that any number of articles about things of no meaningful relevance to some people should be deleted. On this basis I could argue (for argument's sake, I actually adopt the opposite position) that the Hong Kong page you and I recently supported is pointless because all it does it tell us a great deal of numbers and prefixes without even telling us where the routes go - what use is that? It has also been pointed out many times that the information in this form is either not available on official sites or for whatever reason is actually <i>less</i> accurate on those sites in some cases where updates have been overlooked. I would also point out that you suggest somewhat incongruously keeping the London bus routes and not the Melbourne tram routes, odd because Melbourne's network is one of track (i.e. actually permanent) routes and forms the largest tram system in the English speaking world, and most of those London pages do nothing except list the stops on each route. They are constantly supported and remain here, why is this page any different? If anything it is more efficient as it wastes less space than a whole series of individual bus route articles. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 00:04, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>except info on which franchises have been granted to which operator, the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bus_routes_in_Hong_Kong_1ab4.html" title="List of bus routes in Hong Kong">List of bus routes in Hong Kong</a> seems worthy of deletion to me per my explanation above. It is not the worst list I have seen, but as the good quality summary information is already available for HK at <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_bus_route_numbering_1aef.html" title="Hong Kong bus route numbering">Hong Kong bus route numbering</a> which, incidentally DOES tell you where the routes go. We could argue till the cows come home, because this debate is getting nowhere. This AfD has the "absolute completionists" dug in against those who want to delete anything at all because by doing so would spoil the completeness and accuracy of the information. As I already said, I think this particular list subject to deletion is just pure completionists' nonsense for completionisms' sake, but it's whatever turns you on. The fact that I am not local to Sydney is a red herring and is an unfair jibe. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 04:35, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Proposal</b> - I'm fed up with this debate - it's plagued by deletionists who have contributed nothing to (or even know nothing about) Sydney Public Transport information, then propose everything for deletion under a misguided reading of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> - let's propose a compromise. Let's have a single page of all the bus routes <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bus_routes_in_Sydney_a144.html" title="List of bus routes in Sydney">List of bus routes in Sydney</a> (probably moved to "List of Sydney bus routes" to be consistent with other Australian cities), without journey time, frequency and sections. Just where they go (from, to, via), the bus operator and the depot which serves that particular route (if relevant). If it doesn't run all day or is a peak hour express only route, that should be included. A link to the timetable on the bus site should also be included perhaps (optional). And any interesting information, like the former tram route buses. Perhaps this will satisfy people ... comments anyone?

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Do you propose any criteria for inclusion in the list, other than either "currently exists" or "has ever existed"? If all of the hundreds of routes are listed, then we're exactly where we started and may as well leave the existing pages, which are at least a managable size. An example might demonstrate what I'm trying to get at here. Routes 132 and 133 both travel between Manly and Waringah Mall. Most of their route is identical, but they take a slightly different path through Balgowlah. Presumably both are based out of the depot near Waringah Mall. Is there anything particularly important about the difference between the two routes? If the difference between the two is trivial, then why do details of both need to be listed? --<a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako_0eb9.html" title="User:Mako">Mako</a> 01:36, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> What is the point of having an abstract box of numbers when there is already a more detailed version? That is less benefical than what we have now. That page can stay as it is if people want it that way, there is no reason to emasculate this one to emulate the other. I would also imagine this list should only be for current routes and not e.g. like Melbourne's tram routes list, which has historical details, as they are easier to manage there than past routes here would be. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 01:45, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
