<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - well, really, anybody who is in broadcasting is technically a Peabody award candidate, all you really need is $150 for the entrance fee. There's no announcement of finalists for the awards, so unless she wins, we have no indication of how she ranked among all the other entrants that year. I looked at the sources, and of the ones that are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>, she is only briefly mentioned - in fact, from what I can tell, she has just as many direct quotes printed in USA Today as I do, and I can tell you unequivocally, I'm not notable. She is certainly on the cusp of notablity, so don't be afraid to re-create the article when she gets a bit more media coverage under her belt (or of she does happen to win the Peabody, since thats instantly notable). - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 22:29, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Reply to <s>Weak Delete</s><a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a></b> No offense but if ^that^ is your criteria then I am afraid that you are going to have to delete several entries for radio personalities from wikipedia because there are personalities listed here who, unlike JC Lamkin, have never had any notable interviews nor awards. They are much less noteworthy, have zero articles written regarding their work (via blog, newspapers, magazines or other). Nor do they cross professional, activist and artistic lines; yet they have been approved and warmly received on wikipedia. Let me know if you would like me to list their entries so that you may lobby to have them deleted, also.

<p><b>Also, she is an independent filmmaker.</b> I thought that I pointed that out earlier, but this info must have slipped through the e-cracks because clearly there is an overabundance of information that proves that JC Lamkin is wikipedia-able (yes, I just made up a new word, but it fits right&#160;:-).</p>
<p>But, seriously...her most recent film "The Struggle for Safer Streets" is an entry in the Blacklily Film and Music Festival in the category of social change documentary. Here is a link to the Blacklily site for fyi purposes: <a href="http://www.blacklilyfilm.org" class="external free" title="http://www.blacklilyfilm.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.blacklilyfilm.org</a></p>
<p>I probably should have mentioned that earlier, too; but frankly, she has so many achievements that I am an not quite certain which achievements I should list and which achievement will just piss off the editors (btw, she is a candidate for the Peabody in <b>two</b> categories, Public Service and Documentary&#160;;-)</p>

<li><b>Commment</b> Ken, you are obviously enthusiastic about this article, and I hope you keep that enthusiasm as you embark on your wiki-career. You are correct that the number of google hits is not a strict indicator of how notable somebody is, but in this case it is making it difficult for us to verify the information in the article. I took a few minutes to look over the sources again, and unfortunately, I have to stand my my&#160;!vote - there was <a href="http://www.naturalorganizedwomansororityincorporated.com/2006AwardsLuncheon.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.naturalorganizedwomansororityincorporated.com/2006AwardsLuncheon.htm" rel="nofollow">an awards lunchon</a> put on by a group who's home page featured a story about Anita T. Conner, but the website lists no further information nor does it mention the name of the award, and nowhere is Lamkin's name associated with the award, so unfortunately, that bit of info is completely unsourced. The film festival info is also unverifable, as the link you posted doesn't list the name of the movies participating, and Google provided us with no reliable verification that the movie "The Struggle for Safer Streets" was produced by Ms. Lamkin. I did find a story in this local/regional newspaper <a href="http://www.scoopusanewspaper.com/ScoopAugust0406.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scoopusanewspaper.com/ScoopAugust0406.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> about Ms. Lamkin (page 8), and besides noting that the 4th paragraph of the wiki article was a borderline copyvio of the story, it did not appear to me that this is a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, nor could I find any other mentions of Ms. Lamkin winning those awards. It is quite obvious hat Ms. Lamkin is a powerful force within her community, but there are many, many people that are powerful forces in their communities around the world - and while thats admirable, if others aren't writing about their accomplishments, then we cannot verify them, and if we can't verify them, then they can't be here. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 04:29, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

she is listed as the producer and director in the closing credits. Regarding the other items in question, they are verifiable, if not metatagged by google then via email, phone, etc. At any rate, I'm going to stick with my original position ....<b>"Keep"</b> KenHouston 04:50, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</blockquote>
