<li><b>Delete</b> It's painfully obvious that Bart McQueary or someone who knows Bart Mcqueary has been editing the article in favor of McQueary, and there's no way that he/they are ever going to let up. This is probably a rare instance in wiki, someone vandalizing their own entry in their favor; but if Mcqueary can't play by the rules, and he won't allow anyone else to play by the rules, well, I see no great loss by removing his entry. He doesn't exactly... well... matter, anyway. Im sure there are plenty of other bible thumpers and porno pushers out there to take up the clout.Timmybiscool 02:10, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>STRONG Delete</b> I've tried to work on this the best I can. Honest to God I have. I've done my homework. I've combed through page after page of McQueary's own archived websites looking for the truth. I find the man despicable, but I have put the positive information I found on him in this article. I could have easily neglected that he did in fact raise money for children's charities, that he was in fact harassed unjustly by the police, that his statutory rape arrest was due to a piddly three year difference. I did no such thing. The good and the bad are both in this article. But McQueary doesn't want the latter of those two included, apparently. Case in point: Bart McQueary is trying to edit the article to remove the fact that he once advertised his page as an escort service. For over two years now the web archive service has featured the page proving this. It was linked to here in the article, and for the past week or so you could click on that link and see it for yourself. Now that McQueary has come in and started editing the page, the "escort page"-- which for YEARS has been out there in the web archive for all to see-- has suddenly been disabled by a robots.txt. Coincidence? I think not. And of course he is going to come in here, boorish as he is in real life, saying, "PROVE IT. PROVE that it existed." Well guess what, Bart, I could've, if I'd have known you were going to block the page. I could've saved the page to my PC and uploaded it to another server for all the world to behold. But you got rid of it. And now, no, I can't "prove it." And the only reason is because of you. McQueary is trying to manipulate what people can know about him. If that's the case, there's no need in having an entry on him in Wiki; he'll only allow information about himself that he WANTS to be known.<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.154.189.180.html" title="User:69.154.189.180">69.154.189.180</a> 02:26, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Just out of curiosity... have you ever looked up Robert Million in the Harrodsburg listings?
<ul>
<li>Sign your posts with four ~ so people can see who you are. Yes, there is a Robert Million in Harrodsburg, per the Kentucky white pages. I will check in a moment to see if this number matches the one on REM Entertainment. If this truly is the operator of REM, it brings up a new question-- if McQueary had truly been "born again," why would he enable the furtherance of pornography by selling his business to someone else to continue marketing his stuff-- including homosexual porn? Why didn't he shut down the site? And why did REM Entertainment go down in the same time frame as McQueary's page? Bart McQueary, hater of homosexuals, not only sells his porn page rather than shut it down, but he sells it to someone in the exact same town he lives in, who keeps McQueary's phone number on the page for an extended period of time, and when a new number appears people call it and claim to have reached Mcqueary, AND it goes down at the same time McQueary's page goes down? Let us use Occam's Razor here. By the way, while I was at it, I looked up Bart McQueary and found zero results. Also zero for Bartley McQueary, and the only B McQueary was a "B.M. McQueary" in Louisville. <a href="http://www.whitepages.com/10001/search/Find_Person?firstname_begins_with=1&amp;firstname=&amp;name=McQueary&amp;city_zip=&amp;state_id=KY" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitepages.com/10001/search/Find_Person?firstname_begins_with=1&amp;firstname=&amp;name=McQueary&amp;city_zip=&amp;state_id=KY" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Even Fred Phelps keeps his number listed. And what do people have to gain by saying they called REM and got ahold of McQueary? The people to post on AIA aren't the only ones. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.154.189.180.html" title="User:69.154.189.180">69.154.189.180</a> 04:26, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Golly, isn't that funny? After two years of being able to access Bart's Stuff/REM Entertainment's archived pages via archive.org, in the past few days they have mysteriously been blocked from viewing by the site's owner! Isn't that a splendid concidence to protect the venerable name of Bart McQueary? If his life is such an open book, why does he feel the need to hide these things about himself? This article needs to be deleted on the sheer basis that McQueary is actively destroying information about himself. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.154.189.180.html" title="User:69.154.189.180">69.154.189.180</a> 04:30, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Timmybiscool. An article on Fred Phelps is appropriate, but I can't see that Bart McQueary is anything other than an attention-starved moron. Are we going to give every thug his own article? Besides, as has been said, if he (or whoever) can't leave the article alone, it's really not worth the trouble. Don't feed his 300 pound ego any more. --<s>4.253.71.19</s> 02:31, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Whether legitimately members or not, I feel that cult members do not necessarily get to have a page over non-cult members for doing the same acts. Any of his actual activities would not legitimize having a Wiki entry, and the fact that he is trying to modify it means that even if valid, the article's existence will always be less than reliable.

<li>I would have no problem with McQueary being a section in the ACLU Ten Commandments Lawsuit, kept strictly to being about his lawsuit.

<li><i>SIGN YOUR COMMENTS'</i>. I led the charge to have this deleted last time, too. But since it didn't go through, I figured the truth about McQueary might as well be known. Now that another opportunity has come up... My "claims" as you call them only became "claims" a few days ago when Bart McQueary blocked the archives of his webpages in order to get the information taken out of wiki per lack of evidence. Before then, they were not claims-- they were indisputable facts. Hey, Bart, how about you get rid of your robots.txt so everyone can see that I'm telling the truth? Oh, I forgot-- the truth isn't what you're interested in. If McQueary truly had repented his old ways, why would he block the archived pages, unless they were evidence of a crime he didn't want known? Paul of Tarsus certainly didn't try to cover up that he was a murderer.65.71.127.228 19:38, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In addition to the Ten Commandments we also have this case [<a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050306/NEWS0104/503060496/1008/NEWS01" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050306/NEWS0104/503060496/1008/NEWS01" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>].

<dd>I will admit I miscounted--there are only two anonymous keeps. However, percentage wise this is almost half of the votes to keep, as opposed the vast majority of deletes which are registered users.

<li><b>Delete</b>, I've lived in Harrodsburg, and I have no doubt that Bart is editing his stuff. I used to see him coming into Wal-Mart to buy the packing envelopes for his videos. And you know what? After he "sold the page," I STILL saw him coming into Wal-Mart and buying packing envelopes en masse. Make no bones about it-- his "conversion" is an absolute joke. Bart has either gone insane, he was never firmly based in reality to begin with, and thinks he is Phelps, or he has become Phelps because his pleasure in life is hurting others, and who has done that better than Westboro. It was a real ugly thing when his brother died, I think that might have something to do with it. And his the whole business with him and the girl. Take it from someone who's met him and had to deal with him: This guys ten commandmetns lawsuit was nothing more than an attempt to feed his own bloated, hateful ego. He doesn't give a damn about the ACLU or anybody's freedoms, only causing trouble for others and stirring up crap. Mention him in the lawsuit if you have to, but keep it to a bare minimum; anything more is inviting him to ooze his way into the cracks of Wiki and poison it. 216.7.251.54 17:05, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> after a rewrite. The article is too long, in fact it is longer than many movie stars. It should talk about the ACLU Ten Commandments article, the lawsuit with the Kentucky slogan, briefly touch upon the association with <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Phelps_24e6.html" title="Fred Phelps">Fred Phelps</a> and then end.
