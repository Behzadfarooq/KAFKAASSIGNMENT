<p>Vanity for Mr. Ling. His work with Naschy and the <i><a href="../../../g/r/a/Grandmother_Martha_fd4e.html" title="Grandmother Martha">Grandmother Martha</a></i> project can be (and mostly has been) merged with those respective articles. Holding an out-of-date couple of Guinness entries is not a free pass to notability, nor is trying to pass oneself off as a member of the Holy Roman Empire.

<li>With all due respect, I disagree with you here, Russian. I don't think you're a bad person, so if you wrote a bad article, I would easily be able to call it crap without calling you crap. I call articles garbage in AfD discussions frequently, but it's because I think the article- not the person(s) who wrote/edited it- is of little value. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 14:24, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I've unblanked the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> With some cleanup, expansion, and attention, I think it could be expanded into a very useful article. At the moment it focuses on one incident related to terrorism, but I have heard it used in other contexts, and it is more or less a general law enforcement term. It definately needs expanding, but it is worth keeping. <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> 16:43, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as the article is almost content-free, pretty much all the content it has is false other than a dicdef, and it is hard to see how it could ever be improved. Redirect to <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Dares_Wins_%28film%29_ed2f.html" title="Who Dares Wins (film)">Who Dares Wins (film)</a> (which is nothing to do with the incident described, but was indeed called <i>Final Option</i> in the US). --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 17:36, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Do as you like. Delete or keep. But DO NOT say the content is false without explaining. Also, if you cannot see how the film Who Dares Wins, AKA The Final Option, illustrates the term, or do not believe that it was inspired by Operation Nimrod then perhaps you are unqualified to comment. As for content, there wil never be any if it is deleted. I thought the entire point of this obviously anal site is improvement through open contributions. Once again, do as you like. It obviously means more to you than to me.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianb0806_3ef1.html" title="User:Brianb0806">Brianb0806</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrianb0806_bb47.html" title="User talk:Brianb0806">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brianb0806_0462.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brianb0806">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Articles like this are the reason I began getting involved with Wikipedia several years ago.

<li><b>Delete</b> <strike><b>Move</b> to Wiktionary</strike>. This is a legitimate and common slang term used by many gamers to describe exactly the behavior noted. That does not justify a Wikipedia article but it does belong in a dictionary under the verb 'to Bum Rush'. At some point the original meaning of the term (as per much of slang and gamer-speak) was lost in favor of this meaning. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 01:30, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think the original meaning of the phrase "Bum's rush (quickly and/or forcibly removed from the premises as if one were a 'bum') has been lost except to those under the age of 16. At any rate, I didn't see much difference between what this article describes and the more succinct definition covered at the Wiktionary article I linked, except that they're applying that definition to the world of video games. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 01:33, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> It's not his movies that make him notable. I didn't even know he did movies. You can delete his movie works off this article, that is not why he's notable. He's notable for his invisible theater work that he's been exploring in the New York City area. Actually I think it would be a better article if it didn't mention his film at all and a stub was added for his experimental theater work was added.

<dd>Well, that's part of the issue with Invisible Theater is that they don't go around advertising themselves.

<dd>comment. That brings up the interesting aspect of some of this notability argumentation. Most people haven't heard of vlogs at all, so does that make it more likely that such a site isn't notable? __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 17:23, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Yeah, that's a good question, though I think there's certainly room for articles surrounding topics that may not be known to the world at large. I think vlogs should generally be held to the same standard as a regular blog, which should be a reasonably high standard. In this case, the mainstream media coverage and the fact that Rocketboom has been out at the front in development of a certain type of vlog is more than enough to meet my threshold for notability. However, what about the case in which the vlog/blog is particlularly well known in the blogging community, but has limited outside coverage? See the Chuck Olson discussion for example of one of these: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chuck_Olsen_d7a7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chuck Olsen">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chuck Olsen</a>. In this case, I thought it wasn't notable enough, at least for now . <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 18:00, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I'd heard of vlogs, and am familiar with them. For me it remains the difference between having 15 minutes of fame, and being notable, and my vote is unchanged. However, the upgrade in documentation (to my mind, mostly 'me-too' news releases) helps make the thing at least look encyclopedic. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 04:54, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would argue the opposite. The addition of documentation adds notability but it does not make the article or subject encyclopedic. Rocketboom is a blog and such things are impermanent not to mention they appeal to only small portions of individuals. I could see an argument for its notability or encyclopedic importance to a subculture but that in itself, in my view, rules out its importance. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 13:08, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. As a TV writer/producer with credits on Star Trek: TNG, Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Insurrection, The Dead Zone, Wildfire and other productions, I personally consider Starship Exeter to be the most notable and most professionally produced tribute series on the Internet.

<li><b>Query about the entire process</b> Is there a Wikipedia policy against all non-professional films? If this entry is to be deleted for being a fan film, then ergo so much all other entries on such items. Or is it noteworthiness and existing media attention that are the criteria? Or is it that the article as written is not as informative as should be for an encyclopediac entry? I do not see as valid comparisons of the merit of the films in question to other fan films.

<dd>That's interesting. Could someone please explain what this has to do with the validity of a persons vote? Am I to infer that the vote of someone who has voted on many AfD's will be given more weight than the vote of someone who knows something about the subject? So that it is more important to be a scholar of Wikipedia than an expert on fan films? So that the opinion of, for example, Eric A. Stillwell "a TV writer/producer with credits on Star Trek: TNG, Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Insurrection, The Dead Zone, Wildfire and other productions" will be given less weight than the honeourable <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeleuze_eace.html" title="User:Deleuze">Deleuze</a>, who I am assuming from his post is a frequenter of AfD's? I can respect that there is a need for woodcutters in a forest but I most certainly hope that they will NOT be given any greater standing than those who plant and tend the forest.

<dd>Good faith has nothing to do with it, I am talking logic here. I assumed that AfDs were not straight votes, however if this were so then it would mean that all this hoohaa about "ballot stuffing" would be background noise wouldn't it? This also means that <a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike's</b></a> countup of votes on 00:43, 15 June 2006 (UTC) is useless. I can also assume that a vote that does not reference specific instances and examples to support it will be given less weight than one which does? Good! Then I feel that ayes have it! Since all we have had from the nays seem to be unreferenced and unsupported opinions like "this clearly fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> in my mind." and the classic "Star Trek fancruft.".

<dd>Since none of these experts will answer your question Gene, I'll take a stab at it ..."It is true that things labeled fancruft are often deleted from Wikipedia. This is primarily due to the fact that things labeled as fancruft are often poorly written, unreferenced, unwikified, and non-neutral - all things that lead to deletion. Such articles may also fall foul of Wikipedia's policy against creating "indiscriminate collections of information". Well-referenced and well-written articles on obscure topics are from time to time deleted as well, but such deletions are controversial. It is also worth noting that many articles on relatively obscure topics are featured articles.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Generally speaking, the perception that an article is fancruft can be a contributing factor in its nomination and deletion, but it is not the actual reason for deletion. Rather, the term fancruft is a shorthand for content which one or more editors consider unencyclopaedic, possibly to the extent of violating policies on verifiability, neutrality or original research."

<dd>I have no idea, but I would expect someone of such exalted stature to be able to give us exact and concise reasons for their opinions instead of computer-generated comments. Could you explain the logic of why the opinion of a "long-term contributor who contributes on more than one subject" is of more weight than a member of a "single-TV-show pressure group" or to be more precise, a fan. Do you perhaps have something against fandom and the encyclopedic knowledge that we have on our subject?

<dd>You could well be right and it could be an accident that certain users use the exact same wording on every AfD. Mind you we could have different definitions of a Bot since WCityMike has pointed out that this Monobook thingy is a commonly used tool. Pity my most sophisticated tool is cut &amp; paste. If your definition of a Bot is an automated programme that does multiple posts without further human intervention, then yes, I was out of line. Just how many keystokes does it take to create an AfD with one of these Monobook whatsis anyway? More than ten? Less than three? Enquiring minds want to know, unless its a secret? If this is not the place for my enquiry perhaps you could tell me where and who to ask?

<li><b>Comment</b> - I call it as I see it - had you bothered to bring this up on a talk page, you might have had your concerns addressed before going on a wholesale deletion rampage. In the Trek community, these films you've targeted are notable, and those that AREN'T have already gone by the wayside in AfDs of their own. Now, to <i>Stone Trek</i> specificially, a Google search beings back over <b>16,000</b> returns on the term, practially ALL of them referring to this series - it's obviously been talked about. SciFi.com picked it as their site of the week <a href="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue213/site.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue213/site.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>, featured on G4TechTV <a href="http://www.g4tv.com/startrekthenextgeneration/features/53187/Star_Trek_Film_Fandom.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.g4tv.com/startrekthenextgeneration/features/53187/Star_Trek_Film_Fandom.html" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>, and is widely regarded as one of the better Flash cartoon series on the web. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeWazowski_3925.html" title="User:MikeWazowski">MikeWazowski</a> 04:13, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> Well, that's really the point, isn't it? Any article is cherished enough to its own particular community (or WikiProject), and I'm sure in some sections of Trek fandom, various Flash videos and fan films are quite important to you. But AfD asks the Wikipedia community as a whole to comment. If these articles are truly as important as you say they are, then certainly they can stand and pass a consensus decision on notability on their own two legs. Now, as I'm rather sick of the <i>ad hominem</i> attacks, I'm off to go on a wholesale sleeping rampage. — <b><a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike">WCityMike</a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/c/i/User_talk%7EWCityMike_fb24.html" title="User talk:WCityMike">T</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">C</a>)</sup> <span style="color:black; background-color:#FFFF99;">&#160;<b><small>⇓ plz reply <u>HERE</u> &#160;(<a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_a6d3.html#How_to_keep_a_two-way_conversation_readable" title="Wikipedia:Talk page">why?</a>)&#160;⇓</small></b>&#160;</span> 04:22, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A (paid, not free press) newspaper or general readership magazine review or interview would do me. If it's a notable production, it'll make the real papers rather than being limited to the incestuous, self-referential slashdotty world of skiffydom, flash animation and webfads. Otherwise it's no more notable than the work of film students. Given the self-selection bias issues of voters and the excessive reliance on Googling, I think it's only fair to demand much higher standards of notability for web-related cruft. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 22:06, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Flash fanfilms are not notable? You perhaps have a resource that backs that personal opinion up? Since you have chosen to base your vote on a generalisation, I shall address those generalisations in my rebuttal. Fan films are certainly notable, as can be seen from this article<a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/cybercinema/storynonav/0,7645,402055,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://film.guardian.co.uk/cybercinema/storynonav/0,7645,402055,00.html" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> in The Guardian. Flash fan films in the Star Trek genre are a bit thin on the ground, "Stone Trek" is definately the leader, however newcomers like Chad Troftgruben, who hit the topical bone with "Enterprise Flashed" and "Ahoyager"<a href="http://www.lilredheadcomics.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lilredheadcomics.com/" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>, and John Hazard's<a href="http://thehazmat.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://thehazmat.com/" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> "Starship Exeter, the Animated Odyssey"<a href="http://www.subspacebbs.com/forums/showthread.php?t=17902" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.subspacebbs.com/forums/showthread.php?t=17902" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>are making a mark. But of course your generalisation was that ALL flash fan films are not notable! Including the 2003 "Run Lieia Run" (which won awards in two film festivals), the Star Dudes films? Perhaps you are talking about "Broken Saints"<a href="http://www.edgeboston.com/index.php?ch=giveawaycenter&amp;sc=giveaway_enter&amp;id=1657" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.edgeboston.com/index.php?ch=giveawaycenter&amp;sc=giveaway_enter&amp;id=1657" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> or "Xombie" which is arguably the best of the current crop scoring interviews in Fangoria<a href="http://www.xombified.com/pdfs/fango_dec2005.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xombified.com/pdfs/fango_dec2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, Rue Morgue<a href="http://www.xombified.com/pdfs/ruemorgue_aug2005.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xombified.com/pdfs/ruemorgue_aug2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, Horror Movies Online<a href="http://www.horror-movies.ca/horror_3449.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.horror-movies.ca/horror_3449.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>, Movies Online<a href="http://www.xombieforum.com/moviesonline/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xombieforum.com/moviesonline/" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> and Newgrounds Mag <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/ngmag/devspot/spotlight/15" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newgrounds.com/ngmag/devspot/spotlight/15" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>.

<li><b>Ridiculously strong keep</b>. Are you kidding me? He produced, starred in, made the special effects for and edited what is most likely the most popular movie to ever come out of Finland. (It has already been downloaded at least 3.5 million times, as reported in <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helsingin_Sanomat_28bb.html" title="Helsingin Sanomat">Helsingin Sanomat</a>, the largest Finnish newspaper about six months ago -- I wasn't able to track down how many more times it's been downloaded since then.) Yes, it's free to download from the internet, but that's not really the point; I think he <i>easily</i> passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> on the <i>"Multiple features in [...] national newspapers"</i> front; the movie and Torssonen himself have gotten a lot of coverage in Finland.

<li>I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but I want to be absolutely clear on this -- the national significance is pretty big, here, and I don't think Americans or Brits really understand this unless I elaborate. Internationally, Torssonen is not a huge name, of course, and I'm not going to pretend that he's a household name in Finland, either. But as far as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s requirements go, this one's a cinch. There's really no argument. He absolutely meets the criteria therein, as far as the publicity requirement goes. The <i>"made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field"</i> criterion is also fairly applicable, since his work is getting a relatively wide international audience -- previously, Finnish films have been internationally known for <a href="../../../a/k/i/Aki_Kaurism%C3%A4ki_6afe.html" title="Aki Kaurismäki">Aki Kaurismäki</a>, and that's really just about it. Obviously, that's not registering at all on the Hollywood scale, but when it comes to Finland, that international audience is extremely significant on a number of levels, and it has certainly been noted as such in the media. I realize that a lot of people consider the film a crappy Trek parody, but quality is not the issue here at all. To compare him to, say, the thousands of Americans who make parodies or fan films that never really make a blip on the radar is just uninformed. If, say, <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Rubio_6f78.html" title="Kevin Rubio">Kevin Rubio</a> (whose inclusion nobody really contests, I would imagine; at least that article has never been up for AfD) had been featured on CNN and Fox News, and <i><a href="../../../t/r/o/Troops.html" title="Troops">Troops</a></i> had been aired on a national American TV channel and gotten, say, in excess of fifty million viewers who then, went to work the next day and debated whether the movie was as good as <i>Citizen Kane</i> and representative of American moviemaking to foreigners, that would be a comparable level of fame... even if the general public couldn't really remember or care who Kevin Rubio was a couple of years later. Tempest in a teapcup, absolutely. But in a country that has a population of only about five million, shit like this just doesn't happen every week. Not even every decade. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 19:57, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I'm starting to have a feeling that if Torssonen's film hadn't been a Star Trek parody, we wouldn't even be having this discussion. There are articles about smaller, less-known, not professionally funded indie film projects on Wikipedia, and no one is complaining about them.

<li>I am not yet convinced that we actually need two articles. Also the articles on <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuli_Torssonen_7762.html" title="Samuli Torssonen">Samuli Torssonen</a> and the 4 1/2 film repeat the same facts that can already be found on <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wreck_2e2e.html" title="Star Wreck">Star Wreck</a> and In the Pirkinning article. The extra information in In the Pirkinning article not found in the other articles consists of detailed trivia on characters, spaceships and sometimes even explanation of the jokes of the movie. IMHO a part of that could be deleted, for example I doubt that we need the detailed analysis of the Kari Grandi joke in the article. I still suspect that after rewrite the current material amounts to one good article, but of course I'd be glad to see two good articles.<a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunainen_N%C3%B6rtti_4c72.html" title="User:Punainen Nörtti">Punainen Nörtti</a> 17:53, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Such gaming clans are speedy deleted based on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion</a>. Specifically, standard A7 says that speedy deletion is permissible for "An article about a real person, group of people, band, or club that does not assert the importance or significance of its subject." This article asserts its importance based on it being (1) long-running and (2) having 1500 members. I would suggest reading the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bravo_Fleet_c316.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bravo Fleet">first AFD</a> as there are plenty of comments in there about this organization's notability. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 04:10, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>For anyone who hasn't checked the old nomination, my original comments run thus: <i>I've just finished looking at some similar afd's (one of which was nominated by myself), have checked the Bravo Fleet site and forums and have reconsidered my position. First, Bravo Fleet (the website) merely serves as a hub for the simming group itself. The majority of 'business' conducted concerning the group is not seen here. I don't mean the emails that relay back and forth with any co-maintained website, but this. Bravo Fleet rules state that every individual game must have its own website. Looking at the group's posted stats, that's 186 websites. Add to this forums and posting groups and the numbers suddenly shoot up. We can't measure the combined visibility of these websites and they probably don't deserve their own articles, but there's no denying they add to the totals presented for Bravo Fleet, given that they are subserviant to it. As well as this, on Wikipedia's notability page for websites, it is stated that with regards to (sign up &amp; read) forums, that a total post count totalling three times the user count is 'good.' The BF forums have a post count that is 64 times the member count. Now I feel this method of judgement is somewhat lacking, but Wikipedia adheres to it and so it should be considered. The page also cites An established comic or site which has set a trend eg. Bob and George, while not the first sprite comic, did inspire many others. This seems to fit Bravo Fleet rather accurately. It was not the first Star Trek RPG group (its own history confirms that "Tango Fleet" is at least a year older) but many ST RPG groups seek to mould themselves in Bravo Fleet's image i.e. a large 'fleet' containing multiple 'task forces' and games. The closest written example to hand I have is taken from Expansion Fleet,</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>A Feedback/Suggestions forum is opened for all members to discuss freely their ideas and suggestions. This initiative proves succesfull and the idea is born to turn Expansion into something bigger and creating various divisions, similar to the style of Bravo Fleet and Tango Fleet.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Also note that the Wikipedia guidelines regarding website notability are often ignored in individual cases. I have no intention of extensively debating the suitability of these guidelines (as I find them to be largely unobjectionable) or defending this article, but given that the above strengthened my mind on the issue, it may be that it affects others. Clearly piece by piece these 'loopholes' if you want to call them that, don't seem much and don't warrant inclusion by themselves, but there are clearly a number of them in this case making this (I feel) an exception to the general rules. - Hayter 14:25, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</i> - <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayter_218b.html" title="User:Hayter">Hayter</a> 22:35, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>KEEP</b> per my reasons in the first AFD (which I've included here). Also, this is being proposed by a <a href="../../../a/w/w/Template%7EAWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD_e953.html" title="Template:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">pseudo-deletionist</a> without a real reason why it should be deleted, without citing any valid Wikipedia Policy. I'm sorry, but show me where "fancruft" is a valid policy. I'll admit to being a senior member of BF, but I have also been a Wikipedian for over a year and a half now.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Responsive points:
<ul>
<li>When Azathar links to "pseudodeletionist," he links to the category of "Association of Wikipedians Who Dislike Making Broad Judgements About the Worthiness of a General Category of Article, and Who Are In Favor of the Deletion of Some Particularly Bad Articles, but That Doesn't Mean They are Deletionist." I have no idea if the actions of this association's users don't actually correspond to the midpoint philosophy suggested by its name — but that's of no matter, as I have done nothing with them. I merely chose to associate my account with their category because they seemed to be a useful midpoint between inclusionism and deletionism, with a title expressed in a humorous way.</li>
<li>Regarding my use of the term "fancruft":
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a> essay — not policy, but a peer-reviewed essay — states, "[Individuals who dislike the term "fancruft"] might likewise consider use of the term in forums such as articles for deletion inappropriate, but it is nevertheless in common use there."</li>
<li>Said essay also states that fancruft is commonly used as a shortcut in AfD to reference the "indiscriminate collection of information" clause: "Such articles may also fall foul of Wikipedia's policy against creating 'indiscriminate collections of information.'" That would be what I originally meant.</li>
<li>It is questionable whether using the term "fancruft" is a proper reason for a deletion nomination, but if it is, this shortcut has been committed on a massive scale in AfD for God knows how long.</li>
<li>That having been said, I've realized after my June 6 nominations that using the term "fancruft" seems to generate unnecessary offense. One might posit that these individuals are going to get offended anyway, but I've started using the direct policy cite.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The policy language under "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a>" does not support inclusionism. But I'm not about to start debating with Azathar the merits and faults of inclusionism. It's a battle that's raged on Wikipedia long before I got here, and it's not been resolved. I doubt Azathar and I could come to an agreement.</li>
<li>I'll let others respond to Azathar's questions about <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>. I did not cite either in my nomination. In fact, I don't see anyone the <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> clause in this AfD, but perhaps Azathar couldn't be bothered to tailor his response to respond to the actual claims.</li>
<li>Azathar has got his vote, and if this goes against him, he's got <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. But <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_free_host.2C_blog.2C_webspace_provider_or_social_networking_site" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia isn't his web host</a>, and that means his article isn't a God-given right and is thus subject to community consensus. —&#160;<span style="font-size: 88%; font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><font color="#009900"><b>Mike</b></font></a></span>&#160;•&#160; 20:17, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I appreciate the response. This isn't my article, in that I didn't write it, but I do have a vested interest in it. And you are correct regarding the inclusionist argument, we probably couldn't come to an agreement. I know you didn't cite <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, I included them because I mentioned them in the first AfD, and I did say that I voted Keep based on those same reasons. You are right that I don't have a "God-given" right to have my article up on wikipedia, but you don't need to be rude and say "God-given" right either. Remember <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a>. Lastly, "fancruft" is just an essay, not policy, and as such, it shouldn't be used as a reason for an AfD, though you are also correct that is has been before. Perhaps though you should be an example for other editors and correctly state your reasons why you think this article should be deleted. Your "corrected" reason is a much better one to use then "fancruft". No, I'm not offended that you used the term, but instead am annoyed that you are using an essay (though peer-reviewed) that is NOT policy to justify an AfD. Just because every one else does it does not mean its the correct way to do it. And yes, I do have <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, thanks for the reminder.--<a href="../../../a/z/a/User%7EAzathar_4a0a.html" title="User:Azathar">Azathar</a> 00:37, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As for the claim of advertising for Fry's, given that Fry has invested much into starting and running the institute, it is hardly advertising to mention that he founded it. One focus of the Notices article is on its unusual workshop format; I believe describing this should make for an interesting article for Wikipedia. Finally, let me mention that AIM workshops (which have involved a number of distinguished mathematicians) and fellowships are very well-known and high-profile. There are only a handful of other institutes (like MSRI) in the U.S. that I can think to mention ahead of it.

The Wikipedia article for this author also mentions CyberQuest. However, upon revisiting this, I see that there are inconsistencies in the publisher's name and the books' characters. I've left a message on the contributor's talk page asking for the names of the books, and I will reserve my vote pending his or her response. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 13:29, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> This article isn't about the Sigmund Brouwer christian sci-fi series, but something unrelated and likely unverifiable.

<ul>
<li>Only if you accept any fandom at all as being significant. The furry fandom has enough support to hold multiple annual conventions with attendance in the thousands in North America alone, and is noteworthy enough to be ridiculed in national press a couple of times per year. Surely that merits inclusion of at least the top half-dozen touchstones of the fandom? Yerf, VCL, FurryMUCK, and Anthrocon would be the top four (in no particular order). If we can have articles on every village in the US, and every last pokemon character, how exactly can you justify setting the bar this high for a fandom? What I'm asking for is a _consistent_ bar, and I believe the Yerf article is well above anywhere you could reasonably place such a threshold based on the contents of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 05:10, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>You keep _stating_ this, but you haven't yet stated _why_ you consider it acceptable to have a varying standard for notability. Go and AfD all of the minor Pokemon articles referenced by the essay you dislike, and all but the more notable of the 30,000 US cities added by Rambot, if you're sincere about removing cruft from Wikipedia. Failing that, explain why furry fancruft should be removed while the other material in this example shouldn't. I have no problem with _standards_; I have a problem with _double_-standards. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 16:23, 9 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Asking me to AFD every bit of cruft before I get around to your personal favourite is just a little unreasonable, don't you think? Have you watched AFD recently -- did you see the mass Trekcruft nominations a couple of days ago? There's still a lot more of that to go. You aren't making an argument <i>for</i> Yerf... you are arguing that because there is lots of cruft in Wikipedia, we should have more. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 16:49, 9 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am asking you to go about your anti-cruft campaign in order of inverse notability. Go after the items with hundreds, instead of hundreds of thousands, of Google hits first. My <i>argument</i> is that given that all of this cruft that is far less notable than Yerf is currently being _kept_, a) Yerf satisfies whatever de-facto threshold for notability is being used on Wikipedia at present, and b) people seem to be using this de-facto threshold, as otherwise the cruft wouldn't be present at all. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 20:38, 9 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>1. Yerf does not satisfy the WP:WEB criteria. 2. Notability is about more than just being known to a few fans of the genre. 3. Keeping cruft in Wikipedia is easy, deleting it is hard work since block voting is commonplace. People vote keep regardless of guidelines, policies or arguments -- and this includes you. There's a much larger argument here about how Wikipedia is collecting unencylopedic rubbish because people can't get it in to their heads that Wikipedia isn't their personal diary, or a directory of fan crud, and that the AFD is so horribly broken that any crappy article can be block voted indefinitely by half a dozen fans (even though it is technically not supposed to be a vote). 4. Your argument boils down to this: there's already worse crap in Wikipedia, so why get rid of this. This is unjustifiable given the way Wikipedia works. We are dealing with Yerf now. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 22:18, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Would creating a new page, something like Furry art sites, and using that to combine the current Yerf, FA, and VCL articles, be an acceptable compromise? <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 18:05, 9 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, This isn't the place to be striking bargains about other articles. This is a discussion of the notability of Yerf. However, I can't say how other editors would react. All I can say is that if you create an article for Furry art sites, I will put it up for deletion. You don't need it, and they are not notable outside of the furry sub-culture. If you want to discuss Yerf, do it on <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">Furry fandom</a>. It does not justify its own article. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 18:20, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In practice what'll probably happen is that I'll do a minor rewrite of <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">furry fandom</a> to list the most notable art sites, conventions, people, and so forth (top handful that most people in the fandom know about), and a few years down the road when enough mentions in the press exist to stave off an AfD, expand the sections out into articles. It just annoys me, greatly, that a) this article is being deleted vastly out-of-order if we're sorting by notability, and b) <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">User:Motor</a> seems to be dismissing all offshoot articles relating to furry fandom as non-notable out of hand. To give an analogy, this would be like doing the same to the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Goth.html" title="Goth">goth</a> subculture 10-15 years ago (which is the main reason I'm not worried about this dismissal affecting the long-term outlook for inclusion). --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 20:38, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm somewhat hesitant to weigh in on some furry AFDs, but not this one. Yerf is a decade-old website whose significance as the premiere all-ages anthropomorphic art site is hard to underestimate. It has been temporarily less busy (<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=max&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;url=http://yerf.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=max&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;url=http://yerf.com/" rel="nofollow">alexa ranking details</a>) because for a time the site was down, and it is still ramping back up to full operational status, but that does not diminish its historical impact. If the WP:WEB guidelines do not cover it, then I believe they are in error. It may be that this article does not sufficiently establish the site's notability. If so, I suggest inclusion of some of the information available at <a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Yerf" class="extiw" title="wikifur:Yerf">WikiFur's version</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 17:47, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

Of art archives, the ones I would judge "noteworthy" nowadays apart from it would be FurAffinity, the VCL (Vixen Controlled Library), <a href="../../../s/h/e/SheezyArt_c82c.html" title="SheezyArt">SheezyArt</a> (not specifically furry) and Yiffstar. Funnily enough, those are the ones that already have articles here. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 18:48, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> for the same reasons as FurAffinity, below. Article is all hard-drive-failure this and server-downtime that, with no mention of any cultural relevance, media attention, etc. Might be possible to clean up, but current article is unacceptable. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 15:24, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - If Wikipedia accepted articles on every website that is known only among a small group of enthusiasts, it would soon be flooded with fancruft.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Like many deletion-bait website articles, this reads mostly like a log of the mundanities of running a medium-sized website: server downtime, hack attempts, getting a new server, new users showing up, etc. All of this is trivial in an ancyclopedic sense and not interesting or helpful to anyone not already a member. If article is cleaned up into something less trivial, preferably including media coverage and such, I'd possibly change my vote. Alexa rank is 65,722, higher than most AFD'ed websites, but not high enough to be kept on that basis alone. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 12:28, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Many of the entries assert that various publications have referred to them as cults without even providing a link or other information to verify it.

<li>POV is <i>not</i> <b>not</b> NPOV. Clearer: NPOV is achieved by accurately capturing reputable POVs not excluding POVs. Note that Islam isn't a cult, because it isn't unorthodox; it's well over a thousand years old.<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">WolfKeeper</a> 02:14, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It isn't unorthodox according to whom? And why does one thousand years matter? An unbiased reporting of someone's point of view is one thing. That's not a POV problem. But this isn't an unbiased reporting of someone's point of view. Rather, it's a biased reporting of someone's point of view. The requirement for inclusion given in the article is that a media source has referred to the group as a cult within the last 50 years and that the group has been in existence at some point within the last 150 years. Under that standard, Islam, Bahai, and the Roman Catholic Church all qualify. In a church I used to belong to, the pastor gave a sermon one Sunday called "How do I know if I'm in a cult" and one of the standards was that the organization does not recognize the Christian trinity. Well, just about any non-Christian religion would qualify as a cult under that standard. The fact that a subjective decision is being made about which groups to include (where does the number 1000 come from and how did you decide Islam is not unorthodox?) means that it is inherently POV. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 02:26, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>These sort of criteria will have to be worked out and clearly stated by the editors of the article. It's not necessary to figure out every detail right here and now, that's not what AfD is about. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:15, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not asking to figure out "every detail" - I'm asking about selection criteria for a list ... that's a pretty BIG detail. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 14:02, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>So include those, then, provided the sources meet whatever standards are decided on for that list. Of course it's possible to write a POV article by picking and choosing what to include, my point is that the article isn't <i>inherently</i> POV. It's possible to write it in an NPOV manner, and simply providing an example of how some particular version of it is POV doesn't change that. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:13, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I have edited this list for a long time and participated in some of the previous AfDs. My view is that the problem with this list and with many other lists in WP is the lack of consistency and the lack of a solid criterion or criteria for inclusion. Many lists in WP are sometimes used as subterfuges to bypass the Wikipedia content policies of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No original research</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral point of view</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is not</a>.

<li>And I would also add that having done a little work with the references to see how the current situation stands, I'm not tremendously impressed with them.

<li>May I point out that the criteria themselves have been changed over time? Frankly, I'd <i>like</i> to see the criteria change to something more rational. However, what has not been addressed is the degree to which the current criteria were forced on the article as a poor compromise after the previous AfDs -- a compromise forced, in large part, by the same people who are now complaining that the poor criteria of the article are a reason to delete it on <i>this</i> AfD. (Frankly, I'm puzzled. Why does Pjacobi refer, above, to "The previous nominations, I've found so far"? Out of the six he lists, two of them are provably about <i>completely different articles</i> which happened to be of a similar nature. Of the remaining four, two shouldn't have been hard to "find", since in both cases, <b>Pjacobi initiated them</b>.

<li>A limited point of view is still a point of view. I dunno...the title has the word "referred" to in it, so it sort of has that disclaimer. But the word cult is quite negative.

Since not many people have category pages on their watchlists and because category-for-deletion tags don't show up on anything the average reader sees, it's highly questionable to think that the few people who voted represented everyone who would have been concerned -- or even a reasonable sub-sample. By the way, isn't it ironic that the person attempting to get this list article deleted (who is also the one who initiated such attempts twice before that) was <i>also</i> the one who put that category up for deletion?

<li><b>Delete</b>. If this article is not deleted then it is setting the precedent that ANYONE has the right to a wikipedia article, all they have to do is SELF-PUBLISH a book, run their OWN website, and be mercilessly insulted throughout the Australian blogsphere (as long as they write the article themselves, of course!). Need I remind you that "Samuel Gordon Stewart" and "Lee Hotti" both failed to make the grade as far as notability was concerned. And "Lee Hotti" had supporters other than himself. Let's face facts. The only person who has ever made a positive comment about Nigel Gohl is Nigel Gohl. Through his website, through his book and through his entirely self-written wikipedia article. Can I re-iterate, if this article is kept on the grounds of notability, it means that every person in the world capable of self-publishing their own book, maintaining their own website and writing their own wikipedia article is entitled to one. <a href="../../../i/_/e/User%7EI_elliot_e792.html" title="User:I elliot">I elliot</a> 12:22, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Maybe stub it and start a pron category? its actually a very notable site, blushes, and is part of a network of sites that include 8thStreetLatinas, MILFHunter, etc. Would this better be merged into an article about the parent network? Oddly the alexa rating of the parent network probably wouldnt be that high to meet WP:CORP, but the combined Alexa ratings of all subsites would probably far exceed that. The parent company is listed as NastyDollars but i believe that is just the host and the real parent company is RK Netmedia. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup>|sockpuppets|</sup></font></i></a> 15:20, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree completely. Concepts of different kinds of porn sites are worthy of inclusion, but individual porn sites should be kept out of Wikipedia at any cost. The only way for an individual porn site to be notable is to be involved in a major scandal - the kind of thing that is mentioned in pretty much every newspaper for that day. Otherwise we'll have our hands full AfD'ing thousands of non-notable porn sites. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 16:11, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hello, this is Adam Lofitis. I apologize for the lack of reliable sources on the 4 of my UWF articles, the UWF website was supposed to be up but we are having difficulties with it. It is alright if all articles can be deleted except for Adam Lord and United Wrestling Federation (Australia), as they are quite important for the future. And as far as i know, the Wikipedia articles get quite a few hits even though they do not on google as this is an INDIPENDANT promotion in which we frequently tour the country. So please bare with me as the Adam Lord and United Wrestling Federation (Australia) are the only realiable sources we have for our fans to look up in interest. Reliable sources will be posted as soon as it is running. Thankyou. P.S. FOR ONE RELIABLE SOURCE, GO TO WWW.CPWACT.COM, CLICK ON "LOCKER ROOM", THEN CLICK ON "HIGH OCTANE", THEN READ HIS PROFILE, THERE WILL BE EVIDENCE OF THINGS MENTIONED ON THE ARTICLE. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 60.225.203.187 (<a href="../../../6/0/2E/User_talk%7E60.225.203.187.html" title="User talk:60.225.203.187">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_60.225.203.187_cde9.html" title="Special:Contributions/60.225.203.187">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>An article on a term coined by Leon James, added by User:Leonj (whose edit history consists mainly of adding links to his own sites).

There is a dictdef in here, but it's already at Wiktionary according to the links section. There are around 640 ghits for this term, of which most are (a) WP / Wiktionary and mirrors; (b) blogs / personal pages; (c) James' own sites. I see little evidence that this is a widespread term outside of the creator and his immediate circle, but it might just be such a specialist field that only a few experts would use it anyway. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:25, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

There are now additional references and more will be added. The reason there are so many references to Leon Jakobovits is because he was th eonly one for 30 years to publish a series of studies on this phenomenon. Subsequently, other people added new research. There are dozens of such articles still to be added. There is even a new area of application in commnications and advertising.

<dd>What you have provided is not any information about the sermon itself, but about its authenticity. I am not doubting that the sermon was delivered, I don't have the expertise to know whether it was or not. What I am saying is that, stripped of its vast and myriad references, this article is nothing but a definition, and by its nature, can only ever remain so. This violates Wikipedia policy, and hence should be deleted. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> 12:58, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Mr Striver, I appreciate your attempts to save this article, but what you have added ("the authenticity contravers") does not add anything to the content. It is paragraph after paragraph of other people saying the sermon was real. There is no information about the sermon itself, because there cannot be, because it cannot be anything more than a dicdef. THIS is why I have nominated it, not because I think it didn't happen (because again, I don't have the authority to know). <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> 13:21, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Bro, give me time, im working on it. And by the way, even if there was nothing more to say about it, the controversy in itself would make it notable.

<dd>The Lord's prayer is not a sermon. It is a prayer. It is a fundamental part of the liturgy of the various Christian churches. A sermon is a talk on a religious topic. The article does not say that it is a shia prayer, it says that it is a sermon, one delivered by Ali. It does not say anything more than this, and the information you have newly added is a series of quotes by Islamic scholars saying the sermon is authentic. This doesn't matter! The only reason for this sermon to be mentioned is as a small note in Ali's entry, in helping to describe his struggle to succeed Muhammed. Therefore this article does not need to exist.<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> 13:42, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It does have this appearance right now because it is being looked at by several people who would like to add content on this topic but haven't yet. Also, as the article grows, more history will be added as it ties to dualism in science and to Swedenborg's stature in history. The topic deserves attention as it is related to spirituality, God, immortality, heaven, hell -- extremely popular topics for many readers on the Web. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages</a> comment was added by Leonj (<a href="../../../l/e/o/User_talk%7ELeonj_a337.html" title="User talk:Leonj">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leonj_fdea.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leonj">contribs</a>) 05:08, June 7, 2006.</small></p>

As far as the concept, most of the links I find point to blogs, so I'm not sure there is a notability claim either. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7ECholmes75_6eb1.html" title="User:Cholmes75">cholmes75</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7ECholmes75_fc51.html" title="User talk:Cholmes75">chit chat</a>) 15:15, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Objection to deletion: This is an entry to define a new word. Is the fact that the word was invented by a business professional enough reason to block it? It does exist, doesn't it? More and more people are using it in their daily language. It does not advertise a product or a service. Can only not-professionals define &amp; invent new words? Joost van de Loo, 10 June 2006</li>

<li>It is because it is a new word that it is being deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> The style guide <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> discourages the use of neogolisms IN articles, but says that articles ABOUT neogolisms are ok - if they can be verified via secundary sources. This article describes a neogolism that is the subject of a book, HyperThinker, written by a professional, Philip Weiss, in his field of expertise. So the secundary source rule is applicable here.

<ul>
<li>We only do articles about neologisms that significant numbers of people use. If a word is invented by a business, and is used only by that business, for commercial purposes, it's an ad. Since you and Mr. Weiss are the people marketing this word, I can understand why you might have reason to disagree. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 03:31, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - This is a perfect example of a fan film and should stay as an entry to reference as one. Parody or imitation is standard practice in entertainment, and as such, fan films are in tribute to what is being imitated or parodied. If someone wears a sports jersey, sweatshirt, decorate their car or truck with flags or stickers of their favorite sports team and/or player is that any different than someone dressing up as Batman or a Empire Stormtrooper or a Starfleet officer at a fan convention? Why shouldn't a fan create something they enjoy not for profit, as many sports fan play baseball, basketball, hockey, flag football the same way?--D2K 19:54, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Keep</b>. Holy smokes peoples. Emotions have run a bit hot in this one, (could we not get quite so hot in future? Could we not use pejorative "cruft" terms in noms of articles that clearly have had a fair number of contributors? Could we not cast aspersions on the nominators and fellow commentators?) but on balance I think the keeps (which numerically far outnumber the deletes) have the stronger argument here. Some admin has to make the call on this, it's way overdue for a close. I think Keep carries the day here. Disagree? Heck I have one <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> going already, why not two?

<li>We've come to a peace, hopefully, and this is an old comment, so I'll just very calmly point out the reasoning behind my assumption was the phrase "what an amazing coincidence," which referred to my AfD deletions the same day, as well as the reference to civility, a charge I had been bringing up in our disagreement at the time. As for signing your post for you, it's common practice for others to sign unsigned comments and votes by using the {{<a href="../../../u/n/s/Template%7EUnsigned_e4f5.html" title="Template:Unsigned">unsigned</a>}} template so that we have a clear record of who said what ... and, no, I wasn't assuming you were trying to hide your identity, as that's intensely difficult to do here given Wikipedia's tracking of page histories. —&#160;<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 96%; font-weight: bold"><a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike">Mike</a></span>&#160;•&#160; 21:29, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I haven't voted in the other mass AfDs but I feel at least this overview of Star Trek fan films (or any fan films like the equally large - if not extremely larger - Star Wars fan films out there) should stay. Today's amateur film maker/actor is tomorrow's Steven Spielberg/Harrison Ford (or insert your own famous Hollywood types). PirateGent 17:28, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> My POV on this entry is probably no surprise to some here. From the begining, I wanted to contribute to this entry and was blocked. I want to be inclusionary, but others here have stopped that. This entry is greatly biased and gives an incorrect, wrong, and hugely misinformed impression on this fan film subject. It is clearly exclusionary and is selectively biased. This entry negates the huge amount of pre-Internet fan films that were available just because of a lack of Google hits. Many well known fan film producers know of this Wiki biase problem and just do not care to contribute here. Fan film listings are handled more fairly and even handledly on other Internet sites. This faux fan film Wiki entry has been very selectively written to keep some already produced fan films out of this entry by the selectively and unsophisticly enforcement of wikipedia policies to accomplish a censureship objective on this fan films subject. How can any unfinished fan film have an entry here? They do. While many finished fan films entries are treated to a gauntlet of a draconian enforcement of the Wiki rules heaped on them by other Wiki members here that keeps their information out of this fan film entry? This is the state of this fan film entry and this causes a biased fan film entry. When one unpopular fan film producer adds an entry about his film, he is told by other psuedo non-Wiki staff members here that his entry is dissallowed because his entry is not a 'neutral POV', all the while other 'favored' fan film producers are allowed to write their fan film entry with no such interferance or pre-requisites. This results in a biased misinformed entry. Tracing the affiliation of many of this Wikipedia fan film entry's contributors with the many competing fan film factions and fans(who have contributed here) would certainly enlighten prudent people as to the likelihood of their biase motivations they choose to exhibit here by their wholesale elimination some other competing fan films listings. It would also be informative to illustrate the biased motivations of many of the Wiki entry authors who repetative delete opposing other fan films information to be openly shared here. My contention is the entries authors have colaboratively published an misinformed 'elitist' fan films entry based on an antagonistic agenda to other fan films trying to be listed here. This group of authors or 'clique' keeps other fan films information out of this entry by unfair and improper means. Please check the LONG discussion page for who is doing unfairly what to whom here. It could be seen that this much flawed fan film entry is monopolized by a few fan film maker factions very much like a prejusticed Good Olde Boy Club of very questionable parental ancestory.

<li>OMG YES! Whilst we have attention on this article, could someone please look at the manner in which it has been conducted and give this man a fair and unbiassed opinion on whether he has been unfairly done by! Perhaps we can get some closure on his interminable allegations this way. God alone knows I've made every attempt to engage in dialogue but he deletes what he doesn't like, ignores the questions and suggestions that might solve his problem and rants on about the same thing again and again.

<li>Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the essay above an admission that the sole motivation for deletion is that his contributions have been rejected? From long experience with this person, I doubt that even having a properly constituted authority look over his work and rendering a judgement will work. He has a habit on the IMDB, TrekBBS, and IntrepidBBS of claiming that those authorities who find against him are also biased, or have somehow been "subverted" by the "other side". He made similar accusations against the Variety writer of a positive article on Hidden Frontier. But by all means, let's get his contributions looked at by someone who isn't involved. Whether he's been treated unfairly or not, he deserves his day in court.JohnWhiting 00:37, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> You are wrong, John Whiting non-neutral point of view and self promotional motivations of Hidden Frontier fan film commenting here. Trouble with your reading&#160;? YOu are wrong, just like the many times that you try to put words in my mouth in other public places. The entry is clearly biased because it only includes certain elite cliquish video projects over others have similar or more worth. Even unfinished videos are listed here over finshed ones. Consistant requirements, I don't think so. The listing requirements are slanted and change according to the most recent Wiki member's whim and based on the unethical collaborative efforts to censure this entry against other valid fan film producers and me. Netwriter 00:49, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>Just what exactly does all that have to do with the discussion of the article's deletion? Are you saying that because you can't get your film listed the article must be deleted? The whole subject of Trek fan films must be exsponged from the field of human knowledge because this article does not recognise your film? The subject in question here is whether Trek fan films <i><b>as a subject</b></i> should be included as an article on Wikipedia. NOT the quality of the writing OR the content OR any other problems. I am supporting the call for some sort of closure on your interminable and repetative rants. It is a waste of time and effort - time and effort that could be put to better use writing a article which is what we are supposed to be here for!--<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirok_5555.html" title="User:Kirok">Kirok of L'Stok</a> 14:18, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Here's my arguement: Just because something isn't 'noteworthy' in someone else's opinion, doesn't make it so for everyone else. There are people who go to the Wikipedia to find general information about fan films, or more to the point, about Star Trek/Star Wars/etc fan films specifically. If these links are just sites that just go to only paysites, then I would have to agree that pages like that have to be deleted. But fan films aren't generally made for profit, what little money is made goes to production costs. Plus, if someone wanted to see more fan films abou the subject, Wikipedia is a very reliable source to find links to other fan films. Art for Art's sake. That's what being a fan is all about. --D2K 15:46, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think you hit it right on the head D2K. I know I've asked my parents about "noteworthy" events in history that they lived through and they didn't consider the events noteworthy. (quote by my mom "Cuban Missile Crisis? Didn't pay attention to it. I was just worried if I had a date on Saturday night.") as they say "one man's trash is another man's treasure" and I think that sums up all these fan films. PirateGent 19:46, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I'm an anime editor. I usually like to keep (or merge) stuff. This, however is totally non-notable. Show a source? (not ANN sites, blog, forum, or primary.) I don't think it passes the google test. When torrent, blog, wikipedia, and forum were removed from the search it only gets around 1,000 hits. Most of those are fansites, forums, or blogs with one or two showings at a local anime club or con. If keep, it should be merged into <a href="../../../o/t/a/Otaku.html" title="Otaku">Otaku</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_convention.html" title="Anime convention">Anime convention</a> --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 03:11, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I just caught a screening of S.T.E.A.M. at <a href="http://www.a-kon.com" class="external text" title="http://www.a-kon.com" rel="nofollow">A-kon 17</a> in Dallas, TX (June 9-11 2006) and went looking for it online. This article helped me immensely in my search, I may not have found out what I had been watching otherwise. I've actually heard about Otakudom many times before but did not realize what this sequel was. I just updated the article as best I could (still trying to track down the correct running times). These guys have made two very long (nearly an hour), very high quality videos now, with all original voice acting. The movies rank up there with <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troops.html" title="Troops">Troops</a> and other high quality fan works in my opinion. They are well-known enough to be included in conventions that have no relationship with the creators (A-kon), and many con-goers like me (200+ in the room I was in) are going to be searching for information about this. I've seen articles survive with much less merit. --<a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickning1_9f12.html" title="User:Wickning1">wickning1</a> 14:03, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>1. <i>Over 100 films</i> - shouldn't apply, as even major actors would fail this.</li>
<li>2. <i>Awards</i> - look <a href="http://www.panicstruckpro.com/revelations/letters.html" class="external text" title="http://www.panicstruckpro.com/revelations/letters.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
<li>3. <i>Playmate of the Year</i> - obviously not relevant.</li>
<li>4. <i>Noteworthy contributions</i> - this is one people can argue all day, but I'll say they pass, for pulling off a remarkable looking film for very little money.</li>
<li>5. <i>Performer crossover</i> - refers to individuals, not a film, so not relevant to this entry.</li>
<li>6. <i>Noteworthy News piece</i> - here's where you get slammed - The film has had news coverage from CNN, CBS, BBC, MSNBC, G4, CBC, the <i>Hollywood Reporter, USA Today, LA Times, San Francisco Chronicle, Slate, Access Hollywood, New Zealand Herald, Baltimore Sun</i>, and wire stories from KnightRidder, among others.</li>
<li>7. applies to individual performers - again, not relevant.</li>

<dd>I agree. I've removed the "speedy" from my "keep" since it certainly doesn't apply anymore, but since this was nom'd w/o discussion and is more than a year old, with many different editors having contributed to it, I think it deserves a chance to be cut down (by <b>a lot</b>) rather than being completely erased out of hand. Real-life content <i>is</i> possible; I assume the actors (if there were any real actors in the prequels) performing the stunts did have to learn all that stuff. If the fan fiction stuff can be reduced to a minimum and replaced with reality, it could have a place here. The rest can move to Wookieepedia. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 19:39, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's debatable. If he has written something notable in English, then he could be notable enough for the English Wikipedia.

<dd>Ok, I see your points. But I don't think that we should delete this article because he's a German author, but rather that he (might be) a non-notable author (of any particular language). I've created articles on notable Russian and Chinese people who don't have articles on ru.wp or zh.wp (respentively); I don't think that can be used as an argument for non-notability. The de.amazon link is fairly persuasive to me, though I agree that is debateable.

<li><b>Keep</b> Why do you want to delete 1992, but not 1993 or 1991? As said above, there are articles for every year, or virtually so.

<p><b>Keep</b>. Gardner has been quite well-known throughout southeastern Pennsylvania, Delaware and southern New Jersey for decades.

<dd>I would have to agree with The Matt Feldman Experience that Kirjtc2 is making a dubious comparison. It looks as if <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Beutel_b550.html" title="Bill Beutel">Bill Beutel</a> has had considerable national and international reporting duties as well as hosting ABC's morning show whilst Jim Gardner seems to be a minor local reporter and newsreader. I would venture a guess that more people know of Beutel than Gardner and those who know Beutel would not just be in a highly localized area. And by the way, Philadelphia will never be on the same par as New York, it is another dubious comparison.

Then I remembered the Wikipedia as a way to get revenge on him by taking things from his website and putting them on to look like he did it but I Scott Brown did do it to make a mockery of him. I am not going to kill myself because I want to relive the time that WCAU was CBS, boy those were the days! I am not crazy and going to kill myself and do not need help. I don't like Jim Gardner and his story should be deleted. I now have a sattilte dish and can't watch Philladelphia, but get WCBS and WNYW and WCBS has The People's Court which is the best show on the televison today. Not as good as when WCAU was CBS, but good still. I hope that my destroying of the good name of the person was mean enough to get them in trouble with all of you and didn't mean any problems with the Wikipedia with making revenge on people who do not give me the tapes that they promised.

<dl>
<dd>I got into his account because he is one who has a password which is password and I know that is stupid and you can try it too by using login as FunkyChicken and password as password! Stupid moron has made his password password and does not expect people to try to fake being him? That is just being a stupid moron. And I was making it look like I was not alone in my love for WCAU and the People's COurt. He said he was going to leave and I make the account an active one, but this time for Scott Brown and will make all sorts of delting votes for things I do not like, like WPVI which was not as good as WCAU when it was CBS and I can't get either on my sattilite and that is a shame. I, Scott Brown and am sorry and will not kill myself and try to be a better user from now on and not lie or use other users who are stupid enough to use password as their password then quit the great wikipedia and will not use wikipedia as a revenge on people who do not give me my WCAU tapes that they say they were going to give me but do not give. THat is mean and they need to be given ppunishment of being blacklisted on the wikipedia and accused of bad things. I am sorry for not properly making wikipedia editing but I have been feeling bad ever since my mother left and I miss those good days since then WCAU was CBS and I did not have to watch WCBS as CBS on my sattilite. No I am not going to kill myself as the tvnewstalk.net people have made fun of me for and now the radio-info.com people are making fun of me too. This is wrong and I am sorry but they can't be mean to Scott Brown and mock my love for WCAU as CBS. I am sorry if I hurt anyone and if you could fix or delete any wrong things or passwords I would be happy and will not bother you again and maybe later I can make better editings to the wikipeida, but please delete the Jim Gardner article as he was never on WCAU when it was CBS. Thank you and I hope to be a better person when it comes to making wikipedia changes. Please accept my appology.

<li><b>Comment</b> What edit war? What attacks? How does it involve this article or WWAC-TV? It's the first time I've heard of it or seen it. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_WWAC-TV_7dea.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WWAC-TV">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WWAC-TV</a> afd discussion ended several days ago with a full confession and retraction from the hoaxers (including Ngsantia and WWACArtist and maybe UncleFloyd). Anyway, I don't think Dave Roberts was ever mentioned in that discussion. I'm neutral on whether to keep or delete this article. Roberts does seem to be a real reporter though. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 19:53, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b>. Roberts has been quite well-known throughout southeastern Pennsylvania, Delaware and southern New Jersey for decades. I cleaned up and corrected the information presented by the aforementioned troublesome editors, as well as expanded the biography with the external links. The information now in the article is greater than the summarized stub descriptions at WPVI-TV Personalities. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOlessi_e981.html" title="User:Olessi">Olessi</a> 18:54, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Circular logic. An article about a game publisher should be deleted because Google returns 100+ gaming-related links? This seems to me to be evidence that the company is reasonably well-known in its field. Granted, it's not GM or American Express, but criteria for deletion should be more than one or two people unfamiliar with the topic not having heard of the company before.Fireflygames 21:44, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The history log shows I deleted my sarcastic comment within seconds of posting it, but I see you went to the trouble of restoring it to score more points off me. I do still find it bizarre that the primary objection to the article is that I didn't post it under a pseudonym. Regardless of who posted it, it's a factual article free of boastful or unverifiable claims. If you'd like to do further research &amp; make non-vandalizing revisions or expansions as a third party, please do so - isn't that the point of Wikipedia?Fireflygames 21:44, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It was no trouble to put your comment back in. In the future, I would suggest you take those few seconds it took you to re-read and decide to delete it, and spend a little extra time thinking twice <i>before</i> you post it. There's no hiding on Wikipedia, and certainly not AfD.</dd>
<dd>As for the rest: the primary objection to the article is that it is not a notable company, not that you weren't sneaky enough about adding it. It would still have a delete tag on it if your user name was Kafziel. And, no, the point of Wikipedia is <i>not</i> to make other editors scramble around to try to make something worthwhile out of vanity and advertising. It's simply not allowed, and nothing anyone here can write will make it a more famous or significant company.</dd>
<dd>I know it's hard not to take a deletion of one of your articles personally, especially when it has to do with you, but I hope it won't discourage you from contributing in more constructive ways elsewhere on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 23:10, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

We can't know if it will become popular in the future (and guessing violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>), but it doesn't seem to be yet.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think we can live with it at least the 10 days until it happens and then decide. The fact they actually received non-profit status is a lot more than other new anime cons can say. The article needs to be fleshed out <i>A LOT</i> more though. I wouldn't call this an "advertisement" any more than most other anime con pages.

Our sincere apologies for not undertstanding the guidelines concerning self-submiting (we had recived bad advice to do so, not knowing the rules). Nevertheless, we hope that someone and/or a Wikipedia editor may deem the magazine worthy of an article since the magazine is widely read and discusses many subjects (authors) covered by Wikipedia. Thus, we hope someone will either re-write this entry and/or enter a new one in keeping with Wikipedia's guidelines. Thank you.</li>

<p>This article follows the same format as over two dozen other articles for UML tools referenced from page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UML_tools" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UML_tools" rel="nofollow">List of UML Tools</a>. Many of those tools are shareware tools with a shorter lifespan and smaller user base. By comparison, WinA&amp;D has been around for 10 years with thousands of users in 40 countries at companies like GM, Lockheed Martin, IBM, etc.</p>
<p>Are you proposing that all UML tool articles be deleted?</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, a lot of these articles get left alone because nobody notices them. Activity like yours, suddenly showing up and creating multiple articles obviously to advertise your products, draws notice. Thanks for the advice, though. I think these other products need a good look. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 00:35, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><a href="../../../s/o/f/User%7ESoftwareDeveloper_7a90.html" title="User:SoftwareDeveloper">SoftwareDeveloper</a> 01:05, 7 June 2006 (UTC) Although I'm new to Wikipedia authoring, I did spend many hours first reviewing other such articles to ensure my postings were consistent with others and as non promotional as possible. If your goal is to remove all product/tool references then there are many such articles and plenty of lists that references those pages. Don't you think that removing this information will reduce the value of Wikipedia? For example, of what value is the Unified Modeling Notation (UML) without a tool that supports it?</p>
<ul>
<li>There's a difference between documenting and advertising. In many cases it takes a lot of work to ensure that all articles are encyclopedic, not promotional. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 02:45, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. We have an article <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unified_Modeling_Language_b552.html" title="Unified Modeling Language">Unified Modeling Language</a>. People kept adding tools there. So we started the separate <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_UML_tools_faa6.html" title="List of UML tools">List of UML tools</a> with a definition what an UML tool is at <a href="../../../u/m/l/UML_tool_6bc1.html" title="UML tool">UML tool</a>. From time to time, someone drops in there and screams "adspam!" and starts a deletion campaign. I know that Wikipedia is not meant for advertising, but the question yet to be answered is: why do you want to censor these lists? Do you really want to have only tools from the two or threee biggest companies on that list? Or do you want to have no tool listed nowhere on Wikipedia? Then please put <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unified_Modeling_Language_b552.html" title="Unified Modeling Language">Unified Modeling Language</a> on your watchlist and clean that once a week at least. See: If we are talking about things like UML, doesn't it make sense to also have some tools listed? After all UML is meant to be used for software development and the industry is using tools to support UML. Wikipedia is not censorship. Please note: I do not have a special interest in WinA&amp;D (far from that). But please note that WinA&amp;D is a well known UML tool which has been around for years now. Claiming that this tool is not noteworthy in the UML area is simply not correct. Please consider stopping this deletion campaign of UML tools. This campaign may be noble but it isn't thought thoroughly to its end. And please don't think there isn't anybody watching lists like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_UML_tools_faa6.html" title="List of UML tools">List of UML tools</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, it is *not* a Wiki about UML tools.

<dd>Well. How do you define major UML tools? And do you put <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unified_Modeling_Language_b552.html" title="Unified Modeling Language">Unified Modeling Language</a> on your watchlist and delete every addition of an UML tool there then?

<dd>What makes something "major" is of course subjective and will depends of the area of knowledge covered. As far as software is concerned, I'm usually quite partial to the Google test. In my book, hits in the hundreds of thousands or better yet in the millions make a software application major, whereas a search on a product that fails to reach the 1000 results limit of Google makes that product very minor. <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rational_Rose_7d55.html" title="Rational Rose">Rational Rose</a> scores 1,680,000 hits on google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22rational+rose%22&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;num=100&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22rational+rose%22&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;num=100&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" rel="nofollow">[116]</a>, WinA&amp;D a mere 955 hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hs=FzK&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22WinA%26D%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hs=FzK&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22WinA%26D%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[117]</a> (~300 different hits). Ultimately, I try to set a scale based on the amount of results returned by products in a given category of software, I would raise the bar if we were talking about main stream products such as a word processor or a video game (97,000,000 hits for "microsoft word", 60,000,000 for "world of warcraft") or lower it for more obscure fields.

<dd>I'm not "imposing" anything on anyone, AfD pages are used to reach a concensus. You will find that the community at large is not in favour of including unnotable subjects in Wikipedia (there are exceptions such as schools or geographical locations), and that in the absence of hard rules, one has to use common sense and good judgement. You are of course free to disagree, maybe point out why my arguments/criteria have no weight, which may convince others and possibly make me change my mind. I'm still eager to know why you think I should be watching the UML page by the way. <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquendil_375b.html" title="User:Equendil">Equendil</a> <small><a href="../../../e/q/u/User_talk%7EEquendil_2b4e.html" title="User talk:Equendil"><i>Talk</i></a></small> 17:45, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not that this post here would matter anything—as you obviously do not care about the field these articles are about and you've made your decision anyway. But you might want to "impose" your "common sense" <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_software_5eec.html" title="Category:Lists of software">here</a> too. I'm sure you will find some other "non-notable" software there too. At least, this would make your actions here look a little less random. Contributing to wikipedia by random voting for mass deletes of articles created by newbies hours after their creation isn't exactly so interesting. But if it makes you feel happy: well then! Happy deleting! --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 19:14, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I'm a software engineer, so I might just have a little interest in that field. As for other non notable entries, feel free to point out individual entries, I might just propose them for deletion indeed. My actions are not "random", I'm patrolling new pages, fixing those entries that can be salvaged, helping their author improve the content where possible, or at least making sure they are listed for cleanup for later edits by other wikipedians, also participating in the various deletion procedures for entries that I or others think are not suitable (which also sometimes involves arguing in favour of said entries). <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquendil_375b.html" title="User:Equendil">Equendil</a> <small><a href="../../../e/q/u/User_talk%7EEquendil_2b4e.html" title="User talk:Equendil"><i>Talk</i></a></small> 20:08, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm a software engineer too (since 14 years). What bothers me is that you vote here but you do not care about articles like <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unified_Modeling_Language_b552.html" title="Unified Modeling Language">Unified Modeling Language</a>. You didn't respond to the problem I pointed out above here (editors constantly adding tools to articles like <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unified_Modeling_Language_b552.html" title="Unified Modeling Language">Unified Modeling Language</a>). How do you "explain" your "non-notable" criteria to them? We have a lot of anons adding these tools every day. You can remove things like <a href="../../../m/o/n/MonoUML_b2ea.html" title="MonoUML">MonoUML</a> from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_UML_tools_faa6.html" title="List of UML tools">List of UML tools</a>. It will be readded by an anon in less than 4 weeks. You can also delete <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_UML_tools_faa6.html" title="List of UML tools">List of UML tools</a>: anons-will then add tools to <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unified_Modeling_Language_b552.html" title="Unified Modeling Language">Unified Modeling Language</a> (do you prefer that? Are you going to revert-war with them over that? This is a wiki!). I don't think I need to point you to articles, do I? You sure know how to navigate through a hierarchy of categories, do you? We have all sorts of "collections" on this wiki — some random deletes of knee-jerk "non-notables" won't solve that problem. And don't you think it is a problem to explain to newbies why there are articles like <a href="../../../m/o/n/MonoUML_b2ea.html" title="MonoUML">MonoUML</a> and articles like WinA&amp;D are nominated for AfD within hours? Doesn't look that a bit arbitrary (even) to you? This deletion campaign is a random shot like all the previous ones I've seen on the lists of softwares. Don't try to make you looking important here by wrongfully citing <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. Your random shot delete votes are pointless.

<dd>Ok, let's stop this, the UML article is not the center of Wikipedia, there are *hundred* of articles deleted every day, I'm sorry that's still not enough and some articles make it through, can't be everywhere. You think it's pointless&#160;? Without deletion, wikipedia would be a collection of unknown high school rock "bands", bio stubs of random people, ads for web sites and various products, hoaxes and crackpot theories, copyrighted material copy/pasted from websites, manuals, HOW-TOs, etc ad nauseum, sitting there polluting the database, making categories unusable, wasting the time of other wikipedians who work on cleanup tasks, and turning Wikipedia into a generic free hosting wiki as opposed to an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquendil_375b.html" title="User:Equendil">Equendil</a> <small><a href="../../../e/q/u/User_talk%7EEquendil_2b4e.html" title="User talk:Equendil"><i>Talk</i></a></small> 06:25, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Aha. Now we are getting to the point: You are comparing WinA&amp;D with "unknown high school rock "bands"". "the UML article is not the center of Wikipedia"—indeed (So why do you want to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">make a point</a> here?). But it's the center of this delete debate, which you persistently refute to acknowledge. As I said: you are on a random campaign here. And you can't concede the errors in your reasoning. This is humand (persisting to what one has said, being unable to accept own errors), but not actually what's needed to be a good editor for wikipedia. --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 07:39, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As a matter of fact, The <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unified_Modeling_Language_b552.html" title="Unified Modeling Language">UML</a> article is not the center of this debate either, the WinA&amp;D one is. I've already explained why I'm participating in this procedure, I didn't end here for random reasons. That you seemingly refuse to acknowledge this on the ground that I'm not involved in the UML article is another story. <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquendil_375b.html" title="User:Equendil">Equendil</a> <small><a href="../../../e/q/u/User_talk%7EEquendil_2b4e.html" title="User talk:Equendil"><i>Talk</i></a></small> 08:00, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're action here is random because you actually do not even care about things like <a href="../../../m/o/n/MonoUML_b2ea.html" title="MonoUML">MonoUML</a>. You are on a "patrol" here. This is ok for vandalism. But the creation of WinA&amp;D is not vandalism. Your "patrolling" would be fine if you would have a consistent strategy. But you don't. Excusing yourself with "I can't be verywhere" is a bit ridiculous. It rather shows that you've exhausted your arguments. You could at least comment about what to do with <a href="../../../m/o/n/MonoUML_b2ea.html" title="MonoUML">MonoUML</a>. Do you want to delete that too? Your refusal to comment on a broader view is exactly the problem here. This would actually reveal the errors in your resoning. Well, nothing but a random shot. And WinA&amp;D is your random victim. This makes it look like you possibly do have an interest in the removal of said product/company from wikipedia. Wikipedia is not censorship and you have to treat all these products the same. That's the point. --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 08:18, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../s/o/f/User%7ESoftwareDeveloper_7a90.html" title="User:SoftwareDeveloper">SoftwareDeveloper</a> 20:28, 9 June 2006 (UTC) I looked at each of the articles (RbApp, WinA&amp;D, MacA&amp;D OSX, MacTranslator OSX, QuickUML, QuickHelp, QuickCRC) that I've posted on Wikipedia using a format similar to dozens of existing articles and discovered some interesting facts. Every article was suggested for deletion, by the same 4 user names, in the same order, with the same comments, in approximately the same time period. Does something smell fishy to you?</p>
<ul>
<li>All were suggested for deletion by me, not four users. I used the same comment because I had the same reason for all the articles. I have later been told I should have grouped them together into one nomination, which is how it should be for mass-AfDs. I apologise for the hassle of all the nominations. <a href="../../../h/a/a/User%7EHaakon_f760.html" title="User:Haakon">Haakon</a> 20:35, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No problem with nominating them separately. My question: could we find a compromise and keep WinA&amp;D, de-POV and de-advertise that in wording as much as possible (as needed) and merge the others into WinA&amp;D? (I've already added merge suggest tags to the other articles). --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 21:33, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment:</b> one may well claim that any part of <i>Lost</i> one is unfamiliar with is "non-notable". However, with plenty of verifiable news sources, that appears to be a particularly difficult argument to make.

<li>Some content? There is one line: <i>This led to the birth of the 'live streaming webcam', which is still available in various forms today</i>. That is an incredibly poor coverage of the phenomenon. I would rather see a short intro added to this list (adding one or two lines would immediately make it the most comprehensive coverage of the phenomenon at wikipedia). --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:14, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is very little to no verifiable information on this article. There is no proof that the Wii will use its controller to make the game "feel more like you're playing football." Saying that many claim that this game will be the best version is not something that can be proved yet and is a completely invalid argument.

<dd>So your view on this situation is that if a website has few members, than it is advertising, but if it is a well known site, then it's not advertising? That is extremely unfair, and if you look at the statistics you will clearly see that in less than a month we've had nearly 15,000 visitors. <a href="http://www.moture.co.uk/moture/modules.php?name=Statistics" class="external free" title="http://www.moture.co.uk/moture/modules.php?name=Statistics" rel="nofollow">http://www.moture.co.uk/moture/modules.php?name=Statistics</a> Remember, don't just base moture's notability on the amount of members, the forum is just an add on to moture, an optional registration option is available, but the majority of moture can be accessed and used without registration, you can even comment on news. etc without an email address, only 0.24% of visitors to moture actually register.</dd>

<dd>It's not the well known bit that means it's not advertising. For the most part, Wikipedia doesn't allow any sort of pages regarding websites that have not had a signifigant effect on the culture of the internet. This would allow sites such as Newgrounds, 4chan to be on here, but forbid something like <a href="http://www.pso-world.com|PSOW" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pso-world.com|PSOW" rel="nofollow">[123]</a> among others, because they are "Followers" in the trend game. However, small(er) websites that are not as "Notable" regarding the internet, even if their fanbase is enormous, are not permitted. There has been gigantic fights regarding HaloGen (game mod), even though it is rated in the top 5 of all Command and Conquer Generals mods, because it is not a causitive effect of any "notable" phenomenon. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogical2u_96f0.html" title="User:Logical2u">Logical2u</a> 23:09, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Pokemon defence is stating that a given subject to be deleted to more notable than one of the millions of pokemon. The pokemon offence is something random I made up. It was meant to be an injoke. I don't have the time (and I'm assuming others don't either) to completely rewrite the article while researching your site.

<li><b>Comment</b> Moture hasn't been mentioned in any other major articles, but I know many people will want to read this, for example many parents will have heard in the news that illegal music downloading is on the rise, and now all they have to do is point their children to moture, where they can get free legal music from unsigned artists. Another example is the musician community, who can upload and receive comments on their work, as well as creating a small page within moture with photos etc. of thier band. This site may not have a significant effect on the culture of the internet YET, but it may well do in the future, I'm sure very few sites have a significant effect on the culture of the internet, and yet you have hundreds of sites listed. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt.Hoy_37b1.html" title="User:Matt.Hoy">Matt</a> 23:20, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party (United States)</a>. OK, this was a tough one. There is a lot to read here and consensus is not clear cut. A careful review of the material in the article itself suggests that there might be SOME value in some of it. By leaving it as a redirect, that material is accessible to people that want to move it to the target article. I have half an expectation that this will go to DRV, which is fine, I may be reading the sense wrong, but that's what it feels like to me.

<li><b>Keep and edit for POV</b> While I understand the concerns about including pejorative terms, I don't think they're necessarily valid, if the article does not display an overt bias.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Because this is documented, verifiable, and includes references to scholarly material, I think it is hard to argue that this article is, in itself, POV, though some of the material included in it should be reviewed to ensure NPOV stance (it is difficult to maintain such a stance in an inherently POV discussion, but we're not going to remove <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a>, even if it takes a negative POV toward the use of the word--edit, perhaps, but not remove).</dd>

<dd>I think part of the perceived problem with this article is that it's also very close in name to another article. This is only a problem of perception--if the concepts are distinct (which in this case they are), the articles should be distinct. Merging should not be a course of action, nor is it a good compromise, since the terms are definitely distinct. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 00:23, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It can be as documented, verifiable, referenced, and scholarly as it wants, but if it's on a subject that isn't noteworthy, it shouldn't be included in this project. The material is already covered quite adequately on the real article on the party. Before material is even considered on grounds of NPOV and Verifiability, it must first pass the test of notability. This does not. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 04:47, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Really? My <b>google check</b> for "Democrat party" and "pejorative" (which in itself is a very limiting term, with many possible synonyms) pulls up <b>999 links</b>. That's not a small number at all, especially (as I said) considering the limiting factor of a term like "pejorative". I'd like to know from what objective basis you derived your claim that this does not pass the notability test. "Democrat party" with "offensive" pulls up <b>187,000 links</b>. Note that a few of these links (especially the latter) also pull up sites that are <i>actively using</i> the term in a pejorative or negative light (saying, coincidentally, that the "democrat party" is doing something offensive, racist, whatever). That's as strong of proof as references to the term. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial_s&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22democrat+party%22+offensive&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial_s&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22democrat+party%22+offensive&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[127]</a><a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 05:20, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s>I am completely lost. What are you talking about?</s> If editors are vote stacking, that's bad. If they are informing a broad base of editors with varying POV, I don't see the conflict. I don't think 'votes for deletion' are the exclusive purview of folks who watch the page. The difference is intent - to slant the results or just to broaden the base of the vote. I don't claim to know the political views of the folks who were contacted, so I can't say it's 'stacking'... but we definitely agree that stacking is certainly bad and not in the interests of WP. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 01:13, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I was told "Our old friend Rjensen is up to his tricks again," or somesuch, presumedly because I had a drawn-out talk discussion on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_History_3d4e.html" title="American History">American History</a> with Rjensen at some point. I feel that's a very biased way to advertise an AfD, though I don't know for sure it is vote stacking since he did suggest I "weigh in" and not "vote to delete". I wonder if he did a talk page search for Rjensen and contacted everyone who's argued with him?

<li>Hehe. We just edit conflicted on this very phrase. I had the same response to the message on your talk page from Griot that (while clearly indicating his desire to delete) says he 'hope(s) you will weigh in on the topic'. That seems less than an outright attempt to instruct you on how to vote.

<li>The most important thing is whether this article has merits on its own. It is simply an attempt to create another "Democratic Party" article using the perjorative. I would not approve of a Republicrat Party article for the same reason. Neither term is more than dictionary definition that merits inclusion in the main article namely <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party (United States)</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party (United States)</a> - See my other reasons below.

<li><b>Merge &amp; Redirect</b>. Wikipedia is not a Dictionary. An article <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party (United States)</a> already exists on Wikipedia and treats the subject in the NPOV manner that it should be treated. Mention of that perjorative "Democrat Party" is okay in a criticism section of the Democratic Party article but does not warrant an article itself. The way the article reads now, it is as if it is about the Democratic Party in the United States and thus is a repeat of that topic. Since there is no Democrat Party and the term directly applies to the Democratic Party in the United States, it should be mentioned in that article and does not warrant an article of its own. Further, users of Wikipedia, especially children may be directed to the wrong article as a result of this article and not typing in the correct spelling.

<li>I know I am, and I think most others are. This is a badly written article, and a good plan for an article, with substantial information or potential sources of information to include. As for Fan1967: I think there's a good argument that it does mean <i>something</i>, specifically that the Democratic Party is not necessarily democratic. Additionally there is the uh, pun debate (if you can call it a pun)--googling the term brings up a lot of talk of the "DemocRAT Party", a further matter of possible discussion, though I'm not sure that there's as much established material on that specific aspect (there does seem to be on the original point). <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 05:38, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree that this article is badly written, but I think the topic lends itself to bad writing. It strains to have anything to say about this term, as it must, because there isn't really that much to say. The term is used by a handful of Republicans to complain about perceived faults in the Democratic Party. It's really a code word. It is very hard to write an objective article about a code word without using POV.

<p><b>Delete or substantially change and shorten</b> If kept, the article should be much shortened to eliminate redundant examples and should elaborate much more clearly the context of this variant name: (1) that it has a long history as an occasionally used name for the party, even by Democrats, (2) that its current usage is largely driven by Republican Party politicians, officials and partisans (aka "talk radio"), who have fastened on promoting this as their preferred name for their opponents, and (3) that almost universally in major reference sources and news media the name "Democratic Party" is standard usage, as it is by the party itself. A non-tendentious article along these lines may be possible, but the present article isn't it.

<dd>All or most of us agree that the current material is deficient. A vote for deletion is an indication that the article, as a concept, has no possible salvation.

<dd>Good point about concept vs. execution. I'll change my fence-sitting then to <b>Delete</b>, since the justification for a separate article seems weak. As simply a variant name, it can be dealt with briefly in the main article for the Democratic Party, with a redirect, as has been done for the variant name "GOP." <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickDC_c7c4.html" title="User:RickDC">RickDC</a> 21:26, 9 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm going to make a counterintuitive argument now--GOP, being a semi-official name for the party, is <i>more</i> significant and <i>more</i> related to the actual Republican Party article. Thus it makes sense that it's included. While I think this article is sufficiently significant to host on Wikipedia (despite my usual tendency towoard uh, deletionism), it is <i>not</i> closely related to the topic of the party itself due to its use only as a pejorative euphamism. It is historically and politically significant as a reference, but not because it is a major issue relating to the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party (United States)</a>. It is a concept in its own right, one that references the party but which should not be included in an overview article of the party's history, platform, etc. As such, while I do not think it should be deleted, I think it is far better that it be deleted than merged. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 02:27, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From WP:NOTABILITY: <i>A topic has notability if it is known outside a narrow interest group or constituency, or should be because of its particular importance or impact.</i> The pointed use of, and controversy over, the term "Democrat Party" is not known outside a narrow interest group (devoted political partisans of either side), and has no particular importance or impact. It is about as notable as the term "jigaboo", which you will find redirects, quite appropriately, to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html" title="List of ethnic slurs">List of ethnic slurs</a>. Wikipedia has no need to have a separate article for every nasty term and slur someone has ever thought to call someone else. Likewise, there is no need to detail every attack against the Democratic Party which has ever been made with its own article. They have no relevance <i>beyond</i> a discussion of the Democratic Party itself (or possibly within a discussion of the Republican Party's actions regarding their opponents), and therefore the information should be found under the article on the Democratic Party. If it is appropriate to create an article for "Democrat Party", then it is also appropriate to create articles for "spendocrat" and "tax-and-spend liberal" and other pejoratives for Democratic Party members. Since such articles clearly would not be appropriate, we can by analogy safely presume that "Democrat Party" is not either.
<dl>
<dd>Wait. Okay, this means that were the human population to suddenly become stupider and more ill-informed, <i>everything on Wikipedia would lose its notability!</i> Okay, that's a joke--I'm not saying anyone that hasn't heard the term is an idiot, because that is pretty silly. But there is a whole lot of stuff on WP that you (and I) don't know yet. Might not have even heard of it. That doesn't make it worthless... in fact that's what makes it useful to begin with. I think the notability tests prove that this <i>is</i> significant, in that 1,850,000 sites on the Internet were created by people who knew the term, as well as 999 people who specifically stated that it is "pejorative". That far surpasses the notability of a great deal of the material on Wikipedia. I find it damn near impossible to claim this is not notable, as a result. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 02:52, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I've said before, I have nothing against the information or its sourcing, or its being included in Wikipedia. My vote for deletion is a matter of categorization of information, nothing more.

<dd>P.S. you <i>have</i> changed my mind in one way - this article is now so informative and well-sourced that I no longer feel it should be deleted outright without merging.

<dd>"Jigaboo" very well possibly shouldn't reirect to the list.

<dd>I don't understand. On <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html" title="List of ethnic slurs">List of ethnic slurs</a>, I only see one endnote providing sourcing for "jigaboo". In any case, I have no particular interest or opinion on the term. I only grabbed it for use in analogy. If it doesn't fit my case, I'd be happy to retract my usage of it. I will attempt to pick my analogies with more care in the future, but I don't feel my argument is in any way disproved. There are many examples available of details which lack notability beyond a narrow interest group.

<dd>the White House website gives over 2000 hits for "Democrat" (mostly to Democrat as adjective); it usually saves "democratic" for foreign visitors. Note the adjective is NOT pejorative to all Democreats. Google shows 56,500 hits for "Democrat Club" --the great majority sponsored by Democrats. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 06:06, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As you should know the term "Democrat" is used to describe someone in the Democratic Party, which is the official name of that party and should be honored here at Wikipedia. Further as you should know, any hits for "Democrat" must include description of members. But, the term "Democrat Party" is not widely accepted and when used is used a perjorative by the Republican Party or more so right-wing Republican's on talk radio. The honest thing to do here is redirect to the Democratic Party page and be done with it. As far as "Democrat Clubs" that makes perfect sense because people in the Democratic Party are called Democrats; but the PARTY is called the DEMOCRATIC PARTY and has been OFFICIALLY since JACKSON. This article needs to be redirected to the PROPER PAGE. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 12:26, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The proper thing is that, when there's substantial evidence of a certain occurance such as this, that we have an article on it. A redirect will not do it justice, and, if you're concerned about an "honest" assessment of the Democratic party, a redirect will only serve to "accept" the pejorative as a normal, unintentional rephrasing. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:47, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is a very good point that I had not thought to investigate. Especially with Fleischer, it seems the White House used the term repeatedly. The point that should be noted is that it's not pejorative enough to draw attention to itself... it <i>sounds</i> like a mistake. But it's used every time. It seems clear (and research indicates) that the purpose is to produce dissociation between "democratic" and "Democratic" in the listener. E.g. "And I think, frankly, that that's a view -- Senator Miller, for example, was -- noted yesterday that he warned his own party, the Democrat Party, to stay away from that type of argument because he thought it would not work and it would hurt the Democrats."
