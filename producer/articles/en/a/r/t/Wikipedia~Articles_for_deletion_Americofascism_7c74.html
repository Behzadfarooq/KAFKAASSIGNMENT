<p>Here we go again with another brand of fascism! We already got a quite considerable collection of A/Z-fascisms.

<dd>I changed my vote according to the basis on what <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> was kept. Islamofascism was kept because of the arguement that the term is being used widely (<b>the same applies to <i>American fascism</i> but not to <i>Americofascism</i></b>). It was kept also because of the famous <font color="red">g</font><font color="purple">o</font><font color="blue">o</font><font color="green">g</font><font color="orange">l</font><font color="purple">e</font> hits (<b>the same applies to <i>American fascism</i> but not to <i>Americofascism</i></b>).</dd>

<dd>It sounds misleading to me. Even taking "shadows" into account, (and I'm not exactly sure what those are) Islamofascism gets <b>610</b> (not 601) Google hits, and 997 Yahoo hits. On Google "Islamic fascism" gets another 521, "Islamist fascism" another 296, and "Muslim fascism" another 129, for a total of 1556 (though there will no doubt be some overlap). All of these pages are referring to the same topic. On the other hand, "American fascism"'s <b>436</b> (not 445) hits refer to all sorts of things; movements in the 30s, modern day Republicans, Lyndon Larouche, even the Green Party! Anyway, if you want to write a history of Fascist movements in the U.S., feel free, but Americofascism is simply a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:45, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>LOL. Give me a chance. I have to dab American football in about a thousand articles first and then write Brisbane's suburbia.

<dd>Well, it shows that people have used the term, not that it actually means anything. A series of articles on Uses of the term "Islamofascism"/"Judeofascism"/"Christofascism"/"Littlegreenmanofascism" would be properly sourced to such uses, but articles about phenomena of those names? I have real doubts that the latter are justified just because the <i>names</i> exist. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 10:12, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If the term is used in a notable fashion it deserves a WP entry. It has yet to be shown that <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judeofascism.html" title="Judeofascism">Judeofascism</a> or Americofascism are at all notable outside the minds of people trying <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 20:38, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure what a "notable fashion" is. Are insults notable because of who uses them or why they used them? Maybe. But writing about the use of an insult is, as I said, different from writing about the insult itself. If I note that X calls Y a Zhead, does that merit an article on Zhead? I think the article is then actually about the use of Zhead as an insult, not Zhead itself.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:50, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I voted to re-direct <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> since I don't think the article can be keep strictly to the use of the term as an insult. But, Islamofacism is the article people are trying to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> about anyway. The general consensus is that its a bad point, by virtue of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> being a pejorative term that people are likely to encounter and look up, while the others are just madeupwords. In any event my indignation was aimed at the fact that the point was made properly in the VfD there when several people commented we were inviting people to create americanofascism or hindufascism or or or ..... Actually going and creating one of the articles to prove the point was counter productive but realtivly understandable. Creating a second article with even less merit than the first (and I mean this in terms of probability of encountering the term not the supposed phenomena) after the fist was delete.

<p>I just wonder how hypocrite some of wikipedians are! <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> is the only reason they got to delete this article. I haven't seen this reason in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> at all. Are you familiar with AMAZON.COM?! (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index%3Dstripbooks%3Arelevance-above%26field-keywords%3DIslamofascism%26store-name%3Dbooks/102-6518112-9862543" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index%3Dstripbooks%3Arelevance-above%26field-keywords%3DIslamofascism%26store-name%3Dbooks/102-6518112-9862543" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>)! Folks, there is no single book named after <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>; not even the term is used in any book in this world!
