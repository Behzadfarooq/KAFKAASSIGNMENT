<p>Request <b>deletion</b> as not notable. Kelly D. Williams is an artist who produces skateboard related art. The only references are in External links to his own web site and a blog interview emailed from <i>Kreativ Network</i> <a href="http://www.kreativnetwork.com/enter.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kreativnetwork.com/enter.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> a non-notable association of artists. A search of the commercial EBSCO news and magazine database did not turn up any hits for Kelly D. Williams. A NEXIS search for Kelly D. Williams in art news did not turn up any articles. Nor did I find any reliable sources in a brief Google search, mostly his advertising and takes from this Wikipedia article. This article has been up since April 2006 and notability has not been provided. As the “Official website for Kelly D. Williams” is quite commercial, as well as is the <i>Kreativ Network</i> site, it is not entirely clear where this should be judged for notability as a business or as an artist. As a business it fails <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. As an artist: There are no book or magazine biographies or even news stories about Kelly D. Williams. Some magazines are listed in the Wikipedia article under "Exhibition &amp; Media Summary", but, for example, <i>Transworld Business Magazine</i> was listed (until removed by an IP editor last week) and a search of their issues 2003 to date did not produce any articles. Similarly a search of the archives of Staf Magazine <a href="http://www.stafmagazine.com/staf30/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stafmagazine.com/staf30/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (a Spanish language zine) did not reveal any interview with Kelly D. Williams, or any Williams, caveat the archive may not have contained the whole of 2006. Kelly D. Williams may have works in some galleries, but so far as I have been able to determine, he has won no awards and had had no one-man-shows. He has no works in museums. He is not notable as an artist. Maybe in twenty years he will be, but it is not there now. --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 08:24, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> I took a look at the 2006 media mentions listed in his CV. The Street Resource mention seems to be an interview published on the StreetRes blog in Dec 2005<a href="http://www.streetres.com/?p=305" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.streetres.com/?p=305" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, republished from a Japanese <a href="../../../z/i/n/Zine.html" title="Zine">zine</a>. The interview introduces him as an "up and coming artist". Bejnar's already done most of the legwork, so I just ran the other names of media sources through <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> - only Lemonade came with 2 very passing mention hits. <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> search on Williams only brought up a few one line mentions in gallery schedule listings. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 16:12, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> Removed irrelevant, libelous comment from Afd. <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_D._Williams_ea84.html" title="Kelly D. Williams">Kelly D. Williams</a> is clearly a significant artist in either the underground art world, the commercial design realm, or both. The 2K by Gingham affiliation is substantial, as well as this article I located here: <a href="http://www.gimmeshelter.co.uk/ArtistInfo.php?user_id=182" class="external free" title="http://www.gimmeshelter.co.uk/ArtistInfo.php?user_id=182" rel="nofollow">http://www.gimmeshelter.co.uk/ArtistInfo.php?user_id=182</a> containing multiple testimonials from people who appear to be artists in <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_art.html" title="Street art">street art</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> removed subjective phrases per AfD, found a verifiable source on this artist on the 2K By Gingham website. 2K By Gingham is a company that creates apparel featuring the work of legitimate artists. <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_D._Williams_ea84.html" title="Kelly D. Williams">Kelly D. Williams</a> name was found amongst the names of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_McGee_f747.html" title="Barry McGee">Barry McGee</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Michel_Basquiat_17ad.html" title="Jean-Michel Basquiat">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a>, and <a href="../../../y/o/k/Yoko_Ono_397a.html" title="Yoko Ono">Yoko Ono</a>. An article (a pdf) was also found referencing his gallery appearances. I removed the blog link to the Street interview as it seemed to not have much notability. I'm somewhat new to Wiki, but I will try to offer help to clean up this article. 11:15, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep – assistance with edit</b> When this article was first created it seemed to have some improvable or at least opinionated information, so I have made few attempts to remove such content and/or add additional resources as they were found. I’ve done this because I’m aware of the credibility of <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_D._Williams_ea84.html" title="Kelly D. Williams">Kelly D. Williams</a> as an actual artist, both as a gallery artist as well as a commercial graphic designer (not a business). As mentioned, there is, in fact, an article/interview with the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artist.html" title="Artist">artist</a> in Staf Magazine – I know this because I have seen the actual issue as well as seen this artist’s artwork on listings for group and solo exhibitions in various art-related periodicals. Reasons for deletion are also highly opinionated, so I propose to remove opinionated content and keep. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEng500_1ed8.html" title="User:Eng500">Eng500</a> 18:41, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please if you can provide <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verified</a> notability with <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> do so. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">The first requirement of notability for a living person</a> is that the person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. Further, the person must have made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field. They can't just be a credible artist. Contributing to the "enduring historical record" usually means that an artist has works in museums (more than one); however, it can also be met where an artist has started an artistic movement. These underlying facts of notability cannot be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">proved</a> using the content of interviews or other self-promotional works. To show wide recognition, there must be third-party verification from non-trivial publication outside of publications by sponsors of the activity. I hope this helps you understand why the current article fails basic notability standards and what needs to be done to establish notability. --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 04:52, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>RE: Keep – assistance with edit</b> Please refer to the same <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">notability</a> article defining requirements for credibility of a person, which reads <i><b>“This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted.”</b></i></dd>
<dd><i><b>Other tests of notability:</b></i></dd>
<dd><i><b>Multiple features in popular culture publications, A large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following, Name recognition, and Commercial endorsements.</b></i></dd>
<dd>From the research that ALL people have posted on this discussion, this article (or artist as a person) has satisfied several (or ALL) of these tests.</dd>
<dd>If, after all of this, you can still prove that this article is NOT noteworthy or serves as permitted and valuable information to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">Wiki</a> users, feel free to mark me down as a “delete”, but this seems like it’s taking excessive argument to justify deleting the article, while several points of valid criteria have been plainly met.</dd>
<dd>Also note the length of time that this article has existed, the diverse contributions to it, and also consider other articles on Wiki for similar artists in this similar genre of art. Many of them have not been sufficiently written according to the points discussed in this Afd, and therefore serve as referential precedence as preserved articles of significance that should not be deleted. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEng500_1ed8.html" title="User:Eng500">Eng500</a> 05:17, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> It is not the genre, it is not how long something has been up, (I believe that Wikipedia editoras should allow people time to prove up an article.) it is not the fandom, it is not what was done with other articles (the Pokemon argument), it is the standards. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> is clear that if the first criteria is not met, then the others are irrelevant. --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 00:53, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>RE: Comment</b> Thank you for once again providing the information in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>, which above all says this: <i><b>"People who satisfy at least one of the items below may merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them."</b></i> I cannot think of any other argument to clarify the import of this article other than what the Wiki requirements suggest. I think it's obvious that this may be an artist or an article of significance, but i don't have the endurance to do anything other than suggest we <b>Keep and improve this article.</b> --<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEng500_1ed8.html" title="User:Eng500">Eng500</a> 01:24, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That is fine for dead people. You left out the caveat "Biographies of living persons are subject to additional rules and restrictions. ..." Editors have had six months to prove up Kelly D. Williams, and what did we get: magazine dead ends, which some kind soul has removed, one interview, and bios from related parties (galleries). --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 01:35, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Please improve this article if possible. If confirmable text or images are found, go ahead and contribute to this article. Satisfies <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> requirements, but categorized as a stub. Sidenote: Is this the same Kelly D. Williams that is a endorsed snowboarder? I googled a bunch results of a pro or amateur athlete by the same name, mentioning position in arts(?)</li>
<li><b><s>Comment</s> - Keep</b> Added references, discovered that <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_D._Williams_ea84.html" title="Kelly D. Williams">Kelly D. Williams</a> the artist is also a professional (or possibly amateur) snowboard athlete. Added photo &amp; removed stub. Hope this helps!</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> None of the sources I checked (I couldn't get the last one to open) were both non-trivial and reliable (I.e. they were all either blogs or art show blurbs). If he as independent notability as a snowboarder (and <a href="http://www.artistsofutah.org/15bytes/06feb/page7.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.artistsofutah.org/15bytes/06feb/page7.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> does say that he is one), I might be persuaded to keep, but right now there is no evidence that he has any thrid-party coverage for snowboarding. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 09:10, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
