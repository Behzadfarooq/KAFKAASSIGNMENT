<p>This concerns a "Radio Host from an <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underground.html" title="Underground">underground</a> radiosstation called The French Connection which started medium 2005", and as it stands is a POV conspiracy screed. Naturally POV can be fixed, but in this case, is this person notable enough to justify it? While he generates a good number of Google hits, Internet conspiracy theorists have an extremely high <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_Cruft_multiple_17a2.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning/Cruft multiple">cruft multiple</a>, and the hits are mainly from websites similar to his and sites redistributing his 'underground radio'. None look like independent, third party sources. That may be because the mainstream media and other potential reliable sources are in on the conspiracy, or because he's non-notable. You decide. For my part I vote <b>delete</b> per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning <small>(formerly Malthusian)</small></a> <small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></small> 12:55, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> for now. The number of Ghits, even accounting for Blanning's <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_Cruft_multiple_17a2.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning/Cruft multiple">Cruft Factor</a>, seems above average for this sort of thing. However, what worried me as I scrolled through the list is that there are no "mainstream" sources about this guy. It all looked like blog posts, torrents, podcasts, and the like. I don't want to throw out independent media <i>a priori</i>, but if the only people discussing this delightfully idiosyncratic guy are other delightfully idiosyncratic guys, then it's a walled garden scenario. I'm open to change my opinion on this if someone can point to mainstream, or even mainstreamish sources for this guy. I didn't find any because I got tired of scrolling, but I accept the proposition that they might be down there somewhere. --<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 14:15, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think we can be clear about the fact that this is not a "common" guy at all. Common guys are not requested to be a guest in other radio shows. Also are "common" people not discussed in radio programs as subject of discussion. Why I should even spend one second of my time for changing that article about him and writing this message if it was just a common guy. Many persons also mentioned in this encyclopedia fear, hate or love this guy. This guy, an his thoughts have some significant influence on society.

<li>Remember that Alex Jones (journalist) and Jeff Rense are both in this list too, those are not more notable than mr. Smith. Further all those persons had a radioshow on the same radio network GCN. Mr. Smith has many good guests in his show as Rabbi's, Professors, Secret Service Agents, Pentagon Insiders, Writers, Bush Insiders. Why should all those persons go to a non-notable person? Of course we are not so interested in Smith's life, we are more interested in his Radio Show.

<p>He claims that Alex Jones could be an infiltrator. But if you claim something without evidence than you have a theory. Smith provides at least some serious information that supports his claim, and more pleasant information that we can all check. I don't say I like Alex or Daryl or somebody else, I simply listen to them what they have to say. Listening is one of the most important aspects of life. We can listen to different opions, Daryl attacks Alex, Wing.TV attacks Alex. Wing.TV attacks Daryl. Daryl attacks Wing.TV. But it happens all on a decent way. Because they all know each other.<small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.35.49.131 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.35.49.131_2a57.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.35.49.131">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> for now. I've been keeping an eye on Daryl Bradford Smith, and while he's holding steady at about 15,000 hits per day (compare, e.g., my site [www.thhp.org] which gets ten times that many), he doesn't seem poised to get much more, and he's getting more and more unhinged as the weeks go on. He's not a well man.</li>
