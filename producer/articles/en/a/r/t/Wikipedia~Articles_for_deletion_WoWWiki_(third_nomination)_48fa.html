<p><b>Self nomination</b> Fails <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>. This is a fan website, and I do not see how it is notable, yet alone even worth mentioning on Wikipedia. It is only directly related to World of Warcraft, and all other Wikipedia articles that link to this do so in their <i>External links</i> sections. It arguably could be cited as a source (within context), however it clearly doesn't need its own article. Many MMORPGs have their own unofficial fan-driven wikis (PlaneShift has like three of them, and Anarchy Online has AOWiki); yet they do not have their own Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxide_b7c3.html" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 17:49, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> If I where you, I would actually do a little research before screaming <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>, as this is very much notable. Also, there are no rules that go against fan sites. If it is mentioned in the EL section of those articles, they can be safely removed and added to the "See also" section of said articles. This is in fact the biggest Warcraft related Wiki, and I would encourage you to find any other Warcraft Wiki which is as big as this one, so you can prove me wrong on this. Thank you. One last thing, I feel this is a bad faith nomination as you have done little to no research on the subject matter before you placed the AfD. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 09:05, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - How would whether or not WoW players know about the wiki affect its notability? Surely that would only count <i>for</i> the article rather than against it? I would dispute that wikipedia has everything that a reasearcher would need, but if it is to then link to WoWWiki to give a researcher the information missing from here, would it not be a reasonable to have an independant article showing them what the WoWWiki is like? <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirkburn_a0db.html" title="User:Kirkburn">Kirkburn</a> 01:54, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I feel I should mention that the wiki is <i>not</i> just about World of Warcraft, but the entire Warcraft universe - which is an awful lot larger. It's also one of the most popular Warcraft-related websites in the world - the Alexa ranking is now around 4,000 and rising. I have to ask, why do we need a third nomination about this? Are we going to keep having them until it's deleted and there's no way back? Please don't bite my head off for mentioning this, but using the medium of a google search WoWWiki gets 291,000 results for me (compared to 318,000 for <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wookieepedia.html" title="Wookieepedia">Wookieepedia</a>), which seems an awful for lot for something non-notable -- <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirkburn_a0db.html" title="User:Kirkburn">Kirkburn</a> 19:47, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Please clarify this: <i>the Alexa ranking is now around 4,000 and rising.</i> I assume you do realize that the number getting bigger is worse. The reason this was nominated for a third time is that this non-notable, being an unofficial fan site. I didn't see my argument brought up in the previous two nominations. <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxide_b7c3.html" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 21:25, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Certainly, see <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=1y&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;url=www.wowwiki.com#top" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=1y&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;url=www.wowwiki.com#top" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Several days recently the wiki has reached a rank of around 2,500 (the very, very recent dip is due a small amount of downtime). Thank you for mentioning my semantics rather than concentrating on the point, btw. And yes your argument was brought up before. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirkburn_a0db.html" title="User:Kirkburn">Kirkburn</a> 21:37, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Wait a moment - are you saying you didn't actually check to see whether the site was popular (most surely an indication of notability) before nominating it on the basis of non-notability? Since when is the fact that it is "unofficial fan site" qualify it for non-notability? Does something have to be officially sanctioned to be notable? Does the fact it's not a Blizzard-run site count against it? Please explain your reasoning further. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirkburn_a0db.html" title="User:Kirkburn">Kirkburn</a> 01:37, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> What the h3ll does <i>self nomination</i> mean? "Not notable enough" shouldn't be an acceptable argument for deletion. Some actual evidence sould be required.
<ul>
<li>WoWWiki is one of the most used sources of World of Warcraft UI modification API information. It has more info than Blizzard supplies on their sites (game site and forums).</li>
<li>The argument that WoW info on Wikipedia can replace WoWWiki is ludicrous.</li>
<li>Why don't you better spend your time nominating WikiFur for deletion. This uses 4 of 5 references from wikia.com (2 of which are self-referential to WikiFur itself) to somehow justify it's notability. Clearly there is a group of wikipedians targeting <a href="../../../w/o/w/WoWWiki_90d8.html" title="WoWWiki">WoWWiki</a> and not really concerned about non-notable wikis.</li>
<li>In all honesty, I don't really care whether this article gets deleted, but if it does at least use a better argument than a weak notability argument. I expect this article to get nominated for deletion on a regular basis. Some wikipedians clearly love their bureaucracy. --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFandyllic_70bf.html" title="User:Fandyllic">Fandyllic</a> 1:42 PM PDT 27 Oct 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> When I nominated this, I didn't realize there were articles on <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lostpedia.html" title="Lostpedia">Lostpedia</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wookiepedia.html" title="Wookiepedia">Wookiepedia</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memory_Alpha_f337.html" title="Memory Alpha">Memory Alpha</a>, etc. Since these are unofficial fan sites (hosted by Wikicities even), I would challenge whether they are encyclopedic enough to merit their own articles on Wikipedia. It is with much consideration that I believe such notability should be proven. For example, <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncyclopedia.html" title="Uncyclopedia">Uncyclopedia</a> is notable; you can clearly see this in its References section. <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxide_b7c3.html" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 20:54, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>They've already been nominated for deletion, and two of the three have been clearly kept, with the third getting strong support, so it'll probably be kept as well. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:40, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree that perhaps the first edit was a little over the line. Mostly I added it as the fact that this article keeps getting nominated is becoming somewhat of a running joke for us&#160;:) As to my comment to a fellow admin on WoWWiki - who knows more about the website than someone who has worked on it for years?

Someone might disagree with me, though. I've only heard of your site once before, and that was in a copyright problem when I noticed a group of users uploading World of Warcraft screenshots onto Wikipedia from your website, and claiming them as GFDL or PD (which in no way they are, being WoW screenshots they are fair use). <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxide_b7c3.html" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 22:28, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would have seen the deletion banner for WoWWiki here eventually, but I honestly don't consider Wikipedia much of a reference to be too concerned about. I just don't want to let WoWWiki get deleted because of somebody who clearly has an agenda to do it and isn't really applying equal standards to Wikipedia articles.

There's probably some essay that explains it better than I can, but the purpose of strong/weak isn't to make the "vote" count more but to indicate that that user can/can't be swayed or is certain/uncertain about their choice. If an afd has multiple "weak keep"s and a handful of "strong delete"s the closing admin may well decide to delete anyway if the rationales given by the deleters, together with their certainty, result in a stronger indication of the action to take. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 02:11, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I found this very interesting comment on your talk page -- it's very relevant to your stance on this article: "I see that your opinion that notability is a silly criterion is affecting your editing style, and very much to the detriment of the encyclopedia I think. Notability is important because we exist here to serve our readers... [W]e must exercise careful and thoughtful editorial judgment, and one part of editorial judgment is an understanding that treating irrelevant data as on equal footing with the essentials, is confusing and a disservice to the reader.--<i><b><a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 16:32, 16 October 2006</b></i> (UTC)" --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 03:01, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I find the whole premiss silly because nobody can prove or disprove notability. All it takes on Wikipedia is a handful of people voting "keep" and one person voting "delete" and the article stays, same as other way around. People use notability to delete articles which are highly notable, because they themselves don't see the notability. This AfD is a good example, as the person who started it hasn't done any research on it. I stand by my annotation about V and NN, as I find them silly and in many cases counter productive to Wikipedia, as all it takes are enough people. I might want to explain that a little closer on my User Page, if you don't understand what I am saying, please ask me and I will try to explain it. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 08:52, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I fully understand your position, and like Jimbo Wales, I find it to be a detriment of the encyclopedia. Notability is in the eye of the beholder, of course. That's why there are guidelines and policies that were drawn up through concensus of Wikipedia users. Your post seems to indicate unhappiness with the deletion process in addition to your (IMO) flawed opinion of notability. I also have same deep concerns about the AFD process myself: it's very arbitrary. Closing admins often treat AFDs as votes rather than the debates they are supposed to be and give un-due weight to personal opinion, but it's hard to change the process. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 20:09, 29 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Which is also why this whole AfD is - in my eyes - counterproductive to Wikipedia. As it boils down to right now is who has the most "Keep" and "Delete" votes. People should by now understand that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> are both guidelines, NOT official policy.

<ul>
<li>I know, I know... we've played the semantics game about guidelines not being offical policy, before. This is why I feel concur with Jimbo Wales about your position being a detrement to Wikipedia. Disregarding content inclusion guidelines allows for the inclusion of stuff which dilutes the value of other articles. I look at the notability guidelines as clarifications of policy, while exceptions need to occasionaly be made, and they are a pretty good standard for article inclusion. The article up for nomination does not come anywhere near to passing the very lax criteria laid out in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">the web content guidelines</a> but it gets a lot of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">I like it votes</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Something funny about the Alexa rank. Most of its traffic comes from either Wikipedia or Digg or various blogs, unless they insert the URL manually. There are many problems with the Alexa test, see <a href="../../../s/e/t/WP%7ESET_8bd1.html#Alexa_test" title="WP:SET">WP:SET#Alexa test</a>. Its user base is very small and consists of Internet Explorer users who choose to install a spyware program/toolbar; in particular, webmasters who seek to boost their site rankings. Since there are admins from WoWWiki coming to this nomination page and citing from Alexa, this point is obviously invalid. There is a <a href="../../../1/u/p/1UP.com_c6a3.html" title="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> article that merely uses it as a reference, but that's the only context I've seen it used in.

<dd><b>Comment</b> My personal view on the above - grasping at straws. <i>"Webmasters who seek to boost their site rankings"</i>? Please, do not attempt defamation, we do no such thing (nor can!), and are extremely insulted by your suggestion. Why you describe it as <i>"spyware"</i> I do not know, and how exactly do you know <i>"most of its traffic comes from either Wikipedia or Digg or various blogs, unless they insert the URL manually"</i> (isn't that how the internet works?) and <i>"Its user base is very small"</i>. I am not using it to 'prove' it either way, but as context. The IE restriction has very little bearing on the matter - WoW is dual platform, so if anything would show fewer results than in an accurate survey. And I still fail to see why you're so weirdly paranoid about people who work on the website coming here to give an opinion. You sound like you wish wikipedia was some exclusive members-only club, where 'outsiders' aren't allowed! <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirkburn_a0db.html" title="User:Kirkburn">Kirkburn</a> 19:49, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My point is to more formally prove that the <a href="../../../s/e/t/WP%7ESET_8bd1.html#Alexa_test" title="WP:SET">Alexa test</a> is invalid, by example. In no way do I intend to defame WoWWiki admins, however the tone of some of these responses here, as well as their lack of factuality towards the nomination, is enough for me to argue that the converse is true. <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxide_b7c3.html" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 01:08, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And I would contest that you have not 'formally' proved anything. I do not control the views of others, and note that I have not engaged in mudslinging here. I am here to discuss why this article is of value to wikipedia, and I really do want to have a discussion over it&#160;:) Again, no we do not engage in any underhand tactics to gain readership (nor could we, as we have no <i>direct</i> control over the wiki. None whatsoever, and it severely annoys us.). <b>We</b> do not advertise, or post links to us on forums o'er the world. Yet still we remain frequently referenced on wikipedia, and known to many many people. If you are going to accuse people of things they do not do, try and at least back up your statements rather than 'infer' something from a heated debate. It wouldn't stand up in court, it shouldn't here. It's somewhat hard to write an article about a wiki, as it has few identifyable features. No company, no employees, no 'aim', etc. Of course wikipedia has articles about itself, due to the phenomenon it has produced, but other wikis stand in its shadow and correspondingly get little written about them, whatever their notoriety or notability. I just wish to see common sense around here - talking generally, I've seen far too many edit wars over the tiniest, stupidest little thing all because someone wanted to follow a policy absolutely to the letter, to the detriment of 'the whole'. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirkburn_a0db.html" title="User:Kirkburn">Kirkburn</a> 13:34, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I feel I should clarify a point. Since many, <i>many</i> wikipedia Warcraft articles reference WoWWiki (and rightly so, as WoWWiki has more info), would it not be just to have an indepedent page describing this site?
