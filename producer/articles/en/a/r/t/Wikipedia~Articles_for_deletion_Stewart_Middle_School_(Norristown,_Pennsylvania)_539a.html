<p>Nothing specific for notability, except the unreferenced program participation from 1981--might possibly be enough if there were two independent sources for it. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:31, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> - All currently open middle schools that have an well-written article can be included. That's my objective criterion.

<li><b>Keep</b> It looks fine to me. I see nothing wrong with giving a subjective judgment, so long as we try to be fair about it, and that's really what Patsw's and my criteria are in this case -- subjective. I guess I think we should be tougher in our standards for middle schools than high schools, because they are less notable and less important. If someone's going to bother to write an article on one that doesn't have too many problems with it, I'm inclined to want to keep it. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 05:08, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Fails <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Just because someone bothers to write an article doesn't mean it should be included (unfortunately). Notability guidelines state that the onus is placed on the editor (and the community at large) to produce reliable sources. If notability can be established through the participation in the PDE's School Climate Improvement Project then it may be eligible to be kept but this depends on the size and scope of the project. There may not be a consensus between editors on the notability of <a href="../../../e/d/u/Educational_institutions.html" title="Educational institutions">educational institutions</a> but until one is reached we must attempt to follow the guidelines set down in <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> which covers <a href="../../../e/d/u/Educational_institutions.html" title="Educational institutions">educational institutions</a>. <a href="../../../x/a/r/User%7EXarr_c4f1.html" title="User:Xarr">Xarr</a> 13:51, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In almost all practical senses, a public school's own Web site, minus the gushing and laudatory adjectives, is a reliable source, certainly for basic facts. In the United States, the <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Child_Left_Behind_37a8.html" title="No Child Left Behind">No Child Left Behind</a> Act seems to require that state governments create annual reports on schools, constituting an independent source of information. Therefore, as commmon sense will tell us, the nature of reliable sources on public schools is fundamentally different from other organizations listed at <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, and as <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> tells us, we can overrule <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>. Just because someone bothers to write a policy that fails common sense in a particular instance (or even category), doesn't mean we have to march over the cliff behind it. Addressing notability doesn't end the matter of whether a school article should stay or go: If some school articles attract vandalism or don't take advantage of the reliable sources available, they can and should be merged into district articles, letting readers who type in the school's name be redirected to the district article. This does not address non-U.S. schools and private schools.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 17:34, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Clearly Notable: school has a community learning center grant, a partnership with Family Services AND a state of the art wireless (computer) network, with plenty of reliable and verifiable sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> What are the <i>objective criteria</i> for including or excluding middle schools that can be applied to <i>all</i> schools? If that cannot be articulated, then delete-voters has no objective reasons for their vote. They are just making it up as they go along (i.e. <i>notability -- I know it when I see it</i>). It's totally lame and <i>arbitrary</i>. One reading these votes to delete would come to no insight into how to write an article that you delete-voters could find satisfactory. This leads me to ask why isn't every middle school with an article nominated for deletion? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatsw_2d50.html" title="User:Patsw">patsw</a> 19:38, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You're confusing "notability, i know it when I see it" with "well-written article, I know it when I see it and I want to keep it". Interesting points about the usefulness of objectivity, however.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 05:02, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>neutral</b> Most subjects are subjective to some extent--only the general requirements for RSs is always present. There are none here--the district is not independent, and the Penna. report is included within the Great Schools and gives no specific non-trivial information. The reason there are so few newspaper and other articles on middle schools is clear: the media find nothing to write about. Even the criterion of helping readers is unnecessary: anyone who goes to google will find the same sources as used here. WP is not Great Schools. Why duplicate it on a completely unselective basis unless we have something to add?<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:47, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>DGG, first, you can't be comparing some reader reading an article with trawling through Google to find information. You didn't write that. My eyes are lying to me. And you must not have looked to closely at the Pennsylvania DOE Web page -- that is, their <i>main</i> Web page for the school. If you click on the pyramid-shaped triangles, you get far greater detail than Great Schools provides. So much detail that your eyes will quickly glaze over. There are few articles on this middle school, but there are almost 600 in the Google Archives link I provided at the Walnut Middle School deletion discussion, and many of those focus on the school. Walnut wins <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotable_e66c.html" title="WP:Notable">WP:Notable</a> hands down; this one, not so much. My guess is that Walnut is the more usual case. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 05:02, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Delete-voters, do you expect <i>newspapers</i> to make a middle school the subject of an article in the performance of its core function of educating the young people of a community? There are no headlines reading <i>"Sun rises as expected"</i> The criterion that a middle school has to have google-able headlines to be included is unrealistic and will excluded schools that should otherwise be included. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatsw_2d50.html" title="User:Patsw">patsw</a> 12:45, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Actually, yes, we <i>do</i> expect that reliable, published sources make non-trivial references to the school (as <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> requires) for it to pass inclusion muster. That like most of the rest this school fails our standards doesn't mean that there is something wrong with the standards and that their application is unrealistic; it means that the article's subject fails to pass muster and so should <i>not</i> be included. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 16:52, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. The precedent has been to generally keep high school articles and delete grade school/middle school articles, unless they have sources independent of the school which are reliable (meeting <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and which have coverage which goes into depth about the school.

(Would it have satisfied <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> , which is currently tagged as "historical" but had a lot of good work to arrive at a consensus?) <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:20, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
