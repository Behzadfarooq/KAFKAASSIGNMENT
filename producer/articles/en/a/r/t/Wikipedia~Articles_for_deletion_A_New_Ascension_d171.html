<p>I have several news articles (hard copies) from local papers about this band. I cant find the same articles online. How can I show that this band is notable? What about ASCAP check stubs? There music was just purchased for "Undercover starlet"(sp?). A very small reality show in N.Y. Its easy to find on the web though. They're negotiating an instrumental mix for a new horror movie being made. If I could get something from the band, should I send it to Wikipedia to show its authenticity? I spend hours a day on this site (just as a reader) and I just want to add to it. Please help me imporve this page. I think this band deserves to have one...I just cant figure out how to show their notability. Should I list quotes from news papers?</p>
<p>...at the very least, they could be linked with a number of other more prominent pages.</p>
<p>Sorry for being a stereotypical noob.</p>
<p>I cant even post correctly. Sorry.</p>
<p><br />
I was uncertain of the deletion policy for bands but tried to clean up the article all the same. I just checked out <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, maybe you should see if you can fill any of the criteria? If not then save what you have and once they get in the horror movie or on the reality show you can repost .<br />
Good luck,<br />

<p>Thanks alot. I really needed some help with this. I appreciate all your work on the page.</p>
<p>I've been reading non-stop. The more I read about "Notability" the more vague it seems. But I'll keep trying. They have the reality show already, I just dont know how to show that. There music is used in episodes but how do you prove that. The individual would have to actually watch the show, ya know. They also have pay stubs from ASCAP for liceasing deals and radio plays.</p>
<p>If the people who want to delete this page just check out Beatpick.com (easiest to navigate) they would see that they're professional, not some random garage band. Although they're no N'Sync and they havent gone platinum from their first CD...ha. Beatpick is just one publisher. They also scored deals through indie911, and other companies as well. They hooked up w/ MTV through T.J. Rising. Beleive me when I say that I'm no fan of MTV. However, even I understand that its a big deal when MTV accepts everyone of your songs for their catalog. They have done all this without a label--completely on their own. It just goes to show you, unless you sign with a label, people will always think your nothing.</p>
<p>How do I show all this though...Argh!</p>
<p>If their music is on an episode can you cite that in the article and point to an external website throught the cite. I assume there should be some sort of credit for that? To do a cite you can check out <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nantucket_ship.html" title="Nantucket ship">Nantucket ship</a> that I cleaned up with some citing - it is pretty simple. I believe you just need to fill one of the criteria not all of them also I think that TJ Rising's connection to MTV is notable - Can you show that connection via a an external link? The more external links you can get to viable sources such as MTV the better you can prove their notoriety. My belief is that not being an "N'Sync" is a positive thing - lol.<br />

<p>Thanks so much- I dont know how to do the links so I'll have to read up about it. Im def going to take your advice and check out your work on that page. Also, I'll go to the web site that plays the episodes of the reality show online. I'll see if they have credits at the end to show (in writting) that A New Ascension music was legally purchased and used. Its going to suck watching every episode...haha. If there are none, I guess I'll still make a link so that, at the very least, those who are familair with the music will recognize it when/if they here it. Linking to T.J. Rizing is a great idea too...you just have all the answers...ha. I was curious...should a put a picture, or their Logo (or whatever you call it) up? Maybe a link to their myspace and purevolume...??? Also, They have the same Web Desginer as TakeOver Records(Ben Harper's-[formerly from yellowcard]- label)...is that notable? haha. I'm looking for anything, anything at all. Ricky Spoons, drummer (A.N.A.) takes lessons and is friends with L.P. (drummer-YellowCard). John Wilkes is a close friend of the band (Drummer-Red Jumpsuit-Virgin)- i mean geeze...theres so many little obscure things about them...haha they KNOW famous people.. does that count?haha</p>
<p>ok time to work. thanks again. If you have anymore suggestions please do not hessitate.</p>
<p>BTW-"Notable" should be defined as any band that is not N'Sync.</p>
<ul>
<li>I cleaned up the formatting a little for you. An external source would be a review in a magazine, or a website, or something. Have they put out an album? Unfortunately, not being <a href="../../../n/27/s/N%27Sync_9530.html" title="N'Sync">N'Sync</a> isn't an argument for inclusion. I'll give a conditional <b>Delete</b> at this point, unless sources can be found. --<b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumblefool_50e8.html" title="User:Humblefool">humble</a></b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumblefool_8320.html" title="User talk:Humblefool">fool</a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandompage_5bbb.html" title="Special:Randompage">®</a> 21:42, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks-I'm going to add the sources and reviews when I go home. I'm currently at work. I have stacks of articles at my place. I hope I can remember how to cite work properly.</p>

An article that fails to even claim that the subject of the article is notable can be speedy deleted under criterion A7, however. A mere claim of notability, even if contested, may avoid deletion under A7 and require a full Article for Deletion process to determine if the subject of the article is notable. It appears that <i>section 6:</i> Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable. (from what I can see <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Summer_Obsession_9a93.html" title="The Summer Obsession">The Summer Obsession</a> was or still is signed with <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Records_4102.html" title="Virgin Records">Virgin Records</a>, went on the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vans_Warped_Tour_2351.html" title="Vans Warped Tour">Vans Warped Tour</a> and have a wiki page) or <i>section 7:</i> Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city. or <i>section 10:</i> Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show - May apply to this article. The creator of this article is a newbie and appears to be trying hard to get this up to Wiki standards.

<p>Jmylar 20:50, 15 November 2006 (UTC)I didnt get a chance to cite anything yesterday. I hope i get a chance to before anything is deleted. Like i said i have a ton of info. Also, if the fact that Mark (bass) was signed to Virgin makes the band more notable, then It might also be notable that Jared Boice was signed to Vision sound (who discoverd The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus[Virgin]+Escher[no more])...they happen to be a Virgin Records affiliate. Its also where the band records. Plus, the band is professional. The deals they sign are equivelant to those a "Major Label" band would sign. They just make more profit (percentage) then a "major" band would. I dont think they should be over looked just because they MAY (or may not) have more sense then some bands that rush into a major label contract. The "May not," comes from the fact that they might be turned down by Wikipedia simply b/c they've Turned down majors/indie's in the past. Btw-like my SN? Im going for the forum-trendy "rip off" M.Shadows SN. Accept im doing it for J(Jordin) Mylar (we have the same first initial...ha)! yeah- I know I'm lame!</p>
