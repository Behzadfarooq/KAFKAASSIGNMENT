<p>Question: Are potentially-derogatory press release quotations directed towards members of the Ontario Liberal Party inherently noteworthy? If not, with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Evil+reptilian+kitten-eater+from+another+planet%22+-wikipedia+-dictionary+-encyclopedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=270&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Evil+reptilian+kitten-eater+from+another+planet%22+-wikipedia+-dictionary+-encyclopedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=270&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">271 google hits</a> what makes this one worthy of note on Wikipedia, or for that matter, any other encyclopaedia? --GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 19:07, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Despite the silly sounding title, this is a fairly well written valid article on a legitmate bit of historic triva. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 19:24, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Not all bits of political derogation are going to be notable. This does not stop individual examples from being notable. GRider, I wish you would stop phrasing every single VfD you submit in terms of a judgement to be made on an entire class to which the article in question belongs. I don't know if you're doing this to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> but it's tiresome. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:51, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. While I recognize that many would argue that this is inherently non-notable since it relates to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, it was actually and surprisingly a key turning point in that election campaign. It marked the beginning of the rapid downward spiral of the governing party, and it was clear that they would be unable to recover from it. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevintoronto_ec05.html" title="User:Kevintoronto">Kevintoronto</a> 20:22, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The title seems off to me. Could the controversy be listed under something different? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:28, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. A cleaned up version of this article would be more at home as part of <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_2003.html" title="Ontario general election, 2003">Ontario general election, 2003</a> in the Campaign section. - <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENormanEinstein_d22c.html" title="User:NormanEinstein">NormanEinstein</a> 20:32, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Any politics watcher in Canada would be able to easily cite this quote, it deserves to be an entry in the same way that <i><a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition_of_the_willing.html" title="Coalition of the willing">coalition of the willing</a></i> does in my humble opinion. - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 20:40, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> and <b>redirect</b>. The title is ridiculous and nonintuitive -- would anyone ACTUALLY type this in while looking for information on this specific topic? As part of an article on a particular campaign the information itself seems worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia, but not as a separate article, and certainly not with this title. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Katefan0</a> 21:35, Mar 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep. This is clearly an interesting facet of Canadian politics. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Recycling_Troll_5389.html" title="User:The Recycling Troll">The Recycling Troll</a> 22:35, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_2003.html" title="Ontario general election, 2003">Ontario general election, 2003</a>, reducing to a couple of sentences. Minor incident from an provincial election campaign, not meriting an separate article. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:09, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As soon as I read the title I recalled the incident, and I'm not even Canadian. So I'd say it's notable. It would be definately be a candidate for the unusual articles category, though. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">Jonathunder</a> 00:38, 2005 Mar 9 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's not the press release itself that's the notable part, it's the reaction that followed. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 01:14, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep.</b> Fits right in with lots of articles on trivial bits of momentary political spin at Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 01:18, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. What the hell. As long as chocolateboy promises to keep Miss Kitty Fantastico from getting devoured. The article is not actually about evil reptilian kitten-eaters from another planet, in which case it would be patent nonsense; it's about a locally memorable political incident that marked or caused a turning point in political affairs. This probably falls under the same category as <a href="../../../c/h/e/Checkers_speech.html" title="Checkers speech">Checkers speech</a>, above the threshold for being encyclopedic. For what it's worth, the province of Ontario has more than 1/3 of Canada's population. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 02:49, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, cleanup and expand. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 02:53, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Eh, <b>keep</b>. The subject seems to have actually had a quantifiable effect upon politics and society, which is more than can be said for most articles of the type. --<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowking_Man_5da9.html" title="User:Slowking Man">Slowking Man</a> 06:45, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Like <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">All your base are belong to us</a>, the title used to describe the incident matches the phrase used in the incident. Rename to what? -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 09:13, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Weak <b>Keep</b>. Oddly enough, it's probably one of the most memorable events of that election. It certainly generated more national news coverage than just about anything else that happened in the campaign. I wouldn't be averse to seeing it merged into the election article, though. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">Talk</a> 18:14, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Absolutely keep. This had a significant effect on the outcome of the election. Also, today is my birthday. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 01:08, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>. -<a href="../../../g/t/r/User%7EGtrmp_2ffc.html" title="User:Gtrmp">Sean Curtin</a> 03:04, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The first time I saw this, I thought it was silly and pointless and didn't need to be chunked out from <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_2003.html" title="Ontario general election, 2003">Ontario general election, 2003</a>. But, in actual fact, two sentences in the election article <i>can't</i> cover this adequately; there's not one single word in <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil_reptilian_kitten-eater_from_another_planet.html" title="Evil reptilian kitten-eater from another planet">Evil reptilian kitten-eater from another planet</a> that isn't absolutely essential to understanding the context and the impact this had on the election. And it ain't every day that a political incident at the <i>provincial</i> level in Canada gets coverage in <i><a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a></i> newspapers, either, so we're clearly not talking about trivialities here.
