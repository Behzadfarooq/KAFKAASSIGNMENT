<p>Tagged as CSD A7, but I'm not deleting that based on that because this is about a <i>concept</i> of wiki-based novels, not any specific site. That said, I'm not sure we should have an article on this; few people have tried writing wiki-based collaborative novels yet (A Million Penguins is one of the few examples, of not the <i>only</i> example, that has gained any media attention at all), so this probably suffers from <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">general neologism problems</a>. <i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 12:27, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm not saying this article should be spared; I'm just saying I don't see <i>what speedy deletion criteria this meets</i>. Notability is a tricky one because we don't, er, have notability criteria for neologisms. It <i>does</i> fail quite a few of <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> points, there's no sources that would say this is a particularly widespread term yet - that's why it's deletable material. I just don't see how it could qualify for <i>speedy</i> deletion - neologisms are specifically <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">listed</a> under "non-criteria", and one can't really argue this is <i>blatant</i> advertising. Thus, the Process. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 13:58, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. Documenting the word once it can be confirmed to be in widespread use is Wiktionary's remit, not ours. (For one thing, that's primary research that Wiktionary editors are allowed to do and we are not.) An encyclopaedia article entitled "wikinovel" would be about wikinovels — what they are, who came up with the idea, how successful they have been, what their impact upon the world of creative writing has been, and so forth. Thus you need only apply the criteria of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. If the idea of wikinovels hasn't yet been documented, we shouldn't have an article. Now look at the several sources, cited on the article's talk page, documenting the idea of wikinovels. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:31, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yup. So the big question is this: Is this a correct, widespread term? Does it warrant a discussion in a separate article anyway, or just a small bit in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a>? How famous of a phenomenon we're talking of here? I'm not so sure myself <i>yet</i> (just checked Google and seems I got whopping (<a href="http://www.google.fi/search?q=wikinovel&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial&amp;hs=2jO&amp;start=190&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.fi/search?q=wikinovel&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial&amp;hs=2jO&amp;start=190&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">193 distinct hits for "wikinovel"</a>); perhaps the web links may convince me but I'm not really in condition to read a lot of stuff now. =/ --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 14:49, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As far as I'm concerned, 3 sources and 193 ghits does not constitute widespread popular use. More to the point, the kind of project it's supposed to be is not new, and goes by a name that escapes me at the moment, so essentially this is a new name for an old idea, the main difference deing that it is done through wiki making it easier to facilitate than the previous websites that do open-ended group-written novels. Given that, I say the claim that the idea 'began' in Februart 2007 is bogus. At the most, only the term 'Wikinovel' was coined in February 2007, which brings me to my next point. If the concept was only, er, conceived in February then according to the article it can only be 16 days old at best, hardly enough time for something to have made it's way into general usage. I'd have to say <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for something made up in school one day. It doesn't say that policy only applies to the students in school. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 14:53, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thinking of it in terms of a 'term' and looking for 'widespread usage' is still thinking about it as a dictionary definition, which, admittedly, is how the article was originally written. But a dicdef isn't what a wikipedia article is supposed to be. We want to look at whether reliable sources are discussing the idea, which they are (see my&#160;!vote below, and the&#160;!vote between here and there for examples, as well as the ones on the talk page). This clearly suggests to me that it is a notable idea; it clearly meets the description at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, at least. BTW: I don't think something that <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penguin_Books_86fe.html" title="Penguin Books">Penguin Books</a> have sponsored can be described as "something made up in school one day", even if it is a student project. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 18:42, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, but it's clearly because of the concept of a wikinovel that this site has attracted attention.

<li>There are references on the page for private spaceflight that have the concept as their subject, so there's no question that it's notable.

<li>I kind of think of what is happening as similar to the discovery of the first <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extrasolar_planet.html" title="Extrasolar planet">extrasolar planet</a> or first extrasolar earthlike planet, which would lead to the whole class of objects possibly getting a wp article, even though all the news is only about the one that was discovered. Over time more would likely be discovered, and any important planets could get their own page. So to me, since one exists, people are going to be interested in what a wikinovel is. They are likely to ask a good encyclopedia, and right now, we have the beginings of an answer. If more form or become prominent, we will have more data points from which to talk about what these are (and thus answer UncleG), but right now with only one we don't have much to say, but it is better than nothing, it is interesting, and, to me, it is encyclopedic.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Of course it could turn out to be a fluke (evidence could show that there are no real extra solar earthlike planets) and after some time we could want to delete the article, or make it an article about a short lived meme or something. <a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/m/User_talk%7ESmmurphy_5e09.html" title="User talk:Smmurphy">Talk</a>)</sup> 17:54, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But as an encyclopaedia, we are not supposed to document things as they emerge - we are supposed to document things when they become notable. Wikipedia is not a news service, nor is it a collection of everything. If wikinovels do become notable, and it is perfectly possible that they will, to some degree that somebody actually writes something about wikinovels (and not about this or that example), then we can create an article. That's not to say there can't be a sentence or two at, for example, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a>, but it clearly has not been the <i>subject</i> of anything we can source at this point, and failing the primary notability guideline seems to preclude having its own article.

While there are enough sources for an article here, there's little point in having two separate articles until and unless there is another notable example. Some mention of this in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collaborative_fiction.html" title="Collaborative fiction">collaborative fiction</a> would also be appropriate, but merging the whole article there seems like <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecentism_cde3.html" title="Wikipedia:Recentism">Recentism</a>. <font face="Trebuchet MS, Trebuchet"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelithemis_923e.html" title="User talk:Celithemis"><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 02:51, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think merging is a good option; <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinovel.html" title="Wikinovel">Wikinovel</a> should be a seperate article. --<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParker007_4a88.html" title="User:Parker007">Parker007</a> 00:59, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Why?

<dd><s>No</s>, but can we document that A Million Penguins is the only one?

<li><b>Oppose merge</b> The problem with a merge to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collaborative_fiction.html" title="Collaborative fiction">Collaborative fiction</a> is that that article starts "Collaborative fiction is a form of writing by two or more authors who take it in turns to write a portion of the story." A wikinovel doesn't meet this definition, because it is not structured this way. I agree that it is a form of CF, but the CF article would have to be substantially rewritten for a merge to take place without introducing self-inconsistencies. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 15:27, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
