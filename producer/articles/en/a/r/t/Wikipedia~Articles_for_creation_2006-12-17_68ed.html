<p><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2003/12/16.html" class="external free" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2003/12/16.html" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2003/12/16.html</a> velleity \veh-LEE-uh-tee; vuh-\, noun: 1. The lowest degree of desire; imperfect or incomplete volition. 2. A slight wish or inclination.</p>
<p>To become now a priest was an elevation of sorts; yet the ceremony, as we would soon see, reinforced every contrast between the life he would lead and the life of the high and mighty, for whom the crowds roar and the bands play, courtiers and servants surrounding them to gratify the least velleity, historians on their toes to record their wispiest thought. -- William F. Buckley Jr., Nearer, My God</p>
<p>The ease of her words, the control of them, was meant to convey to Compton that her wish to know of her real parents was hardly more than a velleity, a thought that would come to one while watering a plant or peeling an orange. -- Thomas Savage, The Sheep Queen</p>
<p>He does not shout out his wishes or velleities, unless invited by his host to do so. -- Philip Howard, "Modern Manners", Times (London), September 15, 2003</p>
<p>Velleity is derived from Latin velle, "to will, to be willing, to wish."</p>

<p>Johnny Legend aka Martin Margoulies film maker (part of the collaborative effort that brought us "My Breakfast with Blassie" the pseudo documentary spoof featuring Andy Kaufman and the wrestler "Blassie", which was a spoof of "My dinner with Andre" , is also a well known performer of legendary Rockabilly Music.</p>
<p>He co- wrote "Pencil Neck Geek" with Pete Cicero. Pencil Neck Geek has appeared on Doctor Demento's top 100 novelty songs for many years, and still recieves airplay on indy radio, from time to time.</p>
<p>His film " Puke the Saliva Demon" , filmed in stop-motion/animated 8mm circa 67, is an early childhood anti-war film (vietnam war era) is consdered a cult film and a favorite of Quentin Trantino.</p>
<p>Johnny Legend has created over 300 films in his indy movie career, most have not seen or known by the general public, but with the invention of the internet, many are now surfacing in obscure online film sites. His films show also surface, from time to time, in similarly obscure "art film" , college student union themed cult film nites and other venues ...they often appear in mutli film art showings alongside of other obscure cullt classics (eraserhead...etc.).</p>
<p>His feature lenght films are pure indy edged art/ animated shorts... and it's sometimes difficult to figure out how serious he is, or is he yanking your chain... themes/ideas/ styles he says he used to study in his friend Andy Kaufman's comedy technigue....</p>
<p>He has created a few "porno" spoof films, one recently featured a combination of mexican mysterioso style wrestlers combined with industrial edged porn, it's uncertain if the film was meant to have any transformational affect, was it spoof in totality, or was it a serious contribution porno industry&#160;? Only Johnny Legend knows...</p>
<p>As a performer, his vocalizations seem like a characteristic you would find only from folks like Tom Waits or edgier punk-grunge-garage bands... He seems to have never strayed from a certain rawness of vocal style, often with a harmonica and a roar he'll launch off the stage and cruise among the dancers... stage antics and a sound that you can only find in various basement tapes of folks like Dylan, among others... His performing band holds to Rockabilly cliche, while remaining true to a certain improvization...his performance is more like cabaret/performance art/Andy Kaufman style in your face semi-serious, semi-spoof, yet intelligently contrived/delivered along with a sort of inside joke of humour... for that very edge which he defines, he seems to strive uniquely in each performance. It's a sort of Zen experience, "in the moment and in your face" and if you are there, you are part of it.... sort of like a living 3d interactive art work.</p>
<p>He has toured the world many times, performing as Johnny Legend, and, though he is a native of California surf /60's era LA, and was friends with a wide range of rock and roll rebel, (Dennis Wilson, and others), he is more recognised as a perfomer in Europe and Japan, than in the USA.</p>
<p>His on stage "edgy" antics are intenionally designed to break the conventional barriers between audience and performer, a style he partly credits with his times spent around Andy Kaufman, and Tex-Mex wrestling characters, who draw a certain power from challenging audience participation...</p>
<p>"Puke the Saliva demon", his 60's anti-war film also featured Lon Osgood, Steve Margulies (aka Steve Marlowe), and Pete Cicero among others... all LA hippie kids learning the ropes of LA rock era, many of which have peformed with a variety of early rock pioneers ttraveling through LA before it was the mecca for such a rock and roll melting pot.</p>
<p>"Puke the Saliva Demon" was featured as opener for the Leonard Cohen documentary "I'm Your Man" at a midwest community college in 2000.</p>
<p>A live Johnny Legend &amp; the Rockabilly Bastards concert was filmed at the cult "dive" nite- club "the Cactus Club" in San Jose which was closed forever, soon after ... (ARTintoLIFE.com studio production, access tv show, "the ToeKnee Show" circa 2003 you can find part of it on YOUtube).</p>

<p><b>The Galaxy Invader</b> is a financially and critically unsuccessful science fiction film, released in 1985 and directed by Don Dohler. The film notably included some of Dohler's relatives as part of the cast, including Greg Dohler (playing teenager, David Harmon), and Kim Dohler (playing the main villain's daughter, Anne Montague). The story, taking place in a fictitious town in Maryland, America, involves the hunting of an extraterrestrial alien by a group of locals, after the creature crash lands its ship in a nearby forest.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-17_68ed.html" title="Edit section: Plot Synopsis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Plot Synopsis</span></h2>
<p>The film begins with a satellite view of Earth, before a strange, meteor-like ball of fire is seen entering the planet's atmosphere. Following the opening credits being presented against a background of stars, the scene opens in the fictional town of Harleyville, Maryland, where a local youth, David Harmon, is driving his car along a dirt road. As he is driving towards a nearby forest, the ball of fire scene previously flies over David's vehicle, causing it to be engulfed in a ball of electricity before stopping in its tracks. As David emerges from his car, the ball of fire seemingly lands in the forest, causing a type of "dome-shaped" explosion upon its impact.</p>
<p>The camera then cuts to what appears to be the interior of the ball of fire (evidently being some kind of spaceship), seemingly being from the perspective of its occupant (at this point unseen). The occupant then emerges from the meteor, and strides through the foliage.</p>
<p>David proceeds to telephone his university doctor, William Tracy (an apparent UFO conspiracist), before telling him of his sighting. Doctor Tracy agrees to meet him in Harleyville.</p>
<p>The scene then cuts to a young couple eating breakfast in their house (presumably in the same forest that the UFO crashed in). After hearing a noise coming from their basement (caused by the occupant of the UFO, having entered their house), the couple enter the basement of their home, where the occupant (revealed to be a green coloured, somewhat scaly alien) proceeds to kill the two with its claws. The creature then proceeds to live the household.</p>
<p>The scene switches to the house of the Montagues, a family of locals. The family includes Joe, the controlling and superstitious father, Ethel, Joe's protestful wife, J.J., the family's only son, Carol, the family's eldest daughter, and Ann, the family's youngest daughter. After arguing with her father over her relationship with Michael Smith (due to Joe's failure to rob Michael's father of money), Carol runs out of the house, with an enraged Joe pursuing her with a rifle. At the desperate persuasion of Ethel, J.J. follows Joe, attempting to calm him.</p>
<p>During his pursuit of Carol, Joe encounters the alien in the forest. In panic, Joe shoots the creature several times with his weapon, causing the alien to drop a strange, sphere-shaped object it was carrying. J.J., having watched the complete event, is ordered by his father to return to the house with the object, whilst he contacts his colegaue, Frank Custer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Carol meets Michael at her rendezvous point, who swears to take drastic action should Joe threaten her again.</p>
<p>In the meantime, William arrives in Harleyville, where he meets with David. The two begin to proceed towards the crash site, agreeing that it would be best that the superstitious locals where not aware of their activity.</p>
<p>At the Montagues' household, Frank, along with his wife, Vickie, arrive in their car. After explaining to Frank the discovery of the sphere, along with the creature, Joe reveals that, when a switch is pressed that he discovered on the object, the sphere "powers up". Despite Joe's belief that the object could be sold for a high amount of money, Custer concludes that the alien itself would be of more value, and Joe agrees with his associate that the creature should be captured alive.</p>
<p>Afterwards, as J.J. is storing the sphere in the household's garage, he is distracted by noises coming from the home's side alleyway. After investigating the source of the noises, he is ambushed by the alien, who electocutes unconscious with a rod, before recovering the object.</p>
<p>That evening, Joe, Frank and Vicki go to a local bar, where they successfully convince several locals to assist them in hunting the creature later that night (at that point, not identifying to the locals that the "animal" they are planning to hunt is, in fact, an alien).</p>
<p>After leaving the bar and preparing for the locals to arrive, Joe discovers a still-unconscious J.J. in the alleyway, who, after awakening, tells his father of his losing of the sphere.</p>
<p>That night, after Custer and the recruited locals arrive at the Montagues' household, and after Joe and Frank reveal to the group the true identity of the "animal", the two Joe rally the locals.</p>
<p>In the meantime, David and Doctor Tracy, having retired to the local bar after being unable to reach the crash site before nightfall, overhear Vicki discussing Frank's plans to capture the creature with another patron. After offering Vicki a drink, David and the Doctor successfully get Vicki to inform them of the details of her husband's plans, and the two proceed to the forest.</p>
<p>The group of locals lead by Joe and Custer, having begun their expedition into the forest to capture the alien, eventually site the creature and chase it into the centre of the forest. The creature then fires on the group with a laser gun, killing many of the locals, whilst David and William watch from the bushes. Eventually, as some of the locals distract the creature, Frank approaches the alien from behind, capturing it a net before knocking it unconscious with his rifle. Joe, Custer and the surviving locals then proceed to drag the alien back to the Montagues' household, whilst David and Doctor Tracy leave, planning to free the subdued creature.</p>
<p>After Joe and Frank secure the bound alien in the Montagues' garage, and Custer's departure, Joe and J.J. test the creature's recovered laser gun in their basement, discovering that the powered-up object gives the weapon its power.</p>
<p>The following morning, David and the Doctor enter the Montagues' garage, and free the captured creature. David, William and the alien then escape from the Montagues' household, with Joe and Frank in pursuit.</p>
<p>Carol, having been brought to attention by sounds of the chase, takes the creature's laser gun and sphere, and after the alien becomes separated from David and Doctor Tracy, she returns the technology to the creature.</p>
<p>Joe and Custer find David and the Doctor, and Frank proceeds to shoot William, killing him. Custer is also about to shoot David, despite the protests of Joe, but the alien, having now obtained its laser gun, shoots Frank. David, panicked, runs away but Joe fires on the creature seemingly killing it. After taking the laser gun and object from the alien, Joe returns to the Montagues' household, as the creature shows signs of life.</p>
<p>Carol meets up with David, and after the two find Michael, explain to him the events that have transpired. Michael reassures the two that he will formulate a strategy, and advises Carol to simply return home that evening.</p>
<p>That night, Carol is awoken by strange lights emitting from the forest (possibly being generated by the alien's spaceship). After proceeding downstairs to the basement, she is confronted by the creature, who has entered the house. After the creature leaves the household, an alerted Ethel, Joe, J.J. and Anne find Carol, with Joe demanding to know what has happened.</p>
<p>The following morning, it becomes apparent that the entire Montague family has abandoned Joe and left the household, with Joe awaking to find nobody in the house.</p>
<p>The Montague family have, in fact, sided with David, Carol and Michael. Under David's advice that the alien is most likely looking for its laser gun and sphere, Michael decides that they will need to divert the attention of Joe as a means of subduing him, before obtaining the laser gun and object and returning them to the creature. Initially, Anne refuses to participate in the plan, but after the convincing and persuasion of her family and the others, she gives in and agrees to assist them.</p>
<p>Joe, having entered a state of drunkeness at the Montagues' household, remains asleep on the couch when Vicki arrives, concerned over the absence of Custer (having, unbeknownst to her, being killed by the alien). After Joe invites her into the house, he attempts to rape her, but after she escapes him and flees the house, an enraged Joe uses the creature's laser gun to shoot her, before removing her body.</p>
<p>After Joe falls asleep on the couch of the Montagues' household, the Montagues along with David and Michael enter the house, and remove the laser gun and sphere from his grip. Ethel, J.J. and Anne agree to stay and keep watch over Joe until he awakes, whilst David, Michael and Carol attempt to find the alien in the forest to return its laser gun and object.</p>
<p>Later, after the latter three have left the Montagues' household, Joe awakes and, despite the plees of Ethel, J.J. and Anne, strikes the three down and runs into the forest with his rifle, attempting to reclaim the stolen laser gun and sphere. Ethel, J.J. and Anne pursue him.</p>
<p>As they are attmpting to find the crash site of the creature's spaceship (believing that the alien will be there), David, Michael and Carol realize that they are being pursued by Joe, and attempt to flee into the forest.</p>
<p>Eventually, David, Michael and Carol are brought to a halt when their path is blocked by a type of crater (it is implied that the crater has been created by the creature's spaceship crash landing). Joe forces Michael to hand over to him the alien's laser gun and object, when suddenly the creature appears. A frightened Joe fires on the alien with his rifle, before shooting him with its laser gun, killing it.</p>
<p>Michael jumps on Joe, attempting to tackle him, as Ethel, J.J. and Anne arrive. Eventually, Joe grabs Michael in a stranglehold over the edge of the crater, attempting to kill him. As he does so, however, Ethel picks up Joe's rifle, and in a slow motion montage, proceeds to hit her husband over the head with the weapon, knocking him over the edge of the crater and killing him.</p>
<p>The film ends with a montage of images, including the looks of grief and sadness on the faces of David, Michael, Ethel, J.J., Carol and Anne, before cutting to the bodies of Joe and the creature.</p>

<p>Recently established in December, 2006, the Australian lesbian high school couple was involved in a t.A.T.u. inspired short video. This video received mixed reviews on the popular video broadcasting website YouTube and received an honor within two hours of its upload.</p>
<p>Andy and Ippy met each other in a government school in Australia and became friends on their first day at school. It is believed that they had sat under a leaky school roof on their first day and Andy told Ippy she looked beautiful - from there their relationship evolved to what it is today.</p>
<p>Over the years Andy struggled very hard with a variety of identity and sexuality issues – she was initially in denial of her sexuality in 7th grade, but gradually came to accept herself for who she was after breaking up with boyfriends she did not care for. Ippy, however, still struggles with her sexuality even today. She has grown more accepting of feeling attracted to her own sex, and finally agreed to appear in the short film “Andy &amp; Ippy”, uploaded on YouTube.</p>
<p>The film’s director, Bb, first conjured the idea after hearing t.A.T.u.’s first hit single, “All The Things She Said” on an Australian radio station in early 2006. The director is friends with the young couple and watched as her friends struggled to exist in an environment that could not accept this kind of love. After many months, Bb decided to make a short film based on the young couple. However she knew that her film could not be extremely serious for fears of discomfort by the viewers of the video and her own friends and family. After viewing Barry Levinson’s “Wag the Dog”, Bb came up with the idea of expressing the issue of lesbianism in high school through satire. The realistic, grainy filming used in “Wag the Dog”, Bb applied also to “Andy &amp; Ippy”. She shot the entire film using a Motorola phone, and edited the final product with Final Cut Pro. This, along with the spontaneous acting of the couple, added to the satirical and realistic feel to the film.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, this will evolve into a series,” she says. “The issue here isn’t just a funny little film. We’re trying to make people be more accepting of homosexuality. It’s kind of like Thelma and Louise meets Elephant.”</p>
<p>The couple has agreed to shoot “Andy &amp; Ippy, Vol. 2” at a party and upload it once again on YouTube in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>"Exquisite with Wonder" or "Exquisite with a Sense of Wonder" is a photograph of a young man (supposedly of African descent) with dark brown skin and light green eyes and wearing a white cap. The image has appeared throughout the web on various image hostin sites as well as stock photo sites. The picture was origianlly exhibited at the computer arts web site forum, posted by a member, and circulated from there through MySpace layouts and Flikr's.</p>
<p>The image shows a young male looking directly into the camera wide-eyed and emotionless, yet at the same time full of mysterious emotion. The lips at distant view show a hint of a smile, while the expression in the eyes can be seen as wondering, puzzeled, or even a little upset.</p>
<p>The picture was most likely taken with a digital camera, and even more likely edited through photoshop or other photo editing software, but has not been confirmed by anyone. The photographer is unknown at this time as well as the date the photo was taken, age, or identity of the young man seen in the photograph.</p>

<p>Radio Yako is the first ever website that is dedicated to playing Malawian music and programmes.</p>
<p>It is run from Florida by RadioYako LLP of Florida, USA. RadioYako is currently owned by Chimwemwe Ncozana although Malawian Investors are trying to be brought into the picture.</p>
<p>The online radio station is particularly popular with Malawians who are living abroad and want to listen to familiar music from home. England, U.S.A, Canada and Australia and among the many countries where website is often visited.</p>
<p>At the moment the programmes are not broadcast live but are recorded and cannot be paused or fast fowarded.</p>
<p>Also, due to the fact that it is not run from Malawi means the songs are not extremely recent.</p>
<p>Sources:</p>
<p>According to the website www.radioyako.com, the wesbitesmain objective is to "reach and entertain Malawians and friends of Malawi regardless of their location on the globe. We are also interested in promoting Malawian music and musicians so that they can extend their market for music".</p>

<p>The <i><b>circumzenithal arc</b></i>, also called the <i>Bravais' arc</i> and abbreviated <i>CZA</i>, is an optical phenomenon similar in appearance to a <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rainbow.html" title="Rainbow">rainbow</a> and arising from <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refraction.html" title="Refraction">refraction</a> of sunlight through non-terminated, horizontally-oriented <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_crystals.html" title="Ice crystals">ice crystals</a> in certain <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloud.html" title="Cloud">clouds</a>. It takes the shape of one-quarter of a circle centered at the <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zenith.html" title="Zenith">zenith</a> and parallel to the <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horizon.html" title="Horizon">horizon</a>, on the same side as the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">sun</a>. Its colors run from blue near the zenith to red towards the horizon; it is one of the brightest and most colorful <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo.html" title="Halo">halos</a>.</p>
<p>The light that forms the CZA enters an ice crystal through its horizontal top face and exits through a vertical side face (the angle of separation must be 90°). This means that it occurs only when the sun is at a lower altitude than 32.2° above the horizon. The CZA is brightest when the sun is at 22° above the horizon (causing sunlight to enter and exit the crystals at the minimum deviation angle), and then it is about 22° in radius, 3° in width, and tangent to the 46° halo (if it is present). However, the CZA can have any radius between 32.2° and 0°, but at either of these points it is vanishingly faint.</p>

<p>Ashley Swift was born on December 10, 1988. She is currently a senior at Berkner High school, in Richardson, Texas. There she is a member of the National Honor Society and the Berkner Band which recently just received the honor of ninth in state at the 5A Texas State Marching Contest. After she graduates she plans to attend Southern Methodist University, in Dallas Texas, where she just got accepted. Currently she plans on majoring in advertising and minoring in journalism. Ashley is residing with her family of four. Her sister attends SMU and after she graduates she plans on becoming a teacher. Ashley loves taking pictures, and is known to take to many. Lastertag is currently her passion, in which she owns at.</p>
<p>At Berkner, she is currently enrolled in English IV, Pre-Cal, Symphonic II Band, Economics, and Spanish Four. Her grades are decent. Her favorite class is currently English; not for the challenging work she does because God knows she doesn’t get any in that class, but because they get to write, something she loves to do. Ashley recently tried out for the All-Region band, but did not make second phase, which was not a shock to anyone.</p>
<p>Ashley loves to drive, although many people think she is a careless and wreckless driver, which she likes to call “defensive driving.” She loves her friends, and family, and taking pictures with her sister. Ashley is currently planning a trip to New York City after she graduates because that has been her dream forever, where she plans to fall in love with the city and move there after she graduates college. Someday she wants people to write about her for real, and actually have to have people look up information on her for the countless number of papers, books, and articles that will be written on her in years to come.</p>

<p>Jack Tafari</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Jack Tafari, born 1946 in Gravesend, Kent, UK portland.indymedia.org/en/2005/05/318109.shtml</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Jack Tafari is an activist who has focused on improving the conditions of the homeless in the developed world.</p>
<p>Tafari currently lives in London, UK, where he is coordinating the activities of the Homeless Front of the UK (HFUK) (see <a href="http://squat.net/homelessfront/?q=home" class="external free" title="http://squat.net/homelessfront/?q=home" rel="nofollow">http://squat.net/homelessfront/?q=home</a>). The Homeless Front UK comprises a collective of homeless Londoners who seek to create a tent city as a sanctuary for themselves and for other Londoners without shelter. The ‘tent city’ they envisage will be drug and alcohol free; a safe and secure place where homeless people can live while they seek work and make the transition to more permanent housing.</p>
<p>In the UK there are an estimated 400,000 ‘hidden homeless’ without a roof over their heads. In December 2006 the Homeless Front UK’s initiated its Out of the Doorways Campaign to empower and house some of these. As of December 15, 2006, the nascent HFUK has so far housed 11 of London’s ‘rough sleepers’.</p>
<p>Jack Tafari pioneered the concept of the ‘sanctioned tent city’ in Portland, USA, between 2000 and 2004 by spearheading the creation of Dignity Village. Now Tafari and his group want to “replicate Dignity” in London, creating a flagship, eco friendly tent city as a model for other UK cities where homelessness is a problem.</p>
<p>The Portland, Oregon ‘Out of the Doorways Campaign’</p>
<p>In December 2000 Tafari was a ‘rough sleeper’, surviving on the frozen ground beneath bridges and in doorways in Portland, USA. There weren’t enough shelter spaces for all of Portland’s homeless, and Tafari found himself sharing the streets with crowds of others, including for example, legless, wheelchair bound veteran John Reese (<a href="http://www.outofthedoorways.org/about/johnreese.html" class="external free" title="http://www.outofthedoorways.org/about/johnreese.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.outofthedoorways.org/about/johnreese.html</a>). Tafari decided that something needed to be done.</p>
<p>With seven others Tafari began occupying city properties and pitching tents. “… confronted by police for their unlicensed use of public land, the initial group of eight men and women had the benefit of a forceful voice in the person of homeless activist Jack Tafari, and the early support of a few local politicians and associated coverage in the local media. The Portland police department eventually realized that the group, then calling themselves Camp Dignity, was engaged in complicated Constitutional issues of redress of grievance, and deferred the political issue to the local political authority: The Portland City Council and Mayor.” (Wikipedia, ‘Dignity Village’).</p>
<p>In early confrontations with the Portland police Tafari discovered a way to advance his cause, using a combination of new technologies and traditional media. To ‘sweep’ Camp Dignity, the police were required to serve twenty-four hours notice. Tafari started writing press releases and distributing them by email, using the Internet facilities of Portland public libraries. His group put their things in shopping carts and, led by their wheelchair cases, they were ‘moved on’ by the police from place to place. John Reese was elected as ‘Grand Marshall’, and as a result of extensive media coverage their ‘shopping cart parades’ became internationally celebrated.</p>
<p>The final shopping cart parade, which took place on Martin Luther King Day, 2001, included more than 50 shopping carts and was headed up by 12 in wheelchairs. It attracted nation wide media coverage, and the spectacle of armed policemen herding a group of the indigent made for compelling viewing.</p>
<p>After this event, Tafari wrote a final press release, headlined “We’re having a Big Parade” and provided the city of Portland with an advance copy. Portland forthwith granted Camp Dignity a site at the Sunderland Recycling Yard outside Portland, and this particular press release was never sent.</p>
<p>Throughout the ‘Out of the Doorways Campaign’ years, Tafari was a staff writer and submissions editor for the Portland street newspaper Street Roots, and he used this position to publicise his cause among the homeless. The following passage, from an article published by Tafari in the December 2000 issue, is a good example of the agit/prop Tafari wrote to rally Portland’s homeless to his cause: Excerpted from ‘The Future’ by Jack Tafari Today we live in a time of social transformation… a new informational age and a time of economic globalization. It is a time of social dislocation. Today the economy is booming and so is the homeless population. What we see around us now in the downtown core of our cities is homeless people wall-to-wall. Many of the jobs that paid anything have gone south or elsewhere or are now done by machines. Today the cost of space in our cities to live in is climbing beyond the reach of many low-income people. And today homeless people are harried and harassed, run from here to there, taxed by fines, commodified and used as a resource, sometimes brutalized, occasionally felonized and often used as slave labour by the prison industry. You know what they say: the good can't rest and the wicked never sleep. Not, of course, that ev'ry one of we is good. But we are human beings and we do not deserve the treatment we receive at the hands of wicked men. Very soon now we shall pitch the tents of Joshua on various sites around the city. We are blessed here in Oregon with ample public land and so there is space if not a place for us to go. We must build that place for ourselves. Know that the kernel of the future lies buried in the present. It is important for the future how we set up and govern our camps now. We have many friends. There are those who would fight against we, workers of iniquity who profit from our situation and would rather things remain the way they are. It is time to be of good courage, brothers and sisters. We may wander for a time in the wilderness. But as surely as night follows day, one day we shall reach a land flowing with milk and honey. ( <a href="http://www.outofthedoorways.org/about/jacktafari.html" class="external free" title="http://www.outofthedoorways.org/about/jacktafari.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.outofthedoorways.org/about/jacktafari.html</a>)</p>
<p>From ‘Out of the Doorways’ to Dignity Village</p>
<p>Dignity Village began as group of tents pitched in a leaf-composting yard in 2001. It has evolved since into a ‘green’ eco friendly village housing 60 formerly homeless people in a safe and secure environment. The tents are gone, replaced by a variety of ‘not to code’ buildings.</p>
<p>There are now houses of many kinds in Dignity Village, from Portland's first straw bale house built during the Village Building Convergence (VBC) in 2003 to the five light straw/clay infill (cob) houses begun and mostly completed during and after VBC 2004. Dignity probably has the largest collection of environmentally friendly cob houses in the Pacific Northwest. (Street Spirit, March 2005, <a href="http://www.thestreetspirit.org/March2005/dignity.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.thestreetspirit.org/March2005/dignity.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestreetspirit.org/March2005/dignity.htm</a>) A donated bus serves as a library, a windmill provides electricity and the villagers grow their own organic vegetables. The village is self-governed, drug and alcohol free, and built around principals of respect for self and others.</p>

( <a href="http://www.dignityvillage.org/content/" class="external free" title="http://www.dignityvillage.org/content/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dignityvillage.org/content/</a>) 
</pre>
<p>Dignity Village is set up as a self-governing entity, and residents are bound by these rules of behavior, contained in their membership agreement. · No violence toward yourself or others. · 2. No illegal substances or alcohol or paraphernalia on the premises or within a one-block radius. · 3. No stealing. · 4. Everyone contributes to the upkeep and welfare of the village and works to become a productive member of the community. · 5. No disruptive behavior of any kind that disturbs the general peace and welfare of the village. (Wikipedia, Dignity Village)</p>
<p>Dignity Village has since been imitated elsewhere by other homeless people, as far away as Osaka, Japan. Dignity Village is incorporated in Oregon as a 501(c)(3) membership-based non-profit organization, and is governed by bylaws[2] and a board of directors with an elected chairman and other corporate officers. (Wikipedia, ‘Dignity Village’). Tafari was the Chairman of Dignity Village Inc. from 2001 until 2003 and thereafter the Vice Chairman in 2004. Dignity Village has generated considerable international interest as a possible means of ameliorating, if not solving, the problem of developed world homelessness. The Village has featured in articles in London’s Guardian Newspaper America’s Homeless Become New Small-Town Pioneers, October 24, 2003 (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1069796,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1069796,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1069796,00.html</a>); and the New York Times, Home for the Homeless, But Can It Continue? October 5, 2003, for example.</p>
<p>In 2004 Tafari was invited to London to address the Crisis Innovations Fair on the subject of homelessness and possible solutions. He shared the podium there with Dr. Michael Woolcock, Senior Social Scientist with the World Bank.

<p>In 1980 when the Interstate Commerence Commission (ICC) was deregulated, transportation in the Reno &amp; Lake Tahoe area got much better. A new company was established by Gary Neal Pierce named the Reno-Tahoe Tour Company. The goal of Mr. pierce was to start new transportation routes between the Reno Airport and the Lake Tahoe ski resorts. Authority was granted in September of 1981 under license number MC-151690 by the I.C.C. <a href="http://members.aol.com/gpierce513/page12.html" class="external free" title="http://members.aol.com/gpierce513/page12.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.aol.com/gpierce513/page12.html</a> Gary Neal Pierce has operated this company for over 25 years and still maintains the same quality service it was founded on. Today Mr. Pierce also operates a website at <a href="http://RenoTahoeAirport.com" class="external free" title="http://RenoTahoeAirport.com" rel="nofollow">http://RenoTahoeAirport.com</a> which provides up-to-the-minute information on Reno Airport conditions.</p>
