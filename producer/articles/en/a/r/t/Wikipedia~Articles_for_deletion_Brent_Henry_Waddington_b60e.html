<li>Elaborating on <b>Possible Hoax</b>: Alakon's comments not withstanding, further web searches make it seem more likely to be a hoax. Paradox Group, as a publishing company in Madison WI does not show up on a basic search, nor in their CoC. Further antedotal evidence of hoax: (1) Trout connection: a Waddington (not BH) has written a report on Trout; and (2) Game connection: Waddington Games (UK) had the first international rights to the game Monopoly. Even though the article notes authorship of book (which is not verified), ther are no references to the game theory aspect. And, this person's political aspirations and places of residence are non-notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> In the first version of the article I mention his plans for launching a 2008 campaign in Monroe Country. On seeing some of the feedback in this discussion I removed it, as I agreed it was not yet notable. I will now remove the reference to US Politican - my mistake. But I hope you can see why BHW would not be widely discussed in the politican context, as he's not currently well-known.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Simply the number of edits that Alakon is applying to this AfD suggests vanity. The article describes the book as <i>well regarded</i> - but by whom, pray, if no one has yet seen a copy? Reconsider if anyone actually reviews his book or he ever gets elected to the Monroe County executive.-- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 11:16, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. A fairly exhaustive search suggests this guy has no peer-reviewed published articles and that this is a hoax. (I'm open to changing my mind if Alakon provides relevant links.) I note that there is a Brent Waddington at the University of Rochester; BWH is said to reside in Rochester, NY: <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/pr/Review/V68N1/feature2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rochester.edu/pr/Review/V68N1/feature2.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. BW is apparently due to graduate in 2008, which coincides with BWH's alleged political ambitions.

<li>Bowker says ISBN will take 1-3 days to update. It is not currently listed because ISBN entry was mistakenly entered too recently (the publisher, to be honest, isn't the most efficent). It should be up by Monday night, though it may be Wednesday at the latest. However the ISBN publisher prefix is current and verifiable. It has a strange title, yes, but it's a real book from a real publisher. It will be for sale at Amazon, B&amp;N, and other bookstores by the end of the week.

<li><b>Comment</b> Interesting, but I'm still sticking to my theory that this is a conspiracy by a poetry group. The sole google result for "Brent Henry Waddington" is now <a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:IT4UvUkRJXoJ:www.anylit.com/+%22brent+henry+waddington%22&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:IT4UvUkRJXoJ:www.anylit.com/+%22brent+henry+waddington%22&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">this cached page</a> (no longer on the active page) which bizarrely lists <i>the Wikipedia page</i> on Brent Henry Waddington as one of the advertising sponsors of www.anylit.com , a poetry forum website owned by Paradox Inc., Wisconsin which Alakon initially suggested was the publisher of Waddington's game theory book, but which I pointed out was actually a <a href="http://www.paradoxinc.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.paradoxinc.org/" rel="nofollow">poetry website group</a> (see above).</li>
</ul>
<p>A poetry group may have access to the ISBN / amazon registration service of a publisher. On the other hand, this may be a publicity stunt for a real book called Trout which is actually a poetry book. But I still don't buy that this is a real game theory book<a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:45, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>1/ The Paradox Inc. poetry nonprofit has a staff webpage which lists an "A.

<p>2. But this Alkon seems to have a taste for fakes or hoaxes.

This site comes complete with a link to a real initial SEC registration (i.e. basic paperwork), but apparently has no information or real webpages at all beyond a pure text legal notice.

Overtech Technologies is a small-time (student run?) local webhosting outfit to which the person Alkon was appointed an Executive Director and Vice President of (possibly as a joke) as you can see on the <a href="http://overtechtechnologies.com/blog/?p=189" class="external text" title="http://overtechtechnologies.com/blog/?p=189" rel="nofollow">Overtech "corporate" blog</a>. In Fiscal Year 2004, Overtech claimed to have achieved a <a href="http://overtechtechnologies.com/blog/?p=4" class="external text" title="http://overtechtechnologies.com/blog/?p=4" rel="nofollow">net profit of 916 dollars, 82 cents</a></p>

<li>Waddington might not be the leading figure in the Game Theory field, but this new introduction sets standards for clarity and quality. I know I'll be using it in my courses, and I believe many of my colleagues will as well.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlakon_0d9a.html" title="User:Alakon">Alakon</a> 04:23, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Please take a look at the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html#Literature" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">precedents for deletion</a> page</b>, in particular the literature section, which says <b><i>"Authors and writers are notable if they have released a book (other than through vanity press)"</i></b> - in case you are wondering, Paradox is not a vanity/subsidy press because Waddington has not paid a fee to have the work published. ERcheck- I'll provide supporting documentation if you'd like, but I'm not sure what is appropiate and how exactly I go about showing it to you. Let me know.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlakon_0d9a.html" title="User:Alakon">Alakon</a> 04:23, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Almost any information would be useful. Links to the publisher's page (I can't find it), links to scholarly articles by this person, links to academic institutions at which he holds posts, links to anyone who will sell the book. As it stands I am able to find no information on this person at all, nor on the book, and it looks hoax-ish. I am perfectly willing to reconsider if it is sourced, but if you have anything at all to back up the contents of the article, now would be a great time. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 04:44, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not sure that re-organizing the votes was a good idea; it is, at least, very unusual. "delete as per nom" means just what it says -- the nominator's logic is good enough to support the delete vote. I'll hold a vote for a day or so and see if sources are forthcoming. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 04:47, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> per nominator and arguments above as to lack of verifiability and lack of notability. Even if it is not strictly a vanity publisher, it appears to be a very obscure publisher or possibly a type of self-publication. Even if this is not a hoax, the lack of collaterla references and citations show that the subject is not a notable figure in the field. (I am also very dubious about the ISBN issue. I have worked in publishing and bookselling, and in trade publication (that is, not vanity or self-publication), the ISBN of a book is available for ordering purposes typically 1-3 <i>months</i> in advance of publication, often 6 months in advance.) <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 22:58, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You clearly haven't read the new additions to this discussion since you last posted. We *did* check the Amazon link - an Amazon page and a ISBN number is not final proof, as Amazon allows self-listing of titles and images as seen on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/catalog-guide/guide/-/372286/102-9935256-5241736" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/catalog-guide/guide/-/372286/102-9935256-5241736" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, and presumably the esteemed Vice President of a poetry company knows how to register an ISBN. And on a google search on your background, it appears that you enjoy hoaxes with your college buddies. the user Fn = Alkon.

<li><b>comment</b> "waddington trout" gets beaucoup Google hits. A little investigation suggests that a "Waddington" is the body of a type of lure, to which a treble hook is usually attached. This in itself doesn't prove that the book is a hoax; the author could have picked "Waddington" as a pen name for the connection with trout, or it could be a coincidence. It's mainly the alleged connection with game theory that keeps the alarm bells ringing. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 18:04, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
