<li>Comment: these words appear to have been randomly chosed to represent this "vowel merge", relevant google hits appear to be wikipedia mirrors. I believe it is describing a real phenomenon, so this might be merged or renamed. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:24, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>An earlier anon today put a VfD notice on <a href="../../../f/a/t/Father-bother_merger.html" title="Father-bother merger">father-bother merger</a>, then deleted it himself and redirected the article to Fucking father-bother merger. Since the current anon did not give any reason or complete the VfD process I am removing the VfD notice as vandalism. The same anon IP that nominated this page vandalized <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippie.html" title="Hippie">Hippie</a> a few hours earlier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hippie&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10467997" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hippie&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10467997" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (but possibly not the same person).</p>
<p>See Category:English pronunciation mergers, there are a couple dozen similar "pronunciation merger" articles here. Too many to merge into a single article, and each of them could eventually be expanded to give more detail about the geographic extent of each pronunciation and its history, including maps and perhaps even Ogg media files with actual audio pronunciations.</p>
<p>If someone else wishes to legimitately re-nominate this article, they can of course do so. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 01:31, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>There were a whole load of these that came in all at the same time. See Category:English pronunciation mergers. Also see the edits to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a> from the same author. There were a whole load of "yod dropping before X" articles (see <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Yod-dropping_22a1.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Yod-dropping">Special:Whatlinkshere/Yod-dropping</a>) that came in at around the same time, too. They were all merged to <a href="../../../y/o/d/Yod-dropping.html" title="Yod-dropping">Yod-dropping</a>. Basically, all of the specific list items from the phonology section of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a> have been broken out into their own articles.<br />
Since, like the yod droppings, these have relevance outside of U.S. English, I'm with <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a>: <s>either</s> <b>Merge</b> all of the vowel merger articles to <s><a href="../../../v/o/w/Vowel_merger.html" title="Vowel merger">Vowel merger</a></s> <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonemic_differentiation.html" title="Phonemic differentiation">phonemic differentiation</a> <s>or <b>Keep</b></s>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:49, 2005 Feb 21 (UTC)</li>
<li>I replaced the VfD tag because I think it's a valid nomination. I have no vote until I look into it more carefully.

Although the list of "mergers" recently added to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a> looks like it may well require some serious revision — my strong suspicion is that many of them, such as "<a href="../../../y/o/d/Yod-dropping.html" title="Yod-dropping">yod-dropping</a>", are historically bogus, and assume the prescriptionist tradition of southern England's boarding-school English as both normative and deeply rooted in history — this isn't the place to decide any of these issues. -- <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 04:35, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Not sure</b>. On the one hand, I support the idea of keeping these "pronunciation merger" articles; on the other hand, Google seems to come up empty on this precise term "Sirius-serious". Some other ones are very well known, eg, <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cot-caught_merger.html" title="Cot-caught merger">cot-caught merger</a>. So if this merger is real and notable, it seems to be known under some other name. The expert out there seems to be <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Labov_e0da.html" title="William Labov">William Labov</a>, who in 2005 is publishing the <i>Atlas of North American English</i>. His website is here: <a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phonoatlas/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phonoatlas/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> (and I would support deleting any similar material) Very minor mispronunciation. What if we had an article for every mispronunciation in every language, region, dialect, accent, speech impediment, etc? Very unlikely this will be searched for by name. Also impossible for this to evolve beyond a substub. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:14, Feb 21, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>These aren't mispronunciations. Nor are they minor. These are genuine dialectical differences. The pronunciation guide of the OED1 tacitly acknowledged similar vowel differences and mergers to these, as a matter of fact. (It had different symbols for vowels that, although pronounced the same in one dialect, were pronounced differently in others.) The main questions are (a) whether these are the widely-accepted names of these differences, and (b) whether these differences would be better off grouped into a single article on <a href="../../../v/o/w/Vowel_merger.html" title="Vowel merger">vowel mergers</a> or <a href="../../../v/o/w/Vowel_shift.html" title="Vowel shift">vowel shifts</a>, to give context. <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> seems to think that the answer to the latter is that they would not. However, from looking around a bit at existing articles, there seems to be some duplication going on here. All of the yod-droppings were definite merger candidates. I was initially less sure of the vowel mergers, but am becoming more convinced. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:41, 2005 Feb 21 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think the term "pronunciation merger" is used in linguistics to define this. I would vote to merge all those articles into the same place, but I'm not sure where. Perhaps a Phonology of American English? <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> 01:01, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I thought of breaking out the phonology section of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a>, too.

<li>Yes, the term "merger" really is used in linguistics. See the website of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Labov_e0da.html" title="William Labov">William Labov</a>, mentioned above. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 03:55, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agreed; "merger" is indeed used to describe the levelling of two formerly discrete phonemes in linguistics. I do question the factual accuracy of this particular merger, especially given that it is named for two non-native inkhorn terms: to demonstrate the reality of this phenomenon, it would be necessary to show that <i><a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirius.html" title="Sirius">Sirius</a></i> was a name on everybody's lips, and that it had a historically attested pronunciaiton different from <i>serious</i> that once existed most everywhere but was lost in certain dialects. The historical primacy and unaltered purity of certain varieties of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_English_ebb4.html" title="British English">British English</a> seem to be the assumption he's working from.

<li>I've consulted a second source, namely [<a href="http://www.bipolarworld.net/Bipolar%20Disorder/Articles/art14.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.bipolarworld.net/Bipolar%20Disorder/Articles/art14.htm" rel="nofollow">bipolarworld.net</a>. I belive this gives the list extra validity. However, due to the nature of Bipolar disorder it is inevitable that this list is going to be questionable, therefore I have added in the article an admission of this:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"The nature of the condition means it is near impossible to obtain an definative list of bipolar persons, hence this is a list of those that are believed to be so. The fact that it contains many artistic geniuses can be interpreted in two ways, either that bipolar disorder occurs fequently in artistic geniuses or that people frequently associate mental disorder with genius in error, not understanding the nature of the gift."</p>
<p>I believe the list can be interpreted as a mirror on popular perception of bipolar disorder and not necessarily a definative list and such warrent its ambiguous title.</p>
<p>Furthermore I have excluded any living persons from the list to avoid controversy <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukeSurl_8333.html" title="User:LukeSurl">LukeSurl</a> 20:33, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Whatever the sources, it should still be <b>deleted</b>. I just looked at the pages referenced from which appear equally "highly speculative and inaccurate". For one reason or other most mental health pressure groups appear to collect spuriously referenced lists of highly speculative nature of famous people suffering their particular illness/condition. Probably worth an article...Beethoven turns up on every such list, whether autistic/ asperger, bipolar whatever, probably he was just an alcoholic, Schumann suffered from tertiary syphilis and not BPI(as per reference provided, etc, Again, please <b>delete</b> asap.<a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 20:42, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, these lists are collected by those with a vested interest but doesn't that increase this articles validity on how Bipolar disorder is percieved? Perhaps the page could be <b>moved</b> to <i>List of people <b>claimed</b> to have been affected by bipolar disorder</i> with a brief discussion on the bias of said organisations?<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukeSurl_8333.html" title="User:LukeSurl">LukeSurl</a> 21:05, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Furthermore, bipolarity and alcholism or syphillus are not mutually exclusive. Biopolarity, switching from depression to manic may be a cause, or an effect of alcholism, Schumann's syphillus may have caused a bipolar nature. "Bipolar disorder" was previously called "manic depression", and is therefore much easier to speculate on than first appears. For a person to have Bipolar II disorder requires only one major depressive episode in their lives. This is possible to determine with reasonable accuracy from historical records. Yes, if this is to be closer to a definate list then it should be reviewed on a case by case basis, but not deleted. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukeSurl_8333.html" title="User:LukeSurl">LukeSurl</a> 22:54, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><i>This is possible to determine with reasonable accuracy from historical records</i> This is wrong. While the criteria are laid out in stuff like [[ICD 10] ]and <a href="../../../d/s/m/DSM_IV_2543.html" title="DSM IV">DSM IV</a>, any such diagnosis requires huge medical skills, is often in doubt for a long time and may need to be revised at some stage.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would like to see the opinion of a specialist on this article. After the cleanup, the issue seems to be merely whether or not the list is speculative. I'm no psychiatrist, but one or two books I've read by very notable authorities on this field gave me the impression it is not really considered speculation to produce a diagnosis based only on historical data, or even in fictional material. By the way, Ben Stiller is still listed with no indication of source. <a href="../../../v/m/v/User%7EVmv_bc84.html" title="User:Vmv">vlad_mv</a> 01:14, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm not very happy with the "cleanup." The so-called sources are web pages which themselves are very poorly sourced. The NAMI list is simply a list of people with "mental illness." The current page includes Faulkner, gives <a href="http://www.bipolarworld.net/Bipolar%20Disorder/Articles/art14.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.bipolarworld.net/Bipolar%20Disorder/Articles/art14.htm" rel="nofollow">BPW</a> as the source, but notes that Faulkner was "alcoholic." The BPW does list him as "bipolar" but really presents no evidence or sources at all.

<li>Why, exactly? It would be much more useful here in the Wikipedia. I read over what should be in Wikisource and I don't believe this fits the criterion.

<li>This is a clearly different case to <a href="../../../f/e/i/Feist_v._Rural_4040.html" title="Feist v. Rural">Feist v. Rural</a> - I believe that this is copyrightable as a collection of information. In Feist v. Rural, the names and addresses of telephone subscribers were a simple matter of fact. This is someone's opinion on what are the 500 Greatest Rock 'n Roll Songs, and I believe as such is copyrightable. "Information [...] cannot contain any of the "expressive" content added by the source author. That includes not only the author's own comments, but also his choice of which facts to cover, [...] his order of presentation (unless it is something obvious like an alphabetical list), any evaluations he may have made about the quality of various pieces of information, or anything else that might be considered "original creative work" of the author rather than mere facts." - the <a href="../../../f/e/i/Feist_v._Rural_4040.html" title="Feist v.

<li><b>Delete</b> under this name. Rolling Stone has just published a list of its greatest 500 songs and it is a common radio statio feature. There have been two run in Canberra in the past year.

<p>Apparent re-creation of a deleted article. I don't know if this is different enough from the original to warrant a new VfD, or anything. Reading articles like this hurts my very soul, so I have no read it in its entirety, nor do I remember the deleted article enough to compare the two. I'd vote delete or merge, just because thats how I feel about basically all Poke- or Digi- mon, so I don't expect to be heeded on that basis. But I think this line from the article's conlcusion is wirth noting "It's safe to say this character will never make it into any Digimon movie or episode".

<p>I AGREE!!!</p>
<p>PLEASE READ FIRST:</p>
<p>Wikipaedia decision maker. Jason Frost was a Sunshine Bandmember withMajor label, KC &amp; Sunshine Band, as well as an important part of rock n roll history in Olympia-Seattle area, who continues to create music for his devoted fans like myself. You can check here, as well as the many, many, links thoughout this page on his newspaper articles, press, artist pages, and movie film database on major film, etc. He is notable. Android79 has done nothing but angered me and played games and muddied up this page.</p>
<p>A search for "jason frost kc &amp; sunshine band" turned up folowwing results: MTV listings: <a href="http://www.mtv.com/movies/person/337491/personmain.jhtml" class="external free" title="http://www.mtv.com/movies/person/337491/personmain.jhtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.mtv.com/movies/person/337491/personmain.jhtml</a></p>
<p>(The star next to his name means he is notable to MTV!!!)</p>
<p>Wikipaedia requires for a band or artist personality to be listed he must have been a member of a notable band, KC &amp; Sunshine Band, had hits like "get down tonight" and others. His being a member of this band makes him notable, even though I find this the least notable of his accomplishments. I vote to KEEP his other related band entries! - Timk</p>
<p>See discussion under JASON FROST deletion where numerous links are posted as well verifing the notability of this artist for his fans...</p>

<li>Actually, it would be detrimental. The important words are "proper article". An encyclopaedia is not simply a directory. It contains <i>knowledge</i>, not mere information. To be worthy of a "proper article", an entity that is one of thousands (or, as in this case one of hundreds of thousands if not millions) has to stand out from the crowd for some reason. There has to be something more than can be inferred from the fact that it is a school (and thus has all of the things that that entails, such as enrollment, teachers, songs, crests, buildings, sports teams, and so forth). <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_schools_in_Connecticut_6c1b.html" title="High schools in Connecticut">High schools in Connecticut</a>, before its deletion, showed how large numbers of entities with lack of individual notability can be handled.

<li><i>The reasons why notable schools get deleted while articles about fictional bus drivers get kept is due to systematic bias</i> — That is a flawed argument that assumes the erroneous premise that the schools actually <i>are</i> notable.

School articles get deleted because there is nothing of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">importance</a> to say about the schools and the articles are tantamount to directory entries. <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:06, 2005 Feb 21 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Notabillity is a POV, which is sculpted by systematic bias. You have the bias that schools are not notable as your POV, but realize that there are other people who think that they are notable. If you don't think that they are notable then don't read them, but getting them deleted and denying the people who do think they are notable to write about them is bad. Thats why deletionists are bad for the Wikipedia project and they must change their ways. Think KEEP, make Wikipedia more comprehensive and therefore useful, or a merge and redirect to an article in your POV is notable enough to include. For exmaple, a few weeks ago, someone wrote an article about <b>MY</b> former school! Instead of listing it on VFD, I merged and redirected it into the town that it was in, that is a much better soloution. See <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thornbury%2C_South_Gloucestershire_7131.html#Schools_in_Thornbury" title="Thornbury, South Gloucestershire">article about it</a>. If more people kept or merged and redirected there will be less aruments on VFD and Wikipedia will be a better encyclopedia. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorm_25a0.html" title="User:Norm">Norman Rogers</a>\<sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorm_b46b.html" title="User talk:Norm">talk</a></sup> 15:39, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: In regards to claims of vote-stacking, their are large amounts of people who beleive well-written articles for schools are inherently notable. Merely bringing an article to someones attention is no more votestacking than providing a link for someone is. If you'll notice, GRider's contributions were far and wide and not concentrated on any bloc or mailing list group. Speaking for myself, I evaluated the article and voted to keep it out of sincere belief that it deserved to be kept and not out of any votestacking motivation. I have faith that the majority of the other voters did as well.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is another list, and has all the usual problems of such, centering on the problem that the criterion for inclusion on the list is unclear and not agreed, and even when the criterion is relatively clear, it is still often a POV whether something should be listed or not. Unlike regular articles, where facts and arguments related to the matter can be presented, lists are binary: something is either on the list or it is not. Of necessity, if there is a dispute over inclusion, one POV gets to win, since an item can't be both on a particular list and not on it at the same time. That means that many lists inherently violate NPOV. People reacting negatively to this list might reconsider their support for a substantial number of the list articles. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:52, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Your logic is basically flawed. By your logic everything should be here. Every McDonalds outlet have several thousand customers a day and scores of employees, should they have a article each? Water wells service thousands of people all the time. Powerplants provide electricity for millions of people. Receptionist and call center people talk to hundreds of people every day. Should every telemarketer have their own page? They certainly come into contact with a lot of people. And so forth and so on. Every single one of the 6.500.000.000 people on earth comes into contact with all kinds of people and services (such as schools) every single day. What makes schools special? My high school certainly don't belong here. But that not might not have been my viewpoint when I was in school where it seemed much more important because it took up so much of my time. The Harry Potter books have sold 250.000.000 copies worldwide... <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreisler_7251.html" title="User:Preisler">Preisler</a> 11:16, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My true point is not that my bus driver should have an article, but that fictional topics are given more space than "real" topics, in traditional encyclopedias it is the other way around. Of course the main characters such as Harry get and article, but the bus driver, which only a few fans cares about it not right. Replace fictional bus driver with "school" and you see the whole point. Minor fictioanl characters get articles while real, tangible entities do not. And you argument of 250 million copies does not hold. There is reams of fancruft for much less notable fiction, just look around, and it shows. The <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_of_Madagascar_c83f.html" title="Geography of Madagascar">Geography of Madagascar</a>, the forth largest island in the world is a stub, while <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-earth.html" title="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>, a fictional land is a featured article. The bias of notabillity of real and fictional objects is absurd. If <b>fictional</b> bus drivers who are <b>minor characters</b> are allowed articles, then so should secondary schools, shopping centres, stadiums, roads and more. Another thing, a group of notorius internet trolls known as the GNAA ha successfully managed to beat the VFD system, because they were trolling enough to make themselves "notable". VFD is <b>broken</b>, this article will be kept, another school will be deleted and more and more fancruft will pile up. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorm_25a0.html" title="User:Norm">Norman Rogers</a>\<sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorm_b46b.html" title="User talk:Norm">talk</a></sup> 13:09, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason for inclusion is not the <i>reality</i> of topics, but the <i>notability</i> thereof. Since there are more people who have read Harry Potter books than people who know your bus driver, the former is more notable. That the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_of_Madagascar_c83f.html" title="Geography of Madagascar">Geography of Madagascar</a> is currently a stub is unfortunate but not relevant since everyone agrees it should be expanded. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 13:35, Feb 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The fact that <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_of_Madagascar_c83f.html" title="Geography of Madagascar">Geography of Madagascar</a> is a stub is relevent. People have been working too hard on fictional topics rather than real topics, therefore giving them a false sense of notabillity. Listen to people like <a href="../../../x/e/d/User%7EXed_07b7.html" title="User:Xed">Xed</a>. He has been complaining for ages about this. More people need to stop working on fictional trivia and work on the important topics. People fighting the current bias are having an up hill battle. Once you start working in the real world topics you reailize wow big the world is. We have 746,163 articles in Wikipedia, but we have the potential to cover a lot more. Notabillity is still a POV idea, and fictional topics have artifiial notabillity. Think about it, the fictional work is heavily marketed, gobbled up by fans and gives an artifical sense of notabillity. That is the complaint. Fictional objects have a notabillity bias. The same thing applies to Internet-based phenomina. Many of these things are traditionally non-notable, but are "notable" becase of the medium the spread through, therefore bias. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorm_25a0.html" title="User:Norm">Norman Rogers</a>\<sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorm_b46b.html" title="User talk:Norm">talk</a></sup> 13:58, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Being somewhat of a deletionist there's nothing I would love more than to see some of all those pokemon or digimon or whatever articles disappear.. And you're right, it is sad that articles like Mother Teresa or Atheism or all the fancruft gets so many man hours of work and energy while articles of a, lets face it, more befitting nature to a encyclopedia as the geography of madagascar remains stubs. But I don't think there's any hope of that ever changing as long as the demographic of Wikipedia is as it is. Fighting the bias might be something of a Sisyphus task.. But those pages just containing minimal information on the school still bug me alot. These Harry Potter stubs should probably be gathered together and, because we can't shoot them, collected in Minor Characters of Harry Potter or something like that.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreisler_7251.html" title="User:Preisler">Preisler</a> 14:29, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I meant by 'not relevant', is that the argument that an article should be kept because a given worse article exist, or that an article should be deleted because a given better article does not exist (or is a stub) is invalid. This is because those arguments can be equally applied to any article. Consensus has already been established that not everything should be in wikipedia, thus an argument that is equally usable to support every article, must therefore be invalid. I concur with Preisler, too. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 15:55, Feb 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- I'm the author of the page. While it's true I live in Tacoma, I have no interest in the person or product, do not know them, have not seen them, indeed no know one who has -- I know of them only through the cited newspaper article. On 'vanity pages' we read in the guidelines: "Usually, vanity authors write about themselves, their significant others, or their high schools. Articles about start-up businesses or musicians are not vanity pages and are considered acceptable, but it's preferable that the initial author not be someone affiliated with the project." I have no affiliation whatsoever. Thus the label of 'vanity page' does not apply, as I have no connection of any sort (except as a subscriber to the rather undistinguished paper where the article appeared) and indeed will not feel that my "vanity" is wounded in the event of deletion, as my motives in writing it were purely altruistic (as far as I can divine). The <i>Da Vinci Code</i> is a work of great popular interest (though not to me personally, by the way -- I haven't even read it, so no 'vanity' there either) and the devising of a 'cryptex' is an accomplishment of note, IMHO. Perhaps the readers on the 'Da Vinci Code' page might be polled. -- Naturally I accede to the wisdom and outcome of this process, but wanted to set forth my disinterestedness. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_K._Jensen_3134.html" title="User:Mark K.

<p>Book review. Very POV. If the book is considered notable, I still think the current article should be deleted to make place for a better one. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 13:59, Feb 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> and rewrite from scratch.

<li>I do not dispute the worthiness of the subject, but I believe the current article should be deleted because in this case it would be better to start a new article from scratch than to modify the existing article. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 09:03, Feb 23, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree with <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a>. And I disagree with those who say VfD should not be cleanup. <i>In extreme examples,</i> like this one, where the submission is simply garbage, it is perfectly reasonable to nominate it for VfD and hope that someone will bother to turn it into a decent stub. Cleanup should be for articles that need improvement, not for garbage that is not an article at all. I think "delete and list as a requested article" is a disposition that we ought to use more often. The advantage is that a requested article does not exist until someone is actually ready to write it, whereas articles marked for cleanup remain visible. This is good for articles that are better than nothing or that contain salvageable material, but is bad for articles that are worse than nothing and contain nothing salvageable. I'm glad that the issue is moot for this particular article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:13, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In the prior discussion, several "Keep" voters wanted to see how the page would "pan out" (seemingly unaware that it had <i>already been</i> "panning out", rather badly, for 10 months), opined that "people are maintaining it", and called for better explanations of the idea (seemingly unaware of the existence of <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logarithmic_timeline.html" title="Logarithmic timeline">logarithmic timeline</a> that does exactly that). As <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhils_21fd.html" title="User:Phils">Phils</a> points out, <i>we already have the encyclopaedia article</i>. <i>This</i> article, by contrast, is no more than an example of the idea. And it is an example whose edit history speaks for itself. In the month between the VFD discussion closure and the renomination, the page saw <i>exactly four</i> edits. And it really hadn't been maintained very effectively before that. Moreover, the article still states that the election in Iraq took place "last week". Yes, this is an intriguing idea, especially if it were done well (which it hasn't been, and, if the past 11 months are anything to go by, probably won't be — especially given that <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia is not a news service</a>).

<li>The problem with things like this is that some reality show people are notable and some are not, and drawing the line can be difficult.

Hung got a recording contract (somehow), so that separates him from the flock, but others are simply just more famous or infamous than most, and it's hard to quantify that. This case I think will have to be a <b>delete</b>, because I really see nothing here. I guess part of the question is is this guy actively <i>un</i>popular? Or does he just lack popularity?

<li>Sayng "published professor" is somewhat redundant. Basically all professors are forced to publish if they want to keep their jobs. Are you saying all professors belong in wikipedia?

<li><b>Comment:</b> Professors who have published a significant number of scientific articles and several books are definitely notable. But Martinelli really is a borderline case, in my eyes. He seems to have a post-doc position and his publications are limited to his PhD thesis (published in an <i>Acta</i> series and not by a major publisher), a co-edited book, and just a handful of scientific articles. Three (!) mentions of his name in the <a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoomusicology.html" title="Zoomusicology">Zoomusicology</a> article might be enough until he has had some more work published. I'll abstain for now. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 00:26, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment - This appears to be a timeline (partial) of a series of fantasy books I'm not familiar with. There's precedence on Wikipedia for this sort of content I believe, but I lack any knowledge of this book series. We need more information from someone who's read them, and more info on how popular they are. Certainly should probably be listed at something like 'Timeline of X' or 'Royal House of X' as it covers more than just the titular character.

<li>The book series, while not on par with Lord of the Rings, is notable. This article is very messy, though, and would require some extensive rewriting, possible splitting, and definite renaming. <b>Keep</b>. Btw not copyvio, it's a summary of events in the book with some citations, a bit like a TV episode capsule. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 09:17, Feb 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>. This is actually very good material, and just needs clean-up. Sorry for being a bit late with my comments, but there have been some discussion about related issues before, and I was asked to try to merge some of the character material about <a href="../../../s/o/n/Song_of_ice_and_fire.html" title="Song of ice and fire">Song of ice and fire</a> into larger, encyclopaedic entries. I hadn't realised that this nice article came up, but with some trimming it would sit really well on <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Targaryen_ba16.html" title="House Targaryen">House Targaryen</a>, together with some other (shorter) articles about other Targaryens. If and when any single character "explodes in size" he or she can have their own page devoted to him or her (or <i>it</i>, as it happens!). Thore 10:02, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC) -- Actually, after reading this thing through, I will change my vote to <b>keep</b>. There is an amazing amount of work put into this page, and I would like to keep most of it. I will put a brief summary of the page under <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Targaryen_ba16.html" title="House Targaryen">House Targaryen</a>, and link to it. Still needs cleanup and wikification, of course. Let me get right to it. Thore 10:10, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC) -- A somewhat longer discussion of issues related to characters from this series, including my own views, can be found at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_characters_in_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_6e84.html" title="Talk:List of characters in A Song of Ice and Fire">Talk:List of characters in A Song of Ice and Fire</a>. I would be happy if you had a look at these meandering, so that a VfD won't be necessary in the future. Thore 13:36, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Unless there is a policy that we should only make separate pages for subsections when the article itself is over a certain size, I would prefer to have the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_veganism.html" title="Criticisms of veganism">criticisms of veganism</a> not completely merged into the article. The criticism is already fairly big, and if it were fully merged into the <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegan.html" title="Vegan">vegan</a> article, it would dominate nearly half the article (not counting external links). <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Herboso_fb30.html" title="User:Eric Herboso">Eric</a> <a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EEric_Herboso_ef91.html" title="User talk:Eric Herboso">Herboso</a> 03:52, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia is not and internet directory, and the <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegan.html" title="Vegan">vegan</a> page sure has an extensive (perhaps too long) section deveoted to external links, cut out the repetitious content externally linked and there'd be plenty of room to add the criticisms to the main article if you're worried about page length.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 05:20, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. This article was pulled from main vegan article to reduce the size and because a fair amount of redundancy had appeared.

<ul>
<li>No by removing it from the main article, the editors have been able to find and strip out a fair amount of text that should not have been part of it to begin with. Since the article is no longer a debat, the information can be cleaned up in a less charged environment. It has reduced the repetition in both articles as a result. --<a href="../../../a/h/c/User%7EAhc_dcbb.html" title="User:Ahc">Ahc</a> 16:23, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>. Criticisms should be discussed in their proper context, not shunted off to the side. If the Benefits of veganism (and perhaps other sections of the main <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegan.html" title="Vegan">vegan</a> article) are broken out into separate articles and maintain a parallel structure, I will change my vote to "keep separate". <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:40, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> Criticism should probably remain within the same article, unless filesize is exceeded at a future date. As it stands, why split them? bodhisattvah</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. Let's have all the pro-and anti-vegan material in one article (says this vegetarian who'd never become a vegan) <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZantastik_9813.html" title="User:Zantastik">Zantastik</a> 00:09, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think it's better that the criticisms be here rather than on the same page as the article, since this page has the potential to become somewhat longer than it already is, which I think would detract somewhat from the veganism article. Better that the veganism article say that the criticisms are out there, and you can read them on the separate page if you want. I think this is a legitimate article and should be retained, at least by merging if not by keeping it here, which I think better.</li>
