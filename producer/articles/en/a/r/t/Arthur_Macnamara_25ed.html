The Manor House. built by Arthur Macnamara at <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billington%2C_Bedfordshire_12d1.html" title="Billington, Bedfordshire">Billington</a></div>
</div>

<p><b>Arthur Macnamara</b> (<a href="../../../1/8/3/1831.html" title="1831">1831</a> - <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a>) was squire of <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billington%2C_Bedfordshire_12d1.html" title="Billington, Bedfordshire">Billington</a> near <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leighton_Buzzard_03ca.html" title="Leighton Buzzard">Leighton Buzzard</a> in <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedfordshire.html" title="Bedfordshire">Bedfordshire</a>, where he turned a ruinous village into a model Victorian Estate. Today Billington is a small village with no facilities straddling a busy main road. As the heavy traffic rumbles through the village today, motorists notice the 'AM' <a href="../../../c/i/p/Cipher.html" title="Cipher">cipher</a> but are often unaware that the initials stand for Arthur Macnamara.</p>
<p>Macnamara was born in his parents' <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> home in Grosvenor Street in 1831. The family were very affluent: in addition to the London house, they had a castle at <a href="../../../l/l/a/Llangoed.html" title="Llangoed">Llangoed</a> in <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a> and a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_house.html" title="Country house">country house</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/d/Caddington.html" title="Caddington">Caddington</a> Hall, in <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hertfordshire.html" title="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>, and another estate at <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eaton_Bray_bdd7.html" title="Eaton Bray">Eaton Bray</a> in <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedfordshire.html" title="Bedfordshire">Bedfordshire</a>. Macnamara's grandfather had won <a href="../../../l/l/a/Llangoed_Castle_3990.html" title="Llangoed Castle">Llangoed Castle</a> in a card game. However his father died when he was young, and Llangoed Castle was sold in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1847.html" title="1847">1847</a>. Members of the family lie in the isolated <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graveyard.html" title="Graveyard">graveyard</a> in the castle grounds. Macnamara seems to have been brought up from this point onwards by his rather domineering mother. Caddington Hall was now the family's principal seat, but the family fortune was dwindling rapidly.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_28.html" title="September 28">28 September</a> <a href="../../../1/8/5/1854.html" title="1854">1854</a> Macnamara made a brilliant marriage (probably to save the ancestral finances) to Lady Sophia Hare, daughter of the local <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Parliament_22d1.html" title="Member of Parliament">MP</a> for <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Albans_151f.html" title="St Albans">St Albans</a>, the 2nd <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Listowel_a788.html" title="Earl of Listowel">Earl of Listowel</a>. The couple were married on the bride's family estate at Ballyhooly, <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Cork_4166.html" title="County Cork">Cork</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>; afterwards the couple set up home at Caddington Hall.</p>
<p>It is about this time that the first signs of eccentric behaviour began to manifest themselves in the young Squire Macnamara. In spite of owning a large mansion in the area he developed a passion for building, embarking on the project of re-creating the lost castle of <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eaton_Bray_bdd7.html" title="Eaton Bray">Eaton Bray</a> on some land bequeathed him by his mother. After building grandiose <a href="../../../l/o/d/Lodge.html" title="Lodge">lodges</a>, and clearing and preparing the <a href="../../../m/o/a/Moat.html" title="Moat">moated</a> site, he seem to have abandoned the idea, probably through lack of funds. All was not well in his marriage either. Sophia's <a href="../../../f/a/t/Father.html" title="Father">father</a> as a Lord-in-Waiting to <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom_5e8e.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> was able to secure his daughter a position as a Lady-in-Waiting to the Queen's daughter <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Louise%2C_Duchess_of_Argyll_b744.html" title="Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll">Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll</a>, thus Lady Sophia was able to spend long periods at <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court.html" title="Court">court</a> away from her husband. In this era <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorce</a> was not an option.</p>
<p>In the early <a href="../../../1/8/8/1880.html" title="1880">1880s</a> Macnamara now embarked on his most ambitious project yet, no doubt inspired by the building of <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mentmore.html" title="Mentmore">Mentmore</a> by <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayer_Amschel_de_Rothschild_8931.html" title="Mayer Amschel de Rothschild">Baron Mayer de Rothschild</a> five miles away. He began to acquire land and build <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cottage.html" title="Cottage">cottages</a> at <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billington%2C_Bedfordshire_12d1.html" title="Billington, Bedfordshire">Billington</a> and estate cottages and farm houses all adorned with the Macnamara cypher 'AM' sprang up around the village. The cypher began to become more and more adorned in many guises. Humble cottages would sometimes have two manifestations of it, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronet.html" title="Coronet">coronets</a> (that strictly speaking Macnamara was not entitled to use) began to appear, clenched fists waving <a href="../../../d/a/g/Dagger.html" title="Dagger">daggers</a> would embellish them, and always the 'AM' close alongside.</p>
<p>As Billington became the <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estate_%28house%29.html" title="Estate (house)">estate</a> village, the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manor_house.html" title="Manor house">manor house</a> itself began to be built; a large multi-<a href="../../../g/a/b/Gable.html" title="Gable">gabled</a> <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_architecture.html" title="Victorian architecture">Victorian</a> mansion, of no architectural merit, began to arise whose style could be loosely called <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabethan.html" title="Elizabethan">Elizabethan</a>. On two floors the house sprawled, juxtaposing wings linked by conservatories. Each wing, gable or bay bore the now legendary cypher of 'AM'. However the greatest surprise to the approaching visitor were the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motto.html" title="Motto">mottos</a> engraved over each gable of the entrance front. The motto over the front door translated as 'I hate common people'.</p>
<p>The new manor house had stable yards and lodges and new farmhouses each bearing the 'AM' cypher. So numerous were these plaques that it now began to seem like <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graffiti.html" title="Graffiti">graffiti</a>. At <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Billington_4694.html" title="Little Billington">Little Billington</a> a mile away a lodge was built for a new principal approach to the house. The money exhausted, the drive was never built, but the lodge complete with multiple cyphers remains.</p>
<p>It was the planning of this drive that caused one of Arthur Macnamara's most often related acts of callousness: a row of <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cottage.html" title="Cottage">cottages</a> existed within sight of the new drive. The occupants were turned out, and homeless, they requested permission to use the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timber.html" title="Timber">timbers</a> of the old houses to build new homes. Macnamara denied them this, and for two weeks a <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonfire.html" title="Bonfire">bonfire</a> burned doors, window frames, and all which could have been salvaged. The elderly occupants were put into the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workhouse.html" title="Workhouse">workhouse</a>.</p>
<p>He became <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chairman.html" title="Chairman">chairman</a> of the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magistrate.html" title="Magistrate">magistrates</a> at Leighton Buzzard where his sentencing knew no bounds in its severity. If the squire encountered any of his <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenant.html" title="Tenant">tenants</a> on the road with <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheep.html" title="Sheep">sheep</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cattle.html" title="Cattle">cattle</a>, his <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coachman.html" title="Coachman">coachman</a> had orders not to stop or slow down; if people did not hurry out of his path they were mown down. As chairman of the magistrates and the largest land owner in the district he was beyond the law. The slightest affront imagined by the squire could lead to the eviction of the perpetrator from their home.</p>
<p>However, Squire Macnamara had one huge fear: he was frightened of <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunder.html" title="Thunder">thunder</a>. An underground suite of rooms were furnished at Billington Manor, where he would retreat for long periods at the slightest threat of thunder.</p>
<p>On February 11th <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a> Arthur Macnamara died, alone in the great house except for his house-keeper. The cause of his death, perhaps giving a clue to his behaviour, was <a href="../../../c/i/r/Cirrhosis.html" title="Cirrhosis">cirrhosis of the liver</a>.</p>
<p>Following his death, he was found to be <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankrupt.html" title="Bankrupt">bankrupt</a>. Lady Sophia sold the estate and in her old age lived at <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heath_and_Reach_87eb.html" title="Heath and Reach">Heath and Reach</a>, Leighton Buzzard, where members of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_family.html" title="Royal family">royal family</a> would come to visit her, free of her tyrannical husband.</p>
<p>Arthur Macnamara was buried in Billington churchyard, his monumental <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tombstone.html" title="Tombstone">tombstone</a> surrounded by <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron.html" title="Iron">iron</a> railings. There is a <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legend.html" title="Legend">legend</a> that when the blacksmith came to erect them, it was tradition for the spikes on top of the railings to curve outwards (to keep the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil.html" title="Devil">devil</a> out). On Arthur Macnamara's grave the spikes were turned in - to prevent him escaping his grave. These railings were removed during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> when iron work was melted down to help the war effort.</p>
<p>Lady Sophia Macnamara died in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>, and she chose to be buried in Ireland. Her husband lies alone.</p>
