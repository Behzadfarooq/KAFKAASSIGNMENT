<li><b>Strong Keep</b> — Aside from the amount of work that me and others have put into the topic, you can read from the talk pages that myself and <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalbared_d043.html" title="User:Halbared">Halbared</a> have recently decided upon policies wherby each height must be referenced and each submission must be notable, which would then put the article much closer to a good thing. As for subjective, I also don't understand how a person's height, once sourced, can be anything other than fact.

<li><b>DelMerge</b> — Taking 5'10" and 5'5" for average height (men/women) and applying a 3" avg. distr. we get: the 10 tallest men = 9th perc., the 13 shortest men = 9th perc., the 10 tallest women = 6th perc. [6 tallest = 9th perc.] and the 5 shortest women are only at the 5th percetile. The current cutoffs are only 2nd perctile which statistically means ~5% of the population. At least 6th percentile is equal to 1 in 500 million, or ~13 total on Earth. Thus, perhaps the four lists (Tall men/women + Short men/women) could individually deleted and then the information merged into one article - maybe something like "Human Height Extremes" - and then have the top 10 for each category in tabular format.Moridin 01:12, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The cut-offs can be readily changed if the list grows too large. Men and women have different average heights, so a combined list would be skewed by gender. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 19:28, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> — This list (despite being somewhat silly) is far better maintained and pruned for notability than other similar lists of people on wikipedia. Discussions about proper sources are frequent on the talk page, which is a good thing. Carlossuarez46's point, btw, has been taken into account by Halbared and others, who have done a great job of keeping the list from being overwhelmed with semi-notable basketball players and professional wrestlers.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 01:20, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b> These lists have possibly been done in a bit of a "freak show" manner which makes them appear silly, but as someone who is 41 inches(105 cm) tall I think there's potential value in them. I learned a good deal more about Spanish pianist <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alicia_de_Larrocha_8704.html" title="Alicia de Larrocha">Alicia de Larrocha</a>, and helped improved her article, while looking for names to add to the women's list. There's no similar urge to delete List of people with visual disabilities or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_deaf_people.html" title="List of deaf people">List of deaf people</a>. That said the list would maybe look less silly if it took a cue from those two and was arranged by "levels" rather than specific heights as height can change with age.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>Agreed. Most NBA players aren't notable enought to fit. The rule of lists, from what I read back when, is also that the person contributed to the topic or is known for their connection to it. An NBA player of average height for the NBA I think could already be excluded using that rule. Likewise other things are up for deletion here. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_short_men.html" title="List of famous short men">List of famous short men</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_short_women.html" title="List of famous short women">List of famous short women</a> is not affected by this comment.

<li>I looked at the discussion page, and could not find an objective rule. This leads me to question the maintainability of this list. There has already been lots of edit confilcts centered on the "importance" of players. Sure, there are few people editing the list constantly, but what happens when they eventually burn out? <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazybum_3d4c.html" title="User:Lazybum">Lazybum</a> 04:41, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The rule is the one that applies to all stand-alone lists. Their being tall has to be part of their fame or significance. According to one site[<a href="http://www.eurobasket.com/over210.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.eurobasket.com/over210.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.eurobasket.com/over210.asp</a> he top Take <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lock_Martin_49de.html" title="Lock Martin">Lock Martin</a>, who I recently added, he'd likely just be a doorman if a director hadn't noticed he was very tall. Even <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Lee_b095.html" title="Christopher Lee">Christopher Lee</a> got some roles because of his heighth. That the more serious editors will "burn out" causing quality to decline is a risk in almost any article.</li>

<li><b>Delete unless completely restructured</b> The extremes on each list are almost worthy of the lists themselves - they are people who are notable for being tall or short. However, as you get down the list (e.g., tall men) you start getting to people who are notable for things other than their height and just happen to be tall. That crosses over into triviality. I agree with Moridin's proposal as to how this topic might be saved, but as it stands, it's fairly arbitrary and worthless. GassyGuy 03:55, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. "Famous" is undefined, the list potentially endless. Tall: for Asians being of above average height means someting else than for Europeans.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The height of a specific person is objective, but the inclusion on this list is completely subjective. If this article was about extremes, such as the <i>tallest</i> man/woman, that would be objective. A good portion of this article (especially at the bottom) seems to be famous people who also happen to be tall, instead who people who are famous solely because of their height. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperMachine_4dd5.html" title="User:SuperMachine">SuperMachine</a> 19:39, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: For those that assert that this article is objective, please provide objective criteria for whom may be included. This criteria should leave zero room for arguments about whether a person should or should not be included in the article.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I still find this article encyclopedic, important (as a collection of one kind of trivia info and famous people that can belong to it) and, as mentioned above, interesting. And as in other of the kind "list of famous tall/short" articles, it is important to show poeple with unusual height (tall or short) that their height really doesnt matter that much to achieve their goals. They simply show them poeple they can relate to. BTW, it is a good point, that tall basketball players are nothing special, thus only very tall basket players should be contained in the article. --<a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudo2_2bfc.html" title="User:Dudo2">Dudo2</a> 20:19, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sorry, but that's a ridiculous argument. The title is famous tall men, of which you are obvisusly not one. And again, as you'll see from the talk page, non notable people and the majority of basketball players are being weeded out, or at least trying to be. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamishMacBeth_6569.html" title="User:HamishMacBeth">HamishMacBeth</a> 18:56, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The height qualification has been moved up before it can again. That said you wouldn't be on this list because, no offense, you aren't notable. Just like I wouldn't belong on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_short_men.html" title="List of famous short men">List of famous short men</a> even though only eight of those guys are shorter than me.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>Don't take the troll of 7 feet seriously, he's just goofing around. I suggest taking a look at his past contributions before responding to him.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 19:02, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I made an ironic complaint just to show how bad this list is handled. Yeah, don't take it seriously... It may hurt the weakest brains. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_thief_of_7_feet_a825.html" title="User:Dark thief of 7 feet">Dark thief of 7 feet</a> 09:55, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Question.</b> Famous by whose standards? —<i><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;">Encephalon</span></a> 21:36, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</i></li>

<dd>I expect it's by the standards of common sense. For example, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cleese_d081.html" title="John Cleese">John Cleese</a> is tall and known to pretty much everybody who's ever watched television. <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Durand_c323.html" title="Kevin Durand">Kevin Durand</a> is tall, but you'd have a damn hard time explaining him as famous.<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertieBasset_d46c.html" title="User:BertieBasset">BertieBasset</a> 23:36, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I take a different position because I think the word "famous" should be removed or replaced with "noted" from the lists if they survive. People add famous as a justification, but Wikipedia's list guidelines are against having the word "famous" in lists. Anyway these lists should be for people whose height is an important or defining part of their public identity or notability. If it's limited to that I don't see how it'd be failiing list guidelines.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is a list that provides encyclopedic information, and the person that nominated this for deletion was a wikipedia members for about two and a half weeks Seeing as how these articles have been around for a long time, why would it be deleted now?
