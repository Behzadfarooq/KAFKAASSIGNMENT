<dd>Thanks for that. Yes, she did do a Widcombe church page, and she did the Skinner page, but I take it that these are matters she happens to know about. Since she also did this page <a href="../../../t/o/t/Tota_pulchra_es.html" title="Tota pulchra es">Tota_pulchra_es</a>, a page reflecting on Mary and the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, which is contrary to Baptist and other Protestant theology, so it is unlikely that she has POV issues, whereas there is systematic deletion of Christian related articles going on all over Wikipedia. I think it is one thing when there are two sides trying on the one hand to increase Christian content and on the other to delete it, but it's a pity if the contributions of someone who had no such intention, and was merely writing about something local to her, should be caught up in this. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsenetpostsdotcom_fb92.html" title="User:Usenetpostsdotcom">Uncle Davey</a> <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUsenetpostsdotcom_1e10.html" title="User talk:Usenetpostsdotcom">(Talk)</a> 12:43, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep'</b> I know I created this page, but I believe Jonathan Skinner is well known in many circles in Britain, and is an important figure in evangelical teaching and the FIEC. He writes many articles for the evangelical times and is a renowned scientist. He has given many talks and lectures attended by wide audiences. Delete if you wish, but these are my reasons for proposing to keep. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/b/b/User%7EAbbyemery_4417.html" title="User:Abbyemery">Abbyemery</a> (<a href="../../../a/b/b/User_talk%7EAbbyemery_5bbf.html" title="User talk:Abbyemery">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Abbyemery_3b04.html" title="Special:Contributions/Abbyemery">contribs</a>).</small></li>

No discussion regarding attitudes, viewpoints, criticism, notability amongst peers, etc. Book reviews and citations of influential articles that Skinner has (co-)authored would be a good start.

<dd>We are looking for evidence that other people beyond Skinner himself and possibly a small circle of parishoners and fans finds him insteresting enough to write about. If 2 people think he's important, then he probably isn't; if ten thousand people think he is important, he problably is. The dividing line is invisible and fuzzy. To help the wikipedia community evaluate specific people, we look for outside evidence. See below. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 18:53, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Evidence</b> Lexis/Nexis search covering the past 12 months finds several columns written by Skinner for the <i><a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Daily_Press_9e23.html" title="Western Daily Press">Western Daily Press</a></i> and some letters to the editor replying to him in one way or another. He takes on <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dawkins_c78d.html" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>, who had just run a 2-part BBC special declaring that religion was immoral, and he defended tony Blair, who was criticized by the press for saying that God would judge the rightness of the Iraq invasion. Also a book review that thought Skinner's book proceeded from a logical fallacy and would only be convincing to the already convinced. (I can't link to Lexis/Nexis but I can provide the dates and page numbers; I don't know if the Western Daily Press has a web presence or not.) <s>I have not voted yet, leaning toward keep but would like to know what others think in light of this Lexis/Nexis search.</s> Based on the fact that he has published 50+ newspaper columns in addition to a column in the <i>Evangelical Times</i>, and because we have dozens of articles on the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expanded_Universe_%28Star_Wars%29_acd4.html" title="Expanded Universe (Star Wars)">Expanded Universe (Star Wars)</a>, we can <b>keep</b> this one too. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 18:53, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Good evidence, hadn't seen that. I'd add and re-clarify that he writes for the Evangelical Times which has a circulation of about 40 000. I believe that he is therefore notable as a journalist.

<dd>No. Only one vote per person is allowed, but the decision is not made by the volume of votes (therefore, multiple votes by one person make no difference anyway). After 5 days, unless it looks like more time is required, an Admin will review the debate, decide if there was a consensus, and act on the consensus. This looks like no consensus to me (IMHO), so it's likely that this page will not be deleted. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 15:49, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
