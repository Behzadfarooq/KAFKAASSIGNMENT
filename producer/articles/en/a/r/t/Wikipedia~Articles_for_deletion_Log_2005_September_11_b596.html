<li><b>Amend</b> His life seems really incredible if it's true. I would be cautious however in deleting this. The article does say he's not well known outside of Ireland, so his album may not be on general release. Consortiums can also be small groups rather than large international ones. I am also concerned that where as the Johnny Cash article may be confused with the dates, this article does not give mention of these so cannot be held at fault. way2busy

<li>Both of which are credited as Ruaidhri Conroy (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0175860/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0175860/" rel="nofollow">his IMDB page</a>), whose existence is universally accepted and for whom we <i>still have no evidence</i> is this Rory Conroy to whom the article refers. And there's <i>certainly</i> no evidence of any kind that he was a great young physicist or a rare martial arts master (and I've looked) as the article claims. It's been <i>three days</i>, and you sockpuppets have made a billion edits trying to keep this thing, and your evidence <i>does not exist</i>. For the sake of argument, I present now a list of questionable aspects of this article. This list is by no means exhaustive. Feel free to prove me wrong on any or all of them.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>"Rory Conroy", as an actor by that name, is not known to exist. As a physicist or Irish historian, he has no articles or textbooks in university libraries that a number of Wikipedians, including myself, have been able to find. As a martial arts master, his achievements cannot be verified.</li>
<li>The claims that Rory Conroy are Ruaidhri Conroy cannot be handily verified.</li>
<li>If Rory Conroy is Ruaidhri Conroy, it is unusual that this fact was not mentioned on the page until <i>after</i> the Articles for Deletion notice went up. Surely the name he was credited under would at least be worth a <i>mention</i> in a fairly comprehensive article written by what must be a very knowledgeable fan!</li>
<li>He is mentioned as playing key roles in the Irish dramas "Fair City" and "Batchelor's [sic] Walk". IMDB lists "Fair City" as an Irish television series beginning in 1988. No Conroy, Rory or Ruaidhri, is credited. IMDB does not list a "Batchelor's Walk", however, "Bachelor's Walk" is listed as an Irish television series that ran from 2001 to 2003. No Conroy, Rory or Ruaidhri, is credited.</li>
<li>Mr. Conroy is listed as a recipient of the "Best Young European Physicist of the Year" award. No such award is mentioned on Google. The awarding body is the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Science_Foundation_5e48.html" title="European Science Foundation">European Science Foundation</a>, which has no reference to a "Conroy" on its website.</li>
<li>Mr. Conroy is <i>not</i> listed as a recipient of the 1998 Theatre World Award for his role in Martin McDonagh's "The Cripple of Inishmaan", despite the fact that Ruaidhri Conroy <i>did</i> win this award. Another glaring omission in what is otherwise a fairly comprehensive article.</li>
<li>Pictures of Ruaidhri Conroy available online (such as <a href="http://www.fmstar.com/movie/r/r0401.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fmstar.com/movie/r/r0401.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a> and <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theatre_journal/v050/50.2pr_mcdonagh_fig02.html" class="external text" title="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theatre_journal/v050/50.2pr_mcdonagh_fig02.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a>) show a non-glasses-wearer with dark hair who doesn't look a <i>thing</i> like the picture in the article. The picture in the article does not appear online in a Google image search for "Ruaidhri Conroy", nor for "Rory Conroy".</li>
<li>This page is supported by an unusually large number of sockpuppet votes, which, while not an indication of the article by itself, is worth considering on top of the other evidence, listed in part above.</li>

<li>You were doing so well Lord Bob until your last point, insulting people by calling them socket puppets demeans all your other points, the source of the pictures has hard to verify, people can wear glasses and dye hair for roles etc. I think that you are confused by the use of irish names, my name "Seamus" which is Irish for James, we in ireland live in a multi lingual society I can (and do) use both names, perhaps this should be editted and the name chaned from Rory to "Ruaidhri". To the other users I'm sorry that I havent eddited other posts, I'm new to the community, but were we not all new once?? Respectfully ---<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeamus_116e.html" title="User:Seamus">Seamus</a> 20:14 Septermber 2005
<ul>
<li>If Ruaidhri is Irish for Rory (which, to my <i>very</i> considerable surprise, it actually seems to be!), then why why why wasn't his actual freakin' name mentioned in the article?!? He's credited under Ruaidhri <i>everywhere</i>. He appears as "Rory Conroy" <i>nowhere</i>. Two of the credits in the article, if IMDB is to be believed, are <i>absolute lies</i>. His academic background seems to be <i>total fiction</i>. The stuff on martial arts seems to be <i>dubious at best</i>. There are important omissions and facts that are false in the pre-AfD'd article (and in the present version). Heck, for all I know the author of the article also happens to be named "Rory Conroy" and is doing his damndest to pass himself off as the more famous Ruaidhri. You say that my referring to sockpuppets when a bunch of first-time users and anonymous IPs unanimously vote to keep an article demeans my other points. I could have called you anything I want but it wouldn't change the reality that my points are <i>real, unassailled facts</i> that could be disproved very easily if the article were actually true. A reference on the ESF's website to Conroy's award. Known and documented pseudonyms that he also performs and writes under, so as to explain the discrepancies in the claimed and his actual credits. Something on his martial arts work, or his album. Proof of his involvement with <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigur_Ros_f826.html" title="Sigur Ros">Sigur Ros</a> during their December 2004 Irish concert stop, despite the fact that <a href="http://sigur-ros.co.uk/tour/arctour.php" class="external text" title="http://sigur-ros.co.uk/tour/arctour.php" rel="nofollow">their official page</a> claims they neither toured in December 2004 nor appeared in Ireland all of that year. If you could actually verify all of those things, my argument would collapse utterly. But you can't. That's why you haven't, despite repeated calls from different editors to do so. That's why the only way you can try and win this AfD is by flooding the ballot box, rather than by actually convincing us of your point of view. I don't care if you think it cheapens my argument: this vote is supported by sockpuppets, barring you actually revealing solid evidence this vote will be to delete, and this hoax of an article will die. And I will be a little happier because it did. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 21:23, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's alright, then. I didn't mean to imply that <i>you</i> were one of the sockpuppets or one of the article's major editors, the evidence doesn't seem to bear that out. And I'm certainly not going to argue that Ruaidhri is Irish for Rory, and that Ruaidhri Conroy is an actor, which seems to be your main bone of contention despite my addressing other arguments in a thread with you. I took out my anger at the sockpuppets on you, and though I stand by my points above, I didn't mean to cause any offense to you (although I wouldn't mind offending the sockpuppets a bit. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 22:12, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Rory is really famous in Ireland. He has appeared on a lot of t.v. shows on Irish television. His face is known to all. His band are less well known in Ireland, but that's not his profession. He was on a late-night talk show recently and told the incredible story of his life. As a fluent Irish speaker, Rory and Ruaidhri are interchangeable, and although while it's true that he prefers to go by Ruaidhri, he is also know as Rory, especially by non native speakers.---Hector5 (talk) 17:06, 14 September 2005 (UTC):

<li>I did some searching, and I can‚Äôt find any reference to <i>New Agendas in Irish Prehistory</i> containing any papers by an Ruaidhri/Rory Conroy (e.g., <a href="http://www.oxbowbooks.com/bookinfo.cfm/ID/27939" class="external text" title="http://www.oxbowbooks.com/bookinfo.cfm/ID/27939" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.wordwellbooks.com/book.php?id=26" class="external text" title="http://www.wordwellbooks.com/book.php?id=26" rel="nofollow">here</a>), nor does a google search of the paper's title, "Man, Father, Priest and Martyr" bring up any hits.

<p>Does a totally obscure online RPG made by a one man dev team, using <a href="../../../b/y/o/BYOND_490a.html" title="BYOND">BYOND</a> software deserve a wikipedia article? Why don't we make an article for every homebrew game out there on the internet? Since when is wikipedia a directory for everything to have ever existed? A lot of effort has obviously been put into this article, there is more information here than there is on it's original website where it belongs. Their current website however, does tell us they have 18 players. <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 00:44, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. EIGHTEEN PLAYERS!? Look at the forums, 211 members so far, it may not be huge, but it is NOT 18 members.

As for the article itself. <b>Delete</b> if we delete forums for having too few members a game with 11 players online and a 211 member forum really isn't enough. A quick description in BYOND is fine, though and I would like to see this info on their website.

<li><b>Does it matter?</b>* I feel, being one of the chief Administrators and developers for Space Station 13, that I should step in and say a few words. First of all, nobody really cares weather this article exists or not. I don't care, nor do a lot of the community for SS13. However, there is the problem with the morality of the whole idea of deleting this wikopedia addition. This website is here purely for the sole purpose of providing it's users with information on more than what the standard encyclopedia offers. This means users can also add their own defintions of anything they want.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why do you all go completely made over a insignificant post that hardly takes up any space at all? Maybe if NASA or another national space assosciation launched a Space Station, labled #13, that would be good reason to delete this addition, in order to make room for a more official addition. Otherwise, the name isn't required for anything else, and therefore your argument is fruitless.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Don't start with this advertising crap, because if I wanted to, I could find at least 50 additions advertising products. Such an insignificant addition shouldn't be 'worried' about in such a way. Do what you want, it doesn't bother me, the original creator of SS13 nor does it bother any of the important members of the SS13 community. - AZA

<li>Then those 50 articles should also be deleted. Please nominate them ASAP. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 07:06, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think this is a matter of inclusionism/deletionism. I nominated this article for deletion, not because it was badly written or incorrect, but because I feel that wikipedia should not just cover arbitrary topics of little encyclopedic worth. I think the article would be a lot better, and do <a href="../../../b/y/o/BYOND_490a.html" title="BYOND">BYOND</a> and their games a lot more justice if it was hosted on a dedicated online games/BYOND wiki. I believe if we let "harmless" articles like this exist, they will multiply, and wikipedia will just be a bloated useless web directory. One pop up advertisment isn't that harmful, but a 50 popups on a page are. If you really didn't care about the fate of this article, why has so much been said about it by the ss13 team? - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 21:37, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - He is comparing HL2 to Space Station 13. Let's get some perspective here, HL2 was one of the most anticipated games ever, used an experimental delivery system, covered not only in the specialist gaming press, but garnered attention in mass media as well. It will spawn countless mods, official add on packs and will be remembered by many. Space Station 13 is a small online game, with a tiny community, made using commercial tools by a bedroom group, more people are likely going to see the article then are going to play the game.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I expected that kind of answer. I was talking to the guy above that says that SS13 doesnt change anything in the world and stuff. I dont see how Half-Life 2 compares to the laws of physics. I can see the Source Engine having an entry, but Half-Life 2&#160;? A couple of other games use the engine too, it's not extraordinary. Why not have a half-Life 2 wiki instead&#160;? The hack could be described it, the millions of mod his predecessors have spawned. Thing is, the SS13 entry isnt really harmful, and I dont know why we should remove it unless you really hate the game/games in general. <a href="../../../g/p/a/User%7EGparent_b9b8.html" title="User:Gparent">Gparent</a></li>

<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was delete.</p>
<p>The community consensus was clearly for deletion with 19 people unconvinced by any of the arguments in favor of keeping it. I count only one "keep as is", 3 "keep as redirect or merge" and one that was too ambiguous to call.</p>
<p>Phil is correct that the merger which happened while the discussion was on-going complicates the decision. This is exactly why we <b>strongly discourage</b> any mergers while the discussion is in progress.

<li>If the topic of the article is <i>flags featuring one or more stars and the colours red, blue and white</i> then the flag of New Zealand qualifies. No one ever said it was <i>flags featuring <b>only</b> one or more stars and the colours red, blue and white</i>. Heck, if it was, over half of those flags in there would be disqualified, as they obviously feature stripes, which are not stars. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">‚Äî <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 07:37, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Do your homework. You will see that User:Blahma removed the New Zealand flag September 3 because although it is red white and blue with stars it has a red white and blue something else in the corner.
<ul>
<li>I repeat, where does it say the flags have to <b>only</b> feature one or more stars and the colours red, blue and white? <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">‚Äî <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 08:59, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you hard of hearing? ):- ..Do You Homework. The introduction criteria in the article specified the following - <i>"This is a selected list of 'flags featuring one or more stars and the colors red, blue, and white'. <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag.html" title="Flag">Flags</a> listed here contain at least one star and contain three different colors: <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red.html" title="Red">red</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue.html" title="Blue">blue</a>, and <a href="../../../w/h/i/White.html" title="White">white</a>"</i>. So, I added the New Zealand flag which qualifies under that specification, and on September 3 User:Blahma removed it, stating <i>"removed flag of NZ <b>(features the Union Jack)"</b></i> and announcing some sort of nebulous change to the criteria. The fact is, it doesn't matter where you want to put a list of XXXX, if everything that qualifies as XXXX isn't allowed to be included, then the article about XXXX must not be allowed to exist on Wikipedia. Unless there has suddenly been a new policy adopted that censorship rules. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 09:39, September 11, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry, my reply was too confusing. I know the New Zealand flag was removed because it contains other pictures than stars. But what I wanted to say was that nowhere in the title <i>List of flags featuring one or more stars and the colours red, blue and white</i> can I find anything saying other pictures aren't allowed. If the Union Jack isn't allowed it should be mentioned in the name of the list, not as an additional rule added later. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">‚Äî <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 10:28, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I do not understand what is the aversion to the inclusion of the Union Flag! The Union Flag is red, blue and white (perchance the founding fathers of America used the same colours since it was prior to their UDI a British colony), and therefore if the list includes or or more stars New Zealand DOES qualify. As does <a href="../../../t/u/v/Tuvalu.html" title="Tuvalu">Tuvalu</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cook_Islands_1c39.html" title="Cook Islands">Cook Islands</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/y/Cayman_Islands_08a3.html" title="Cayman Islands">Cayman Islands</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/u/Niue.html" title="Niue">Niue</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Dependency_a6ce.html" title="Ross Dependency">Ross Dependency</a> and more .... or do not ANY of these count since they are not US-centric nations. <b>STRONG DELETE</b> for this very badly written article!!!! <a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhyddfrydol_22ef.html" title="User:Rhyddfrydol">Rhyddfrydol</a> 22:51 11 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, but before insulting the article as being <i>very badly written</i>, maybe you could bother to read through the whole discussion and find what its original purpose was and so what cause did that "aversion" against the Union Flag have. As I told below, I won't repeat nor evolve here anything further, but just two hints are: 1. The purpose was to distinguish between some very similar flags which consist a virtual group, so mixing them with flags from other groups does not do much good. 2. The flag of NZ was deleted at the same time when the criteria was clarified, but later someone for some reason generalized the criteria again, so now really the flag of NZ would qualify. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahma_d385.html" title="User:Blahma">Blahma</a> 00:03, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. I am the original creator of the article and would like to defend its purpose here. But first thanks to <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">User:Henrygb</a>, who put the AfD template to the article's page, because without it I would not notice this discussion at all. Well, and now: I got the idea first while at <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Youth_Day_2005_e961.html" title="World Youth Day 2005">an international event</a>, where there were thousands flags displayed by individual participants. I could easily recognize a lot of them, but there were some which kept both me and all my friends confused and uncertain. If you live in Europe and do not meet those flags so often, you really can't tell the difference between e.g. the flags of <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Texas_d8c6.html" title="Flag of Texas">Texas</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Chile_996a.html" title="Flag of Chile">Chile</a>, or the flags of <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Cuba_e6de.html" title="Flag of Cuba">Flag of Cuba</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Puerto_Rico_5ccd.html" title="Flag of Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> (which is often a crucial difference, in terms of the language and/or the general background you may await while addressing the person who is waving this flag). That's why I thought it'd be handy if also we here in Europe could have an easy way how to make the things clear and see all those similar flags in one place, without having to look them up in the list of all existing country flags. Now I hope I have made it a bit more clear while e.g. the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_New_Zealand_c485.html" title="Flag of New Zealand">flag of New Zealand</a> has not been included (please don't feel offended for that just because you come from there). Also, to all you U.S. guys over there, sorry, but the similarity with the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_the_United_States_f8f6.html" title="Flag of the United States">U. S. flag</a> was also not the original idea, though now it has become a considerable one. I agree that maybe the article title as is now is a bit confusing, too long and looking to be too specific. Still I suggest the article should not be deleted (because of its prospective usage described above) - maybe rather splitted into several articles like "List of flags similar to the flag of Texas", "List of flags similar to the flag of Cuba" etc. But I just alert that with this solution, another problems appear like which flag is the "base one" and which are the "derivatives" etc. Also, I think that unless you prove that all of the listed flags have been inspired by the U.S. flag, this article should not be merged with that one, since then its original purpose will vanish as you will have to either break up the list (and along with that its original purpose) or introduce false facts into the article on the U. S. flag. I hope I have not sounded too bossy or boring, just wanted to explain my motives and opinions. I am open to any further discussions. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahma_d385.html" title="User:Blahma">Blahma</a> 11:55, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>OK, can I feel offended about the New Zealand flag not being included when I don't come from there (in fact I come from pretty much directly across the entire world from New Zealand)? If the title of the article is <i>List of flags featuring one or more stars and the colours red, blue and white</i>, it doesn't make sense not to include a flag featuring one or more stars and the colours red, blue and white, as the New Zealand flag does. If you want to amend the rules to exclude flags that feature the Union Jack, rename the article to List of flags featuring one or more stars and the colours red, blue and white but not the Union Jack. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">‚Äî <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 12:12, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, let's do that and rename the article. Anyway, I too am not really contented with its current name. But first we have to settle on some name, which would clearly describe the list. I think that you too will agree that the title you just proposed ("...but not the Union Jack") would make the title even longer and less straight-forward. I have tried to give explanation on the purpose of this list above, but fail to find out a good name so far. Probably we should start from the other end, and not give the name according to what the flags feature, but rather to the similarities. Still, my worries about listing it simply as being derivates of the U. S. flags are expressed above. If you propose a fitting solution for another name, I am for <b>rename</b> as well. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahma_d385.html" title="User:Blahma">Blahma</a> 12:24, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Yet something worth thinking over: Originally I did not intent to include the U. S. flag in the list and the goal was just to list all flags which feature a <i>single</i> star and the colors mentioned. Also the title, which originally was <i>List of flags featuring a star and the colors red, blue and white</i>, respected this original intention. However, somehow also I got influenced by the ubiquitous U. S. flag and decided to include this as well, maybe also because of historical reasons and its relationship with some of those flags already listed. Now I think I could withdraw from it (also in order to make the original purpose of showing just <i>really similar</i> flags together), so we could resign on listing the U. S. flag, which would make it easier to find a suitable title for the article (maybe something which would include <i>lone star flags</i>, as this is a common enough term which could constitute a group of flags - but take this just as an idea). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahma_d385.html" title="User:Blahma">Blahma</a> 12:31, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

If we would make the present <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_flags_by_design.html" title="List of flags by design">List of flags by design</a> into a gallery (which I think would be a good idea, since if one is focused at the design, it would be good if they could see the designs immediately and all at once, instead of having to click on each of the links), then we could also easily incorporate the contents of this article into such a gallery and this article would become superfluous (and could be also redirected to that gallery). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahma_d385.html" title="User:Blahma">Blahma</a> 12:39, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I also did a google. There were plenty of articles with "atheistic" and "creationism," but I found only two links, both to the same very brief personal essay, that contained "atheistic creationism." Interestingly, the essay revision is dated July 1 of this year--the same as the Wikipedia article and the 3 revisions made by Bokkibear. I suspect Bokkibear is one and the same as Chris Richard Harter (AKA Chris Harter, AKA C. Richard Harter), and that this "atheistic creationism" is his own pet idea. Are there any articles on the subject by other authors, or any scholarly apologies reconciling creationism with atheism?<a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 03:07, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

For our overly loving voters, remember that Wikipedia can only have articles that are <i>verifiable.</i> All attempts thusfar of verifying have failed. Given the silliness in the first version, it's probably a good idea to check one's <i>assumption</i> of good faith against the <i>execution on the screen.</i> Once unsourced, irrational claims start showing up, there is evidence of bad faith to counter your assumption of good faith. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:21, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

I will agree with Tony Sidaway on one point: the reason one is an admin is that one is trusted to make interpretations. If one shows that one cannot be trusted to interpret, then that one should no longer be an admin. When this hoax was stripped down to its non-vandalized elements, it was a substub. However, you will note that I did not actually go ahead and delete the article, which I will do if I feel that it is an unambiguous speedy delete candidate.

<li>Kappa, that's a down-right pointless definition of fame. By this reasoning any person who is ever featured in a major movie even if just for a fraction of a second, has "an enormous audience".

I note, however that all four of the "merge" opinions came before <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a>'s comment about the merge and the copyvio finding. I confirm his finding that the copyvio is still in the article's history. I also note that this article is an orphan which seems to contradict the claim that this is a "notable product".</p>
<p>Given the copyvio, I am going to exercise my discretion and call this one as a "delete" decision. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 00:08, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Simply mentioning she came out with a perfume, doesn't require a merge. It's something editors can do (and I guess have done), without using content here, which has no value. The last para is copyvio from mass e-mail, so deleting the whole article, with edit history, is probably good. Also, the normal GFDL requirement to keep the source of text used in a merge, doesn't apply, since all useful information comes from the Britney's e-mail sent out and her web site, which is copyrighted, and not licensed under GFDL. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 10:50, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Apparently the record label exists. But only 2,330 Google hits makes me wonder whether it's encyclopedic. Also, note the vanity-like writing ("<b>Abnotic</b> was founded in 2004 by <b>Hassan Ansari</b>, a proven teen prodigy." <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">Ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> 05:34, September 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Getting over 10,000 hits a day just for its instrumentals page makes the label quite worthy of an article. Plus the website counter shows well over 25,000 hits, while the website is still fairly new. www.soundclick.com/freebeatsbyabnotic is operated by Abnotic's producers on Soundclick.com. Soundclick has the world-leading internet charts with millions of songs on its servers, yet Abnotic still managed to stay number one on the charts for years. If you check the Soundclick.com front page, FREE BEATS by Abnotic is the second-best overall artist (charts are updated everyday). <small>unsigned comment by 68.9.59.75 05:52, 11 September 2005 EDT</small></p>

<p>Albums have been released by the artists, but not yet under the record label. The vanity was there, but is now removed. A $50,000 project is in process right now for the album "The Dawning". The artists from the record label, including the founder, have been featured on MTV and VH1. The Hulk DVD features menu tracks produced by Hassan. The label is fairly new, recently launched in 2004. However, the artists under it have years of experience. Unreleased songs by its artists are in rotation on many radio stations around the nation. The label recently raised $18,000 for the victims of Katrina with a concert in Hartford, CT. If any vanity still exists, please feel free to reword it. And again, albums have been released by the artists and the first official album under the record label is due in a few months. Peter Gunz, Mr.Lucci and Lord Tariq are some known names supporting the label. <small>unsigned comment by 172.163.18.11 20:52, 11 September 2005</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> promotional article. Wikipedia is not an appropriate venue to promote your record label. The <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=abnoticrecords.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=abnoticrecords.com" rel="nofollow">Alexa rankings</a> show that <a href="http://www.abnoticrecords.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.abnoticrecords.com/" rel="nofollow">abnoticrecords.com</a> is not in the top 100,000 web sites. What makes a record label notable? Web site traffic? Famous artists? I think that what a record label is about is producing records, and your label has not yet released one. You write that "Abnotic still managed to stay number one on the [Soundclick] charts for years" and that "The label is fairly new, recently launched in 2004." Apparently it has been on the charts longer than it has been in existence, which would be pretty impressive if it were not a load of bull. Here's a crazy idea: become famous for making records <i>first</i>, then get in the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 06:36, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
The article is in no way promotional. It does not tell people to buy music from the label, or even mention a URL. There are basic facts about the label in the article. Famous artists....well, there are many "famous" artists that neither I nor you have heard of. A record label is about talent and the quality of the music. However, the article, again, does not state anything about the record label being the best at making music! It states facts...not opinions. I am sure you have never heard many names working with our label, such as Talib Kweli...does that make them not "famous" or untalented? NO! In fact, Talib is a genius, and he is one of the many people supporting our upcoming release, "The Dawning". As mentioned before, the label's artists have released albums while signed under various other labels and have been making music for years. The name Abnotic was a name of a group containing about 14 artists and producers who decided to make it a label. Abnotic has been on top of the charts FOR YEARS and STILL IS ON TOP OF THE CHARTS, except now with the word "Records" after it. The label is new, however, the name and the people working under it have been making music for over 12 years! In fact, Mos Def and Talib are both on Wikipedia! Other names supporting our label include XI, an artist/producer who recently went on tour with the Ying Yang Twins (major), Wyshmaster, who produced for EA Sports NBA Ballers video game and Peter Gunz, who has worked with Nore, a major artist in the music industry. We also have produced for HUNDREDS of labels around the world! Calling our team unfamous bullshiters is a pretty deep statement, especially when you don't personally know the people who make up the label. And the whole point of the article is so people can get to know the subject...same as the point of every other article in Wikipedia. You can blame almost ANYTHING listed in Wikipedia as a form of promotion, but WE ARE NOT TRYING TO PROMOTE. THE GOAL IS TO LET THE WORLD KNOW THAT THERE IS SUCH A LABEL AND IT HAS SOME AMAZING PEOPLE WORKING BEHIND IT AND IT HAS HUGE GOALS WHICH IT MAY SOMEDAY REACH! With over a million fans worldwide, I think the label deserves a spot on Wikipedia. It seems as if the matter is related more towards racism or descrimination against the type of music the label than your concerns of it not being good enough.</p>
<p>It has known people working for it who have been working on and off in the major industry for years. It has been on top of the most respected internet charts and still is! It has music in rotation on over 150 broadcast radio stations world wide. It has produced for hundreds of other labels around the world. It has had music featured on MTV and VH1. MTV Cribs and Pimp My Ride should be some recognizable names. It has over a million fans who have purchased CDs from its artists. However, the albums were not released under Abnotic Records. The team is made up of award winning artists and producers. The label is without a doubt legit. It has already put on 2 concerts in Connecticut. I CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH OVER FIVE THOUSAND EMAIL ADDRESSES OF FANS OF THE LABEL! Now these are only the ones who signed up for our mailing list online. AND YOU CAN CONTACT support@soundclick.com and ask them about the history of the two accounts associated with Abnotic: Abnotic Records and Free Beats by Abnotic. Finally, have a listen for yourself and judge if the quality of the music is as good, if not better than many major, or as you call them, famous, artists.</p>

<p>&amp;</p>
<p>www.soundclick.com/abnoticrecords</p>
<p><br />
YOU WILL SEE WHAT WE MEAN. OH YES, YOU CAN ALSO CHECK THE NUMBER OF INTERNET RADIO STATIONS PLAYING OUR MUSIC! SHOULD BE WELL OVER 100!</p>
<p>And if you still feel Abnotic Records is not worthy of an article, feel free to remove it. I'm done wasting my time trying to explain why we deserve a spot on Wikipedia and reading false accusations. If you read right, I mentioned that the people in the label have been making music for years. Abnotic Records was just launched in 2004, but the people running the show have been earning awards and been on top of the charts for over a decade! mp3.com, soundclick.com, best new talent, ears showcase, you name it, we've done it. We are members of The Orchard distribution company...AND....</p>
<p>ONE LAST THING....</p>
<p>Our website is only a few months old! PLUS THE ARTICLE IS NOT ON OUR WEBSITE, IT'S ON THE LABEL! AND ALL OF OUR TRAFFIC IS BASED ON www.soundclick.com/freebeatsbyabnotic</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/flame21014/traffic.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/flame21014/traffic.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/flame21014/traffic.jpg</a></p>
<p>ABOVE ARE THE TRAFFIC REPORTS FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS. AND THESE ARE ONLY FOR OUR BEATS PAGE. WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER MUSIC PAGE ON SOUNDCLICK RECEIVING ABOUT THE SAME TRAFFIC AS THE BEATS AND OF COURSE, OUR OFFICIAL WEBSITE. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME ABNOTIC DOES NOT HAVE ANY TRAFFIC!?</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Bloodlust Software has been making underground games for a decade and was around during the first days of Shareware. They helped pioneer what was possible with fighting games on the PC. They've created games for Troma Entertainment (Toxic Avenger, Cannibal: The Musical) in the past. How is this not notable? The emulators were popular, sure, but they weren't original entertainment.</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> I do believe that the entire point of the Wikipedia is to serve as the most comprehensive Internet resource. By that token, there can indeed be an article on everything and anything. Also, I do not think that articles on The Simple Life, Insane Clown Posse, and Inuyasha are exactly important or worthy of encyclopedic value, but here they are...</li>

<p>Partly agreed to. When you say non-notable to internet group, in a way you are challenging the authority of all those internet communities made on net including the Wikipedia Community. So should we say that Wikipedia too is non-notable??</p>

<p>However, leaving aside these issues, an organization is identified with its aims and objectives and its contribution towards a society. The Young Uttaranchal has been involved in various field activities such as <a href="http://younguttaranchal.com/projects/project1/" class="external text" title="http://younguttaranchal.com/projects/project1/" rel="nofollow">Organizing essay writing competition in schools of Uttaranchal</a> and presently is involved in <a href="http://younguttaranchal.com/projects/project2/" class="external text" title="http://younguttaranchal.com/projects/project2/" rel="nofollow">Compiling / Publishing a Book on Career Guidance for the Students of Uttaranchal</a>. The work of the group speaks for itself.</p>
<p>Just go through this article in Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Bengal" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Bengal" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Bengal</a></p>
<p>When dead movements are mentioned no harm in mentioning a live one. Afterall Wikipedia is a Community meant for the Community.</p>

<p>Though 1200 member, Young Uttaranchal, is voice of one of the poorest state of India, where internet density is below 0.1%. The group members have added sigificant information about uttaranchal on wikipedia. Wikipedia should encourage such group. --Ganesh</p>
<p><b>Retain</b> Cannot agree to <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a>.

<li>There is a federal government body called Geoscience Australia, which is "the national agency for geoscience research and geospatial information", and it has a database on place names of Australia, which <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/map/names/" class="external text" title="http://www.ga.gov.au/map/names/" rel="nofollow">you can search here</a>, and I encourage you to do exactly that, because it will reveal there is no suburb called "Ashfield North" or "North Ashfield".</li>
<li>Local knowledge: I have lived less than 200 metres from Ashfield <b>for the past 9 years</b>, and I have never heard of this suburb called "Ashfield North".</li>
<li>Street Directory: The definitive Sydney street directory is called the UBD, and it contains a comprehensive list of "Suburbs and Localities". This list does not contain any entry for "Ashfield North" or "North Ashfield".</li>
<li>When I asked the person who added these suburbs about this, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html#Sydney_Suburbs" title="User talk:Nickj">they indicated there was "a bit of gunk"</a> in the data they were using.</li>

<li>The current <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Sydney_suburbs_28df.html" title="List of Sydney suburbs">list of Sydney suburbs</a> should be fairly complete and definitive (errors and omissions can happen of course, but I'd venture to say it's now &gt; 95% accurate), and myself and others have put a lot of effort into making it as accurate as we can, so if something is not on that list then it's most probably not a suburb.</li>
<li>For all of the above factual reasons, if you do not delete this entry, then there is something very seriously wrong. In fact, when I mentioned that there was to be a vote over whether to delete a ficitional suburb to my partner she burst out laughing, and proceeded to ruthlessly mock the Wikipedia, and in all honesty she's got a very valid point. -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 00:02, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That's a stamp or envelope from 1957, which is 48 years ago. For all I know there may have been a place called that then, but there sure isn't now.</li>
<li>It clearly says "POLLING PLACE" on that page.

Are seriously suggesting that "INFANTS HOME" qualifies as a suburb?</li>
<li>Same as above, it's the name of a voting station. The paragraph above refers to "Stanmore Public School" in the same way. Are you proposing that "Stanmore Public School" is a suburb? The paragraph below that refers to "Marrickville Town Hall" in the same way. Are you seriously proposing that "Marrickville Town Hall" qualifies as a suburb?</li>
<li>They're spammers! They're trying to make a link farm to push up their google rankings, so you already know they can't be trusted. In fact, if you go to <a href="http://www.sydney.communityguide.com.au/" class="external free" title="http://www.sydney.communityguide.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sydney.communityguide.com.au/</a> you'll see that they also consider "Hmas Kuttabul" to be a suburb of Sydney!

<dd>&lt;rant&gt; Please, enough with the silly arguments. Google is not a substitute for using your brain. It's not a suburb, OK? I should know, because I've spent much of the past week cleaning up the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Sydney_suburbs_28df.html" title="List of Sydney suburbs">list of Sydney suburbs</a>, plus I live right next to it. Moreover, there is a government body that exists to define what is and is not a suburb. They say no. You can't just randomly make up new ones up whenever you feel like it! Jeez, I'm dealing with morons! I really cannot believe I'm seriously wasting my time having this discussion - for me, it defines everything that is wrong with the Wikipedia, in which people with knowledge backed up with references aren't given more credence than people who don't know what they're talking about, and in which getting the most useless crap deleted becomes an extended political process! &lt;/rant&gt; -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 02:20, 12 September 2005 (UTC) P.s. sorry for the rant - but it was that, or kick the cat.</dd>

S. I was trying to determine whether this was a case where there are neighborhoods that have informal names that are not officially recognized, together with strongly-held but <i>varying</i> local opinions on the validity of said names. It is sometimes hard to distinguish between the rightous indignation of someone truly well informed, and the simulated authority of a POV-pusher. Sometimes the name of a post office or a polling place is an administrative convenience that is all but ignored by locals, and sometimes it is the neighborhood's "real" name. People who live in Boston <b>never</b> say "I live in Boston." They say "I live in Jamaica Plain" or "I live in West Roxbury" or "I live in Roslindale." Not a parallel case, because these are not just post office names; the neighborhoods‚Äîwhich are <i>officially</i> called neighborhoods‚Äîdo have official existence. Anyway, there's a reason I made a <b>comment</b> rather than a vote... <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:16, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry, I apologize, I overreacted in my response. You are fully entitled to play devil's advocate and ensure that there is merit to the proposed deletion. I was frustrated with the Wikipedia's process (in particular the asymmetrical nature of how quick and easy it is to unilaterally get content added, but how hard and slow it is to get multilateral consent to get bad content deleted), but that does not just justify my response, and I apologize. -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 00:01, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Extremely Strong Delete</b>, because <b>this suburb does not exist!</b>:
<ul>
<li>There is a state government body that defines suburbs called <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Geographical_Names_Board_of_NSW_35ee.html" title="The Geographical Names Board of NSW">the Geographical Names Board of NSW</a>. You can <a href="http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/name/search" class="external text" title="http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/name/search" rel="nofollow">search their database</a>, and I encourage you to do exactly that, because it will reveal there is no suburb called "Ashfield South" or "South Ashfield".</li>
<li>There is a federal government body called Geoscience Australia, which is "the national agency for geoscience research and geospatial information", and it has a database on place names of Australia, which <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/map/names/" class="external text" title="http://www.ga.gov.au/map/names/" rel="nofollow">you can search here</a>, and I encourage you to do exactly that, because it will reveal there is no suburb called "Ashfield South" or "South Ashfield".</li>
<li>Local knowledge: I have lived less than 200 metres from Ashfield <b>for the past 9 years</b>, and I have never heard of this suburb called "Ashfield South".</li>
<li>Street Directory: The definitive Sydney street directory is called the UBD, and it contains a comprehensive list of "Suburbs and Localities". This list does not contain any entry for "Ashfield South" or "South Ashfield".</li>
<li>When I asked the person who added these suburbs about this, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html#Sydney_Suburbs" title="User talk:Nickj">they indicated there was "a bit of gunk"</a> in the data they were using.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../m/u/n/Municipality_of_Ashfield_05fe.html" title="Municipality of Ashfield">local council</a> which would cover this suburb (if it existed) <a href="http://www.ashfield.nsw.gov.au/council/profile.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ashfield.nsw.gov.au/council/profile.htm" rel="nofollow">defines the actual suburbs</a> it covers, and it says "the Municipality includes Ashfield, Summer Hill, Haberfield, the eastern part of Croydon and the fringes of Croydon Park, Hurlstone Park and Ashbury." Note that there is no mention of "Ashfield South" or "South Ashfield".</li>
<li>The current <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Sydney_suburbs_28df.html" title="List of Sydney suburbs">list of Sydney suburbs</a> should be fairly complete and definitive (errors and omissions can happen of course, but I'd venture to say it's now &gt; 95% accurate), and myself and others have put a lot of effort into making it as accurate as we can, so if something is not on that list then it's most probably not a suburb.</li>
<li>For all of the above factual reasons, if you do not delete this entry, then there is something very seriously wrong. In fact, when I mentioned that there was to be a vote over whether to delete a ficitional suburb to my partner she burst out laughing, and proceeded to ruthlessly mock the Wikipedia, and in all honesty she's got a very valid point. -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 00:02, 12 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There has to be a vote, not because a fictional suburb is so controversial, but because if there were no review process then someone could just go in and delete <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 05:37, 12 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I know, I just feel there has got to be a better way. For example, let me make a constructive suggestion: if an article or redirect is less than 1 week old, then any logged in user with &gt; 1000 edits can speedy delete. Also any user should be able to speedy delete any article where they are the only contributor, irrelevant of article age, or whether they are anon (which would make it easier for people to fix silly mistakes). That would prevent Sydney from being deleted, and it would also prevent anons from deleting new valid content created by others, yet it would allow everyone to fix their own mistakes. Essentially it would allow a reasonable level of trust that is currently lacking from the deletion process, whilst avoiding the worst problems. -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 00:13, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - it is my understanding that you do not need to nominate a disambiguation page for deletion if it is disambiguating between an article that does exist and one that does not, as this would more be considered a technical correction.

The same applies here. There are plenty of sources that discuss the many varieties of ball games that there are, according to Google Web alone. Also according to Google Web, this game isn't mentioned in any of them by this name. The article cites no sources itself, of course. This is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, the publication of a newly invented ball game (or, at the very least, a newly invented name for a ball game) in Wikipedia.

<p>The article is about a former band with no results on <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com/" rel="nofollow">allmusic</a>. Most of the information in the article is sourced from the band's web site, or band member's or fan's blogs. This is the second time I have nominated this article for deletion. I believe the outcome of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mind_Pollution_cb37.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mind Pollution">previous vote</a> was influenced by multiple unsigned keep votes from the article's creator, and a lack of interest on the part of other Wikipedians. I would ask that people review the article, the previous vote, and follow the links in the article. Some are broken, and some don't show what the article claims. For instance, a search on the Marilyn Manson site turns up no references to either Mind Pollution or Sin Star.

The sources are from their official news from years ago in the internet archives.. This information cannot be altered. This was the source for several things. What is wrong with citing Fan Sites as sources&#160;? What is wrong with citing the band members Blogs as sources. You know for a fact that those Livejournal entries &amp; dates cannot be forged. There are pictures of Davien Crow (the singer of the band) with [Gidget Gein] ... I dont even feel like repeating the fact they can be found on SO MANY different sites. AND I DONT NEED TO POINT OUT THE FACT THIS IS RELATED TO [SIN STAR] .... David stop lying and handing people bullshit. I don't know what your problem is with this band, but you could at least be Honest instead of taking things out of context to try and get rid of them WHEN YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY put no effort into looking at the sources and only keep pointing out some of the official site sources and so on. NONE OF YOU ARE READING THINGS OVER. THEY MEET WP:MUSIC by at least completing 2 catagories&#160;! not to mention other ways.

<li>I followed the link to marilyn-manson.net. I see nothing about Sin Star on the front page. I entered a site search for "Sin Star".

There were no results for Mind Pollution. You are correct that <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com/" rel="nofollow">allmusic</a> does have something on them. A search for "Sin Star" finds a "Sin Star Project" with the following information: "Genre: Rock". Again, there were no results for Mind Pollution. If you search for a real band on allmusic, you would find their albums and much other information. I have by now spent hours looking at your sources, and I have no problem whatsoever with this band. I wish them much success, and I hope someday they make it and are deserving of an encyclopedia article. You say they have albums. Can I buy any of these albums in a music store? I searched Borders, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Amazon, with no success. Livejournals entries cannot be forged? Anyone can write anything they want in a blog or on their own website.

<li><b>MERGE</b> with [Sin Star] as a sub section. There is no reason for there to be an article on Mind Pollution when [Sin Star] better meets WP:MUSIC with the aid of this article.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> If it is not merged I say keep it. It meets the Guidelines set by Wikipedia for WP:Music ... They have 2 national, verifiable tours (through fan sites and the internet archives, the archives cannot be altered) and have releases on notable independant labels Kid Atrium and Mushroomcloud records as said before. There are also several other non-music related guidelines both articles meet.

<li><b>Comment</b> None of you have reviewed the article, pointed out what information is false, can back up your claims that they are false, there are several lies or mistakes in David's statement and it is simply unfair to vote DELETE just because there might be sockpuppetts.

If this article is deleted it will be against your own standards and rules that it is done so and I'm sure it will just continue to be a problem for everyone. <b>SO I ASK YOU ALL TO TAKE THE TIME TO ACTUALLY LOOK OVER THE ARTICLE AND POINT OUT VALID REASONS FOR IT TO BE DELETED, THAT ARENT FALSE LIKE MOST OF DAVIDS</b>, JUST AS WE WHO WANT IT KEPT HAVE POINTED OUT SEVERAL VALID VERIFIABLE REASONS THAT IT MEETS WP:MUSIC BY 2 REQUREIMENTS WHEN ONLY 1 IS NEEDED&#160;!!!!!!!.

<li><b>Comment</b> David Conrad is faling to mention that several of the sources such as Rock Detector, Allmusic.com, IMDB, VH1, Blabbermouth, The Internet Archives (Waybackmachine.org), soundlick, and SMNnews are the source of most of the information. There are several obvious, blatant, credible sources of their link to bands such as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Manson_e590.html" title="Marilyn Manson">Marilyn Manson</a>, especially in the case of <a href="../../../g/i/d/Gidget_Gein_afd5.html" title="Gidget Gein">Gidget Gein</a>, and Nancy Marzulli.I beleive David is trying his best to misguide the readers into ignoring the factual notable places with references to Sin Star. There are plenty of bands such as Orgy for whom you cannot easily find results on google for because of the adult entertainment industry related links that appear. Christina Jacobs 00:19, 13 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Rock Detector has a link to register and the copy "GOT AN ALBUM TO SELL? Sell it on Rockdetector!" on the front page. Apparently, anyone can sign up to sell an album there. Allmusic has nothing but "Genre: Rock" about "Sin Star Project". I searched for an actual notable indie artist, Ani DiFranco, and found a wealth of information. We are not discussing an article on Marilyn Manson, Gidget Gein, Nancy Marzulli, Orgy, or anyone else other than Sin Star. I entered a search for Sin Star on Blabbermouth.net and found nothing related. I did find them on <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=236907" class="external text" title="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=236907" rel="nofollow">soundclick.com</a>, but not on Borders, Barnes &amp; Noble, or Amazon. I have no intention of misleading anyone. I hope all interested Wikipedians will look at all the evidence and vote as they see fit. For myself, I would much rather be spending my time on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Missing_encyclopedic_articles_25fe.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Missing encyclopedic articles">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Missing_encyclopedic_articles</a>, but I am concerned that if people use Wikipedia as free web space to promote themselves, eventually Wikipedia will lose both support and reputation. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 04:13, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to point out that there have several contributors to this article. Some of the quotes may have been fans adding to it. The quotes pointed out by david "promotional activities carried out by fans have gone as far as having MTV.com tricked into placing a Sin Star artist biography on their site however this was promptly removed the same day" is essential to the facts about the internet promotion, there is also a screenshot of the article. The quote "Sin Star's debut full length album (under that name) has been in the works for over a year now ... this LP will be released commercially through national distributor 101distribution with or without the aid of a major label" is taken from information found on their official site's news posting. I reall don't think this is a Vanity page, they don't even have this much information about themselves up. I also noticed somone has deleted their real names (perhaps the bands doing??) Christina Jacobs 00:33, 13 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because of the structure, or lack thereof, of the rest of this page, I will simply respond to a few points here, and then wash my hands of this. I don't doubt that these individuals are ruthless self-promoters. My concern about the MTV.com quote is that it suggests that they may be doing the same thing to Wikipedia now. If their album comes out next year and is a huge hit (and I wish them luck in that), there will be plenty of opportunity to create an article about them then. Regarding the mention on <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0311988/bio" class="external text" title="http://imdb.com/name/nm0311988/bio" rel="nofollow">imdb.com</a>, I don't see how that supports their notability. I did find the listing on BMI. It seems they have a song licensed by BMI. Is BMI producing their debut album, due out next year? Can I buy any of their music at my local record store? Most of the other sites, like Myspace, BYOFL, and Bandname Register, are ones that anyone can put anything on. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 04:13, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>MERGE</b> Mind Pollution should be merged into Sin Star as a new section in the article. I am not going to join this site just to argue about this, but I will support that the article is correct, the sources are credible. David is taking things out of context and has stated false information in some cases above.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with the other posters that claim David has misguided the readers of this discussion. Most notable in the fact <a href="http://Allmusic.com" class="external text" title="http://Allmusic.com" rel="nofollow">Allmusic</a> does have an entry for Sin Star and there are several links to sites such as <a href="http://imdb.com" class="external text" title="http://imdb.com" rel="nofollow">IMDB.com</a>, VH1:Driven's episode guide, and even screenshots backing up the bands links to Marilyn Manson. I will admit Sin Star is hard to find through SOME searches, but I have found many more links that David would lead us to beleive exist.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> David has not backed up his claims with links or evidence. Where as Sin-thetik has (as well as previous posters on the previous pages). I beleive he is simply asking people to take his side.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Fits Criterea for WP:MUSIC ... David Do you have anything better to do than to try to get rid of this band when you KNOW YOU ARE WRONG&#160;? There are several bands on here who are not Signed to a Major Label, They have released music under Mushroomcloud Records, are a member of <a href="http://bmi.com" class="external text" title="http://bmi.com" rel="nofollow">BMI</a>, They are directly linked to [Marilyn Manson], [Gidget Gein], The Band Orgy, [Suicide Girls], and several other famous people and organizations. Several of the sources are LARGE sites such as [SMNpromotions.com SMNPromotions] and [Marilyn-MAnson.net Marilyn-Manson.net] which can even be found on Marilyn Manson's entry here at Wikipedia. [VH1] is one of the cited sources, [Nancy Marzulli] makes a TV appearence in this, they have been on 2 Nation Tours under a different name, They have Several CDs such as (LPs, EPs, and so on) that were short run Nationally Distributed places. There are other sources that include [RockDetector], They have a Music Video Out, Davien Crow has works on other band's albums released in places such as <a href="http://hottopic.com" class="external text" title="http://hottopic.com" rel="nofollow">Hottopic</a>... You keep trying to twist the quotes around into something they are not and are trying your best to mislead people into not noticing the other significant sources. ALLMUSIC.COM DOES HAVE THEM LISTED I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO POINTED THIS OUT&#160;! <a href="http://BYOFL.org" class="external text" title="http://BYOFL.org" rel="nofollow">BYOFL</a> has them listed. <a href="http://Bandnameregister.com" class="external text" title="http://Bandnameregister.com" rel="nofollow">Bandname Register</a> has them listed. There are several promotional companies listed in the sources that have information on them. If you were paying attention you would notice that Sin Star's CDs are currently out of print, which is why they are no longer avalible on this site. You really are a iggnorant and naive individual with absolutely no researching skills David Conrad. AS FAR AS MYSPACE.COM GOES if you should be aware that even bands as big as [Nine Inch Nails] and [Motely Crue] use Myspace.com for promotional reasons. ALSO STOP TRYING TO TWIST THIS QUOTE AROUND "Sin Star's debut full length album (under that name) has been in the works for over a year now ... this LP will be released commercially through national distributor 101distribution with or without the aid of a major label" that is a cited quote from one of their sites, 101distribution is a major national distributor, and the fact that it says the debut LP is under THAT NAME should show any literate person there has been a nationally released under another name and also ... ALSO AN LP is a full length album, EPs are Albums as well (Short ones) under 12 tracks or so. REDEFINE Magazine out of seattle will be featuring their back cover ad this fall issue (as cited on their site recently). One of the sources is Blabbermouth.net which is owned by major label Roadrunner Records&#160;! I'm not sure what else you need other than perhaps some glasses to see that this entry meets all criterea&#160;! The list goes on and on and on and on... You truely are turning this into something personal... And your just going to keep making a Fool of yourself by lying&#160;!!! TO SHOW IT MEETS WP:MUSIC I will highlight in Bold which critereas they meet and provide sources if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Musicians and ensembles There are a lot of bands, singers and other musicians and musical ensembles with articles in the Wikipedia (see category:Musicians).</p>
<p>A musician or ensemble (note that this includes a band, singer, rapper, orchestra, hip hop crew, dj etc) is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</p>
<p>Has had a Top 100 hit on any national music chart, in a large or medium-sized country*</p>
<p><b>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in a large or medium-sized country*</b> They have been on 2 national tours. 1 of which was halted after 2 or 3 shows into it (i forget what the article said). The information those tours can EASILY be found by looking at the internet archives for their official site. Why would an then upcoming band's tours be featured on large sites&#160;? A lot of sites containing such information such as mp3.com no longer exist.</p>
<p><b>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable)</b> They music released under Mushroomcloud Records.</p>
<p><b>Has been prominently featured in any major music media</b> Blabbermouth.net , SMNpromotions.com , their manager on [VH1] (all you have to do is watch the episode to see Nancy Marzulli I will find a screenshot if needed) , [IMDB.com Internet Movie Database (IMDB)] has them under [Gidget Gein]'s biography. MegaMetalOnline.com, SMNews.com, and Allmusic all have Sin Star. These sites are some of the largest music sites and databases on the net.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out this quote from WP:MUSIC "A good online resource for music and musicians is the All Music Guide, (<a href="http://www.allmusic.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.allmusic.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.allmusic.com/</a>) which although often out of date, does give a level of indication as to what a band or musician has done." Don't you guys think that since Sin Star is on Allmusic.com that perhaps the information just hasnt been put up yet&#160;? Use your heads.</p>
<p>As far as [Mind Pollution] goes, don't you think Sin Star would have changed most information and profiles online about [Mind Pollution] into [Sin Star] by now&#160;? That all fan sites would have converted or gone away, and since the CDs are out of print there would no longer be in catalogs&#160;??????</p>

<li>Nancy Marzulli was featured on VH1:Driven - Marilyn Manson , She was their manager and that is easily verifiable. Nancy Marzulli was one of Manson's superiors at the 25th Parallel Magazine that he worked at when they were Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids. Read any biography that goes back that far and you will have your source.</li>
<li>[Gidget Gein] is Marilyn Manson's former Bassplayer, there are videos online of [Sin Star] members Davien Crow and Alison bordan , as well as Nancy Marzulli with him at his debut Artshow in Miami FL. They were guests. There are also pictures online of this (the video is linked on the entry). It is also stated on <a href="http://IMDB.com" class="external text" title="http://IMDB.com" rel="nofollow">IMDB</a> on [Gidget Gein]'s profile that they were responsible for one of his nicknames.

Information can be found there easily.

<li>I disagree, because their official sites and several sites related to them DO show up first when searching for them.They have had plenty of time and really do meet WP:MUSIC .. Some things are harder to verify than others David. I hope you consider some of the more intangible sources that were listed. BTW where else other than an official site would keep records of a national tour not sponsored by Tickermaster&#160;??? or a Major Label&#160;??

</ul>
<ol>
<li>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in a large or medium-sized country*</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>They have been on 2 national tours in the US, one was cut short, there are links to information, dates, and footage of these shows linked directly in the sources. Most from the internet archives which are intangible. There is also information listed on several fan created sites about these tours and random information in other places.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>How they qualify: Releases on Mushroomcloud Records, Kid Atrium Music, and their self owned label Red Pill Music. Allmusic.com has them listed as the Sin Star Project and does not have information on their EPs, Singles, and other things any longer because such older media is out of print (as it is stated in some of the sources).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN LP/Full Length Album (which is mentioned as the Debut) and an EP (extended play) Album , single CD, and so on. I hope you guys realize this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Promotional language was probably added by a fan, it appears several people have attempted to FIX the article to get rid of b/s and promotional shit somone added. It's not like you guys can't remove it yourself.. your just obviously trying to get it removed with a bias.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Has been prominently featured in any major music media</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>How they possibly qualify: Manager was on VH1:Driven. Sin Star is mentioned in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Manson_e590.html" title="Marilyn Manson">Marilyn Manson</a>'s former bassist <a href="../../../g/i/d/Gidget_Gein_afd5.html" title="Gidget Gein">Gidget Gein</a>'s profile on [<a href="http://imdb.com" class="external text" title="http://imdb.com" rel="nofollow">IMDB</a>]. IMDB is a major movie and music database. Allmusic.com has them listed as the Sin Star Project.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Just because some items are no longer catalouged because of companies that went under and are now RARE does not mean they did not exist. Why would an intangible source from 1 - 5 years ago be a lie&#160;? Because it's obviously not possible for it to had been changed just to get on this encyclopedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>So can somone actually make an argument&#160;? NO , why&#160;? Because the sources are legit and noone is paying attention. THEY ARE CLEARLY MARKED AND I SERIOUSLY DOUBT ANY OF YOU have viewed them all, because even I haven't, but there are VERY KEY LEGIT MAJOR SOURCES LISTED!! <i>Pay attention, don't be lazy.</i></p>

<li>Yellowikis doesn't "grab" articles, Uncle G's bot transwikis them. Yellowikis has been around for just over one year. Most of the articles are considered incomplete in some way so they are marked as stubs - and for that reason they are not included in the count of legitimate pages. Yellowikis isn't a business. The use of the "rel=nofollow" tag prevents the external link from acting as linkspam.--Yellowikis Admin 01:33, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>WP has lots of links to other WikiMedia Projects that are in construction - We thought that it would be OK to link to a FDL, non-profit, (but non-foundation project). Uncle G advised against it so we stopped. But I still think we should be able to encourage people to add information to Yellowikis. Just as some articles point people at WikiBooks or WikiSpecies. --Yellowikis Admin 01:33, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've now read the first and second discussions, as well as reviewing the article history. I'm confused as to why some of the cite material was redacted, and now aware it's you that causes semiautomatic transikification to happen (and if you have any ins with the team there, you may want to recommend they take some antivandalism steps!). But I have not seen anything to change my vote from keep as noted above.

<li>I'm basing that on looking at <a href="../../../t/l/_/WP%7ETL_c6c3.html" title="WP:TL">WP:TL</a>. I'm often wrong, but unless there is no human intervention required here, isn't this a long list of things that someone has to tend to as opposed to doing something else? Even if it's just bot-work, that's still disk space and server time being used. And "our resources" are those that go towards the aims of the project. If the editors doing the work are members/contributors to YW as well, I suppose it's not an issue. Not my reason for supporting deletion, though.<br />

<li>Er. I didn't say <i>"here are a bunch of resources that are <b>going</b> to be used,"</i> but I could have been more clear in that. I also said that bot work still consumes resources. It's a minor point, but I'm not seeing any indication that I'm wrong. The bot runs on Wikipedia servers, it's consuming a Wikipedia resource, albeit a tiny amount. Clearly there is such a thing as "our" resources, which is why I can't use my user page as a <i>de facto</i> myspace and why we eliminate spam. I now yield the floor.<br />

<li>What makes you think that "the bot runs on Wikipedia servers"? Was the hint from the person who runs the 'bot that <i>there are no such resources</i> perhaps too subtle an indication that it <i>doesn't</i> run on Wikipedia servers? ‚ò∫ And I didn't ask what "our resources" were in general.

Based upon clues in the discussion there, I actually located several articles myself at the time. More have been added since. Whether content is copied from here to Yellowikis is irrelevant to whether this web site is notable. But so, too, is discussion of Alexa ranking, Google hits, and article counts. Such considerations no longer form part of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and rightly so because they are <i>bad</i> metrics. WP:WEB asks for non-trivial published coverage of the site by multiple sources independent of the subject, and the article links to several such published works.

Furthermore, currently Yellowikis is not for profit, thus a place to advertise start up businesses should not really classify into this argument. Also, why aren't other articles like wikicompany etc. not being considered for deletion, seems like utmost bias to me on part of the users of wikipedia towards other wikis. --Stabani 20:25, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Devoted to a single division of a minor league of indoor American football, which isn't widely followed to begin with and already has a network of articles devoted to it. What little hard information is in this article can already be found in the <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_Football_League_e313.html" title="Arena Football League">Arena Football League</a>'s other articles. Several months ago the subject of deletion was raised on <a href="../../../a/f/l/Talk%7EAFL%27s_Southern_Division_9459.html" title="Talk:AFL's Southern Division">the article's talkpage</a> by another user; this produced a cursory attempt to improve the article, but it remains a pretty much unexpandable stub about a non-noteworthy subject. <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinabik80_d67b.html" title="User:Binabik80">Binabik80</a> 22:47, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Assuming this is a professional league, which I assume it is, and it has "12,400" paying attendees per game (according to league article), I think the league is notable. The division is a borderline case, but there seems to be an inkling of unique content about rivalaries specific to the division. I tend to follow the rule, that if sub-topics (e.g. teams) warrant an article the larger one does. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 00:34, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Two people have now said or implied that I've called the Arena Football League non-notable, which of course I have not. Rather, the AFL's <i>Southern Division</i> is non-notable. There's nothing in this article, nor can I think of anything that <i>could</i> be in this article, that wouldn't fit better elsewhere, whether in the general AFL articles or in team-specific articles. Articles on teams are not sub-topics of the divisions, they are sub-topics of the league itself. The division is an artificial construct of the league to allow it to organise competition, and discussion of it belongs in articles on the league. <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinabik80_d67b.html" title="User:Binabik80">Binabik80</a> 22:28, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, logical breakdown of league organization. Consider a rename to <i>Southern Division (AFL)</i> or the like for a more standardized name. Also, as far as "isn't widely followed" being part of the rationale, the AFL had a national broadcasting contract w/ NBC last I checked -- that's better than hockey can rate in the States.

<li>Um, the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeastern_Conference_3deb.html" title="Southeastern Conference">Southeastern Conference</a> is a complete collegiate league, not a division of anything and not professional. I would vote to merge the other two into parent-league articles if nominated.

<dd>While I acknowledge that the SEC isn't an apples-to-apples comparison, it's still reasonably similar. I'd say it's much closer to an NCAA division than a "complete league." Division vs Conference probably doesn't matter to you any more than it does to me as minor semantics. Anyway, I see these articles as filling a <i>List of whatever-it-is champions</i> (a well-established list) plus <i>List of whatever-it-is members</i> (another well-established list) plus <i>other potentially encyclopedic information about whatever-it-is</i> (and there's certainly a lot of these).
