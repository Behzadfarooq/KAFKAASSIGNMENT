However, I did not read through the University of Washington paper extensively. If the term is used exactly, I would say that it barely passes "multiple secondary sources" (with a grand total of 2). However, from a brief skim of that article the phrase is not used, and I'm assuming a delete for failure of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 17:47, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Changed to <b>Keep</b> It does seem there is more encyclopedic substance to the article now, which can be built on, and it is no longer merely a definition. There are only three sources at the moment although I googled it and more sources can definitely be added. Also I do not see how it could be merged any longer as the article it would most likely to be merged into ie. (sex-selective abortions) would not contain information on disability related abortions which this article does. It might however be possible to merge sex-selective abortions into this article since that is a subtopic here. --<a href="../../../r/d/j/User%7ERdjohnson_e4c2.html" title="User:Rdjohnson">Rdjohnson</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>Despite my original feelings I'll have to vote to keep it for the following reasons:

<li>It is fleshing out with more encyclopedic content than I originally thought it would, and isn't just a dictionary definition anymore.</li>
<li>It isn't used much but it apparently does have legitimate usage among scholarly papers.</li>
<li>I don't think it can be merged anymore since it is a distinct topic of its own, even though it is definitely relatable to other topics.--<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegaMind_6bd5.html" title="User:MegaMind"><font color="teal">MegaMind</font></a></li>

<dd>The first ref just uses the words as a descriptor not a defined term <i>per se</i> so is not a reference for the term as such, just a discussion which would be a more proper ref off abortion or disability or something else.

<li><b>Comment</b> Since this article encompasses sex-selective abortion we could just merge it under this article under a specific sex-selective abortion sub-heading instead of creating a whole new article for it. That way we could also expand the article in ways that might not necessarily involve selective abortion per se but perhaps involve prenatal discrimination in other areas like opposition for healthcare rights for pregnant mothers and their offspring or economic discrimination against pregnant mothers with fetuses. I don't know if that's relevant but I just thought I'd toss it up there as a possibility.--<a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpoisp_485b.html" title="User:Spoisp">Spoisp</a></li>
<li>Another possibility: prenatal discrimination and selective abortion might also work as a merge page if we do decide to merge it. --<a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpoisp_485b.html" title="User:Spoisp">Spoisp</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Possibly I don't know if selective abortion should necessarily be in the title then though if that kind of material is added. On the other hand I think you definitely have a point about creating a sex-selective abortion subheading although I think a selective abortion subheading would be good as a title or part of a title for the first part of the article. I also thought it might be a good idea to include material regarding attacks on pregnant women motivated by reasons for attempting to end the pregnancy based on the spouses or grandparents economic or social motivations not to permit a delivery. I do definitely think that including the information in the sex-selective abortion article in this article would be a good idea whether or not we decide to merge it. --<a href="../../../j/f/r/User%7EJfraatz_d331.html" title="User:Jfraatz">jfraatz</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The article brings together two kinds of selective abortion, sex and anti-disability selectivity. Both are notable, but they need to be linked to articles on the individual subjects (using the 'main' template, or some other). <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selective_abortion.html" title="Selective abortion">Selective abortion</a> might be a better title. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterkingiron_03d3.html" title="User:Peterkingiron">Peterkingiron</a> 00:23, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - even though this coinage has been around in this context since 1999 it does not appear to have passed into wide usage, thus apparently running afoul of <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. There do not appear to be any sources of which this is the substantial or non-trival subject. The article is sourced by a Green Bay Packers page, which is not independent, and an article which mentions the blocked kick in a sentence or two as part of a much larger article. Other sources appear to make the same sort of trivial mentions (noting that fans coined the name but nothing beyond that. And technically the "supernatural speculation" section appears to qualify as original research. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:38, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Looking at the Bears article, it has no trivia section, I assume because the people who maintain it don't want one. This is one play out of a nearly 90-year club history.

<p>A non-fiction book that was only published last year. We can't possibly have articles on every book.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The author is international security editor of <i>The Economist</i>, not a particularly noted writer, so I really don't think even criterion 5 applies. <i>He's</i> probably worthy of an article, but all his publications aren't. Attributable does not automatically equal notable. Are you suggesting we should have articles on every book ever written? They're all attributable! Effectively this is advertising for a very recent book that has not yet established its place in history. Bear in mind that Wikipedia does not consider most academics to be notable, and if they're not then their works generally aren't, so why should this particular book be notable just because it's written by a journalist? -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 10:43, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. When I see an insufficiently sourced article, I first go to Allmusic.com. In this case, I was able to find a listing, so I added it to the article. The next step would be to find a reliable source which specializes in "underground gangsta rappers". I tried <a href="http://xxlmag.com" class="external free" title="http://xxlmag.com" rel="nofollow">http://xxlmag.com</a> , but I didn't find a reference there. Perhaps there are better sources. In any event, this sounds like a case where reliable sources exist but may be hard to find. Are his albums on a notable independent label?

<li><b>Delete</b>: MySpace artists aren't linking to their labels. It's good to do extra research, but, given the ease of entry into the "rappa" market and the ease of production of CD's these days, we still need to look for those who are notable, which means standing out from the crowd, not standing in the middle of it. <a href="../../../u/t/g/User%7EUtgard_Loki_9cc9.html" title="User:Utgard Loki">Utgard Loki</a> 13:35, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Thanks for the Allmusic link, Eastmain; that spurred me to find out more about the artist. He seems to have <a href="http://www.rhapsody.com/lilconer" class="external text" title="http://www.rhapsody.com/lilconer" rel="nofollow">5 tracks</a> in <a href="../../../r/h/a/Rhapsody_%28online_music_service%29.html" title="Rhapsody (online music service)">Rhapsody</a>, a notable subscription music service that doesn't seem to allow uploads - I haven't used Rhapsody, so I may be wrong. <i>Mama Tried</i> on the label Urbanlife is the only album on which Lil Coner is the solo artist; the other 5 are compilations by the label Connected Inc. One would think that his myspace page would give clues about his work, but he isn't helping us out there today. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangerer_d331.html" title="User:Strangerer">Strangerer</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerer_0525.html" title="User talk:Strangerer">Talk</a>)</small> 15:32, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>From a linked article on the artist's Myspace page, "Ya'll know and you know we dangerous even our logo has a gun, Connected Inc. My record label dropped its first album Dec 03' and now we on our seventh." I think this seals it as a non-notable independent label. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangerer_d331.html" title="User:Strangerer">Strangerer</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerer_0525.html" title="User talk:Strangerer">Talk</a>)</small> 15:38, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yikes! I'm an 'OBSESSIVE, FRIGHTENED, LONELY MANIAC"? Anyhoo - I am a big fan of musician Gene Simmons and I also have a great interest in and respect for those who were courageous enough to survive the Holocaust and continue to love others in spite of all the evil they experienced. The fact that this woman, Flora Klein, and HER experiences so profoundly inspired her son - who went on to profoundly inspire hundreds of future rock stars is, I firmly assert, notable enough to be included on Wikipedia.

See A1 in the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Category%7ESpeedy_deletion_1a11.html" title="Category:Speedy deletion">category:speedy deletion</a>. Some people think "Old Hickory is a stoplight" is a stub, and others think it's an A1 speedy delete.

<dd>That's why I referred to it as "guidelines", rather than "policy". Our policy is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. That page doesn't deal with detail - it refers you to the guideline <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for the detail of current consensus of what kind of people are and aren't regarded as notable. Where WP:BIO is so very clear, it'd be very difficult for you to argue against applying it; an example might be someone appointed to minister of state, who died before taking office. That'd be arguable. This isn't.</dd>

<dd>naturally not I am adhering to&#160;: This list is only a guideline, and should not be used an absolute test of notability; each article should stand or fall on its own merits. I really tried to find references about this guy, to the point that I Skyped a friend of mine who works in a newspaper in Oslo. He came up with one article mentioning this guy in passing as part of the report of the swearing in ceremony. After that zilch, nada ... not even that he inaugurated a public pissoir. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 16:24, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have seen those, and basically they confirm that Bryggesaa was part of a government as member of the liberal party. That is beyond discussion and that is basically what this article says. My point is that there is nothing more.

A legitimate starting point for the article about the organisation would be references that do more than reporting standard WTA press info, but report e.g. specifically on the conference.

<li><b>Clarification</b>. The Google results below show that this is indeed a plausible search term. So, I wish to slightly to my opinion above. I still think the article should be merged to <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Hong_Kong_bc9f.html" title="Demographics of Hong Kong">Demographics of Hong Kong</a> (they are essentially the same topic, but the "Demographics of ..." prefix is established on all country articles), but I <b>strongly oppose deletion</b>. Merge and redirect instead. If a quality merge is too complex (and it seems to be, given the multiple overlapping sections of the articles), perhaps move the content into a subspace of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Talk%7EDemographics_of_Hong_Kong_d7ab.html" title="Talk:Demographics of Hong Kong">Talk:Demographics of Hong Kong</a>, which can then be deleted once the merge is completed. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 08:24, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. The article is written by numerous editors and there is a large section of discussion on the article. Deletion is very inappropriate here. There are tons of research on Hongkonger in the past decades, and Google returns 191,000 on "Hongkonger", 40,800 on "Hong Konger" and 414,000 on its Chinese title "香港人". Think of improvement first even though it could be a big project. — <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenryLi_3574.html" title="User:HenryLi">HenryLi</a> (<a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenryLi_c2e2.html" title="User talk:HenryLi">Talk</a>) 04:11, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I want to clarify that I don't mind re-creating this article if the content is well sourced and not just a bunch of original research like it currently is. But as it is, the article could use a complete rewrite. The issue of the fact that this article is poorly written was raised more than a month ago. Personally, I'm lost on how to save the article, short of a complete rewrite. Also, I'm sure the words "Hong Konger" or "香港人" can be found on a lot of webpages, so I don't think it's neologistic, but the term is hardly ever actually defined, and there is really very little resources for an article about this subject. Most HKers just have a general idea of what 香港人 means, but nobody ever bothers to actually define it in detail. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 10:52, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I guess many of us would be persuaded to keep this if there were already articles like "Shenzhen-er", "Shanghai-er" &amp; etc. But no, we don't have them. And we should not have them. When we type <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian.html" title="Canadian">Canadian</a>, we will be re-directed to Canada; when we type <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_people.html" title="American people">American people</a>, we will be redirected to "Demographics of the United States". That's probably the right way to do things.--<a href="../../../k/2E/c/User%7EK.C._Tang_75f3.html" title="User:K.C. Tang">K.C. Tang</a> 15:26, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Looking at google the pages that say HongKonger are tabloid type articles or existing Chinese sites doing a translation cause they have no better word to use. This is a slang and the page is misleading people to think it is an official term. As an encyclopedia entry, the contents are way too off track. If there is a merge, can someone suggest which part? Seriously everything about politics, citizenships and writings are already in better articles. BTW survey results are opinions in number format. There is no room to improve on an un-referencable street term IMHO. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjwong_5487.html" title="User:Benjwong">Benjwong</a> 03:35, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>To all suggesting a merge... why? Do we ever see articles that have a list of all bosses in a single video game, notable or not? This list should be deleted to create a precedence against boss lists that don't use any discrimination besides how specific the list becomes (series, game, etc.). - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 23:45, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>That's not precedence to have an article. That says "if minor characters have ARTICLES, then merge them into a list."

<ul>
<li>You are right, but no one is calling for us to keep this article. And the fact that there already exists a list to which this can be merged makes the matter less complicated (in my opinion). Also, as <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackSparrow_Ninja_f7b7.html" title="User:JackSparrow Ninja">JackSparrow Ninja</a> has noted below, the boss battles are a key part of the game, so it's not like these are completely minor characters. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:40, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I have been watching this article for several days now after watching edit wars on Recent Changes. I have listed the main issue I have with the article on its talk page: The only sources listed are 2 MySpace pages and a Greek website. The other issue is that another user has mentioned that he believes the group Gate32 is a hoax. While this cannot be proven 100%, the author has not attempted to prove that the group is <i>not</i> a hoax. Instead, the article's original author, who is also named Gate32<sup>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gate32_3d6e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gate32">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../g/a/t/User_talk%7EGate32_d230.html" title="User talk:Gate32">talk</a>)</sup>, simply removes the Hoax and Prod tags from the article without any discussion on the talk page. This has happened 4 times now. The last Prod tag was dated 2/24/2007, and the 5 day waiting period expired without the author addressing the issues with his page. That is, until he removed the tags this evening. Since the author will not cite his references, the group mentioned in the article is dubious, and the author continues to vandalize and remove relevant tags, I figure that the article is more of a nuisance than informative. However, if the author will actually cite <i>relevant</i> and <i>appropriate</i> sources for the information, I see no need to remove the article. <b><a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMec_modifier_fd30.html" title="User:Mec modifier"><font color="#000099">Mec modifier</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMec_modifier_50a6.html" title="User talk:Mec modifier"><font color="#999999">talk</font></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mec_modifier_c816.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mec modifier"><font color="#999999">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 04:06, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep without most images</b> I support keeping this article because although the paintings are all from one individual, many of the paintings actually affect major events in the show. In addition, the article provides information on how the some of the artwork is produced for the show. After reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>, I can agree that many of the images would not fall under fair use because they are not iconic. The only artwork that might be considered iconic in terms of the show is the nuclear explosion on Issac's floor, as this painting drives a main story arc throughout season 1 and is repeatedly referred to by various characters. As a side note, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artwork_of_Isaac_Mendez_48fd.html" title="Artwork of Isaac Mendez">Artwork of Isaac Mendez</a> is actually more of a <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_f2e5.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists">Wikipedia:Lists</a> than a standard article.

If this article's information is merged back into <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Mendez_2543.html" title="Isaac Mendez">Isaac Mendez</a>, it will likely return as a list in bullet or table form instead of becoming prose. - <a href="../../../f/m/m/User%7EFmmarianicolon_02b0.html" title="User:Fmmarianicolon">fmmarianicolon</a> | <a href="../../../f/m/m/User_talk%7EFmmarianicolon_bdb5.html" title="User talk:Fmmarianicolon">Talk</a> 23:07, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Reparations against modern companies for who directly benefited from or were complicit in exploitation and slavery are an interesting issue with continuing relevance (I believe Chicago recently declared that they would not do business with JP Morgan until they came clean). As best I can tell, 19th century insurance records are being used to establish such a link; except the third paragraph, which seems to have no relevance whatsoever. If the article can be repurposed to explain clearly the historical interest and the modern relevance, this would seem notable. It may, however, be necessary to discard the current version. <a href="../../../e/l/d/User%7EEldereft_fc2a.html" title="User:Eldereft">Eldereft</a> 10:20, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, albeit somewhat weakly. I think that the topic of insurance policies on slaves is one that can support an article. The text now here is hard to follow and needs cleanup, but I do not think it is <i>totally</i> useless to someone who wants to improve it, or needs to be wiped from the history.

<p>This article starts out with the unverifiable, OR claim that "cattle are thought by many to be inherently funny" due to the likes of their "propensity for flatulence," and dives headfirst into a long, indiscriminate list of movies, TV shows, songs, and commercials that happen to feature a cow in some way or form, some of which are very questionable (honestly, would a TV commercial for cereal really have a joke about masturbating a steer?).

<li><b>Might support an entirely rewritten, referenced analysis article</b> The main problems that I see with this article are that it isn't referenced, it makes some questionable original research sounding claims (like the line about cows being inherently funny), and it presents all its information in a bullet list of snippets. So as it stands it's not a very good article. For me to support it, it would have to be repurposed and rewritten, basically talking about cows as they appear in popular media in a more encyclopedic manner (eg convert bullet list facts into a more comprehensive analysis and paragraph format) and has to provide at least minimal secondary sources to show the analysis isn't original research. FYI, note that it looks like this article was split off from <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cattle.html#Cattle_in_popular_culture" title="Cattle">Cattle#Cattle in popular culture</a> <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:06, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Most of those other "(animal) in popular culture" articles are just as bad for the same reason: nothing more than indiscriminate lists of times that animal is mentioned in some song or TV show. Of the examples you cited, the only one of encyclopedic caliber IMO is <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lions_in_popular_culture.html" title="Lions in popular culture">Lions in popular culture</a>, as it cites numerous cultural depictions of lions in mythology, literature, heraldry, etc. that are all quite historically significant.

<li>Cows are prevalent in our culture because mankind has domesticated them as livestock for food, dairy, leather, and such for thousands of years, not simply because they are "inherently funny."

<li><b>Keep</b> It is notable &amp; culturally significant. It explains why in the article. Professional sporting events was a cultural no-no when they ran the first one in 1971 &amp; it was so controversial that the NFL refrained from it until 1989. And the fact that so few have been played in 80 years is of cultural significance.

<li>re "Indologist", a Master's degree clearly doesn't establish any sort of notability as an academic.

<li>sigh, a PhD would <i>also</i> not establish sufficient notability (but we won't take a voiceofdharma.com page as evidence, I think). He would need tenure at least if you're going to claim he is notable as an academic. I think you should concentrate on arguing he is notable as an author. oops, no ISBNs, just a bunch of journal articles. Maybe his article can be merged with one on his organization?

<dd>I'm going to begrudgingly accept your verdict on most of the disputed matters for the sake of a civil discussion but you've still not addressed the primary concern, this team is not noteable according to wikipedia's rules on noteability. The only reference given is the team's own website not an external source. You say it is part of a noteable group and it gains noteability whenever the group is refered to, like a magazine might have the article: "The BCAFL, whose members include the Washington Tigers and the Surrey Stingers, will be sponsoring a team in the marathon to raise money for lukemia." That would be a trivial reference, nothing to do with the team itself. If you can prove that Surrey Stingers is noteable by it's own merits, rather than just because it's part of a group then I'll stop complaining and let it stay.
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I think it's pretty presumptuous to say that even though you're the only one who has a problem with the page, you get to decide whether to "let it stay". Sometimes people don't agree with you (in good faith). Tone like this does nothing to win support for your argument. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasonpatriot_1b91.html" title="User:Masonpatriot">Masonpatriot</a> 15:49, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This just seems to contradict the rules of wikipedia. Homer Simpson gets his own page but Apu's children do not get individual pages because they are not noteable, they are part of a combined page. Perhaps a few BCAFL pages should consider being merged into, say, Minor teams in the BCAFL?</p>
<p>I do aknowledge the comments about my tone, and I appreciate perhaps it should have been a little more civil. But so far the only three reasons given to keep it are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want the information to be kept...somewhere. (Dissobays wikipedia's rules, wikipedia is not an indeascriminate collection of information)</li>
<li>The group is noteable so the team must be. (I think this is illogical, by the same token every branch of Tescos, Sainsburys and Argos could have its own page)</li>
<li>You were quite rude when you suggested it for deletion. (Maybe I was, maybe I wasn't but that doesn't change the article and it's the article we're here to discuss)</li>
</ul>
<p>So I'll say this one last time. I do not think the Surrey Stingers are noteable enough to warrant a page on wikipedia. Can anyone find proof that they are?<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimondrake_cba7.html" title="User:Simondrake">Simondrake</a> 13:30, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Ok, here are some external sources that publish Stingers information (I have linked specific pages when possible:</li>

<li><a href="http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Britball%20Teams/SURREYSTINGERS.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Britball%20Teams/SURREYSTINGERS.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.britballnow.co.uk/History/Britball%20Teams/SURREYSTINGERS.htm</a> This is a 3rd-party site with Stingers news and information.</li>
<li>www.hot-iron.co.uk A website about Scottish teams, but it does include information about opponents.</li>
<li>www.touchdownclaymores.com The former Claymores website contains a lot of BCAFL information, mostly in the forums.</li>
<li>www.nfluk.com The British NFL page, it also contains lots of BCAFL information in the forums.</li>
<li>Lastly the magazine First Down features news and game reports for EVERY TEAM in BCAFL, they do not have a web page but I will buy an issue and scan the Stingers page if it will calm you down.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I will say this again: Why have you singled the Stingers out for this treatment? There are several other BCAFL teams that are even less notable than them but you have left their pages alone.

<p>This debate is a mess, it's become more about my tone and calling me petty than it is about the page. The bottom line (And the top line, if you'll look at the topic instead of worrying about my tone) is that I do not think this team is noteable on its own. The fact that there are other pages out there that are less noteable is a topic for another day, this discussion is about Surrey Stingers.<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimondrake_cba7.html" title="User:Simondrake">Simondrake</a> 16:17, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, since you are the one that brought this issue and the article has existed without problem for well over a year, I would think that the burden is on YOU to prove non-notability. Plenty of points have been made above by MLA, Black Falcon and Jckivington to support notability. Are you saying that just because you want to disregard their arguments, you're right? All you've said is that the Stingers aren't notable, but haven't said why (except to dismiss what others say and post blanket links to wikipedia policy). I don't see this as unreasonable. Like I said above, though, this seems to be a dead issue at this point. -<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasonpatriot_1b91.html" title="User:Masonpatriot">Masonpatriot</a> 04:07, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Their evidence of noteability is not valid according to wikipedias rules, which is what I said from the start. No one has provided evidence that is valid by wikipedias rules on non-trivial external references and the incredibility of forums. I'm just going to give up now because this is getting rediculous. It seems like a simple logical connection, this page is not noteable by wikipedias rules so it should be deleted unless noteability could be proved according to the rules.<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimondrake_cba7.html" title="User:Simondrake">Simondrake</a> 04:13, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You keep on saying according to Wikipedia rules, but you are yet to note a single rule that this page does not conform to despite numerous requests, you keep on going "aginst the rules, against the rules!!". When someone stands up in court they are charged with an individual law violation not just "he broke the law". You also said "I do not think that this team is notable on it's own" which implies that your arguments are not based on any rules but a dislike for this individual page or team. This amuses me given the fact that you falsely claimed that this page is non-neutral, but that is a much better description of you.<a href="../../../j/s/k/User%7EJskivington_dbb6.html" title="User:Jskivington">Jskivington</a> 03:26, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. The team is very minor, but given that they are part of this: <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Collegiate_American_Football_League_1ab3.html" title="British Collegiate American Football League">British Collegiate American Football League</a>, and that the article forms part of a very complex whole, the nomination to delete is highly unlikely to succeed. An argument might be put forward that all the teams should be mentioned only in the parent article - however, there is already enough information on each of the teams to justify a split off. The amount of information on the League is sufficient to justify its existence on Wiki. The only debate would be as to how the information is organised. And it seems from looking at the matter, that the information is organised in the most helpful manner at the moment. All that this discussion is doing is causing upset. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimondrake_cba7.html" title="User:Simondrake">Simondrake</a> clearly felt the article was worth a discussion to see if other people felt the same way as he did. That's fine. I would agree the article needed testing. It has now been tested and found satisfactory. It is clearly going to become even more satisfactory (rather than less) as time goes on. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 22:22, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is very important to see the difference between blog and forum sites as to newspapers. Newspapers are written by professionals and are moving from hard copy to soft. This is a very impotent development for the industry. This below is some one who is not 100% as to what it is he/she is talking about. This is not 1 posters comments and this topic is very important! You have posts about online radio, online TV etc. It would be silly to remove it. Just look at the posters tag, that says it all! If electronic pager can stay, so can online news! It is people like this chap who has flagged this up who make Wikipedia loose its credibility.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Martin-jj (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartin-jj_2ed3.html" title="User talk:Martin-jj">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Martin-jj_5bd1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Martin-jj">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>Who posted this silly thing saying the online papers not being important? I am doing research about a UK based newspapers for a TV program later this year on the BBC. Very silly this. I found this site through google... well I know about it, but I have not used it until now. I was looking for a website I have been asked to do the background on and spotted that this site has information on. So logged on and the first thing I see is that things are to be deleted with out research being done. I will be adding this fact to our program notes. If wikipedia wants to be taken at face value, it should not allow the public to pick what is kept and not kept. The public should submit information and then staff on the site should check it out! I have spotted huge holes and lots of information being cut, due to it not fitting the editing system. This post should be kept as it is! I am not going back on here as it has lost credibility to me. I know what the facts are and this post is spot on. Lots of information, ok needs a bit of a clean up, but DO NOT delete, just because of that! --Fm-jessamine 19:49, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: POV FORK page states that:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"POV forks usually arise when two or more contributors disagree about the content of an article or other page, and instead of resolving that disagreement, someone creates another version of the article (or another article on the same subject) to be developed according to their personal views rather than according to consensus."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is not POV forking about <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>, since the article <b>was not created based in a disagreement in that article</b>. As a fact, the article North America has no debate going on. This article <b>was created to provide a link for the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Template%7ERegions_of_the_world_5158.html" title="Template:Regions of the world">Template:Regions of the world</a></b> that had a link to North America (as a continent). North America (continent) and North America as a region/subcontinent are two different concepts. North America as a region/subcontinent is a valid term used in Latin America, parts of Europe (including Italy, Germany, Portugal, Spain) and Asia, under the single American continent geographical model.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This page should not be deleted because it deserves an article on its own, just as <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_America_%28Americas%29_6b83.html" title="Middle America (Americas)">Middle America (Americas)</a>, another region of NORTH AMERICA has its own. Middle America/North America are also regions within the Americas and both in the North American continent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>About the sources, this is <b>a new article (just 2 days old)</b> and I was working on it, <b>it was not completed yet</b>. I have added more sources now, as the AfD tag indicates I can improve the article. If this was the case for nomination, then you should have asked for more sources, not nominate it for AfD. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#CE1126">Alex</font></a><i><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#006847">Covarrubias</font></a></i> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Flag_of_Mexico.png/15px-Flag_of_Mexico.png" alt="" width="15" height="9" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="green">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 18:22, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As stated above and below: of course it's a fork (regardless of recent additions), and the decision to nominate it well considered and not at all hasty. Nor was this article based on a <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">consensus</a>, since the North America article (as you put it) has 'no debate going on' -- so it isn't based on any agreements, either.

<dl>
<dd>I repeat, this article was not created because of a disagreement with the current article North America, so it is not POV forking according to its definition, nor it was based in "personal views" since the souces provided clearly indicate the existence of North America as a region. There is a WP policy called <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">Be bold</a>, so I created this article based in that and most importantly, to provide a link in the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Template%7ERegions_of_the_world_5158.html" title="Template:Regions of the world">Template:Regions of the world</a> that had no link to North America as a region, but a link to North America as a continent.

<dd>With your phrase "I did not agree to the creation of this article", you want to give the feeling/impression that we were having a disagreement about North America, which is false and very low from you. We never had a disagreement about this theme.

<dd>That is your opinion -- what else would you call this but a disagreement? Read the very content you added about forking above. <b>There may be other models, but that doesn't mean creating a fork is at all a way to deal with the topic.</b> I may believe that North America is part of the American continent (particularly if you heed the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympics.html" title="Olympics">Olympics</a>), <b>but <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> should be updated instead.</b> Middle America is well-sourced (hell, <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Middle%20America" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Middle%20America" rel="nofollow">pull out a dictionary</a>) and different.

<dd>As well, AC's recent source additions do not validate the article.

Read: <i>major</i> (in population, area, economy), while not discussing the minor ones that are also part of the continent. Corticopia 18:53, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>When NA is defined as a region, it sometimes includes St. Pierre and Bermuda, as clearly indicated in this article.

<dd>This proves nothing: the title notes both 'regional' and 'country' and, as above, the content notes the continent. And you still have not reputably sourced when it <i>IS</i> defined specifically as a region -- if it is as you say, it shouldn't be difficult to cite. And this can still be incorporated into the bona fide article Again, straw man arguments don't justify this fork. Corticopia 19:37, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The real problem here is that <i>America Central</i> is not part of <i>Nortamerica</i> while <i>Central America</i> is part of <i>North America</i> and this a very subtle nuance of translations that gets missed by editors not paying attention to the details. So there's a lot of fighting going on across a few geography articles. Plus, for some reason there's a few <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin American</a> editors who really like <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manifest_Destiny_e614.html" title="Manifest Destiny">Manifest Destiny</a> so they go across articles changing the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a> to <a href="../../../a/m/e/America.html" title="America">America</a> and insisting they're <a href="../../../u/s/e/Use_of_the_word_American_8aee.html" title="Use of the word American">American</a>. Which pisses off that <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hoser.html" title="Hoser">hoser</a> crowd that's actually proud of our national identity eh? So emotions are high and there's one or two shit disturbers about.</dd>
<dd>Ultimately, encyclopaedias are bad sources. But not unusable ones.</dd>
<dd>So what we have here is a fork from a <b>very</b> similar but not quite identical article. Does this deserve a split? I have no idea.\</dd>

I understand the issue of there being a geographical entity, the continent North America, and then a distinct geopolitical entity, the region North America (particularly in the context of Latin American politics). However I think the existence of a seperate article lends a lot of confusion to the issue, and it would best be served by some discussion in the main article rather than creating an inherently POV fork. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 16:13, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How can you outright dismiss concerns regarding confusion? The article itself states <i>Using this geographical model ...</i> with absolutely no attempt to explain <i>which</i> geographical model "this" refers to. The overwhelming consensus in the world is that the term North America refers to a continent as described in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> article. The issue of there existing an alternative, minority definiton of the term warrants inclusion in the North America article, but not a standalone entry of its own. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 16:30, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree that North America is a subcontinent of America, the same as Central and South America. In my opinion, the word <i>Americas</i> is kind of confusing and does not reflect what everyone knows about the existence of only five continents in the world (without considering Antartica). History facts reveal the discovery of one sole continent, America. Besides, that happened in La Espaniola, Dominican Republic. We have also been informed of a most archaic term for America; the West Indies (or <i>Indias Occidentales</i> in Spanish). This applies to everyone and most importantly, everywhere. Cultural differences, however, have contributed to the separation of the continent once known as America. For instance, when most of southern United States was under Spanish and Mexican power and control, America still remained being the common usage among the people of this present area. We also make differences between Latin and Anglo-Saxon America, but, we must keep in mind that those terms comprehend a cultural ending, not geographical. Americas, in this sense, refers only to those regions of America that are separated by different types of things, such as language, economic development, culture, traditions, races, and society. In conclusion, I agree that North America should not be mistaken for a continent, when <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discovery_of_America_5fed.html" title="Discovery of America">history</a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography.html" title="Geography">geography</a> do not do so. The same happens when we separate Europe into Western and Eastern Europe, which does not mean that they ought to be considered as two separate continents, for the same reasons explained above. Nevertheless, my advice is to correct the already existent article, by putting subcontinemt instead of continent, and delete the present one or, ultimately, join both articles and make one out of them. --<a href="../../../g/u/s/User%7EGustavo86_a547.html" title="User:Gustavo86"><i>Gustave</i></a> - <a href="../../../g/u/s/User_talk%7EGustavo86_294a.html" title="User talk:Gustavo86"><i><b>May I help you?</b></i></a> 23:11, 2 March 2007 (UTC) PS: I'll copy and paste this message in North America article.</li>

<dd>Clearly the article is not clear enough on what you're talking about. If it were, it wouldn't be up for deletion. It's <i>very</i> confusing, and took me about ten minutes to figure out what the difference is. It's also poorly titled, as I stated a few lines above. It makes it seem as if you're referring to the North America in the Americas as opposed to the North America in Eurasia. The problem is that the article is <i>very</i> short, and needs to be beefed up. It makes sense that there are two main regions of North America: Central America and Mexico-north. So an article on North America (Region) is expected. Unfortunately, you can't put a lot of information in NA(A) that isn't already in NA, as that would make it seem <i>more</i> of a fork. Unlike Central America or Western Europe, which all have significant regional histories and specific qualities, NA(A) doesn't have anything that isn't already added into NA or the country articles. If there is something that truly makes NA(A) stand out from North America, add it to the article and prove me wrong. <b>--<a href="../../../m/p/d/User%7EMPD01605_77c2.html" title="User:MPD01605"><font style="color: #000099">M</font><font style="color: #FF0000">PD</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../m/p/d/User_talk%7EMPD01605_0e7e.html" title="User talk:MPD01605">T</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPD01605_89a1.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPD01605">C</a></sup></b> 02:31, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>: there is a difference between a place's geography (countries, continental plates, etc.) and its social sciences aspect. i.e. what makes it a region such as interconnected economies, histories, cultures, etc. by virtue of its geography, not the physical geography itself. I agree with the notion that it should be renamed as 'North America (region)'. At a very minimum, it should be merged, but I favour 'keep'. It is a little light on information right now, but as already noted in another comment, the article is quite new. Let it evolve a bit more while keeping an eye on it to make sure there is no unreasonable overlap with the geography oriented article that already exists.</li>

To do otherwise would be confusing and a disservice to anyone trying to use either article for research. Who, after all, thinks of North America in two separate ways? Who says, "no, I meant North America the continent, not the region." It's one thing to be thorough, but it's another to overcomplicate a subject to the point of confusing readers. <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeeeshboy_7ba0.html" title="User:Feeeshboy">Feeeshboy</a> 16:36, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>:You're wrong. The debate in Central America was not the inclusion of Mexico in the region (we know that physiographically/geollogically a southeastern portion of Mexico is in CA), but the inclusion of all the definitions in a very NPOV wording. That debate ended days (if not weeks) ago, and the result was the inclusion of all the terms in the usage section. I only created this page to provide a link in the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Template%7ERegions_of_the_world_5158.html" title="Template:Regions of the world">Template:Regions of the world</a>, in which "North America" linked to the continent, instead of the region. That's all. This page should not be deleted because it deserves an article on its own, just as <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_America_%28Americas%29_6b83.html" title="Middle America (Americas)">Middle America (Americas)</a>, another region of NORTH AMERICA has its own.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - <i>Language matters.</i> The other regions of North America have <i>different names.</i> It would be one thing to have an article called Northern North America, if people used that term, but no one does. The difference between North America (as a region consisting of the US, Canada, and Mexico) and Central America/Middle America is that the latter two aren't also the names of something else. What you're saying is that there should be a page for North America, as defined as a region of North America. Wouldn't it just be easier for there to be one page that states that "North America" is a term used to mean both a continent and a region consisting of the vast majority of that continent? If there is in total too much content for one page, then I could see a case for separate pages, but it would be easy to <b>merge</b> in all of the unique content of this article. <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeeeshboy_7ba0.html" title="User:Feeeshboy">Feeeshboy</a> 22:51, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If you reach North America (the continent article) when you clicked on a link to a region, the continent page should definitely explain the use of the term as both a region and a continent, but I'm fine with that explanation, rather than an article that says "North America is a region of the continent North America." <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeeeshboy_7ba0.html" title="User:Feeeshboy">Feeeshboy</a> 23:32, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge/Delete</b>: I don’t think that there should be a North America (Region) article because I don't Think that there should be and article about Countries That Have Green In Their Flags. There should not be articles about arbitrary regions that incluse arbitrary countries with no similarities. And Mexico have little to do with US, beside its borders. There was an <i>old</i> division of the American continent that was thought in Brazilian schools with North America as Canada, Mexico and US. But nobody see this division been used anymore. The problem that I saw here is that people think that North America is the parallel to Latin America. The most <i>correct</i> way to divide America is the cultural division and <i>should</i> be Latin America (countries with Latin traditions or more specific <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberian_Peninsula_03ea.html" title="Iberian Peninsula">iberic</a> traditions) and Anglo-Saxonic America (countries with British traditions). The other way to split America is (or better saying, used to be) South America (with everything below Panama), North America (Canada, US and Mexico), Central America (with everything between Panama, including, and Mexico, excluding) and Caribbean (with every isle in the Mexico Gulf that does not belong to another country). The current concept of North America (as a synonym to Anglo-Saxonic America) came to simplify the term and with a discordance of Canada, that would prefer that it was called, Franco-Anglo-Saxonic America (and making this tradition interesting because France is also a Latin country), and making things even harder. So to make things easier to say, they call the Angle-Saxonic America, North America. The fact is that nowadays the world recognize two Americas, Latin America, including all countries of Spanish or Portuguese traditions (know to be a poorer America), and North America, that include Canada and US (marked by well developed countries). Truth is that Mexico have more to do with their Latin countries than with US. The entire Nafta concept is pointless in this discussion since it was created to flood Mexico with American products, increase the American influence in Mexico (collaterally sinking Mexico in deeper poverty) and have no cultural support. I think there could be a topic on the North America article about the old (geographic) division, like in a history topic, but creating a new article about it, is an overshot for a term that is no longer used. I think that there might be a national interest in Mexico to be seen closer to US, but political issues should not reflect in the Wikipedia content, by giving more importance to a subject than it should. <a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvaroludolf_6389.html" title="User:Alvaroludolf">Alvaroludolf</a> 12:34, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

It is currently still being taught (Latin America, some parts of Europe and Asia).

<dd>I live in Brazil. No geographical division here are thought on geography classes (beside a quick note on the history of america, maybe), people on the streets might still talk about the old way but the press, new books and quality materials all talk about latin america because it makes more sense to divide Ameria this way.

<li><b>Merge</b> I find it usefull. And... I see a bit of heat in some of the comments written so far. We should be discussing here with facts and proven issues, not opinions. The thing is this: The Spanish speakers (or as t has become custom to call us: "<b><a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">latin</a></b>os") have always been told that geographically, Mexico is part of <b>North America</b>. (Please... look at a map). No only us Spanish speakers in Latin America, but non Spanish speakers in Europe, Asian... Wow... now that I think about it, <b>its probably just the USA (and possibly Canada) the only countries stating that Mexico isn't part of North America geographically speaking</b>! We as Mexicans (I am a Mexican) do not <b>eagerly await</b> to detach ourselves from Latin America. The thing is... Latin America is a <b><a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistic.html" title="Linguistic">linguistic</a></b> division, not a <b><a href="../../../g/e/o/Geographical.html" title="Geographical">geographical</a></b> division.

Therefore, by looking at a map, you might see that if you cut in half the entire continent of America, you might see that Mexico ends up in the same half as the USA and Canada. As wikipedians it is our duty to discuss matters not from points of view, but from stated facts. Really. We ought to stand higher than this. I say: use what's relevant and usefull from both articles and make a really good article about North America (including the fact that most of the world thinks Mexico is part of it). --<a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValdezlopez_f8bd.html" title="User:Valdezlopez">Valdezlopez</a> 02:55, 8 March 2007 (UTC)Valdez Lopez</li>

Your edits were not made to clarify the use of North America (meaning US+Can), because that information was already there and sourced, by the way, with a reference to Fowler's. Your edits only included irrelevant information about Central America and South America, in a "Usage of NORTH AMERICA" subarticle. And most importantly, this article was not created as a result of that "debate" nor the result of another "disagreement" as you falsely try to give the impression of.

<li><i>Comment</i> The more I read this article, the more I find that it is a contradiction in terms. In <b>one sense</b>, it argues that North America is a region consisting of the US, Canada, and Mexico. In <b>another sense</b>, it suggests that some people consider Mexico not to be part of the region. This definition I find dubious and in need of a source. Furthermore, <i>if</i> the US and Canada are to be described as a region, then <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-America_aae9.html" title="Anglo-America">Anglo-America</a> suffices for this purpose. Finally, in a <b>third and even more confusing sense</b> than the others, this article contends that North America is a <b>region</b> that includes Greenland and Bermuda. I find it hard to believe that anyone thinks of either of those when discussing North America as a region. They're much more in line with the idea of NA as a <b>continent</b> (they sit on the NA tectonic plate). Greenland and Bermuda seem to have been trotted out to justify the article itself, somewhat reminiscent of the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition_of_the_willing.html" title="Coalition of the willing">coalition of the willing</a> ("You forgot Poland!"). So aside from POV problems, this article is flawed in its failure to clear up the distinction between NA as a region and as a continent. If this article can state that there are multiple ways of looking at North America, why can't the original North America article be tailored to do so? <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeeeshboy_7ba0.html" title="User:Feeeshboy">Feeeshboy</a> 16:07, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The issue, of course is that <i>when</i> Canada and America are described as a region, <i>North America</i> is the term used, in real life. Realistically, North America the continent is well defined, except around the fringes (for example, whether it includes all of Panada, or just until the canal). North America (the cultural region) really <b>is</b> more poorly defined, so you should expect any article that is free from original research to reflect this confusion. North America the cultural region includes:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>America (always)</li>
<li>Canada (almost always)</li>
<li>Bermuda (Rarely explicitly, but usually)</li>
<li>St. Pierre and Mickey (As Bermuda)</li>
<li>Greenland (As Bermuda)</li>
<li>Mexico (less commonly, but still sometimes)</li>
<li>Possibly other places with decreasing likelihood.</li>

It succinctly states that the term is used in two different contexts a) Canada and the United States and b) all of the predominantly English-speaking nations. As far as the differing definitions of "North America" and "Central America", <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas_%28terminology%29.html" title="Americas (terminology)">Americas (terminology)</a> handles that relatively well. As it stands, <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_%28Americas%29_40fd.html" title="North America (Americas)">North America (Americas)</a> is a needless article because it duplicates information already found at <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas_%28terminology%29.html" title="Americas (terminology)">Americas (terminology)</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>. As for the merits of the article, I have serious problems with a WP article whose first cited references are WP articles from other languages.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, Webcomics do not have significant enough presence on Wikipedia to date despite being a widely spread medium and even the gateway for some independant artists into the world of printed distribution (see <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">megatokyo</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverloch.html" title="Inverloch">Inverloch</a>, etc).

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have added a number of sources to the article, specified instances when it has been recognised, and generally expanded the stub.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. The added refs are pretty weak, in my opinion -- local business papers and local restaurant reviews really don't cut it -- and unless something stronger shows up, it's down to the trivial <i>WSJ</i> bit and the number-crunching of <i>Inc.</i>. Also, the pizza? Not so extreme. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:11, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Could you please clarify your argument? The sources themselves are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> even though the newspapers are not that notable. However, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> does not require that sources themselves be notable; it is about the <i>subject</i> of an article only.

<li>That's pretty much hairsplitting if I've ever heard it. Since these are all local newspapers whose coverage boils down to "Hey, lookit this new pizza place what just opened", that's pretty much testifying to the non-notability of the business is if that's the only sort of media coverage that can be dredged up. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 06:15, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I really don't know what to make of this. Firstly, the page title (Major discoveries) is not what the page is about, as is made quite clear in the introductory sentence: it's meant to be a list of people who have made tow or more discoveries. Secondly, no definition is given of 'major discovery' leaving it so vage as to be useless. Thirdly, no edit has ben made since the page was created on 17 November 2006 (and what's there is not exactly meaningful). Fourthly, I do not see how this can properly develop into a useful page beyond the trivial. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 12:08, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> The stated aim of the article "List of people who have made major discoveries in two or more fields (archaeology, literature, science, mathematics, etc.) or multiple discoveries in one field." might be worth an article. However:-
<ul>
<li>The title of the article does not suggest that it is about people who have made multiple major discoveries</li>
<li>There is a problem deciding what counts as a "major discovery".</li>
<li>In fact the article is not about this at all but discusses mostly underwater archeology.</li>
<li>The creator of the article appears to be the Dr Spence referred to in the article and therefore it appears to be a vanity article. His claims to fame are unverified.<a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules1975</a> 12:17, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> what's wrong with this article is larger than what's right. The name doesn't match the content. Someone's POV has to define what discoveries are major and whether the fields are sufficiently distinct to merit inclusion. Also, what do people who do make "major" discoveries in two "different fields" notable as a group? It seems trivial and subject to all sorts of interpretations: Hitler discovered that you could stage all sorts of monumental parades and get people all hyped up (Psychology), he also discovered that Stalin and the Red Army were tougher than anyone thought (Military Science). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 00:59, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I had considered userfying it, but with the edit history (which includes an apparent variety of editors), it just seemed odd that it would be such. Also, I can't tell if the ongoing edits by individuals are vandalism or not... everyone seems to change the entire context of the article and its very basic facts each time around. Not a single source when at least something is dearly needed. This seems to fail the Google test -- definitely doesn't seem notable. I'm somewhat thinking that all the editors may be personally involved with the individual which the article references. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThisisbossi_e64b.html" title="User:Thisisbossi">Thisisbossi</a> 04:57, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> for the present person--his HS athletic accomplishments if real are probably N, though the bio is Vanity. There are 2 independent sources although not of high quality on Google, after searching for "Ben Andrews" Parkrose. His MySpace page link doesnt work. Per Dhartung, it does seem like someone is playing an elaborate multipart hoax at out expense, looking for different people of this name. First step is to change the titles so we can tell them apart, and relist. Alternatively, just delete this and watch if they start again. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 08:09, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

No sources, no non trivial independent third-party media mentions, vaguely crystal-ball like (although it's not making predicitons, it IS assuming that the event is going to become notable), Prod was contested, although the issues raised were not addressed, so this is AfD is next precedural step. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 13:07, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is pornstars who happen to be mothers (and not dead etc?) really a suitable topic for a list like this? I know "if we have this we would have to have X" is a dubious argument. However, in this case I think it might be valid. You could have a similar list for any category of women, filmstars, politicians etc (or fathers for that matter). It's not encyclopaedic. Also the list fails <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> as it is unreferenced.

<li><b>Delete</b> - this is inherently confusing. What is a "mother porn star"? Is it a porn star who performed while pregnant? Is it a porn star who had a child while performing? Is it a porn star who had pre-existing children? Does it count if she adopted them? What if she marries, and her husband has kids already? What if she has kids after no longer performing?

<li><b>Keep</b> - I wrote the article: there was an "OUCC disambiguation page", on which the OU Cave club was listed, but as a dead link. Hence I added the short article, essentially to clear this disamb up, and to direct further enquiries to the club's main web pages (which I maintain). I suggest the article is worth keeping, if only for consistency with the disamb page's raison d'être. In response to Whpq, OU Cave Club has been around for 50 years, so I think it's stable enough to merit a small note in Wikipedia. In response to Loki, it's the university caving club, not a college one (there is a difference). I deliberately kept the piece short, for the reasons noted earlier, but am happy to expand if that is the general opinion. On the other hand, if there's a strong vote for delete, no hassle.<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Roberts_3062.html" title="User:Steve Roberts">Steve Roberts</a> 04:30, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: My nomination was due to the very "raft of organizations" that each and every college (and university) will have. The designation of each one to an article does two bad things. First, it is such granular coverage that the next request/justification will be for a high school's after hours drama productions. If school organizations are not discussed at the school, but as stand-alone articles, we are open to <i>all schools</i> making the same justification (and then every card game). The second is that it produces an inherently unsearchable name. Would a person looking for the information look at Wikipedia? Would she look at the Oxon pages? Would he look at the actual university website? In other words, <i>why</i> would we offer an article, unless the organization has done something to or in the world that would make the world seek information <i>here</i> instead of its more logical spots? This was no revenge on student organizations or deprecation of "notability" (which is a red herring, but I can't see any AfD voters voting on anything <i>but</i> that, these days), but rather an argument for the proper organization of information. (Next stop, "Lincoln High's production of Oklahoma! 2007," I'm afraid.) <a href="../../../u/t/g/User%7EUtgard_Loki_9cc9.html" title="User:Utgard Loki">Utgard Loki</a> 14:39, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Unsourced!</b> not even on <a href="../../../i/t/u/ITunes_59e0.html" title="ITunes">iTunes</a>, and that would be the only source. Plus the fact that the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fragile_Heart_2007_4461.html" title="Fragile Heart 2007">Fragile Heart 2007</a> was never released as a single. Yes there are two Fragile Heart songs, but one was released in (2003?) on <a href="../../../0/3/0/0304.html" title="0304">0304</a> and the other on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goodbye_Alice_in_Wonderland_fab4.html" title="Goodbye Alice in Wonderland">Goodbye Alice in Wonderland</a>. But the page seems to fake the idea about the later, making it seem like it was actually released. (I looked on iTunes and Google and couldn't find anything, not even a statement on her site saying the song was ever being "re-released", especially as a "Fragile Heart 2007".) <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESeventysix67_575c.html" title="User:Seventysix67">Seventysix67</a> 09:01, 2 March 2007 (UTC) <sub>(<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.92.43.153.html" title="User:24.92.43.153">User:24.92.43.153</a> created this account to use <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>)</sub></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I do appreciate the metaphor provided by the nominator, but the individual in question is notable. I have added a reference that accounts for all of the content. This, coupled with the external links, in addition to several other articles (<i>The Irish Times</i>, for instance, has at least 2 articles about him, but I can't access them as they're restricted to subscribers), sufficiently establishes notability. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 03:17, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>no claim of notability other than having a pub build to celebrate a jubilee.

<li><b>Keep</b> If you check Category:Villages in Derbyshire, there are a lot of pages like this. It may need work, but there is certainly precedent enough to keep it. <a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhostPirate_5f74.html" title="User:GhostPirate">GhostPirate</a> 19:44, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: It is not clear to me that its incorporation in that category is of itself a satisfactory criterion for notability. Perhaps most of the entries there are indeed non-notable and should also be AfDed? With that said, I encourage knowledgable editors to improve the article to clarify its notabiliy. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBaccyak4H_9457.html" title="User:Baccyak4H">Baccyak4H</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/c/User_talk%7EBaccyak4H_c254.html" title="User talk:Baccyak4H">Yak!</a>) 19:55, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Possible POV fork of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathy.html" title="Homeopathy">Homeopathy</a>, though, to be fair, there are strong opinions on Homeopathy, and it may just be that only one side edited it. However, in any case, the article admits the subject is almost undefinable as seperate to Homeopathy, except that it's somehow better than more general homeopathy. Should become a redirect, I think. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 17:51, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> I am one of the editors of the page, it is an old page and it has been worked on by a lot of people, but it needs a major rewrite and it could also be shortened. There is a list of "To do" items in the article's talk page, this is a good start, I think, and I think everyone should read those before maing a decision here, but I will of course accept the decision of the majority and some of what Adam Cuerden says is also valid <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPernambuco_dde4.html" title="User:Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a> 19:05, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Article was started by <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomy_ac5c.html" title="User:Homy">Homy</a> after a POV dispute on <a href="../../../h/o/m/Talk%7EHomeopathy_15b1.html" title="Talk:Homeopathy">Talk:Homeopathy</a>. As far as I can tell, there is no difference between "classical" homeopathy and the garden-variety homeopathy described at <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathy.html" title="Homeopathy">Homeopathy</a>. If there are reputable sources that state otherwise, deletion may not be in order, but the article is still a POV-fest. I also think that <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complex_homeopathy.html" title="Complex homeopathy">complex homeopathy</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_homeopathy.html" title="Clinical homeopathy">clinical homeopathy</a> should be nominated for deletion as they were created by the same user for (presumably) the same reasons.

<li><b>Delete</b> This looks like a version more favorable to the field's legitimacy that <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathy.html" title="Homeopathy">Homeopathy</a>. Anything about the history of homeopathy found here can be added to the article <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathy.html" title="Homeopathy">Homeopathy</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> As far as I can tell it is just a POV version of the Homeopathy article.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> a lot of the comments are about POV, but that should be fixed with a rewrite and not a delete, in fact it would be good to hear from actual editors of the page before making a final decision on deletion (so far I'm the only one who's given my opinion among those who have worked longtime on the page). I want to point out that there is actually something called Classical Homeopathy, and it is not a bogus concept invented by 'User:Homy'. A Google search gives lots of hits for Classical Homeopathy, and it is also known as Hahnemannian Homeopathy. Perhaps the article should just be rewritten to NPOV and then renamed Hahnemannian Homeopathy and that will solve it? The concept is established within the homeopathic community and thats why I think it deserves a separate article, here are a couple of references, the first is actually quite critical <a href="http://www.classicalhomoeopathy.com/pseudo.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.classicalhomoeopathy.com/pseudo.htm" rel="nofollow">On Pseudo-Classical homeopathy (Dr. Rajesh Shah, Editorial, "Homeopathy Times")</a> and then <a href="http://www.vithoulkas.com/EN/homeopathy-doomed_oblivion.html" class="external text" title="http://www.vithoulkas.com/EN/homeopathy-doomed_oblivion.html" rel="nofollow">Is Hahnemannian Homeopathy doomed to go in to oblivion again?

<li><b>Comment in reply</b> I don't think anyone's arguing that an article on it might not be appropriate at some point, just that this one has no merit because there's no NPOV material in it not covered at <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathy.html" title="Homeopathy">Homeopathy</a>. I mean, is there anything in the present article usable as a basis for the new one that couldn't just be copied from <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathy.html" title="Homeopathy">Homeopathy</a> with better result? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 12:01, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very strong keep</b> - I haven't seen this article before, but I have no doubt that its a very notable article.

It's appears to be an important subject. I suggest placing one of the available "cleanup" tags instead of deleting since this article can be saved with some editing. As <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDELETE_1b88.html" title="WP:DELETE">WP:DELETE</a> states, "Articles and text which are capable of meeting [relevant content criteria] should usually be remedied by editing." <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis1972_3fe3.html" title="User:Luis1972"><font color="Darkorange" face="Papyrus" size="2"><b>L</b></font></a><a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis1972_3fe3.html" title="User:Luis1972"><font color="Darkorange" face="Papyrus" size="3"><b>uis</b></font></a><a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis1972_3fe3.html" title="User:Luis1972"><font color="Darkblue" face="Papyrus" size="3"><i><sub>1972</sub></i></font></a> <a href="../../../l/u/i/User_talk%7ELuis1972_1004.html" title="User talk:Luis1972"><font color="Darkred" face="Papyrus"><small>(Talk</small></font></a> <font color="Darkred" size="3">•</font> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Luis1972_8566.html" title="Special:Contributions/Luis1972"><font color="darkred" face="Papyrus"><small>My Contribs)</small></font></a> 18:56, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That, in and of itself, does not render this article subject to deletion under <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDELETE_1b88.html" title="WP:DELETE">WP:DELETE</a>. I suggest reading that policy in its entirety. As I quoted above, the policy says that an article <b>should not be deleted</b> if it can be saved by editing. Since I've already cited multiple reliable and independent secondary sources (Encyclopedia Britannica, Columbia Encyclopedia, materials in the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library_of_Congress_f2f1.html" title="Library of Congress">Library of Congress</a> catalog), it's obvious that someone can easily edit the article to incorporate the information from those sources. We must keep in mind that when we are considering articles for deletion, we should not only consider the state of the article as it stands now, but how it can be reasonably improved in the future. I'd also hate to think that a subject that both the Encyclopedia Britannica and Columbia Encyclopedia found important enough to devote space in their encyclopedias would be missing in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis1972_3fe3.html" title="User:Luis1972"><font color="Darkorange" face="Papyrus" size="2"><b>L</b></font></a><a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis1972_3fe3.html" title="User:Luis1972"><font color="Darkorange" face="Papyrus" size="3"><b>uis</b></font></a><a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuis1972_3fe3.html" title="User:Luis1972"><font color="Darkblue" face="Papyrus" size="3"><i><sub>1972</sub></i></font></a> <a href="../../../l/u/i/User_talk%7ELuis1972_1004.html" title="User talk:Luis1972"><font color="Darkred" face="Papyrus"><small>(Talk</small></font></a> <font color="Darkred" size="3">•</font> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Luis1972_8566.html" title="Special:Contributions/Luis1972"><font color="darkred" face="Papyrus"><small>My Contribs)</small></font></a> 19:59, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> This article needs a lot of work, and citations for its facts, but it is a notable and deserves an article.

<li><b>Keep</b> I added a cite to Business Week and a review from Journal of Asian Studies of volume 3 of a 3 volume series of scholarly documentation on the church.

<li><b>Delete</b>: per nom. Also, Luther had no interaction with witches at all. The passages quoted are simply theory emerging from commentary on Bible passages that command capital sentences for witches. They are the sum total of his comments on the subject.

<ul>
<li><b>Contra Deletion</b> Many Lutheran pastors, theologians and jurists quoted Luther´s opinion on the persecution of witches. Even canon laws referred to Luther in this matter. Thus Luther´s attitude had a great impact for the persecution of witches in Lutheran territories. Altogether about 60000 women and men were executed because of witchcraft. Thus it was not a trivial matter, but was important for the public and church discussion for two centuries.</li>

<ul>
<li>That Martin Luther and his teachings may have had an impact on the issue of witches and the persecution thereof may be true. If so then that is a fine topic for discussion as a section under the article on <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch-hunt.html" title="Witch-hunt">Witch-hunt</a>. But since it seems Luther had little if nothing to do directly with the persecution there should NOT be an article on the subject.

</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> It appears that Martin Luther believed in and was opposed to witches, in common with other ministers of his time. I do not see that this banal fact needs an article devoted to it. I do not see sources saying that his belief about witches was important. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 21:28, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: per nom. As a matter of interest I was the one who did research on this material when it was first introduced into the Martin Luther article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree that this article is dubious at best, but I fail to see how a couple of paragraphs on this subject should be expunged entirely from the project. Judging from Google, there appears to be substantial interest in the subject of Martin Luther and witchcraft, as well as what appears to be misinformation. I think it would serve the reader to have an accurate, brief discussion of this subject somewhere on Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 19:11, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Perhaps the information could be added to the extant <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_views_on_witchcraft.html" title="Christian views on witchcraft">Christian views on witchcraft</a> page?

<li><b>Comment</b> there are many web-sites claiming that there were instructions, overt or covert, against witches by Luther. Notable authors, such as Zacharias, fail to mention anything about it.

Agree with the conclusion that this is an instance of <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a> in spite of previous arguments that a schedule satisfies a keep. If anything, a predetermined and formulaic play schedule seems to neatly fit the spirit of a "systematic pattern of names" that part 2 of <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a> specifically prohibits. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 21:29, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Part 2 refers to /individual articles/ about items from lists, not articles that contain these lists.

<li>Point taken. That said, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2009_Chicago_Bears_season_f9ad.html" title="2009 Chicago Bears season">2009 Chicago Bears season</a> itself is an item taken from a predetermined list, and even more telling, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Bears_seasons_3b3d.html" title="Chicago Bears seasons">Chicago Bears seasons</a> does not even bother placing this year in a list. That a predetermined list of who they will play is known hardly constitutes anything beyond generic information, and doesn't even constitute a complete schedule, as no dates are given. With over 2 years to go before anything useful can be said about the '09 season there is no point in it having an article. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 21:57, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm not particularly enthusiastic about keeping this article (I may change my position), but it's really supposed to be solely on encyclopedic content, rather than how far away the future season is. One could say, "We haven't even had the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2008_Summer_Olympics_1481.html" title="2008 Summer Olympics">2008 Summer Olympics</a>, there shouldn't be an article on the <a href="../../../2/0/2/2024_Summer_Olympics_68c5.html" title="2024 Summer Olympics">2024 Summer Olympics</a>." But the fact is that there is encyclopedic information in both, so they're both acceptable. Granted, the encyclopedic value of the 2009 Bears article is weak, I'm just making the point that it's not about how far away it is. <font color="#1874CD"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 05:34, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> It looks as if this sporting team has separate articles on every season back to the year dot. This is much too much for one team in one sport and thus non-encyclopaedic.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article is promotional, original research and not neutral point of view. In addition, it was written largely by Ncanales (who is also Nicholas Canales the founder of Spanish Black Belt). Wikipedia policy does not allow the production of vanity sites. Please note that this expresses <b>no hostility</b> towards the school: it sounds quite interesting and Mr. Canales seems an eager, honest person. However, Wikipedia is NOT a business directory. I wish him and his business the best, but they need to find a business site, not an encyclopedia. A final point: a prod for deletion was added and Ncanales removed this prod, which is also a clear violation of Wiki policy. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Interlingua_69c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Interlingua">email</a></sup> 06:54, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I apologize for deleting the PROD. I indeed understood that doing so would not go against any wikipedia policy, but had I know that would have created controversy, I would not have deleted it. I apologize again. I did not create the page. Page was indeed created in a advert format. I did edit major sections to correct this violation hoping that other people would participate later. Other people are starting to edit the page. I just ask for a delay in your decision and/or for advice on how to add tags to advice others what type of changes/editions are valid and which ones are not. -- Ncanales 11:34, 3 March 2007
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If user names are any guide, the article was created by Santiago Anria, a tutor and development co-ordinator for this business. The vast majority of contributions to the article have been made by him, ncanales and an unregistered user at 208.59.127.200: between them, there was only one very minor edit made outside of this article. Although the efforts that ncanales has made deserve to be acknowledged as being in good faith, I do not believe that the business is notable or significant beyond its immediate area of operation. The information now offered in the article, well sourced and relatively NPOV as it is, is now more a description of a style of teaching, and not encyclopedic information about the subject of the article. I'm afraid it is the nature and scale of the business that render it inappropriate for an entry in Wikipedia, and not only the original tone of the article that Nicholas has worked hard to redress. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_McE_a4a1.html" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> 19:47, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a spin-off from <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_liberalism.html" title="Classical liberalism">Classical liberalism</a>, consisting of short descriptions of Locke, Smith, Kant and Friedman, and little else. The problem here is that classical liberalism is a bitterly contested label, and the uncritical classification of these individuals as 'classical liberals' is also contentious. In addition, we already tackle this subject in depth at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contributions_to_liberal_theory.html" title="Contributions to liberal theory">Contributions to liberal theory</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html#Development_of_liberal_thought" title="Liberalism">Liberalism#Development of liberal thought</a>.

<li>Keep, classical liberalism as a term is not as debated over as one would think. Classical liberalism has a very clear meaning even left of center academics accept and those who subscribe to them, especially prior to the 19th century are very clearly classical liberals. No one worth their salt disputes this. Only questionable are Hayek and Friedman and other 20th century academics who have been labeled conservatives but themselves reject the term. Mill is also questionable because he changed his mind later in life and advocated more government. No one but a few dogmatic wikipedians dispute the list. It honestly, should be included in the classical liberalism page, but it should not be deleted outright. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.249.100.227 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.249.100.227.html" title="User talk:24.249.100.227">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.249.100.227_e4ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.249.100.227">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>weak keep</b> and <b>move</b> - I agree with smokeyjoe and Dragomiloff about the word "key", we need to source these people as "classical liberal", and "thinkers" doesn't fit with other lists of people, but the word "in" is ok for now.

<li><b>Delete</b> - article is too POV. In what sense was Kant a classical liberal, for example? Why is he a "key" thinker in some "classical liberal" tradition? Why is Hume less "key" than Kant? Where is Mill? Where's Rousseau? The whole idea is just too problematic; any definition will be contestable. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 08:06, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Whether Kant was a classical liberal or not is not up for debate, he unquestionably is a classical liberal. Only classical, again as the article suggests, because in the U.S. and Canada liberal has taken on a different meaning. Without such North American centric views it should actually read Key Liberal Thinkers, since Kant is, without a doubt, a liberal.</p>

<li><s><b>Comment</b></s> <b>Keep, pending references</b> I think one of the things that makes <i>Jeopardy!</i> unique from other game shows is its audition process. Contestants can't appear on <i>Jeopardy!</i> unless they are able to demonstrate their knowledge. I believe surely there are articles and books written about the <i>Jeopardy!</i> audition process. If those sources can appear and are discussed in the nominated article, then I believe the subject can demonstrate notability. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 03:52, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just because an article can be sourced does not always mean that the topic should have its own article.

<li>This is an encyclopedia, not a junkyard. You can't compare a game show on television to something as historical, important and well-documented at the Civil War. There should not be tons of articles split off from marginal subjects, plain and simple. There should not be as many articles for Jeopardy as there are now. C'mon, a article on the set design? That's pure cruft right there. Probably will be deleted soon anyway.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> the argument "it was taking too much space in the main article" is not a real reason to delete it. it should just be a section in the main article, and pared down, this is an encyclopedia, not a place where every info bit can be, you're supposed to be an editor, meaning you edit things.

<li>There are plenty of topics on Wikipedia which are discussed in <i>families</i> of articles of appropriate sizes, organized by categories and footer banner templates.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Jeopardy has an audition process. Writing about it is reasonable. Per Aude, it's reasonable to cover this in a separate article (although the coverage in the main article may need some expansion). Although this is unsourced, I fundamentally don't believe that the information here, by and large is unverifi<i>able</i>. I think we can afford to be eventualist here, although this article should be tagged for cleanup: it's not in great shape. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 17:06, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Two known POV splits from <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathy.html" title="Homeopathy">Homeopathy</a> with very little of note that can be said about them. NNeither have been worked on significantly since the split (unlike the seperately-nominated <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_homeopathy.html" title="Classical homeopathy">Classical homeopathy</a>.</p>
<p>I've done a little editing to remove their worst parts. <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_homeopathy.html" title="Clinical homeopathy">Clinical homeopathy</a> was the worst, praising three homeopaths to the sky (reference: themselves) and containing this bizarre little non-sequitor: "Books which describe clinical conditions could be used by both clinical and classical homeopaths, the clinical homeopath will value its worth just more." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clinical_homeopathy&amp;diff=112122687&amp;oldid=112121590" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clinical_homeopathy&amp;diff=112122687&amp;oldid=112121590" rel="nofollow">[64]</a></p>

Article was supposed to have been written for the biography section as this is a biography and not a promotion of the attorney. (How can this be resubmitted as a bio and not an article?)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't quite follow what you mean by "a bio and not an article". Everything which is written in article space - even a biography - is an article. In other words, all biographies are articles, in the same way as they would be in any other encyclopedia. I don't see the sources that you say are cited, either.

<p>I deleted this after it had been <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">prodded</a>. The rationale for deletion was "Does not meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. A Google search turns up several other Jackie Barnes but only a passing mention of this one in an article about his father."</p>
<p>This was contested after the deletion, with the arguments that "There are some factors that show he is eligable to have his page re loaded. He sung a duet on the Double Happiness album by Jimmy Barnes. That album debuted at number 1 on the Australian charts. The song from the album "same woman" has been on rotation in radio in australia as well as in many cd stores around Australia. He has toured internationally as a drummer with Jimmy Barnes. The band has toured UK, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. these have been reported in newspapers etc. He is currently recording the new Jimmy Barnes album, and has done some writing for the new Living Loud album with Steve Morse and Bob Daisley. His website shows the 20 albums he has appeared on as a soloist and drummer. In the children's group The Tin Lids, they were nominated for the ARIA award for Best Children's album, I believe it was 1992 or 93. There are plenty of recordings on his site available to listen to and youtube videos."</p>

<dd>I still disagree - the Arts Gazette piece (online mag only I think) is written by himself, the London listing website serves up his own PR, &amp; the Shepherd's Bush Gallery is not a prominent one.

<dd>My fault with the Art Gazette, should have read to the end... But the Entente is a recurring show that has nothing to do with De Caso but a French-English coproduction that happens every year with changing artists. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 00:07, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Alf photoman, I don't think that the Entente is a recurring exhibition. It was timed in relationship to the centenary of the <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entente_Cordiale_adae.html" title="Entente Cordiale">Entente Cordiale</a> between France and England. The LondonTown website piece is the only non-self-referential source that we have, which does little more than establish that he exhibited there. Surely, there are other sources, no? Perhaps in the French news? I could be compelled to change my vote if something more surfaces, but as it stands, it fails <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlanetneutral_0d3a.html" title="User:Planetneutral">Planetneutral</a> 00:55, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> <s><b>Comment</b></s> - My initial reaction was to suggest this article is worth keeping. It wouldn't be difficult for me to come up with several reliable sources, and groups like this are so independent and unique it is hard to think of them as part of larger group. However, the article is so poorly written that to become a truly valuable article it would need a complete rewrite and in its present form it's not worth merging anywhere. <font color="purple">✤</font> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JonHarder_9df4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JonHarder">JonHarder</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonHarder_604a.html" title="User talk:JonHarder">talk</a></sup> 23:58, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Seems notable enough. Sects are of enough interest to have their own articles and don't really fall under the definition of "individual chapters of national and international organizations" - after all, individual Anglican and Catholic dioceses are deemed to be notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> A splinter sect is not a chapter. Any organizational or doctrinal difference is enough--just as long as the group considers itself distinct. WP is not a judge of what differences in theology are significant. The number of members is totally irrelevant. This is a necessary principle, or we would have perpetual arguments about things which people feel very deeply about. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:53, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is a religious denomination, not a local chapter, so the delete coments by Anthony do not apply at all. It has 10 congregations per <a href="http://www.allcountries.org/uscensus/74_religious_bodies_selected_data.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allcountries.org/uscensus/74_religious_bodies_selected_data.html" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>.

As reliable and independent sources the article includes two at present: a book about the denomination and an entry in an encyclopedia about the broader Mennonite faith (not published by or exclusively about this denomination). With its history dating back 195 years, there are doubtless additional sources if it is desired to expand the article. It presently satisfies <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> so there is no basis for deleting it other than not liking it.

The quality of the prose is probably not my best (as I'm rather tired at the moment), but the sources suffice to establish notability and the extra information makes this more than just a stub-class article. Also, as noted above by <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a>, this is a separate denomination and not a small chapter of the Mennonite Church. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 08:14, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>== This article is a total disaster. == This article has got to the point where any celebrity who has been photographed smoking is included. "Tony Yayo"?

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_smokers.html" title="List of famous smokers">List of famous smokers</a>. The list does need major clean-up, but I don't think that is a sufficient reason to delete. The list need to be sourced because right now it is a magnet for all sorts of dubious claims (pictures "surfaced" of someone smoking a joint, so-and-so is "said" to have smoked pot everyday, and numerous references to people being marijuana smokers because they simply sang a SONG about smoking marijuana). The list should be reoriented to the original purpose of <i>iconic</i> smokers, not just anybody who was ever seen with a cigarette. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 04:28, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Although the second list may be controversial, the first is definitely useful and either one or both together could eliminate a lot of the dubious entries on the current list.

<li><b>Keep.</b> This is of great interest to so many people, I don't know how some of you people can say otherwise. Brown pants, indeed! (Iridescenti, above) (For all we know, you "delete" voters could work in the tobacco industry and want a lower profile because of negative publicity. I've been a proud anti-tobacco campaigner for decades.) Some evidence for public interest are the campaigns to get celebrities to be better role models and the campaigns to reduce smoking in movies so that young people (the main movie theatre-goers) are less influenced to smoke. To participate for or against such campaigns, it helps to know about whom you are talking, so let's draw investigators to Wikipedia for that encyclopedic information! Many of the delete supporters are voting based on the quality of the article now, instead of how good it can be after we work on it more. We don't delete an article because it is unfinished and needs references. We should keep out the word "iconic" (too limited and trendy) in the criteria. Arkyan (above) has a good point--probably a great majority of entertainers in Western culture in the 1940s smoked.

<li>I think there's just enough to point out the fraternity's existence, pull in a few primary source things about its history, and show that it has an influential position in Philippine politics.

<li><b>Comment from a Member</b> The Sigma Rho Fraternity stated in this article is based in the University of the Philippines - Diliman campus. Other frats based in the Philippines with the same name are not recognized by Sigma Rho Diliman (SR Diliman). Sigma Rho Diliman was organized in 1938. UPLB Sigma Rho was founded in 1957. As far as SR Diliman is concerned, this fraternities are simply trying to ride with the prominence of SR Diliman as a national force. An obvious evidence that SR diliman was copied is the similarity in fraternity seal. You can refer to SR Diliman's website at www.thesigmarho.org. SR Diliman's prominence can be traced by simply typing Sigma Rho at www.google.com.ph.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Varial indy (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Varial_indy_7443.html" title="Special:Contributions/Varial indy">contribs</a>).</small></li>
