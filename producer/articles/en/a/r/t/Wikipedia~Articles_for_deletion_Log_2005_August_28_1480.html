<dd>"The New Oxford American Dictionary, in August 2005, gained media coverage when it was leaked that the second edition contained at least one fictional entry. This was later determined to be the word "esquivalience", defined as the willful avoidance of one’s official responsibilities, which had originally been added in the first, 2001, edition. It was intended as a copyright trap, as the text of the book was distributed electronically and thus very easy to copy."</dd>

<p>Wikipedia is not a predictor of future events nor it is a volume of <i>Tv Guide.</i> This show cannot be notable for it doesn't exist yet.

<li><b>Keep</b>.At what point did Wikipedia become an Encyclopedia of prominent events? I thought the idea of having a huge encyclopedia that anyone can add to was to create a compendium of as much knowledge as possible. Its not like someone made up an entry for a show that isn't real. This is a real thing and even if it was only on the air for one episode, that's enough. What difference does it make if there's an entry for a show that you don't think is good enough? Don't read it. However, Prison Break is airing as we speak, and therefore can be counted among all the things that have ever occured and ever been created by man.</li>

<dd>Correction: Wikipedian <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a> was kind enough to double-check the counting, and noticed that <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a>'s vote was incorrectly attributed as a "delete". This mistake has been corrected, and the numbers above reflect the new changes to the vote count. Of the 8 valid votes cast, 62.5% is for delete. This is marginally below the threshold of around 66% required for deletion, so the article "Liz shaw" will be undeleted and reinstated.

<p>Annon Edit; This above point is irrelevant as William Hung has a Wiki entry, for one bad audition he did. And Liz's subsequent publicity led to an invitation to do a porn movie with Ron Jeremy. Liz's publicity, while not on the same scale as William Hung's is still prolific considered New Zealand's size. I support the renaming to "Elizabeth Joan Shaw".</p>

I suppose that if the topic WAS to be renamed Elizabeth Joan Shaw that could be handled through a <a href="../../../l/i/z/Liz_Shaw_1af5.html" title="Liz Shaw">Liz Shaw</a> dab page also - would that mean that the current <a href="../../../l/i/z/Liz_Shaw_1af5.html" title="Liz Shaw">Liz Shaw</a> page is renamed to Liz Shaw (Dr Who) or similar? Maybe. A topic merge of both the <a href="../../../l/i/z/Liz_shaw.html" title="Liz shaw">Liz shaw</a> and Liz Shaw NZ entries is an excellent idea.</dd>

<li><b>KEEP</b> She is a well known person in New Zealand, with her appearing in adverts that screen daily, a documentary last week, many discussion forums, and NZ Idol (albeit only in one show). It is important to separate opinions about her and her actions/style/way of life with the fact that she is now an emerging public/well-known figure. Merstiner 12:09, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. We have a close situation here (4 delete, 1 merge, 1 redirect), the entire content of the article is ""Chi-Chi" is a character from Scarface played by Angel Salazar. He is the short guy in the gang." Now, the <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarface.html" title="Scarface">Scarface</a> itself is a disambiguation page, and so merging and redirecting would need to be to one of the actual movie articles, <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarface_%281932_film%29.html" title="Scarface (1932 film)">Scarface (1932 film)</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarface_%281983_film%29.html" title="Scarface (1983 film)">Scarface (1983 film)</a>. Unfortunately, the article here does not say which one the character appears in. There is very little content here, and it is not easy to merge this with either of those articles anyway. With no good bearing of where or how to merge this, I will call this a delete. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:44, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> While it's true many universities have residence hall pages, the NYU dorms are not "colleges" in the sense of Yale and therefore don't have detailed histories and statistics. They were a better fit on the main page. By the by, I wrote the sections initially, and most of it is pulled from what I remember of being a student at NYU. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommyP_432a.html" title="User:TommyP">TommyP</a> 01:19, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b></li>
</ul>
<p>- Argument on size: The article is indeed already too long, alumni and presidents have already been outsourced. Many large sites at wikipedia have separate articles on subcategorical content in order to maintain a sizeable format. At Wikipedia, most university-related articles have the following on their main page: information on schools, rankings, size, general campus information, specialities, faculty, history, athletics and sometimes alumni and trivia/lore/traditions. Other, especially campus-related information is mainainted in separate articles, cf.: <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Yard_ae83.html" title="Harvard Yard">Harvard Yard</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_F._Johnson_Museum_of_Art_1b86.html" title="Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art">Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watterson_Towers_427d.html" title="Watterson Towers">Watterson Towers</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/Davenport_College_8913.html" title="Davenport College">Davenport College</a></p>
<p><br />
- Argument on content: the article is in my view still encyclopedic, although every university article on this page contains more information than a traditional encyclopedia article. If that was a criterion, we`d have to delete 90 % of all university-related articles. I haven`t found any specific and detailed information on residence halls elsewhere and I believe it should not be included on the main page. However, I believe that this article contains valid information on NYU and should therefore not be deleted. If this article is deleted, may other articles will have to be deleted as well (see above). There are separate lists of university presidents, university museums and what not. So why delete this article&#160;? One could argue that not all information contained therein is encyclopedic style and that for example it is not really important whether an NYU dorm offers washing machines or not - but then change the article, don`t delete it.</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The article most certainly does allege notability. Creator, producer and star of, what is essentially, a television show. It's just broadcast on AOL instead of a conventional network. She appears to have had numerous celebrity guests and filmed on location around the world.

Also, I reworded the whole article, since it was an exact copy from the web site, which says "All rights reserved". <s>If her website is not a complete hoax</s>, it's a reasonable keep (both for her <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webcast.html" title="Webcast">webcast</a> and to a lessor extent as a blogebrity). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 18:10, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm not seeing notability here. The show is not on broadcast, cable, or satellite TV; it's apparently just something you can access on AOL, like a web site or blog, but it's video?

<li>Comment: I'm hoping that's a typo and you meant "dubious". It's ok to vfd an article because the notability and/or claims made in it are "dubious". But, it's wrong to vfd an article, because you find a certain group of people to be "odious". Many valid wiki articles are of odious people who have done odious things. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 07:51, 29 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><small>i doubt "odious" is a typo, and i agree with Agamemnon2. it's not wrong to criticize a page for the subject's odiousness when that trait is not only directly related to a desire to have one's name plastered around (perhaps specifically at wikipedia), but likely forms the sole weak (yet disguised) excuse for inclusion — the subject (or friend, relative, fanatic) wants to have an article here. see <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accident_%28fallacy%29.html" title="Accident (fallacy)">fallacy of accident</a> for more on why your example of generally odious people has no merit in this discussion. further, it's mistaken to presume that the terse comments after votes compose a full case. what's going on here is that wikipedia articles are used for original-research publicity (and google priming) rather than for encyclopedic knowledge distribution. that's not obvious to you in this example? <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaltyPig_21a4.html" title="User:SaltyPig">SaltyPig</a> 08:59, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

The page contains three discreet articles (on Palestine, The West Bank, and The Gaza Strip), each with separate sources and word counts. (Why word counts? Are they copied from something else?

In the past two days, we have seen articles focusing on 1] one scene from a movie (Chain Saw Scene from Scarface) and 2] one character from a movie (Frank Lopez from Scarface). Both were from a user who, in my opinion, is a hoaxer (if WP has a more poltically correct euphemism for this term, let me know). <b>What would happen if every movie had each character and each scene broken out into separate articles?!</b> What makes such tidbits notable, and where will it stop? These were both trifling articles, of little consequence, and don't add to the sum of human knowledge. If we do in fact want to document films in such exhaustive detail, we need to talk about conventions for titling and organizing these data. Further, this practice is already migrating to reality TV shows, whose characters are no-name wanna-bes trying to break into show business. <b>Some of these shows haven't even aired yet,</b> and (in the case of a modeling show) their characters/actors are getting new articles under their names, with links pointing to chat rooms sponsored by the show. <b>The current view seems to be, "It's on TV, so it's notable." Since when? Prove it.</b></font> Sorry for the rant, but it needed to be said.

<li>Agreed. This is ludicrous. Heck, covering individual episodes of TV shows is, to me, a waste of valuable resources.

<p>This appears to be a vanity page <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">JoanneB</a> 11:04, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>First off this is not a vanity page. Miss Paris is actually a legitmate actress and local TV personality here in Portland and you have pages for athletes, talk show hosts, models, actors and actress, and even rock stars here on the site. Are they not vanity pages too? If so they don't belong here either and you should delete them immeditely. Or are you picking on her because she hasn't won an Oscar or made over 20 million? As I see it, her space has every right to be here just as much as someone who is famous.</p>

<p>Oh really? Every actor an actress has started somewhere, even access TV. I have watched her over the years and she has grown quite a bit as a performer. Infact if you want to challege the vanity pages. Let's take a look at the pages of Courtney Love and Paris Hilton for example. Are they not vanity pages? I would think so. These two have no talent whatsoever but yet they are listed on here. But hey while you're at it why not delete ever single athlete, actor, dancer, and performer off this site reguardless. I say if you delete her. You have delete all those celebrities as well because they are vanity pages too.</p>

<li>okay, who's going to do that? i saw about 1 sentence that wasn't marketing dreck. it's not like anything's lost by deleting the page. sometimes i think these votes for deletion are viewed as though it's the last chance for the entire future of an article. the best future for this article might be to zap it so that somebody actually starts it right one day. not jamming on you personally, but i wonder what the value is in leaving up some of these hack pages. the vote for deletion is voting to delete <i>this</i> article, not any article that might be made about the subject later. if you can fill me in, please do. thanks. this general "keep everything possible" flavor i've noticed lately confuses me. it seems to presume that creating a page is difficult, as though we're fortunate that somebody happened by one day and left us these pieces of litter. strange (IMO). <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaltyPig_21a4.html" title="User:SaltyPig">SaltyPig</a> 08:03, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry, the blanking was a mistake on my part. I'm more used to CV than VfD. Thanks for correcting that. If you're refering to my comment of "No real content" as "implying it was already blanked" that was not my intent. A list of slang terms has no real content that is suitable for an enclopedia.

<li>Just because you can it doesn't mean you should. There are a number of cautions against over hasty nominations in the instructions for this page. If you make a lot of nominations which are overwhelmingly rejected, you will get frustrated and you will have wasted a lot of other peoples' time. Neither of those things will be good. Over time you will become familiar with what type of nominations might succeed. Nominating articles which are certain not to be deleted may be a breach of the policy that one should not disrupt Wikipedia to make a point, but you are not guilty of that in this instance as you are new. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 15:33, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm of two minds. It's all verifiable, I've pulled an extensive edit on the page, but it still has that smell of vanity.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Is the Wiki Comics Project about being completist or being a hall of fame? If being self-published disqualified you from being considered a professional cartoonist, many alternative cartoonists would be disqualified. Self-publishing is very common in comics, and Roberson has published others under his imprint too, and has been working in the field for close to a decade. I would also add that the comics references in Wikipedia are, in general, at present biased heavily toward mainstream comics with far less on alternative creators. Is this an oversight or reflective of a prejudice against non-mainstream cartoonists? Just because he hasn't worked for Marvel or DC doesn't mean he isn't a cartoonist, and incidentally, why has the stub reference been removed? I vote against deletion. <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilesgoat_2ac3.html" title="User:Gilesgoat">gilesgoat</a> <a href="../../../g/i/l/User_talk%7EGilesgoat_7e74.html" title="User talk:Gilesgoat">talk</a> 16:31, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. It's not the self publishing that excludes Roberson, see my statement above for my reasoning. I removed the stub template because the article is not a stub, it's a fairly decent article given the subject. I don't think he'd need to have worked for Marvel or DC, but I don't think the body of work he has produced at present deems him worthy of an encyclopedic entry. Feel free to prove me wrong. I tend to see Wikipedia as falling in between completist and hall of fame. And to be honest, if all you need to be to be a professional cartoonist is a self-published one, then I need to change my job description, having also self published comics. I think the description professional cartoonist means one earns one living at it. And look, if one does the old google test we get <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Roberson+cartoonist%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Roberson+cartoonist%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official" rel="nofollow">56 hits</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This guy seems notable enough for me, has longevity, and his self-publication is definitely not of the vanity kind.

<li><b>Comment</b> Most cartoonists not working for the majors don't make a living at it. It's the work that matters. Roberson did a 252-page graphic novel, still works in the field, and is a very active presence in the comics community. And if you had done a google search under his full name, which he always goes by(because there's a lot of Robersons, after all), you'd have found a lot more <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=john+linton+roberson&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=john+linton+roberson&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">hits</a> Also, there are a lot of alternative cartoonists who turn up fewer hits because they have no web presence. The e-book in contention, incidentally, got a lot of notice within the community and included about 30 very notable people, as it was a benefit for EPICURUS and JOURNEY creator Bill Loebs. It wasn't a small thing. According to the info on it, it was done as an e-book only to minimize expense so LOebs would get most of the money.- <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilesgoat_2ac3.html" title="User:Gilesgoat">gilesgoat</a> <a href="../../../g/i/l/User_talk%7EGilesgoat_7e74.html" title="User talk:Gilesgoat">talk</a> 21:35, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Nope, I'm not, but I am very familiar with his work. I question too the misapprehension that self-publishing is vanity in comics. It's very, very common in that field. As far as how active he is, I see him commenting on issues in comics all the time in various places and he's much more prolific than you might think. I dunno. But excluding him because he self-published PLASTIC is silly. It's not the scale, it's the work, and he's produced a lot of work and still does. And why does work on Eros count against him?

<li><b>Comment</b> All I know is that I've seen that information before, as well as the picture, which I've seen at least a year back on his writers.net profile. I've made as much of a case as I can. As far as I can tell the main reason for removing him seems to be that he's not as well-known as some. To me that's not a legitimate reason, but that's my opinion. I may seem partisan but I go way back as a fan of his--I was a subscriber to PLASTIC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Incidentally, just thought I should add: there seems to be a misunderstanding about PLASTIC now that its back issues are at Ebookopolis. It used to be a print publication when "Vitriol" was being serialized. The last issue he printed, no. 8, I received in 2001. So in fact he's only done one thing, WORKING FOR THE MAN(which he organized almost by himself) that was an e-book from the get-go. Also, his work was printed in Danny Hellman's LEGAL ACTION COMICS, and one of the pieces he contributed to in WFTM was written by Terry Gilliam collaborator(writer of the JABBERWOCKY film and former HELP editor) Charles Alverson. So this guy has worked with some notable people, and the fact he was able to get so many famous pros on what I recall as short notice for WFTM indicates influence and presence in the comics community, seems to me.<a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilesgoat_2ac3.html" title="User:Gilesgoat">gilesgoat</a> <a href="../../../g/i/l/User_talk%7EGilesgoat_7e74.html" title="User talk:Gilesgoat">talk</a> 23:11, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article needs too much work to live. At a minimum it should discuss or at least list all the proposed units, relate them to the earlier units they correspond to and the later units that adopted the concept, speak to why its decimal and related to an arc of the earths great circle, who Mouton was involved with as regards his astronomy, what problems he worked on as a mathematician, how his contemporaries received his ideas and what the connection is to measurements of the earth and the metric system.<a href="../../../r/k/t/User%7ERktect_7070.html" title="User:Rktect">Rktect</a> 21:45, August 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't know if having once tagged it I'm allowed to untag it, but I went into the article and, despite that it took some work, corrected some of the more glaring mistakes such as those regarding Mouton and the second pendulum using "Klein World of Measurement" and then added Klein as a reference.<a href="../../../r/k/t/User%7ERktect_7070.html" title="User:Rktect">Rktect</a> 18:48, August 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Delete</b>. The problem is that the Wikipedia system as is makes cleanup impossible (kindly ask me by email why that is the case).

<dd>Cleanup is not impossible. It's not even particularly difficult. Try harder.

<dd>I have tried this route for a month, and now given up. Wikipedia style "consensus" has been reached in VfD after VfD, but the only result is that the "problem" moves to new articles.

<li><s><b>Keep</b>.</s> If 4chan memes really had no interest to anyone outside the group, I'd vote delete, but they do. 4chan is quite notable, and the fact that a number of widespread Internet memes (including <a href="../../../o/s/-/OS-tan_f23e.html" title="OS-tan">OS-tans</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bananaphone.html" title="Bananaphone">Bananaphone</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/y/Soy_Sauce_Warrior_Kikkoman_5eb2.html" title="Soy Sauce Warrior Kikkoman">Soy Sauce Warrior Kikkoman</a>, Pedobear, the <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numa_Numa_aede.html" title="Numa Numa">Numa Numa</a> song, Limecat, <a href="../../../t/h/e/There_she_is%21%21.html" title="There she is!!">There She Is!!</a>, and quite a few more) originate or are popularized there is one of the reasons why. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenelope_D_a4b7.html" title="User:Penelope D">Penelope D</a> 21:06, 28 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My bad; I missed the note that the article is supposed to be specifically a list of <i>current</i> 4chan memes, which is of course totally unencyclopedic. I hereby change my vote to <b>Delete unless</b> the article is changed to a list of popular memes that <i>started</i> on 4chan. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenelope_D_a4b7.html" title="User:Penelope D">Penelope D</a> 21:14, 28 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why would an entry on "current" anything be unencyclopedic? If you're writing a work for reference, it's expected your analysis will be limited by the date of publiciation. This is analygous to saying the page "nuclear fusion" should be deleted because scientific research on the subject is ongoing and might be outdated when someone reads it.<a href="../../../v/g/s/User%7EVgss_2d00.html" title="User:Vgss">Vgss</a> 21:41, 28 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't say an entry on "current anything" would be unencyclopedic, nor do I think that. I think an entry on "current memes on message board X" is unencyclopedic, because it is inherently of little to no interest to anyone except members of that particular message board. A list of popular memes that started on 4chan (and eventually spread to other Internet communities), on the other hand, would be relevant to people outside the 4chan community. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenelope_D_a4b7.html" title="User:Penelope D">Penelope D</a> 22:45, 28 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That would be nearly impossible to compile with the difficulty in finding enough people who have been relgious member of the board since its inception. Even in that case, there is always constasting opinions on the origin of memes. The other alternative -- composing a directory of ALL internet memes, would also be too difficult, as there's simply too many forums and communities for even a large group to have success in cataloguing. I'm all ears if you can find a better title for my project, however.<a href="../../../v/g/s/User%7EVgss_2d00.html" title="User:Vgss">Vgss</a> 23:34, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is an article of memes used on 4chan, not 4chan-exclusive memes. It is not difficult to maintain -- I estimate I'll only need 30 or 40 entries, and that's after 4(?) years of the site. Whether or not the interest in the subject is small, that's not a reason not to include it. Furthermore, these are not solely 'inside jokes' -- I've made a point of explaining the origin of "It's a Trap" and where "Cracky-Chan" superceeded 4chan.<a href="../../../v/g/s/User%7EVgss_2d00.html" title="User:Vgss">Vgss</a> 21:10, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

That isn't enough for me. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 18:48, August 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> - The <b>islands</b> are federally recognized and designated as islands in the state of Massachusetts, you can reference this information on the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS.) There's a link directed to the GNIS on any one of the Bass Rock articles. Also, Bass Rock in Norfolk County is marked with a buoy as an isolated danger, it's nicknamed or otherwise called "The Spindle", and on or around that particular Bass Rock lies a diversed marine ecosystem. At first, I might think of such islands as these as insignificant, too insignificant enough to be mentioned on Wiki. Although, if a geospatial satellite photogenically and geographically records and make measurements of such islands as these using tax-payer money, the man hours it took to record these into government datatbases, such islands as these with their designated names appearing on nautical maps and perhaps various other maps, people giving it another name and/or nickname to it, visually marking the presence of this particular island with a buoy as it seems to pose a significant isolated danger to passing vessels in nearby busy marine traffic areas, an important marine ecosystem existing on and/or around it, &amp; etc. then such federally-designated islands as these must be of some significance, because the federal government, various government agencies, and various peoples and organizations sure do think so. Another point I would like to make is that islands of any "significance" evidently plays an important role in maritime claims, boundaries, and/or disputes for political entities. An example would be that the Pacific island <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tonga.html" title="Tonga">Kingdom of Tonga</a> was able to expand its jurisdiction, laws, and its national boundary by many nautical square miles into the Pacific Ocean from the point of the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minerva_Reefs_108b.html" title="Minerva Reefs">Minerva Reefs</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, a small and "insignificant" reef island that is barely above water during low tides. In addition, the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minerva_Reefs_108b.html" title="Minerva Reefs">Minerva Reefs</a> was almost a widely controversial issue of interest in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, before the <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tonga.html" title="Tonga">Kingdom of Tonga</a> laid claim to the reefs, an American businessman seriously tried to convert and claim the island into an independent island country, called the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Minerva_1164.html" title="Republic of Minerva">Republic of Minerva</a>. This reminds me of a common quote that I've heard many times before, is that "One man's trash is another man's treasure." Also, There's an arctic island and/or "rock" off the coast of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenland.html" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> that is an issue of a long international dispute between <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>. The tiny uninhabitable island and/or "rock" is called <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Island_6c1d.html" title="Hans Island">Hans Island</a>. Both countries has claimed <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Island_6c1d.html" title="Hans Island">Hans Island</a> as their own, claiming that it's part of their country's soil and boundary. The dispute has become ever more significant, with both countries sending official government spokesmen and military personnal to and/or on the island, erecting their country's flag into this seasonally-unfrozen barren island and/or "rock." The international dispute still remains officially unsolved. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniReb_3c1b.html" title="User:UniReb">UniReb</a> 19:50, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. No vote yet, but I want to point out that we have articles on <i>thousands</i> of "freaking rocks" called asteroids (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_asteroids_8bf3.html" title="Category:Lists of asteroids">Category:Lists_of_asteroids</a>).

<li>We do not have articles on "thousands" of asteroids. We have articles on a small handful of notable ones: the closest, the largest, the earliest known, and so on. The vast majority of obscure asteroids may be lucky to be named in a list. I have no difficulty with articles on notable rocks such as <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcatraz_Island_b07a.html" title="Alcatraz Island">Alcatraz Island</a> or <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perc%C3%A9_Rock_ed0d.html" title="Percé Rock">Percé Rock</a>, but some anonymous outcropping that is merely a hazard to navigation and of interest only to navigators who have better information on their charts than they can get here does not, in my mind, rate an article. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 02:14, 2005 August 29 (UTC)

<li>First of all, I was very careful to state that we have "articles on thousands of asteroids" (which is clearly a fact) rather than "thousands of articles on asteroids" (which may not be true yet, but I don't feel like counting). We have articles on the first 450 and a smaller percentage of the other 90,000 identified asteroids. Even apart from that, we have 200 <i>lists</i> of asteroids. The lists appear to be very complete and I question the statement that "The vast majority of obscure asteroids may be lucky to be named in a list." They all appear to be very lucky, indeed, then. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 16:56, August 29, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hmmm - "articles on thousands of asteroids". Now how would =most= people interpret that statement? And I consider 450 out of 90 000 a handful. Nor are there 200 lists of asteroids, there are somewhat over a hundred. Many of the articles are on people associated with asteroid discovery or research. There are several lists on asteroids because one single 90 000 item list is beyond the best browser's capability. Finally, bringing up asteroids as an excuse for keeping these rocks is a red herring. I am of the opinion that <a href="../../../4/5/0/450_Brigitta_7740.html" title="450 Brigitta">450 Brigitta</a> does not need an article either - the information it contains is so limited that it could easily be handled by an annotated list. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 19:03, 2005 August 29 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am sure this was a very nice and much talked about poll, but at the end of the day, that is really all it was. A media organization conducted a popularity to contest to discover what a group of people thought about the impact of other people in the nation's history. The poll does not really prove anything about the comparitive worth of these people, and it really only amounts to personal opinion, albiet the personal opinion of many. I do not think, therefore, that this is particularly encyclopedic. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 19:17, August 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I am aware of which media organization conducted the poll thank you very much. That is completely immaterial to the point, as is enumerating other examples of wikipedia articles that do the same thing. These lists are by their very nature POV due to the fact that they represent opinion not fact. The only difference is that they do not represent the POV of a wikipedia author, but rather the POV of a large group of people sampled by a media organization. These are not fact articles, but rather opinion articles (sure they are fact articles in the sense that the polls occured, but the occurance of an event does not automatically make it important, and the thrust of the article is expounding on opinion). Lists like this are created all the time. They can be fun, but they are not encyclopedic unless actually used to further some noteworthy agenda. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 19:27, August 28, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Don't mistake this for purely a POV dispute. If it had not already been vfd, I would requested it myself on the grounds that this page unfairly singles me out amongst other webcomic creators for the sole purpose of keeping petty grudges alive, and contributes nothing to wikipedia that the entries on my webcomics don't already. It's not that it currently has POV issues, it's that it never will have anything but POV issues. I mention this only because it appears people are voting to keep it purely on the abstract principle that deleting a page doesn't solve edit wars - the issue is far complex than that. Unless some individual will stand up and take editorial responsibility for the material written in this page, it's just a convenience for personal slander. It's a POV entry. <i>As the person the entry is about, is my wish to remain a private citizen and not a public figure to be ignored by wikipedia?</i> --SeanHoward 19:19, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I won't say "gave up your status as a private citizen," but when you decided to make a webcomic and put it on the internet, you basically said, "Hey, look at what I am doing!" Doing that basically makes you a public figure. Let me put it this way: If <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bono.html" title="Bono">Bono</a> suddenly decided to retire and become a private citizen, then that's all fine and dandy, yet people will still remember him as he was. Therefore they will write things about him and his life and music, and just because he goes away doesn't take away the memory of him. It's basically the same situation with you, Sean. You made yourself known and even now that you have decided to "retire," you will still be remembered for your comics, your strong stand against copyright violation, and the PA thing (unfortuantly). -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinman11_b86f.html" title="User:Martinman11">Hoekenheef</a> 22:22, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What would constitute illegal? Publishing the name of a minor without consent, like my daughter's name? How about the fact that the dispute in question is simply libel against my person, with Wikipedia being used to repeat such damaging claims from an authoritative source? If not illegal, then how about just useless? Since I don't talk about my personal life online, the only reasons this page is to talk about my comics - which have their own entries and are more than capable of representing themselves without an associated author's page - and to repeat libelous statements verbatim without regard to simple things like... I don't know... facts, evidence, investigation, morals, or competence? I mean, I'm the world's foremost expert on me. What good is an article which not only ignores that expertise, but stands completely in defiance of it? What good is an article which can be used to defame, attack, or otherwise slander me that I do not have the tools to easily and quickly correct? There's no reason for this article to exist, and unless someone is willing to take legal responsibility for what goes into this article as it goes in, it represents a dangerous threat to my privacy, my reputation, and my personal well being. People get extra privs to edit their own user pages against vandalism, and yet I am forced to sit by, banned due to reverting the same malicious vandalism four times in 24 hours? That is completely unacceptable. Delete this article or take some damn responsibility for what happens to it. --SeanHoward 03:24, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>"it represents a dangerous threat to my privacy, my reputation, and my personal well being."</i> Oh really. Then let me ask you. Has anyone ever come straight up to your home and throw rocks at windows, spray painted a slander on your garage, or done "donuts" on your lawn because of any of this? I will say it again, when you decide to make a webcomic you said, "Hey, take a gander at me and my work!" Oh, plus asking for someone to take some "damn responsibility", I think the already have tried to, but you come behind them spewing things like, "Oh, don't mention any of my incidents with other webcomic authors because it will tarnish my reputation." Get over yourself, Sean. Yes, there will be POV problems with this are, and do you know why? It's because there are idiots here who believe it is fun and enjoyable to vandalism pages, but they are not the majority.

<dd>Yes, I have had my personal property damaged and I have received very personal and detailed death threats over the very material which Wikipedia seems absolutely incapable of keeping straight. Is my moral peril not enough? When was the last time you had threats on your home answering machine? And I'm not complaining about obvious vandalism. That's not a problem. It's people who make subtle, but very malicious accusations on a webpage about me without having a damn clue what the hell really went on. Were you there? Did you read the email I sent to Gabe and Tycho? Did you see the forum avatars? Did you share PMs with the people who used them? Did you talk with the forum admin who dealt with it? Did you have an email conversation with Gabe or Tycho later? No. You didn't, which means you don't even remotely have half the facts and have exactly zero business writing about it. Nobody does, because I'm the only one with the facts - and here I am trying to actually share those facts, and I'm fought every damn step of the way by jerks like you. If wikipedia can't be used to actually share facts about my life on a webpage dedicated to facts about my life, what good is this wiki crap anyway? What recourse do I have to protect myself against wikipedia except to have the article simply deleted? --SeanHoward 02:32, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, for one, if the facts you have differ from what's written, the process of getting that changed is more presentation and discussion, and less vulgarity and invective.

<dl>
<dd>I did. The reason I showed up here was because hard facts were being changed into alleged facts. Something that absolutely did happen (and proven) was being changed to "may have" happened. I came in, wrote down all the facts, accompanied by two dozen links to evidence to back them up from third party sources, only to have that material changed. Then a quote is put in the thing which is taken COMPLETELY out of context and implies absolutely incorrect things. Then I get accused of POV simply because I'm the only one who is qualified to comment - there are no facts here that have been provided by anybody but me. I've spent literally years trying to clear my name of these baseless accusations, and you guys have a problem because the FACTS happen to agree with my side of the story and not the baseless slander of some guy who never even had a shred of evidence to support his side in the first place. Hell, even in this section, my comments have been changed - granted, they did use a word that you can see on NYPD Blue or The Daily Show, but it is dishonest. I said "shitload" because that word had exactly the sort of connotation that I wished to convey. Removing that word without notice changes the sentence. Wiki's policy tells me not to curse, but it tells you not to censor cursing. YOU CHANGED THE FACTS! It doesn't matter one bit what you think about me as a person. I could be, and am, the grumpiest person in the world, but you can't go changing facts and starting edit wars simply because you dislike me. Until you guys accept that I'm not only a primary source, but the only source period, this article will be nothing but conjecture and pure fantasy as you guys write what you think happened with exactly ZERO research or understanding of the topic at all. You write what you write because you hate me or because your search for NPOV tells you to discount the only source because HE WAS THERE, not because you have any factual evidence or anything intelligent to contribute. And Hoekenheef, it's amazing how quickly your tone changed. --SeanHoward 15:11, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>On some things yes. He can comment on relatively few things, actually. For instance, he'd be considered a secondary source on the actual forum discussions (if that. It's obvious he barely glanced at it). He would be a primary source on the email I sent him, but his interpretation of why things were written the way they were must be discounted. If the author says he wrote something and somebody disagrees, the author deserves the benefit of the doubt unless irrefutable proof exists otherwise. So, the amount of things that he can talk about with authority are few. It's a moot point anyway, because I don't see Gabe here, and you guys certainly aren't qualified to talk for him. --SeanHoward 16:00, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's not moot at all; it illustrates why people are giving you so much resistence when you say you have <i>the</i> facts and are the <i>only</i> source of facts. Here's a summary of how that conversation just went:</dd>
<dd>[Sean]: I am the only primary source.</dd>
<dd>[Leth]: Not true, Gabe is also a primary source.</dd>
<dd>[Sean]: So what, Gabe's not here.</dd>
<dd>The point is, <i>you're not the only primary source</i>. And when you insist you are, it reduces your credibility. Especially when you tell people that another primary source must be discounted simply because you say so.</dd>
<dd>Now, are you the only primary source <i>currently available?</i> This might be true, I don't know. But this does not appear to be the statement you made. What you said is that you're the <i>only</i> source qualified to report on many of these issues and that we, and Wikipedia, are at fault for not recognizing this simple truth. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinn_39bd.html" title="User:Spinn">Spinn</a> 16:57, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The section on avoiding profanity only covers writing articles with "brilliant prose". The section on <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_guidelines_82c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines">Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines</a> doesn't say anything about profanity, but it does distinctly say "Don't misrepresent other people: As a rule, refrain from editing others' comments without their permission". You didn't just overstep. You jumped off. Besides, I use profanity well - you can say a lot with one word, more concise that way. "Wikipedia needs to show more responsibility" or "Wikipedia needs to show a shitload more responsibility". World of difference there, huh? I can't think of another word that would put emphasis on the right amount of disdain and distrust by which I judge wikipedia's responsibility and credibility. It's really quite pithy. It consists of pith. --SeanHoward 16:00, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Even if people can't agree on all the POV issues the page still has useful information about the whole pixel art controversy, and it isn't worth scrapping the page and the history of squidi.net just because some people have strong feelings about who was in the right. Some people would prefer to just delete the article or bully others into removing it because they don't like its content. Worst case we could lock a stable version of the page that relies on the facts, but this isn't unresolvable. The entry contains the most relevant information there is about Squidi and the comic at the moment so long as it remains off the web.--<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigCow_5aad.html" title="User:BigCow">BigCow</a> 23:49, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, and those interested in the POV issues will, hopefully, reach consensus. As for Mr. Howard and the "public figure" issue, I'd just make the analogy to a free press and news media. Can a person prevent a newspaper from publishing a news story about them? Under U.S. law, no, given the after-the-fact remedies of libel and invasion of privacy causes of action. I do not see anything in the fact of existence of the article, or in the content of the current version, that is either libelous or invasive of Mr. Howard's privacy. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 07:09, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A person cannot prevent a news story being written about them, however there are laws that pertain to what the press can print - laws which do not and can not apply to wikipedia. The press has editorial responsibility for what they print. They can be sued for damages if they print something inaccurate or unfairly damaging. On wikipedia, there is no one to take responsiblity. Yeah, there's "policy", but it's not enforced so much as encouraged, and edits are reverted after they are made public, not verified beforehand by an editorial staff with integrity and honor. I am not a particularly famous person and many of the facts about the controversies that people seem so insistant on putting on this page are little more than hearsay and vulgar misrepresentations. Because I'm not famous, the amount of people on this planet that could create a factual summary of events that only I was involved in can be counted on one hand (hell, one finger - me). Wikipedia editors without understanding or appreciation of the subject would find it impossible to properly represent facts and could be easily mislead with malicious edits. Simply put, I'm not famous enough for anybody but me to know what the hell is going on with my life, and I'm not interested in fighting to maintain this worthless article against jerks and vandals. Unless wikipedia can guarantee more responsibility than has been shown in the past three weeks, it has no business discussing my personal life at all. Period. Wikipedia isn't the press. Don't even remotely pretend that it is. --SeanHoward 08:04, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but make sure the entire PA incident is fixed. Also, work on making the entire thing more NPOV, and maybe lock it once it is. The artice brings some useful information on Mr. Howard, and should not be deleted just because he 'says so' Although I do believe he has a right to enforce some NPOV rules about it, it should remain. Example: Say J.K. Rowlings (or for that matter, anybody at all) does not approve of their listed entry for wikipedia, or does not want themselves featured within the database. Such a desire is inconsistent to the desire of wikipedia itself, which is a database of information. The deletion of information just because the subject does not want to be covered is rather fallacious. Mr. Howard, you do exist, do you not? If so, then wikipedia, as a source of information, is fairly duty bound to present information about you (or anybody) in a NPOV matter. Fix the POV tendencies and lock the article if necessary. But do not delete it. User: Scion of the Light</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, he said surprisingly. The term may or may not be right, but the subject itself -- the practice of keeping monkeys on ships -- seems to be, I guess, established, at least in fiction.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This doesn't seem to be a real term.

<p>This was tagged for a speedy delete, but I don't think it falls into that category - there does seem to some information elsewhere on the web about this person. I suspect there is so little known about Djedptahiufankh that the poor fellow only merits a footnote on some other page. I've no opinion one way or the other, so I'll leave it up to others to decide.

<li><b>Delete or (if a suitable place can be found) merge.</b> Apparently it's about a real person, but considering that the name gets 64 Google hits (compare 674 for <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmose-Nefertari_93c1.html" title="Ahmose-Nefertari">Ahmose-Nefertari</a>) and half of them appear to be stuff like "list of ancient Egyptian male names," I seriously doubt he's notable enough to warrant his own article. Would probably be fine as a short section inside some bigger article on ancient Egypt, but I'm not sure which. Maybe a section on whatever "Prophet of Amun" means in the <a href="../../../a/m/u/Amun.html" title="Amun">Amun</a> article?

<li><b>Keep</b> Djedptahiufankh did truly exist. There are also several web sites which mention this person and he is also mentioned in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Kitchen_3947.html" title="Kenneth Kitchen">Kenneth Kitchen</a>'s book, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt. More importantly, his tomb was found intact and many treasures and dated bandages were found on his body. He was a very important person in her time--the Fourth Prophet of Amun--and merits some mention on Wikipedia. His discovery was a rare event in a country where Mummys were often robbed or destroyed in antiquity by tomb robbers. Finally, this web site confirms some of the details of his career: [<a href="http://members.tripod.com/~ib205/djedptahiufankh.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.tripod.com/~ib205/djedptahiufankh.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>]</li>

<li>Actually "slated" means to schedule or designate, that sounds pretty confident to me. Also, what can they say? <i>"There are definetly going to be 50,000 people there."</i>? No, they can give you an estimate. It's not like theres gonna be 100 people, or 1000, even 10,000 people. I think we all know they'll be more... much more.

<li><b>Keep</b> - as creator of the article, a Las Vegas local, and a future attendant of this event, I vouge for its signifigance. This is guaranteed to be a major event, with attendance expected to be in the several tens of thousands. Operated by the same people who do <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnaroo.html" title="Bonnaroo">bonnaroo</a>, many of the most well known artists in the industry will be there. Here are some other music festival articles that seemed to have made the grade, and that also appear to me to be less notable than Vegoose: <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Springs_Music_Festival_3163.html" title="Hot Springs Music Festival">Hot_Springs_Music_Festival</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin_International_Guitar_Festival_784e.html" title="Darwin International Guitar Festival">Darwin_International_Guitar_Festival</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brecon_Jazz_Festival_9bc3.html" title="Brecon Jazz Festival">Brecon Jazz Festival</a>, <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramid_Rock_Festival_eb1c.html" title="Pyramid Rock Festival">Pyramid Rock Festival</a>, Samstock Music Festival(600 attendants at most), <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_Rock_Festival_7332.html" title="Nova Rock Festival">Nova Rock Festival</a>, Yggdrasil festival (this article was created feb. 9th, 2005, and has recently been improperly VFD'd), <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwest_Region_Music_Festival_7b6e.html" title="Northwest Region Music Festival">Northwest Region Music Festival</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wireless_Festival_4d8e.html" title="Wireless Festival">Wireless Festival</a>.

<li>Regarding your reference to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>, here is an excerpt, <i><b>"planning or preparation for the event is already in progress and the preparation itself merits encyclopedic inclusion"</b></i>. Vegoose falls under this distinction. Also, this article was not intended to be an advertisment. I have nothing to gain from this. In fact I'll be losing a great deal of money attending the event&#160;;*) And Vegoose will do well regardless of a wikipedia article, my intention was not to increase ticket sales. This event will undoubtely occur, and <b>will</b> be notable. Doesn't that make it notable <b>now</b>? - <a href="../../../r/_/l/User%7ER_Lee_E_e1df.html" title="User:R Lee E">R Lee E</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" /></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:R_Lee_E" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:R_Lee_E" rel="nofollow">talk</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/R_Lee_E" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/R_Lee_E" rel="nofollow">contribs</a>) 01:20, August 29, 2005 (UTC)

<li>No. Produce a news article that says <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> is planning to attend and I'll agree it's notable now. Heck, produce an article about it in the mainstream news media like <i>The New York Times</i> that says the rock world's eyes are directed on Las Vegas and I'll agree it's notable now. An assertion by R_Lee_E's that he knows the future and that it <i>will be</i> notable is not notable, unless R_Lee_E personally is notable, or a recognized authority.

<li>P. S. Why on earth is it important to have the article in Wikipedia <i>now?</i> What's the problem with "userfying" it (moving it to a subpage of your personal user page) and then submitting the article again <i>after</i> the event has occurred? Quite likely there will be more to say about it then, and it will be a better article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 03:04, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

It <b>will be</b> a very notable music festival, I think thats obvious. <del>Though considering the direction this VFD is heading, and being that its not much of a big deal to me, I am willing to retract my vote. Though we all know it'll be back in 30 days, and sheesh, I can't see it recieving a VFD then, unless it's just out of spite.&#160;;) Thanks for your votes, you might as well delete it now.</del> But my opinion stands, the delete votes this VFD recieved were rather ill-concieved and apparently submitted on a whim. - <a href="../../../r/_/l/User%7ER_Lee_E_e1df.html" title="User:R Lee E">R Lee E</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" /></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:R_Lee_E" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:R_Lee_E" rel="nofollow">talk</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/R_Lee_E" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/R_Lee_E" rel="nofollow">contribs</a>) 03:27, August 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>All of the above mentioned articles are not local to Las Vegas at all as far as I know, and they are very reputable companies. I specifically weeded those out of many, many other articles available about vegoose. While people invest hours of their time adding every single pokemon character, or every single obscure star wars character, or every single zatch bell! character to wikipedia, I'm trying to provide relevant info about a very notable music festival, expected to bring in many tens of thousands of people, and that will likely be an annual event for years to come. Thats why I think it's important now. I believe I've answered both of your questions. - <a href="../../../r/_/l/User%7ER_Lee_E_e1df.html" title="User:R Lee E">R Lee E</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" /></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:R_Lee_E" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:R_Lee_E" rel="nofollow">talk</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/R_Lee_E" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/R_Lee_E" rel="nofollow">contribs</a>) 17:41, August 29, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>OK. The second Rolling Stone reference (first isn't really about Vegoose at all, just mentions it as one of umpteen upcoming performances) plus the Billboard article is good enough for me.
