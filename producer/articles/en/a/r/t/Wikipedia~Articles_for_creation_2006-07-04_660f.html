<p>Driza-Bone are a UK soul/dance/R n'B/ funk outfit. The group contains Billy April and Vince Garcia. Signed to Island records's Fourth and Broadway label, they released five solo singles and one album. In 1991, at their nascence, their featured vocalist was Dee Heron. With Driza-Bone, Heron provided soulful vocals on two of their well-known club hits. The first of these, "Real Love" was a Top 20 hit and is considered today one of the best soul/dance classics ever. It is constantly cropping up on "Best of..." compilations, by various artists. The follow-up, "Catch The Fire", had a garage like vibe to it, and also lit up dancefloors. Then, until 1994, the group were latent. That is, the producers April and Garcia still produced (innumerable) other artists' music, but released nothing under their own name, with their own vocalist, exclusive to them. In this sense, other work they produced for other artists can be seem as Driza-Bone records really since these respective records feature various and exclusive artists. These tracks can be considered Driza-Bone collaborations. An example is Lindy Layton: she was the temporary 'unique vocalist' for April and Garcia - so for Driza-Bone- on her 1991 single, "Without You".</p>
<p>In 1994, Driza-Bone became 'Drizabone' to mark the change in lead vocalist from Dee Heron to Rn'B singer Kymberley Peer. The debut single with Peer, "Pressure" was a big airplay and club hit, and hit the Top 40. This was followed by "Brightest Star". A totally re-recorded version of their "Real Love" hit from '91 was released, sung by Peer this time and not Heron. The production was different too and featured an MC's rap in the middle. The new version of "Real Love" was also a significant hit. A universally critically-acclaimed album was released at the end of 1994 entitled "Conspiracy". The album, unfortunately only reached #72. It attracted comparisons to the likes of Soul to Soul, Lisa Stansfield and The Brand New Heavies.</p>
<p><br />
Garcia and April have written, produced and remixed countless other tracks for many modern artists and are in HUGE demand. Their production is hugely original and distinctive, classy, soulful and sophisticated. They have remixed/produced Alison Limerick's "Hear My Call", Kylie Minogue's "Put Yourself In My Place" and Shanice's "I Love Your Smile", to name only a few.</p>

<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident. That all Chi-Chi's are created to salsafy our lives through good food, festive drink, and the pursuit of some serious fun.</p>
<p>Further, it is the right of the people to abolish routine. As a free and salsafied people, you have the full power to come together. To eat, to drink, to relax, to goof off, to pause.</p>

<p>An Ice Cream Panwich, as the name suggests, is like an ice cream sandwich, but made using a pancake. Ice cream is squashed evenly on top of a small to medium-sized pancake, which is then folded over. Like a taco, the Ice Cream Panwich is eaten with bare hands.</p>

<p>Mackellar Girls High School may seem like a great school for girls, but don't be fooled!!! There have been reports of bashings within the school and the principal is not supportve of integration of physically disadvantaged children. There was one incident where an academically gifted child who was in a manual wheelchair, had gained entrance into the talented program at the school and had her place taken away without notification. Though the school said they would put her on the waiting list, they took her off again without explanation. There has been much speculation whether or not the principal is having a lesbian relationship with the principal of another school, Killarney Heights High School. In short, Mackellar is a very dubious school, and the principal should be removed!</p>

<p>Michael Robert DePaolo was born the miller son of two merchant parents in the fall of 1887. He grew up playing jacks, acing spelling tests and challenging local farm animals to footraces.</p>
<a name="Footracing_Career" id="Footracing_Career"></a>

<p>Michael was a venerable footracer in his prime, competing against such greats as Hanes McClain and Higgins O'Rourke.</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:2runners.jpg">Image:2runners.jpg</a></p>
<p>His footracing career was cut violently short, however, upon a bout of influenza brought on by a strong case of youth obesity in 1895.</p>

<p>Michael's now infamous mid-life crisis came at the tender age of 13. As a miller son, he worked in the mills, until a freak milling accident left him with only 1 1/2 arms.</p>

<p>After the accident, Michael was never the same. With only 1 1/2 arms, he was no longer able to participate in recreational sports at a competitive level. The most vivid example of this is the account of a stickball game he played in the summer of 1901. Michael attempted to swing at a pitch, severing a tendon in his arm, disabling him for the remainder of the baseball-playing season. Neighborhood boys never knocked on his door again.</p>

<p>Following the severed nerve, and cut off from society, Michael's life deteriorated in the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>. Friends began to phone in prank stories about him to newspapers, claiming outlandish accounts that he had "eaten neighbors' livestock" or had "defecated on adjoining property." He hit rock bottom when he appeared in a local town play, completely nude from the waist down. These activities, along with the growing rumors that he was beginning to attain superpowers that made him immune to injury from rocks, led to Michael's stoning in 1923.</p>

<p>The mangostein is an exotic fruit first popularized in Western culture by Julian Russo's operetta, "Oh the Fruit of Thine Loins, Mangoroth, Mangostein." The fruit has semitic origins and is in fact first cited in the Book of Esther as the fruit that Queen Vashti is unwilling to serve to the guests of the royal court. Introduced to the Americas by Schlomo Mangostein in 1862, the fruit was a major component in fighting scurvy in the ranks of the Union Navy. The mangostein is an important cash crop in many Latin American economies and under the rule of Hugo Chavez has become the third greatest export from Venezuela after oil and rubber gloves.</p>

<p>After having captured four Spanish vessels off cape San Vicente (Portugal) in February of that year, Jervis, who sailed for Lisbon (Portugal) after the engagement, received orders from the admiralty that he should subdue the then blockaded Spanish port of CÃ¡diz (southern Spain), where the rest of the shattered Spanish squadron had sought shelter. The British first sea Lord thought that the easiness of JervisÂ´ victory over de CÃ³rdoba guaranteed a successful attack on that southern harbour. JervisÂ´ ships besieged CÃ¡diz more closely but, to their surprise, were repelled by an unexpected synergy force. Smaller cannon boats organised in a flotilla scattered across the bay under Spanish commander Mazarredo and brought disaster to JervisÂ´ fleet. These yachts, bearing one larger calibre cannon (24 pound), had a clear advantage when coastal warfare in shallow water was involved, as they could manoeuvre more easily, even in the darkness, and position themselves in order to attack the most vulnerable parts of ships of the line. The city batteries alongside the Spanish war ships anchored at harbour joined those boats in bombarding the assaulters, who loosened up the grip of the blockade and as a result many merchant convoys were able to enter and leave the port.</p>
<p><br />
THE BRITISH LOOK DOWN AT TENERIFE</p>
<p><br />
The blockading British war ships crews began feeling fed up with the long stay at sea and mutiny knocked on the captainÂ´s door. Jervis heard of treasure Spanish convoys from America arriving regularly at Tenerife, which was fortified, rather than at CÃ¡diz and sent two reconnoitring frigates over. Caught by surprise by boats from English frigates Minerve and Lively that entered the port of Sta. Cruz in the dark, French privateer frigate La Mutine and another Spanish frigate of the Philippine Company were captured in April. It encouraged the British fleet enough for Jervis to commission a small squadron with the aim of invading its capital Santa Cruz by means of an amphibian attack.</p>
<p>Therefore, on July 14, just promoted rear-admiral Horatio Nelson, hoisting his flagship on HMS Theseus, captain Miller, sailed for the Canary islands ahead of a squadron including HMSÂ´s Culloden, captain Troubridge, Zealous, captain Hood, all 74Â´s; frigates Seahorse (38) commanded by captain Freemantle, Emerald (36) by captain Waller and Terpsichore (32), captain Bowen; cutter Fox under lieutenant Gibson and cannon boat Ray, lieutenant Crompton. HMS Leander (50), captain Thompson, joined the flotilla once the attack had started. This plundering expedition amounted around 400 guns and nearly 4.000 men. They arrived in the vicinity of Sta. Cruz on July 17.</p>
<p>At Sta. Cruz, lieutenant general GutiÃ©rrez, a two-time victor over the British, hasted to prepare defence when he learned about he capture of La Mutine. He ordered city batteries and castles to be refortified by doubling their gun rows, which now had increased to 91, and piling earth sacks around. He was able to put together a force of 1.700 men from soldiers, partisans, local hunters, militia, artillery and French sailors from the taken French frigate.</p>
<p>According to NelsonÂ´s plan, Troubridge would lead the first move: the frigates of the fleet should approach as closer as possible and disembark the troops at night in order to fall on the heights and the batteries north east of the city. Then, cannon boat Ray would open mortar fire on the city. At break of dawn, the ships of the line would bear in the harbour and bombard the city to destruction unless the Spanish merchant ships anchored and their cargo either on board or that which had already been carried into the city was handed over to the British, as read the note sent by Nelson to the Spanish authorities.</p>
<p>On the 20th, Troubridge was on board Theseus to sharpen the last details of his duty. The disembark manoeuvre was conceived in two stages. In the first, men would be released at Valle Seco beach, some two miles west of Sta. Cruz harbour, so as to take Paso Alto castle in a surrounding approach. If the city did not surrender after conquering this point, the rest would head for the port and launch the definite attack. Force was over 1.000 men as each ship of the line provided 200 and 100 each frigate, supported by 80 artillerymen.</p>
<p>The plan began the next evening. In the clearness of the summer Canary night, citizens realised blurry figures sailing forward into the pier: the British boats, carrying the troops, were on their way. They were two groups: one of 23 boats and launches heading for the Bufadero cliff; the other, 16, coming right into the city. Authorities were updated as adverse streams held the English back. No marine bombardment was likely as ships could not get any closer and even though frigates could, the latter ported naval cannons of straight fire that could not reach the city. The British had just one curve shot mortar which could inflict little damage. They had no howitzer and carronades were of no use in this situation. Spanish cannons began firing heavily on the boats, wrecking some of them. The currents were too strong and the British decided to go back to the ships.</p>
<p>In a second attempt, frigates were tugged by the boats close to the Bufadero, where they anchored. Despite the Paso Alto castle shooting, the contrary streams and the lack of animals to carry the artillery, 1.000 British soldiers stepped on Valle Seco beach with some warfare material. In the middle of the night, some of the boats did not reach the beach and ended up strewn around, as no British officer knew the location.</p>
<p>Along the 23rd a heavy cannonade and musketry took place. GutiÃ©rrez managed to recruit more effectives and station them in the castle, as well as moved the forces from the Sta. Cruz fortress, now unnecessary, on to Paso Alto. The British, who lost two men, were harassed and troubled. Nelson, from the Theseus, called the troops back. Once on board, the three frigates slipped before the Candelaria beach and the Barranco Hondo, firing into the cliffs, intending to frighten and silence the defenders. Once rejected in Valle Seco, GutiÃ©rrez guessed NelsonÂ´s next move and brought most of the artillerymen in the port batteries, leaving just 30 militia men in Paso Alto. The British could not see the Spanish troops trips from one place to another, so they deemed the Spanish force larger than they actually were.</p>
<p>Nelson was between a rock and a hard place. Enraged by the failure of the first stage of his plan, he called his captains on board Theseus and explained how he himself would lead the next move ahead of a boat group followed by 5 more led by captains Troubrige, Miller, Hood, Waller and Thompson straight to the San CristÃ³bal castle, in Sta. Cruz harbour, where GutiÃ©rrez had by now assembled his best trained fighters.</p>
<p>In order to reduce the noise, cloth-padded rows propelled the boats at 10.30 p.m. on July 24 from around the Zealous into the harbour. Spanish frigate San JosÃ©, anchored 500 metres away from the pier, fired an alarm shot when sailors on board heard that the disembark troops were getting closer. Troubled waters were against the British, who amounted 700 in the boats, supported by 180 in cutter Fox and 80 in a Canary sloop taken earlier. Apart from the San CristÃ³bal castle, which had been pierced open in order to place a low huge 24 pound cannon, general GutiÃ©rrez had split his force in four strategic points: Pila square, Santos stream, CarnicerÃ­as beach and Santo Domingo monastery.</p>
<p>At around 23 h. a rain of cannon ball and musket bullet from the batteries of Paso Alto, San Miguel, San Antonio and San Pedro fell on the approaching British who saw some of their ammunition dampened by the waves. Several shots reached the cutter hull. Some of the boats reached the beaches and marines managed to stick a couple of cannons, yet others drifted away. Spanish mortars and cannons focused on the successful sailors and swept them away. Tens of British ripped soldiers were left scattered on the beach. An immense line of fire, ranged from Paso Alto to San Telmo castle, vomited iron on the small vessels. Before midnight cutter Fox was shot dramatically by crossed fire from the heights and sunk and more than half her crew drowned.</p>
<p>The cannon el Tigre, howling from the hole opened in San CristÃ³bal castle, hit NelsonÂ´s boat and tore off the rear-admiral right arm. Captain Bowen was killed on board his boat, which was reduced to a piece of shattered wood. Those soldiers who succeeded in reaching the beach were bullet riddled also from house terraces and windows. Citizenship was closely involved in repelling the attack to the point that, after the victory, some were given honours and medals.</p>
<p>Nelson was bleeding copiously and step-son lieutenant Nisbet cut a piece of his own neck handkerchief and tied it tightly around NelsonÂ´s arm to stop the bloodshed. The admiral refused to use frigate Seahorse, that was stationed close, to be taken back to his flagship, as it would imply captain Fremantle would have to hoist an SOS flag and demoralise the crews. Instead, the sailors of his boat rowed hard back to the Theseus. The surgeon had been warned of the contingency and he got his instruments ready. Nelson was cited saying as he pointed to his right arm âhey doc, I want to get rid of this useless piece of flesh hereâ. NelsonÂ´s operation was quick and aseptic. The limb was thrown over board, despite the admiralÂ´s wish to keep it.</p>
<p>The batteries increased the cannonade when they noticed that almost half thousand British soldiers managed to tread on the CarnicerÃ­as beach and were attempting to slip into the city. Captains Troubridge and Hood, leading 350 men, accomplished the taking of La ConsolaciÃ³n convent. However, the rest of the troops were defeated when they tried to jump into the San CristÃ³bal fortress from behind. Troubridge was aware of his desperate situation with no support from ships or more effectives coming to his aid, but he was still in the mood of joking. An envoy handed Gutierrez a letter from the captain where the Troubridge demanded the surrender of the Spaniards. GutiÃ©rrez, a veteran in fighting British braggarts, returned the mailman answering Troubridge should stop drinking in these situations. In the meantime, the Spanish general ordered the fire on the besieged British to be increased meanwhile he brought more artillerymen to the batteries closer to La ConsolaciÃ³n.</p>
<p>The rest of the British forces achieved disembarkation in Las CarnicerÃ­as and proceeded through the Santos cliff. Despite the heave fire from the Spanish fortresses, these men succeeded in joining Troubridge after being bottled in Sto. Domingo square.</p>
<p>GutiÃ©rrez had the Canarias battalion blockade the pier so that Troubridge could not make any escape back or any support come in. Two columns headed for the harbour, one behind the Sto. Domingo square in order to hinder the British advance inside the city and the other along the coast. In the morning, convalescent Nelson attempted to reinforce Troubridge by sending 15 boats into the pier. At around 1.00 am, a roaring fire flew over the small squadron. Three of them were sunk with more than 30 drowned, the rest rowed back shocked.</p>
<p>At this time, alcohol had absolutely drained TroubridgeÂ´s brain. The arrogant captain sent another message to GutiÃ©rrez through captain Hood, who showed up before the Spanish general with clear symptoms of delirium tremens. The post said that the British would take consideration of the poor Spanish people once the Spanish arms had surrendered to His Majesty soldiers. GutiÃ©rrez, seeing that Troubridge was out of his mind, offered a doctor had TroubridgeÂ´s head checked and, if necessary, further treatment at a local hospital. When soberness and judgement finally came down to the British officers, they accepted what was inevitable from the beginning and signed their surrender before the Spanish authorities.</p>
<p><br />
Nelson agreed to take notice of the Spanish victory back to the peninsula and frigate Emeral entered CÃ¡diz in late July. When Jervis learned about the fiasco he got mad at Nelson and his men as Jervis expected the mission to be accomplished. Jervis estimated the Spanish port cities such as CÃ¡diz or Sta. Cruz to be like the Spanish ships of the line that had been beaten hard back in February in a naval battle. Haughtiness and lack of proper material and human resources for an invasion led the British fleet sent against Tenerife to a painful defeat and they never tried to capture any Spanish city again.</p>
<p>The Spanish suffered 30 dead and 40 injured. The British 250 dead and 128 wounded. The way back to England was difficult as the British had lost many men and some sails. GutiÃ©rrez supported embarkation by means of two Spanish schooners. The Spanish general allowed the British to leave with their arms and war honours when, in fact, the weapons must have been captured and the men taken prisoners. Courteous letters were exchanged between Nelson and GutiÃ©rrez as a result of the final harmony. Nelson would later told that Tenerife was the most horrible hell he had ever endured, and not only because he had lost his arm.</p>

<p>Gongzong Emperor; Chinese æ­å®; Pinyin: GÅngzÅng; Birth Name: Zhou Xian; (c.1270- c.1323)- Seventh emperor of the Southern Song dynasty. Son of the empress Chuan and the emperor Duzong, Gongzong was emperor for less than a year, at age 4, under the regency of the dowager empress Xie. Gongzong's pseudo- reign was marked by Song defeats to the Mongol army and loss of control of the capital Hanzhou in 1276 to the Mongol general Bayan. The regent sent Gongzong's two brothers and their uncles to Fujian province for safety before announcing Song capitulation and removing Gongzong from the throne. The entire court was brought to Shangdu (Beijing) as prisoners. Khubilai Khan gave Gongzong an honorary title, Duke of Yingguo, and had him educated in Tibet as a Buddhist monk. In 1323, Gongzong committed suicide which led to rumors that he was the father of the future Mongol emperor Shundi, born in 1320 to a Turkish woman. The fate of Gongzong's two brothers was to become the last gasp of the Song dynasty as the Mongols pushed further south to eradicate the remnants of Song China. The eight year old Duanzong, son of the concubine Yang and the emperor Duzong, was declared emperor by the fugitives in Fuzhou, Fujian. The entire court soon had to flee and were taken to sea by the chief minister, Chen Yizhong who kept mobile along the shore as the Mongols moved closer. When Shanghai fell, the Mongols launched a naval attack and forced the court further in the sea where the ship sank in a typhoon. Most of the court managed to berth themselves near Hong Kong and though Duanzong survived the ordeal, he later died of shock. The six year old Bing Di was then named emperor by court officials. Once again the court was pushed out to sea amid Mongol advances and after months of regrouping, a counter attack on the Mongols was attempted. 1,000 ships were chained together in a line stretching the length of Hong Kong harbor; the ensuing battle lasted three weeks. The Mongols captured 800 Chinese ships and nearly 100,000 died in the melee. 16 ships managed to escape, including that of the dowager empress Yang. Bing Di did not survive, though it is said that a minister tried to save him by jumping off the ship with the emperor in arms. The Mongols found his body washed up on the shore. Yang was so distraught that she drowned herself and is now worshipped as a goddess of the sea along the coast. With that, the Song dynasty was at an end and the Mongols would reign as the Yuan Dynasty for 89 years.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-04_660f.html" title="Edit section: Grande Oriente Lusitano - MaÃ§onaria Portuguesa">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Grande Oriente Lusitano - MaÃ§onaria Portuguesa</span></h2>
<p>The <b>Grande Oriente Lusitano - MaÃ§onaria Portuguesa</b> (<i>Grand Orient of Lusitania - Portuguese Freemasonry</i>) is a symbolic masonic Obedience founded in 1802, thus being the oldest portuguese masonic Obedience. Its first Grand Master was SebastiÃ£o JosÃ© de SÃ£o Paio de Melo e Castro Lusignan, grandson of the first Marquis of Pombal, and his symbolic name was <i>Egas Moniz</i>.</p>
<p>The Grande Oriente Lusitano - MaÃ§onaria Portuguesa belongs to the masonic liberal current, proclaming the absolute liberty of conscience and adogmatism.</p>
<p>Its history in intimately related to the history of Portugal itself since the early 19th century. Some of the great changes Portugal has met during the 19th and 20th centuries were mostly due to the action of portugues Freemasonry, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Liberal Revolution of 1820;</li>
<li>The Abolishment of the Death Penalty, in 1867;</li>
<li>The establishment of the Portuguese Republic, in 1910.</li>
</ul>
<p>Opposing every form of oppression, the Grande Oriente Lusitano has faced throughout its history many moments of fierce persecution by the most conservative and reactionary wings of society. Amongst these moments, the prohibition during the Estado Novo dictatorship (law nÂº1901 dated 13th of May 1935, proposed by JosÃ© Cabral who had recently joined the single state-ruled party <i>UniÃ£o Nacional</i>, National Union, after leaving the portuguese integralists and the national-sindicalists leadered by Francisco RolÃ£o Preto) which forced portuguese freemasons into clandestinity and often prison and political exile. [Fernando Pessoa], the renowned portuguese poet, who assumed himseld as a profane (or non-mason) published an article in <i>DiÃ¡rio de Lisboa</i> (Lisbon Daily, a daily newspaper) defending Freemasonry and specifically the Grande Oriente Lusitano. During clandestinity (1935-1974), the Grande Oriente Lusitano had its buildings confiscated and the Masonic Palace, in center Lisbon, occupied by the LegiÃ£o Portuguesa (<i>Portuguese Legion</i>, a para-military political force created for the "defense of the State").</p>
<p>The Revolution of the Carnations on the 25th of April of 1974 revoqued law nÂº1901 and the Grande Oriente Lusitano could once more see the light of day and have its buildings returned.</p>
<p>Amongst its members one may find very important names of the History of Portugal and the World:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gomes Freire de Andrade (Grand-Master of the Grande Oriente Lusitano at the time of his death in 1817);</li>
<li>Manuel Fernandes TomÃ¡s (founder of SinÃ©drio, a secret society created to organize the Liberal Revolution of 1820);</li>
<li>Manuel da Silva Passos (better known as Passos Manuel, proeminent liberal politician);</li>
<li>SebastiÃ£o de MagalhÃ£es Lima (founder of the Portuguese League of the Rights of Man);</li>
<li>Bernardino LuÃ­s Machado GuimarÃ£es (president of the Republic);</li>
<li>JosÃ© Relvas (proclamed the Republic from on the 5th of October of 1910 from the balcony of Lisbon's Municipality);</li>
<li>JosÃ© Mendes Ribeiro Norton de Matos (Grand-Master of the Grande Oriente Lusitano, general and candidate for the democratic opposition on the presidential elections of 1948);</li>
<li>Afonso Costa (republican politician, several times prime-minister);</li>
<li>AntÃ³nio Egas Moniz (doctor in medicine, Nobel Prize);</li>
<li>Gago Coutinho (aviator);</li>
<li>EmÃ­dio Guerreiro (mathematician, politician, antifascist resistant, fought in the Spanish Civil War for the republicans, member of the french resistance in WWII, founder of the portuguese Popular Democratic Party, PPD);</li>
<li>Fernando Valle (doctor in medicine and politician, founder of the portuguese Socialist Party);</li>
<li>JosÃ© MartÃ­ (martir of cuban independence, initiated in 1871 at <i>ArmonÃ­a</i> nÂº52 lodge at the Orient of Madrid, of the Grande Oriente Lusitano);</li>
<li>and many more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the auspices of the Grande Oriente Lusitano there are lodges of the Ancient and Accepted Scotish Rite and of the French Rite. These Rites and administered by the respective philosofic Potences with which the Grande Oriente Lusitano has a treaty to confer the symbolic degrees:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gremiolusitano.pt/?menu=4&amp;submenu=9" class="external text" title="http://www.gremiolusitano.pt/?menu=4&amp;submenu=9" rel="nofollow">Supreme Council of the Grand Inspector-General of the 33rd Degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scotish Rite for Portugal and its jurisdiction</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gremiolusitano.pt/?menu=4&amp;submenu=10" class="external text" title="http://www.gremiolusitano.pt/?menu=4&amp;submenu=10" rel="nofollow">Sovereign Grand Chapter of the Cavaliers Rose-Croix - Grand Chapter General of the French Rite of Portugal</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three potences are represented in civil society through the GrÃ©mio Lusitano, a cultural, recreational and philanthropic society whose head quarters are situated at the Rua do GrÃ©mio Lusitano, number 25, in Lisbon. This building, the Masonic Palace, also hosts the Portuguese Masonic Museum, considered by many as one of the best of its kind in Europe. The Museum is open to the general public.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-04_660f.html" title="Edit section: Gillespie's Hypothesis of Business Leadership">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gillespie's Hypothesis of Business Leadership</span></h2>
<p>Developed by Roger M. Gillespie of Clarkston, Michigan. The author is a business consultant and a media &amp; communications professional.</p>
<p>The business world still is full NiccolÃ² Machiavelliâs style of leadership. The âdo-as-I-say not as I doâ style is counterproductive to succeed in business.</p>
<p>It is believed that everyone knows what Leadership is but few actually understand it or practice it. This may be because few have actually experienced an organization that practices organizational leadership â management yes, leadership no. There is a difference between management and leadership. Management is a process where Leadership is management philosophy. Both are needed however having only a management process will create an economic disadvantage.</p>
<p>This has lead me to develop Gillespieâ Hypothesis of Business Leadership:</p>
<pre>
n1: 80% of all businesses lack true leadership.
n2: Your business is NOT an exception. 
</pre>
<p>n3: Gillespieâs Corollary â The 80% figure is probably low but it fits into the Pareto Principle.</p>

<p>Harbour View High School is a grade 9-12 school in the City of Saint John, new Brunswick, Canada. It was created in 1997 when the 5 high schools in Saint John were zoned geographically and Saint John Vocational High School became HVHS, making the population rise from over 200 to over 900. In 2001 the school peaked at around 1350 after many classrooms were added on or old shops and labs were divided up. After 2001 the school district reversed the geographical zoning rule and the population started to decline again as many students chose to attend the two "uptown high schools", Saint John High and St. Malachy's Memorial. In 2006, the school population is just under 1100.</p>

<p>The story opens at a tiny island called Morrowland (original name: Lummerland), which has just enough space for a a small palace, a train station and rails all around the island, a convenience store, a small house, a king, two subjects, a locomotive named Emma, and an engine driver by the name of Luke (Lukas). One day, the postman - who has to come by ship - drops off a package with a nearly illegible address with the names <i>Mrs. Krintuuth</i> and <i>Zorroulend</i>, and a large 13 on the back. After a futile search for the addressee all over the island, the people open the package - and find to their immense surprise a black baby inside. After the surprise has died down, the baby is adopted by the islanders and is named Jim Button.</p>
<p>But as he grows up, the King begins to worry about the fact that there is no space to let Jim live on the island once he's grown up, and he announces to Luke that Emma has to be removed. Luke, upset about this decision, decides to leave the island with his locomotive, but Jim (who had accidentally listened to Luke as he related his sorrows to Emma) decides to come along. Converting Emma into a makeshift ship, they sail off the island in the night and eventually arrive at the coast of <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>.</p>
<p>When they arrive in Ping, the capital, they win the friendship of a tiny great-grandchild named Ping Pong, and from him they learn that the Emperor is in mourning because his daughter, Li Si, has been kidnapped. Luke and Jim offer their help, and while investigating the circumstances of Li Si's disappearance they stumble upon several names which are directly connected to Jim's mysterious arrival on Morrowland: Mrs. Grindtooth (Frau Mahlzahn), the Wild 13, and the name Sorrowland. Now the two friends have one more reason to go to the Dragon City (which is located in Sorrowland) and confront Mrs. Grindtooth.</p>
<p>After a long and very hazardous journey - in which they make two new friends: Mr. Tur Tur the Giant (who is actually a "Scheinriese", an illusionary giant), and Nepomuk the half-dragon - they arrive in the Dragon City and free Princess Li Si and a large number of children, who had all been kidnapped by the Wild 13, a gang of pirates, and sold to Mrs. Grindtooth so she could torture them by "playing" school. They take the dragon with them as they make the journey back on the <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_River_0e4b.html" title="Yellow River">Yellow River</a>, which has its origin right in the Dragon City. Making it back to China, where they receive a triumphal welcome, they are surprised by two startling news: that Mrs. Grindtooth is to turn into a Golden Dragon of Wisdom, and that the other inhabitants of Morrowland want them back on the island!</p>
<p>With a last advice given by Mrs. Grindtooth and the generous assitance by the Emperor, Luke and Jim come into the possession of a swimming island, which should solve the problem of Jim's future residence, and after a cordial welcome back on Morrowland, Jim and Li Si become engaged, and Jim gets a baby locomotive, which he names Molly. But there are yet many questions to solve, and these call for another adventure...</p>

<p>While the novel and its sequel are supposed to play in about the 20th century, there are many elements mixed in which create an atmosphere of intentional anachronism: China is still an empire, and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_02d7.html" title="Native Americans">Native Americans</a> and <a href="../../../e/s/k/Eskimos.html" title="Eskimos">Eskimos</a> still live in their traditional ways, while ocean liners, telephones, post service, chewing gum and many other modern conveniences are already in use.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many ficturous locations, like the "Crown of the World", a vast mountain range coloured in red and white stripes, and the Magnetic Cliffs. Some of these are based on legendary and real places - here the <a href="../../../h/i/m/Himalaya.html" title="Himalaya">Himalaya</a> range and the magnetic cliffs in the Voyages of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinbad_the_Sailor_2f5b.html" title="Sinbad the Sailor">Sinbad the Sailor</a>, repsectively - but there are also original locations.</p>

<p>High Distortion is a <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_Rock_2583.html" title="Hard Rock">Hard Rock</a> band from Aurora, Ontario. The band was originally formed by lead guitarist Spencer and drummer Chris (last names left undisclosed) in 2004. They were only 11 years old. The band soon added schoolmate and rhythm guitarist James. The band was missing a bassist. They were about to call it quits until James found Paul, a bassist from his hockey team. With that lineup they had a complete band. High Distortion never chose to add a vocalist due to management reasons.</p>
<p>Unfortunately High Distortion never got anywhere. They would spend most of their practices being distracted by other things such as video games and computers. However, the band did gain some popularity among their classmates at school. After reading a promotion poster on the school's bulletin board, Brian, classmate and close friend to the band members decided to become the band's manager. Along with Brian came schoolmate Andrew, who became the band's official merchandise seller.</p>
<p>Once all of this was finally organized, the band members began to lose interest in the idea of being in a band. The band never actually broke up, they just decided that they did not have enough skill and commitment to continue. They had slowly come to an end.</p>
<p>High distortion had never actually released any albums or singles, or even play any live shows. The band only lasted a total of two weeks.</p>
<p>Te only promotion the band ever had other than bulletin board notices was a <a href="../../../p/i/c/Piczo.html" title="Piczo">Piczo</a> website. You can find the band's site at <a href="http://www.highdistortionkicks.piczo.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.highdistortionkicks.piczo.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>Spencer is still playing guitar and is improving on his musical knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>Chris has probably been the most successful band member after the breakup. He has now co-formed a band called Almost a Band. They are currently having more success than High Distortion ever did.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-04_660f.html" title="Edit section: [ [DUNNOSE HEAD, WEST FALKLAND] ]">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">[ [DUNNOSE HEAD, WEST FALKLAND] ]</span></h2>
<p>Dunnose Head is a long peninsula which is on the west side of West Falkland. To the North is Christmas Harbour and King George Bay. To the South is Port Philomel, Philomel Pass and Queen Charlotte Bay. Historically Dunnose Head was part of the Packe Bros group of farms which included Fox Bay East (Wethers) Port Howard Packes (Yearlings) and Dunnose Head (Breeding Ewes &amp; Wethers). The Settlement was located on the South Shore seaward of Halfway Creek, in a small natural cove with a jetty. The settlement contained a cookhouse, a new manager's house, and old manager's house, woolshed, Drafting Pens and dip, and sundry other settlement buildings with four surrounding paddocks. There were outlying shanties at Raus Creek and Gun Hill. There was also an outside Shepherd's House at Shallow Harbour. Sheep Camps were as follows. South Camp (Ewes) North Camp (Ewes) Centre Camp (Ewes) Stud Flock (Stud Ewes) Cattle Ground (Wethers) Narrows (Wethers) and Gun Hill (Wethers). Today Dunnose Head is divided into three farms. One is based on the Shallow Harbour House, and two on the old Settlement near Halfway Creek. There is a large Gentoo Penguin Rookery at the base of Mare Rincon in the old South Camp, and a further Rookery at The Narrows. Sealions are to be found on Seal Island on the South Side of Philomel Pass. Whales have been seen in Philomel Pass, and there was a well documented beaching of Pilot Whales in Port Philomel in recent years. I believe there are still Quarks (Night Herons) on Seal Island. Philomel Pass has the second fastest tide race in the Falklands, the fastest being Tamar Pass. Dunnose Head was bombed by the RAF during the 1982 war, which resulted in building damage, and injuries to two people. Tim Miller (Son of Sydney Miller, late of Hill Cove) lost an eye. The RAF believed that the Airstrip at Dunnose Head was being used by the Argentines to land freight aircraft for the transshipment of supplies. This was following the long range bombing of Stanley Airport, which was thought to have made the runway unusable. Actually the runways were quickly repaired, and aircraft inbound from Argentina were dropping to hedge height to evade radar, and continued to land at Stanley.</p>

<p>Most of this is from personal knowledge of experiences working at Dunnose Head in 1962 &amp; 1963. Information on the Pilot Whales beaching in Port Philomel is from Ian Strange book on the Wildlife of the Falklands. Information on the bombing of Dunnose Head is from correspondence with Tim Miller, and various books about the 1982 war.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Aird, October 20th, 1955 - June 26, 2006</p>
<p>Elizabeth Aird was born in Vancouver on October 20th, 1955. She was raised and educated in Ontario, where she began her successful journalism career. Elizabeth returned to Vancouver in 1978 and eventually joined the Vancouver Sun as a reporter, later a critic and featured columnist. She was a publicist for such movies as Cold Front and Bird on a Wire before joining the newspaper in 1988.</p>
<p>Ms. Aird was born in Vancouver but spent most of her childhood in Oakville, ON, and later Toronto. As a teenager, she once babysat Keanu Reeves.</p>
<p>In her 20s she returned to Vancouver, where she started writing for a city-owned publication, The Urban Reader, and worked as a film publicist before joining the Sun in 1988.</p>
<p>As a movie critic, Ms. Aird received a National Newspaper Award nomination in 1992. Reviewing Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, she wrote: "So, you want a little blood with your comedy? How about a little torture with your hit parade of '70s bubblegum hits? Hum along with Stuck in the Middle with You while we chop this cop's ear off. Having fun yet?"</p>
<p>Liz was an outspoken and unflagging champion of the underdog and frequently went out on a limb for causes she believed in.</p>
<p>She was on medical leave at the time for her death; she died suddenly at her Kerrisdale home on June 26, 2006 at the age of 50.</p>

<p>Tim Mackintosh-Smith (b.1961)lives in an ancient tower house off the market of the cows in the old city of San'a Yemen. From there he has authored the Thomas Cook/Daily Telegraph prize winning "Yemen: Travels in Dictionaryland" (1997), and more recently the first two volumes of his journeys in 'the footnotes" of Ibn Batutah: "Travels with A Tangerine"(2001)and "The Hall of a Thousand Columns" (2005). He has written widely on subjects as broad as the collection of frankincense, the stories of M.R. James and the history of umbrellas. He has featured in a documentary film "The English Sheik and the Yemeni Gentleman", and is presenting a BBC documentary series recreating the experience of tracing Ibn Batutah's fourteenth century travels into the present day. Despite his refuge in a distant corner of Arabia, Tim has succeeded in becoming celebrated among the literati of Europe and the Americas and hopes to make lots and lots of money. His brilliant treatment for a feature film about the modern day descendants of Ibn Batutah seeking their rightful inheritance may serve this purpose.</p>

The Appalacian Trail passes to the south very near to Lake Chatuge and the nearby town of Hiawassee, Georgia, is a favorite stop-over for many hikers on the trail. Home to the Georgia Mountain Fair, Hiawassee becomes a very busy place in July and August as vacationers from all over the Southeast converge for many things, including top-name Country Music concerts at the Georgia Mountain Fair, and fine dining at many of the areas high-end restaurants. Surrounding towns include Young Harris, Georgia, &amp; Hayesville, North Carolina.
