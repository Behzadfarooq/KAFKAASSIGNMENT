<p>This article survived a previous AfD with a no consensus closure. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2007_March_4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113875584" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2007_March_4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113875584" rel="nofollow">A DRV consensus</a> narrowly overturned, citing inadequate consideration of WP:BLP, and lack of extensive reasoning by the closer. The matter is resubmitted to AfD for new consideration. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 18:00, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Note</b>: this is actually the fourth time this article has been nominated for deletion. <a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfacets_25b2.html" title="User:Sfacets"><span style="font-family:century gothic"><font color="DarkRed">S</font>facets</span></a> 00:48, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Two early nominations came while the matter was still in the tabloids, and before the current version of WP:LIVING a/k/a WP:BLP was adopted, and this is a relisting of the third nomination because the reviewing administrator at DRV decided to relist for more community input (see above). <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:01, 10 March 2007 (UTC) (nominator)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. There are no BLP concerns at work here, and it meets all of our standards. Given the amount of attention, no harm can be done by our article on it, so there's no problem. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:06, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> A trivial piece of malicious gossip. No way is this encyclopaedic. Its brief appearance in a few sections of the UK media for a couple of days last summer does not mean this is permanently notable or accurate (count the "allegedlys"). Utterly unworthy of this project. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 18:36, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This doesn't seem to have gotten any media attention other than a few days in May... I can't buy that the alleged perpetrator of one count of small-time eBay fraud is notable. -<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisherQueen_a50d.html" title="User:FisherQueen">FisherQueen</a> (<a href="../../../f/i/s/User_talk%7EFisherQueen_b952.html" title="User talk:FisherQueen">Talk</a>) 19:13, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as the original AfD and DRV nominator. From my prior statement: "This article unnecessarily publicizes embarrassing events in the life of an otherwise unknown living person. As noted in the article itself, the Internet publicity given to these events has seriously damaged this individual's life and we should not knowingly participate in further doing so. The page, although created and edited in good faith, is the functional equivalent of an attack page against a non-notable person. See my comments at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Doc_glasgow_7bc7.html#Outside_view_by_Newyorkbrad" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Doc glasgow">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Doc glasgow#Outside view by Newyorkbrad</a>, and other participants' comments in that RfC, as well as recent threads on the notability policy pages for related discussion. In addition, it has been noted that this article's reports of unproven allegations raise WP:LIVING issues, and also that the proposed NOTNEWS guideline would also strongly support deletion. The "do no harm" test underlying WP:LIVING as applied to a non-notable person strongly supports deletion of this article, whose encyclopedic value is slight, as a matter of principle. It would be desirable for the community to have the opportunity to address this set of issues in a situation that is not wiki-notorious a la Brian Peppers and Daniel Brandt." <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 19:18, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Notable as multiple reliable sources. --J2thawiki 20:35, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per NYB sometimes we need to rise above the tendency to source count (and the sources here are bad anyway - and article which uses 'alleged' and 'claimed' as often as this one does should be speedy deleted anyway). With the powerful medium we are comes some responsibilities - the fact is that we don't need this trivial rubbish, and we are a better encyclopedia without it. BLP isn't just a rule to be applied - it is a mindset to be adopted.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 21:34, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> WP:NOT vigilante justice. This is the sort of material which circulates in a tabloid for a week then ends up in the bottom of the bird cage.. where it belongs because it's just not encyclopedic. Maybe if people are still talking about it years from now it will be worth documenting, but it's a violation of our duty to make a determination of notability which may ultimately be self-fulfilling. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 21:41, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> once again. This is not encyclopedic, it's just a continuation of unfounded harrassment based on an unproven claim against a living person. We don't need to extend this ridiculous 15 minutes of fame piece. I see no reason to think this is of continued importance. The references are from a very limited time-span. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 22:05, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename</b> (possibly to Laptop Guy?) - the article needs a new name, certainly, but has notability via mention in several daily newspapers. I recall hearing about this back when it was still fresh, and I'm hardly a blogoholic. NPOV here is tricky, as to the best of my knowledge, Mr. Tofangsazan has not gone on the "official" record with his version of events, and I beleive it prudent to keep in mind that <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> was never convicted of any crime, either. Fifteen minutes of fame is still fame. --Action Jackson IV 23:47, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> - this is the fourth AFD for this article - it meets all the criteria for an article, there is no reason it should be deleted. As well as being notable in the media, it was a huge <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Phenomenon_7c5a.html" title="Internet Phenomenon">Internet Phenomenon</a> which attracted millions of visitors. If this article were to be deleted, it would be a hypocritical double standard and other articles such as <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonsai_Kitten_9206.html" title="Bonsai Kitten">Bonsai Kitten</a>, and in fact most of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Category%7EInternet_memes_6268.html" title="Category:Internet memes">Category:Internet_memes</a>. This has nothing to do with vigilante justice, the article is neutral in tone and well sourced.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. It is well referenced and there are dozens of other references that can be added from other British papers, if there is a need. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 00:48, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Could you cite those sources please? Most of us don't have access to UK news archives.

<li>I have added a couple more to the article, one from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a> (major UK broadsheet) and one from the BBC.

<ul>
<li>I'm not convinced yet that it meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTNEWS_ff3e.html" title="WP:NOTNEWS">WP:NOTNEWS</a>. If it does, it seems borderline. The sources from the Google News Archive are mostly from the same week, and the ones which come later are one- or two- paragraph mentions which use it as a hook for articles whose main focus is digital privacy. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTNEWS_ff3e.html" title="WP:NOTNEWS">WP:NOTNEWS</a> requires multiple-paragraph coverage in distinct articles spanning multiple weeks. Can you point to any multiple=paragraph coverage of this after early June, 2006? The longest I can find is two paragraphs in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macleans.html" title="Macleans">Macleans</a> <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> 17:59, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I do not think it meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTNEWS_ff3e.html" title="WP:NOTNEWS">WP:NOTNEWS</a> either. However this is not wikipeida policy, it is proposed policy. If it passes then this should definitely be revisited and I will support any deletion. The sources provided are sufficent to meet <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGameKeeper_fab7.html" title="User:GameKeeper">GameKeeper</a> 00:51, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>According to its talk page, WP:NOTNEWS has support in principle. It is likely to pass in some form. Since Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy, I think it's reasonable to apply a policy or guideline in advance of it actually passing.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> 01:13, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. To say that there are no <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">BLP</a> concerns at all is to ignore the plain wording of that policy. The question remaining is whether those concerns are outweighed by other considerations. In this case, I do not consider them to justify the continuation of this page. It is a hostile page written about a person who is at best semi-public and who has not apparently taken any steps to put himself into the public eye. This is a trivial little spat that got some column-inches on a slow newsday. Wikipedia is not WikiNews. The argument that we have to keep it because "it's an internet meme" also utterly fails to convince me. This has no place in the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 00:57, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I also added a link to a BBC source article, and there are more if anyone thinks that it is necessary to add more.

<li><b>Delete</b> per NY Brad, Makemi, Rossami, etc. A case of unremarkable people and unremarkable events. Please leave playing journalist to the people on Wikinews. I entirely agree with Doc Glasgow that articles on living people where "alleged" or its variants need to be employed to explain the "notability" of the subject should be speedily deleted, probably under G10. There's no deadline, and we can easily wait until allegations become facts, or not as the case may be, before publishing. It does a great deal of harm, to us and to the subjects, to include this egregious <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>-ignoring eyesore. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 11:54, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

It's 2050, and for whatever reason the subject of this article is going to be the subject of a PhD thesis (original research in action). How would the hypothetical PhD student research their thesis? They'd consult press and web archives, diaries, official documents, etc. Their paper would reference the Times, the Independent, diaries, an archive of Sawyer's blog if available, and similar material. Although it would be much longer, better written, and in a position to offer some broader context for the events, the hypothetical thesis would be based on exactly the same kind of sources as this article. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 13:23, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

So, what I would suggest is maybe merge the whole incident, condense to a few sentences and redirect the article to <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBay_4cc0.html" title="EBay">eBay</a>. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 01:14, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</s></li>
<li>Forget it, <b>delete</b> it. The incident might be notable, but this person ain't.

<dd><b>Comment</b> And the first of the handful of sources dates from May 30, 2006, the last from June 3, 2006. There has been nothing subsequently.

<li>Same vote as last time, after looking at the sources provided: *<b>Delete</b>. Strictly under <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>, this article unfortunately passes muster. However, I'll apply the proposed <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTNEWS_ff3e.html" title="WP:NOTNEWS">WP:NOTNEWS</a> which is likely to gain consensus in a form that would support deleting this article. Even in the absence of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTNEWS_ff3e.html" title="WP:NOTNEWS">WP:NOTNEWS</a>, common sense indicates that we are not a directory of news stories, and if we have to cut off minor news stories this is a good place to start. The argument that the sources focus on the event, not the person, is also a good argument for not having an article <i>at this title.</i> Having said this, if this event happens to be discussed in an article describing its historical significance (if there is any), its significance to the study of Internet memes, etc., I don't think I would object to including the information in those kinds of contexts. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> 00:58, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Being an internet phenomenon does not necessarily mean that something is inherently notable, and neither does appearing in the news. This was in the news for a couple days nine months ago, there is no lasting significance. Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedia, this article is not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 11:12, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - this article use to be terrible. Photos with dubious copyright status and probably violating BLP, OR, and other such stuff. I did my best to improve it, nominating the photos to be deleted &amp; removing some of the worst content. But none of this changes the fact the person is not noteable, only the incident so we shouldn't have an article on the person anyway. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 19:21, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
