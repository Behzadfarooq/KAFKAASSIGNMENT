<li><b>Comment</b>September 20th, 2006 - I am the creator of www.beerdiegame.com and I can assure you that it is a legit site. Some people may play it differently than others but it's all basicly the same. I learned it at Ball State University from a friend in ZBT. His brothers brought the game back from out east in the early 90's. Originally played on a door that had been ripped off frame. From there we/it evolved into what it is today. Minor changes to the game to only make it better and more competitive, like adding the net with the fringe so you can see if the die goes under the net. Circles on each corner among other rules.
<ul>
<li>I tried to use that logic last time, but got shot down by people who insisted one non-mirror ref was good enough. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 14:55, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>43 Man Squamish is, as the article notes right off the bat, notable because it was invented by <i>MAD</i> magazine as a joke, but so great was the popularity and influence of the magazine that students at a number of colleges formed teams to try and play it.
<p>I can't believe I'm the inclusionist here. I have demonstrated above that a) Wikipedia has a number of drinking game articles and b) Google returns 103,000 hits for this game, very few of which are mirrors.

<dd>In and of themselves, no. But eliminate 25% of the ghits for this and you've still got well over 70,000. We've kept articles with far less than that as a measure of sheer notability. I believe that in this case the ghits are a proxy for whether people actually play this game. We've got multiple non-mirror sites discussing and delineating rules for this. To address a point that's come up in other drinking-game AFDs, there are places to go if someone challenges where a particular rule came from other than Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 04:39, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

The most compelling reason to keep this is that it is a valuable resource to those who choose to play Beer Die. Additionally, one of the great things about the game is that while there are basic, undeniable rules, the more nuanced rules are open to discussion, debate, and style. This wikipedia entry provides a necessary forum for hashing out those nuances.</s> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jjabodee (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jjabodee_65a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jjabodee">contribs</a>) .</small> <s>*<b>Keep</b>What makes our country great is the freedom to spend days on end throwing balls at cups - and the right to spread the gospel of the sheer beauty of the game to others.</s></p>
