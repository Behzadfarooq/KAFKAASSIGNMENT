<p>James Bla Pahinui is the second oldest son of the legendary Hawaiian slack-key guitar player Philip “Pops” “Gabby” Pahinui. He started playing music at the age of ten when his Dad bought him a Martin ukulele and learned how to play the instrument from watching his Dad. As he grew older he joined in the backyard jams at their Waimanalo home and eventually joined his Dad on stage during the Hawaiian Renaissance of the 1970s.</p>
<p>The early Doo-Wop bands of the 50s are his primary influence (besides his Dad of course): Shep and the Limelights, Bobby Day and the Hollywood Flames, The Penguins, The Cellos, The Heartbeats, The Skyliners, and early Elvis. Also local groups: The Mop Tops, and the Kasuals. These groups instilled in him a strong love of harmonies and simple melodic lines.</p>
<p>From his Dad, Bla learned about Hawaiian music, the importance of strong rhythms and an appreciation for Latin music.</p>
<p>Bla’s style ranges from rhythm and blues, good-time rock and roll to soulful renditions of traditional Hawaiian favorites. Many remember Bla playing at the Sand Castle or Betty Reilly’s and bringing down the house with his versions of classic rock and roll tunes. Even today, when jamming, the songs will eventually turn to the old classics.</p>
<p>His two best-known songs are Moonlight Lady written by Carlos Andrade and recorded with his Dad and Waimanalo Blues written by Liko Martin and performed with Cyril and Martin Pahinui, Ry Cooder, Jim Keltner and David Lindley.</p>
<p>Over the years, he has had several bands (Jimmy and the Playboys in the early 60s) and played with many of Hawaii’s best musicians: Peter Moon, Palani Vaughn and the Brothers Cazimero in Sunday Manoa, with his brothers Cyril and Martin in the early 90s, Ledward Kaapana, Bernard Kalua, Dennis Kamakahi, and Mike Kaawa.</p>
<p>Ry Cooder's June 2005 release, Chavez Ravine, Bla Pahinui can be heard doing vocals on "Third Base, Dodger Stadium". Bla also plays guitar and ukulele on the album.</p>

<p>Tribler is a social <a href="../../../b/i/t/BitTorrent_9cbd.html" title="BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a> client developed by a research group from the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. It is based on the <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_%28Yet_Another_BitTorrent_Client%29_1350.html" title="ABC (Yet Another BitTorrent Client)">ABC</a> <a href="../../../b/i/t/BitTorrent_9cbd.html" title="BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a> client and distributed under the <a href="../../../g/p/l/GPL_a75a.html" title="GPL">GPL</a> licence. The goal of Tribler is to add a social community to file sharing networks. It has additional features so that people can identify eachother securely (permanent identifiers) and can help eachother with downloading (cooperative downloading). Furthermore, Tribler has a distributed recommender system (BuddyCast), that automatically selects <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torrent.html" title="Torrent">torrent</a> files that the user probably likes. BuddyCast selects peers with a similarity in download history, to recommend files that are probably your taste. Tribler also introduced merkle hash torrents. These torrent files do not have to include hash values of all pieces of a torrent file. Therefore, the size of merkle torrents are much smaller than original torrents.</p>
<p>Tribler has also additional software to distribute live video streams instead of files. The latest release of Tribler is version 3.3.6, which can be freely download from the website.</p>
<p>At 27 April 2006 the Tribler client project won the dutch Vosko Trophy for Business and Innovation. The technical details of Tribler are published in a paper, presented at the IPTPS conference.</p>

<p>Undermountain is a vast <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labyrinth.html" title="Labyrinth">labyrinth</a> of caverns under the area of <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterdeep_%28city%29.html" title="Waterdeep (city)">Waterdeep</a>. At least nine levels deep and possibly more. These caverns' true creators are unknown. Currently Halaster Blackcloak is rumored to use Undermountain as his playground (307 DR - 1370 DR). The lower 3 levels were delved by dwarves. Below that not much is known of Undermountain.</p>
<p>The upper levels house many famous sites such as <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skullport.html" title="Skullport">Skullport</a>, also known as the Port of Shadows. <a href="../../../q/i/l/Qilu%C3%A9.html" title="Qilué">Qilué</a> and the Promenade of Eilistraee, a temple complex North-east of <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skullport.html" title="Skullport">Skullport</a> dedicated to the good aligned followers of <a href="../../../e/i/l/Eilistraee.html" title="Eilistraee">Eilistraee</a>. Both of which are on the third level.</p>

<p>W.G. Bench is not a "well known Archeologist" (sic) and his collection is unverified and unknown except to the author of the entry. Paraskevaides Museum is a trading name used by a notorious internet-vendor of forgeries, coins and antiquities by the name of Eftis Paraskevaides. The term "museum" is used by their company to describe their stock-in-trade and should not be confused with a public collection of any kind. I would strongly recommend that the entry for WG Bench is deleted from Wikipedia for the above reasons. I am not supplying a published source for this information as I am not proposing an article for submission.</p>

<p><b>David Wayne</b> is the moniker of electronica artist Wayne Gulezian. He is best known as the dance\pop musician and songwriter who has had songs on hundreds of dj pool charts across America and in parts of Europe. He originally uploaded his music on mp3.com as a storage solution while transferring from Boston, MA to Rome, Italy. Shortly after, he started to gain a large following from dance and electronic music lovers around the world. Critics have often cited groups such as Depeche Mode and Joy Division when describing the catchy pop melodies, dance beats and deep alternative sounding vocals. Total internet downloads of his music have grown to well over 200,000. He has a very large GLBT following due to the many catchy disco tracks he has written and due to a particularly unique PR campaign where a "word of mouth" buzz was created.</p>

<p>Dorian Shainin, an engineer who left his quality and reliability stamp on a host of products from lunar landers to automobiles to light bulbs over a 60-year swath, died on January 7th at the age of 85 in Manchester, Connecticut. The cause of death was heart failure.</p>
<p>When managers at Fortune 500 corporations and up-and-coming small businesses were confronted by quality/reliability problems that stumped them, they sought the counsel of Dorian Shainin. He founded the technical-problem-solving company, Shainin® LLC, that is widely respected today.</p>
<p>Shainin developed more than 20 statistical engineering techniques that became the core of the Shainin Systems for quality and reliability improvement. These systems have helped manufacturers solve quality problems they thought unsolvable. The Shainin techniques helped Motorola win the first Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in 1989.

<p>Located in the central part of the Caspian Sea near maritime border between Russia and Kazakhstan, the Kurmangazy field (formerly known as the Kulalinsky field) is the least developed of Kazakhstan's upcoming oil and gas developments. In July 2005, however, Russia and Kazakhstan signed a new $23 billion production sharing agreement for the Kurmangazy field. After some delay, the Russian and Kazakh state oil firms Rosneft and KazMunaiGaz signed the deal in the hopes that this would expedite the field's development. The agreement delineates the Kazakh and Russian sectors of the Caspian seabed and defines the development of Kurmangazy and two other disputed offshore fields that are situated near the Kazakh/Russian border.</p>
<p>The Kurmangazy field has an estimated area of 380 square kilometers. Geologists estimate that the Kurmangazy field contains up to 45.5 billion barrels of oil, of which 4 to 13 billion barrels will be recoverable. As a result, this field is expected to produce up to 600,000 barrels per day in the next decade. Production from the Kurmangazy field will be exported through the CPC and BTC pipelines. In addition to associated gas, geologists expect discoveries of gas lenses during development.</p>

<p>Thomas James was a sea captain and explorer from England. In the years 1631 to 1632 he sailed to Northeastern North America in search of the Northwest Passage. He wintered on Charlton Island, a small island in the south of James Bay in the south of the Hudson Bay. During the same year, Captain Luke Foxe, also of England, set out to find the same passage, but traveled back before Winter. After suffering hardships in the Canadian winter, James finds that there is no northwest passage south of 66 degrees, and argues that the ice, extreme cold, and unsuitable winds make such a passage useless compared to the traditional route to asia around South America. He tells his story in The Strange and Dangerous Voyage of Captain Thomas James, printed in 1933.</p>

Robert Lawrence Bax III was born on may eigth of 1990, and had a powerful influence on the south side hyphy movement. To this present day he is no longer involment in the "scene" he was busted on september 18 of 2006&lt; A bust that will forever go down as "operation albertsons"&gt; where Bax began to spin out of control into a criminal rage. All the followers of Mac Dre and Anyone Getting Hyphy in the bay will always remeber this day as " Bax Day".</p>

<p>Stacey McClean (born on February 17, 1989 in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackpool.html" title="Blackpool">Blackpool</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>) is a former British musician and actress, most known as a former member of <a href="../../../s/_/c/S_Club_8_9e04.html" title="S Club 8">S Club 8</a>. At the young age of 12, Stacey audition and was chosen to be part of <a href="../../../s/_/c/S_Club_7_5d3d.html" title="S Club 7">S Club 7</a>'s support act on their <i>S Club Carnival Tour</i> and was to only perform on one of their concert shows. Stacey and the rest of the group soon found out that they would be appearing as support acts for the entire tour. Which lead to becoming an actual music group and releasing their own single.</p>
<p>In 2004, Stacey and the rest of S Club 8, starred in <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>'s televison show <a href="../../../i/_/d/I_Dream_0b7e.html" title="I Dream">I Dream</a>. Unlike some of the other cast members, Stacey was shown in many scenes during episodes and was even fortunate enough to have her own storyline in one episode of I Dream, <i>Together</i>. This showed that not only could Stacey sing but has potential to be a fairly good actress.</p>
<p>Although the public hasn't heard much of Stacey since S Club 8 disbanded in 2005, Stacey is still being prised for her amazing vocals. Many even think she had the best vocals in the group, as well as being one of the better dancers. Stacey also still keeps in touch with the rest of the S Club 8 dispite being one of the two former members living the furthest from the rest of the band.</p>

Hodaka Yoshida (1926-1995), artist, was a Japanese modernist who worked first in oils and then from 1950 in the woodblock print medium. He was the youngest son of artists Hiroshi and Fujio Yoshida.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Japanese order is used for Hodaka's name: <a href="../../../y/o/s/Yoshida_Hodaka_5f7c.html" title="Yoshida Hodaka">Yoshida Hodaka</a>. The main article for this artist in Wikipedia.org is found in this form. However, in Western literature his name is often found in the Western order: Hodaka Yoshida. His signature on works is usually in Western script and in the Western order. The same is true for other members of the Yoshida family.</p>
<p>This family and their art, from its first artist onward, was Western and Japanese in their life and in their artistic style.</p>

<p>The Legend of the Moon and Stars... and what they mean to PCMB Once upon a time, not so long ago , in a mystical Park, there lived a Marching Band struggling to compete at a National level. Suddenly, their Director (Glen Adsit)noticed that the Marching Band always performed better at night. The Director began telling the Marching Band ,”Look for the moon&#160;;reach for the stars.” The Director contacted one of the talented parents (Annette Smigell) a few days before their next National’s Competition ,and asked the parent to create a “banner” that the Marching Band could “reach for”inside the dome(since they wouldn’t be able to see the real thing).the parent, using a black king-size bed sheet, added a sparkling moon and stars to create the banner. The parent completed the task in time to inspire the Marching Band.That year (1990) was the first year that the Marching Band won Nationals. The banner is closely guarded by another parent and is hung every year (only at States and Nationals, when the Marching Band can’t see the real thing), and helps inspire the marching Band to always “reach for the moon and the stars”.</p>

<p>What is Regulation? Regulation simply is the Governments involvement in different markets and in the tax system. If all markets were ‘free markets’ (working on the basis of supply and demand), some people would be considered to be disadvantaged. Therefore the Government intervenes to ensure there is a reasonable level of equality between all those within the country. The Government regulates and intervenes in a range of markets and systems including: • The Labour Market • The Financial Market, and • Australian Tax System</p>
<p>All these area have benefited with a certain level of regulation and has allowed a reasonable amount of equality. This ‘equality’ concept is evident within the “Revenue Law: Cases and Materials” text book, this book states that “Political power is used to override economic power in order to distribute the products of society in a way which is considered ‘fair’ or ‘just’, according to the value system which is used in making the decisions.” This tells us that with a certain level of regulation a ‘fairness’ between all people is created.</p>

<p>Deregulation This occurs when governments slowly remove their level of control on the different markets and the tax system. As their level of intervention lessens the markets become more dependant on themselves to remain sufficiently equitable for all within the country.</p>
<p><br />
Labour Market</p>
<p>Centralised and Decentralised Wage Systems Essentially the difference between a centralised and decentralised wage system is the level of government control. Centralised: Within a centralised wage system the government and its industrial tribune (The Australian Industrial Relation Commission) determines award wages and working conditions for the employee. With this system employees doing the same jobs will receive the same wages. There is no variation to wages to anyone doing the same job. A centralised wage system has the following advantages: • Lessens disputes over wages between employer and employee, • Reduces unemployment by • Lower levels of inflation • Allows fairer distribution of income and profits between shareholders and employees.</p>
<p>Decentralised: In a decentralised wage system an employees wages and working conditions are determined through direct negotiations between the employer and employee. This process involves minimum government intervention. The current “Work Choices” economic reforms rely heavily on a decentralised system with anything but basic standards (eg. long service leave, annual leave) and is at the core of John Howard’s economic reforms.</p>
<p>The potential danger within a decentralised wage system is inequality between employees. Employee conditions of work is solely determined by their level of negotioation skills. For example two men doing exactly the same job for the same period of time may have different condition as one may have had previous experience in setteling agrements. It is also imortant to consider the relvant strengths of the parties to the negotiationms. A large enterprise negotiating with an individual, without Union support (illegal under “Work Choices”), is in a very strong bargaining postion from the start.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Moving Towards a Decentralised Wage System with each Successive Accord From 1983 to the present a number of Accords (an agreement between trade unions, the government, and employers to restrict wage demands, inflation and price rises respectively) have been passed which have affected the Australian worker and the wage system which they work under.</p>
<p>Stage 1 • Accord Mark I (1983) this Accord noted that wage rises were directly linked to increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). • Accord Mark II (1985) focused on superannuation and that wage rises were discounted by 2% of the CPI of the time. • Accord Mark III (1987) a two tier system was developed a flat rate and second rate which was to be negotiated with the employer based on productivity. Negotiations for family allowance supplement began. • Accord Mark IV (1988) award reforms, awards were reviewed and any wage increases were linked to efficiency and productivity. • Accord Mark V (1989) built flexibility into awards and protected weaker groups by raising low rates of pay and also included tax cuts and welfare benefits for improvements in work practices.</p>
<p><br />
Stage 2 • Accord Mark VI (1990) beginning of enterprise bargaining (negotiations between employer and employee on pay and work conditions at the level of the individual firm) and the move to a more decentralised wage system and also reforms in training and education system.</p>
<p>Stage 3 • Accord Mark VII (1993) enterprise agreements were used to determine wage increases. Employer and union agreements had to be accepted by the AIRC.</p>
<p>With each successive Accord the Australian wage system has become more and more decentralised. This shift has enable enterprise bargaining between employer and employee to take place.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Workplace Relations Act 1996 In 1996 the Howard Government introduced the Workplace Relations Act erasing the Industrial Relations Act established by the Labour Government in 1988. The Workplace Relations Act entailed a number of new ideas some which included:</p>
<p>• The introduction of Australian Workplace Agreements (AWA’s) • The wider use of enterprise bargaining agreements • Restrictions on union activity, and • Making it illegal to force employees to join the union (which was often used as a precondition to employment), With the passing of this act unions have had a smaller impact on employee awards and the move towards enterprise bargining agreements for all people through AWA’s has increased.</p>
<p>Benefits of Deregulating Labour Market Deregulating the labour market and filtering the level of government intervention has a number of benefits to the economy and employer: • Wages can be determined by supply and demand leading to proper allocation of labour resources in different industries. • Wage rates reflect the capacity of each industry and their ablity to pay and gain a resonable return. • Any increases in wage must be linked to productivity. • Inflation is reduced which reduces costs in the industry allowing exporting and importing industries to become more competitive in the international market, and • Allows market to find appropirate level of minimum wage.</p>
<p>The most recent step in the move towards deregulation is Howards “Workchoice’s” legislation which was passed in 2005. Within this legislation Howard claims a number of benefits are available to employee.</p>
<p>Employees are protected under “Workchoices” by: • The Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard • The terms of their workplace agreement • Their awards And gain the benefits of: • Meal break entitlements • Public holiday entitlements, and • Extended parental leave entitlements Financial Markets</p>
<p>Financial Deregulation: When did it Occur?</p>
<p>Sir Keith Campbell established a committee in 1979 to examine the Australian financial system, and to recommend certain changes. It was the first such inquiry since the 1936 and covered a range of issues. His suggestions helped Australian economics. These changes were necessary in the increasingly complex nature of the financial system. This committee was named “Campbell’s committee of inquiry.”</p>
<p>Financial deregulation began in the early 1980’s under a Labor Government of Bob Hawke as Prime Minster and Paul Keating as Treasurer. This partnership used the ideas brought up by Campbell to help Australian economics.</p>
<p>Its main objective was to move away from regulating a range of financial activities to allow greater freedom to banks to respond to global competitive market signals.</p>
<p>Changes that occurred with Financial Deregulation</p>
<p>Since Federation Australia was a country that relied heavily on protectionist policies (tariffs, government regulations etc) as the basis for its economic and social development. This policy, while often questioned, was shown to be no longer effective in the more global environment of the eighties. As Bob Hawke states in his memoirs “Australia lay closed at its borders, the arteries of its financial life suffering from a sclerosis of regulation……..The world was kicking at Australia’s door; to stand there with our hands pressed against it was folly.”</p>
<p>Australia needed to change economically as to compete with the new global markets. One of the major changes that occurred during the financial deregulation was the floating of the Australian dollar in 1983. Before this Australia had a fixed exchange rate (fixed currency.) Floating the Australian dollar ment the movements in the dollar changed and reflected the strengths of trade at the time. There were those who were wary of losing total control of the Australian dollar. When these concerns were put to Bob Hawke he famously addresed them by saying “When you float the dollar, you float the bloody dollar!”</p>
<p>Other important reforms that were finacally deregualted in the 1980’s include: • Deregulation of the stock market and incorporation of broking firms • Entry of foreign banks, and • Removal of controls on the interest rates banks could pay and charge, on the terms for which they could lend</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Wallis Inquiry and Report</p>
<p>In May 1996 one of the first acts of the Liberal party’s Treasurer Peter Costello was to establish an enquiry to review the Australian financial system (latter known as the Wallis inquiry.) This inquiry led to some changes within the financial system these changes were implemented in April 1997 in the Wallis report.</p>
<p>The areas that were addressed in the Wallis report fell into three categories: the establishment of new regulators, mergers and acquisitions and dealing with electronic security.</p>
<p>New Regulators A number of new government commissions were suggested by the Wallis inquiry to allow the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to focus on monetary policy and dealing with the banks. The new regulatory commissions established were the: • Australian Prudential Regulation Commission (APRC) – dealing with superannuation, insurance and prudential regulation (reducing the possibility of risk) • Corporations and Financial Services Commission (CFSC) - responsible for protection of the consumer, and • Payments System Board (PSB) - focusing on systems of payment.</p>
<p>Merging and Acquisition The Wallis report stated that there should be certain limits in relation to the levels of ownership of financial institutions. Its states that a shareholder should not be able to own more then 15% of banking or insurance company./ This would have the effect of allowing a wide spread of ownership. This limitation would ensure that one person could not have too large a say in the running of a financial institution.</p>
<p>Electronic Security As technology is becoming more advanced new potential for security breaches could occur during financial transactions. One of the suggestions put forward by the report was to recommend the acceptance of digital signatures. These digital signatures would allow major institutions to verify authenticity in messages sent electronically.</p>
<p>Benefits of Financial Deregulation</p>
<p>As the financial market has been deregulated two major benefits have become evident:</p>
<p>• The levels of competition have increased. As foreign banks are now allowed into Australia as well as the introduction of specialist providers more competition is found in the banking sector. This increase in competition has forced the lowering of interest rates from 1990 to today. This can be seen in the graph below taken from Reserve Bank of Australia Bulletin (2003), 'Banking fees in Australia'.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>• Growth of Economy. After deregulating the financial market the growth in the Australian economy was large. This included 13 consecutive quarters of growth above 4 per cent “the longest run of such growth recorded in the history of the quarterly National Accounts.”</p>
<p>This growth in the economy can be related to improvements in productivity and income growth, which are byproducts of the financial reforms.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Government in the Economy</p>
<p>Functions of a Tax System Although the main aim of taxation is to provide revenue to fund government expenditure. There are also some important socio-economic purposes for taxation some which include are: • The provision of merit and public goods – As private companies conclude these goods to be non-profitable. The government steps in to provide them with this goods i.e. education. The government pays for these goods via the money gained through taxation. • The need for the government to support those for whom a free market would not provide for – For example the poor would not be able to pay the market price for many necessities such as food. The government therefore steps in and provides people with cash grants who cannot pay for basic goods and services. These grants come from the collection of tax. • Correction of free market imperfections – Within a free market imperfection may occur such as a monopoly power or wasteful competition. However accelerating the rate of economic growth or maximizing economic stability through varying levels of taxation may help thwart these market imperfections allowing consumers better choice of products at reasonable prices.</p>
<p><br />
Current Problems with our Tax System</p>
<p>Australia’s current tax system can be considered to have one major problem, its complexity. Within our system the public pay tax over all three levels of government for a variety of reasons both directly and indirectly. The major taxes collected over the different tiers of the government are:</p>
<p>Local Government - Rates</p>
<p>State Government - Land Tax - Stamp Duty - Payroll Tax - Motor vehicle registration</p>
<p>Federal Government - Income Tax - Customs Duty - Passport fees, and - Goods and Services Tax (GST)</p>
<p>This three tiered government taxes system is considered too complex and may lead to confusion to the general public.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Tax Reform In 1999 under Howard’s Liberal Government, legislation was passed which was intended to simply the Australian tax system. A cornerstone of this legislation was the GST. This was a tax aimed at taxing most goods and services. (an example of an indirect tax). Howard claimed when the GST was introduced, the Australian Tax system would become simpler. He claimed that the state governments would remove their Stamp Duty and Payroll Taxes (both direct taxes) and allow GST to take its place. The Federal Government would ensure that, net of administration costs, the full amount of GST collected would be provided to the States. However the State Governments did not remove all their direct taxes. This meant that when the GST was introduced the ideal goal of Parliament was not achieved. In a real sense, the tax system became even more complex, adding to the confusion of the tax payer.</p>
<p>Social Problem with Tax Systems in General Using tax to help maintain government policy and to help gain revenue also has some problems that relate to the social engineering side. There are three major problems in tax that affect social engineering:</p>
<p>1. The general categorisation – Tax rule is created under general terms and applies to broad groups of people who are all treated the same way. However the tax system is not well suited to deal with unique individuals i.e. an individual employee. This inadequacy to deal with uniqueness may lead unfair levels of taxation for different people. 2. Unpredictability of taxes effectiveness – As tax is an indirect instrument it is often difficult to determine how effective a tax will be at achieving its goals. If it cannot achieve its goal it is simply draining money away from the consumer and weakens the economy. 3. Side Effects of Tax - Tax is also said to create some unintentional side effects. For example high levels of income tax may lower the incentive to work as the money gained from working would be lost through tax. It is also suggested that excessive amounts of tax may impact on the amount of babies being born. As parents hold off on children until they have more money.</p>
<p><br />
Changes in Recent Years to Tax System Most post-war Governments have made an attempt to “reform” their tax system. The main reform in Australian tax of recent was the GST legislation as mentioned above. As I believe I have covered GST effectively I will move on. In 1985 Bob Hawke and Paul Keating introduced the Capital Gains Tax (CGT) this tax was aimed at taxing the capital gain made on the disposal of any asset (e.g. the selling of a rental property), except those with specific exempt status. This tax stoped people avioding tax through a specific loophole.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Benefits of Changes in Tax System</p>
<p>GST as a tax has a number of benefits. As it is an indirect tax through the purchasing of goods and services it creates a horizontal equity (everyone is treated the same) e.g. if two people buy an apple each for $1 they both pay the same amount of tax on it and it is not dependant on the different monetary or social factors of the payer. Economically speaking GST is also a benefit to the government. If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rises the cost of goods rise as well, this in turn gives the governments more revenue through the increased prices.</p>
<p>CGT as a tax system change also created some benefits. The main benefit gained was that people could no longer avoid paying tax by changing their income stream into capital. As the disposal of capital was not taxed up to this point. This system allowed a more fair system of taxation with fewer loopholes for people to avoid paying tax. This gave a social equity among the tax payers.</p>

<p>202.56.224.122 05:50, 21 September 2006 (UTC) GOLDEN HANDSHAKE: A BOON OR A BANE</p>
<p>Reshma Shrivastava Lecturer MBA Department Disha Institute of Management And Technology,Raipur Email: prasadreshma@yahoo.com .</p>
<p><br />
This is not a new management buzz but it is a term associated with a valuable commodity Gold so how golden is Golden Handshake we need to understand that and also its intricacies. We can Define Golden handshake is a large payment made by a company to a senior executive upon termination of employment before his/her contract ends It is also associated with the term "Downsize" meaning - reduce the manpower. Now a days every company is chanting only one 'mantra' - reform - restructure – downsize “ Don't recruit fresh employees in cases of retirement, throw the casual or contract workers our of job and even if that is not sufficient - lure the employees to leave the job give them some extra money in their hands – This is Golden Handshake!</p>
<p>We can also define golden handshake as a clause in an executive employment contract that provides the executive with a significant severance package in the case that the executive loses their job through firing, restructuring or even scheduled retirement. This can be in the form of cash , equity and other benefits, and is often accompanied by an accelerated vesting of stock options.</p>
<p>Typically, "golden handshakes" are offered only to high-ranking executives by major corporations and may entail a value measured in millions of dollars. Golden handshakes are given to encounter the risk inherent in taking the new job, since high-ranking executives have a high likelihood of being fired and since a company requiring an outsider to come in at such a high level may be in a precarious financial position. This business term dates from the mid-1900s and is closely associated to golden parachute- a generous severance agreement for an executive in the event of sudden dismissal owing to a merger or similar circumstance. In the changed scenario of globalisation, cost cutting by public sector undertakings and Government departments has become the order of the day. The first victims of the economy measures are the employees, who are being made to pay with their jobs.</p>
<p>Be it any sector Railways, banks, textile industry, Aluminium plants, Steel Plants, you name any industry - Thousands of employees are going out of employment everyday. If we ask the companies one question - who is going to buy the products, if everybody is thrown out of jobs a vast majority become burden of an employed few? We know nobody will answer it. The facts prove that there are no buyers even after unbelievable gifts are offered with some products. Go through newspaper ads on any day the industry itself is getting a handshake - not so golden. Let us see what happens to the employees who receives "Golden Hand Shake" .</p>
<p>1.Those employees either starts his own venture 2.The money gets spend on their children’s education 3.The money also gets spend on their daughter’s marriage 4. Some money or amount is used for saving 5.Most of the time it is found that the money results into expenditure affairs</p>
<p>There are very few people who gets another opportunity in other comparable jobs. Now the question is why will any company recruit such non trained employees and spend money on training them so . Now if we see various issues how many people can get success in their own venture if they get started with business very few so result is loss. Only exception is perhaps if you start the business at very small level where you think there is less investment and income is guaranteed like having a general Store or you turn out to be vendors. Otherwise you are totally bankrupt. The result is trauma all around. Spending days in utter frustration jobless seen as a spent force an outcast an object of pity. Those who kept some money in savings schemes discovered in 4/5 years time that the good amount of interest earned in yesteryears is nothing today due to inflation. If things go by the same rate what will be left over is only horror. There is no government at the centre worth the name. Is there anybody to review it to retrace the steps? Most unlikely. So "downsizing" will continue. Market will further shrink. Industry will face a fresh bout of crisis. The employees will still feel deprived . They would find themselves in a helpless position and their future appears bleak. Most of the times they cannot even decide what to do with the few lakhs of rupees they get in by way of compensation package. Many of them end up burning their fingers by starting business ventures without proper planning . There are several instances of employees, who had taken VRS, being harassed by their kith and kin and family members for money, Some VRS people have utilized the money to discharge their duty by their family. However, many of them who have been used to a busy life do not find it easy to sit back and relax at home. There is also a chance of some of them going into depression due to constant nagging by their `near and dear' ones that they are sitting idle at a time when they should have been working. So Golden Handshake can never be a golden opportunity. www.answers.com/topic/golden-handshake www.investorwords.com/2200/golden_handshake–202.56.224.122 05:50, 21 September 2006 (UTC) Reshma Shrivastava</p>

<p>During 1750, Bengal was faced with invasions from Bargis from Maharashtra. These bargis will loot the people and destroy the crops. This was done to weaken the enemy morals before raising full fledged attacks by the kings who will support the groups of Bargis. Bargies were essentially different armed force units than regular soldiers and will raise occassional attacks in the enemy territory to creat havocs.</p>

<p>One large canon made of 63 hoops of wrought iron cylinders welded together and with a length of twelve and a half feet, still bears testimony to the military prowess of the Malla kings. One legend says that this canon named Dal-Madal or Dal-Mardan was fired by the family deity of the Malla kings, Madan Mohan, to repulse the Maratha invaders or Bargis.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of a group of artists being commissioned to make clay images is perhaps in the Maharastha Purana a Bengali poem by Gangarama about the effects of the invasions of the Maratha Bargis in the 18th century. Between 1740 and 1750 Bengal was faced with invasions from these Bargis from Maharashtra who caused widespread damage in the Nadia district and parts of Murshidabad in western Bengal. In the poem there is a confrontation between the forces of Nawab Alivardi Khan and those of the Marathas under its general Bhaskara. Bhaskara decides to perform Durga puja to ensure victory and he summons all the zemindars to tell them of his intentions.</p>

<p>202.56.224.122 09:39, 21 September 2006 (UTC) What is a Smart Card? What is a smart card? The term Smart Card is loosely used to describe any card with a capability to relate information to a particular application such as magnetic stripe, optical, memory, and microprocessor cards. It is more precise, however to refer to memory and microprocessor cards as smart cards. · A magnetic stripe card has a strip of magnetic tape material attached to its surface. This is the standard technology used for bank cards. · Optical cards are bank card-size, plastic cards that use some form of laser to write and read the card. · Memory cards can store a variety of data, including financial, personal, and specialized information; but cannot process information. · Smart cards with a microprocessor look like standard plastic cards, but are equipped with an embedded Integrated Circuit (IC) chip. Microprocessor cards can store information, carry out local processing on the data stored, and perform complex calculations. These cards take the form of either "contact" cards which require a card reader or "contact less" cards which use radio frequency signals to operate. Key Features and Characteristics Shown below are some of the key features and characteristics of smart cards.</p>
<p><br />
Cost Typical costs range from $2.00 to $10.00. Per card cost increases with chips providing higher capacity and more complex capabilities; per card cost decreases as higher volume of cards are ordered.</p>
<p>Reliability Vendors guarantee 10,000 read/write cycles. Cards claiming to meet International Standards Organization (ISO) specifications must achieve set test results covering drop, flexing, abrasion, concentrated load, temperature, humidity, static electricity, chemical attack, ultra-violet, X-ray, and magnetic field tests.</p>
<p>Error Correction Current Chip Operating Systems (COS) perform their own error checking. The terminal operating system must check the two-byte status codes returned by the COS (as defined by both and the proprietary commands) after the command issued by the terminal to the card. The terminal then takes any necessary corrective action.</p>
<p>Storage Capacity EEPROM: 8K - 128K bit. (Note that in smart card terminology, 1K means one thousand bits, not one thousand 8-bit characters. One thousand bits will normally store 128 characters, the rough equivalent of one sentence of text. However, with modern data compression techniques, the amount of data stored on the smart card can be significantly expanded beyond this base data translation.)</p>
<p>Ease of Use Smart cards are user-friendly for easy interface with the intended application; handled like the familiar magnetic stripe bankcard.</p>
<p>Susceptibility Susceptible to chip damage from physical abuse, but more difficult to disrupt or damage than the magnetic stripe card.</p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>Smart cards are highly secure. Information stored on the chip is difficult to duplicate or disrupt, unlike the outside storage used on magnetic stripe cards that can be easily copied. Chip microprocessor and Co-processor supports DES, 3-DES, RSA or ECC standards for encryption, authentication, and digital signature for non-repudiation.</p>

<p>it is often surprising what ingredients with e nos etc. are made of both good and bad and although it is not so often prime time discussion as it was a few years ago (some of the bits in pringles (di-sodium ribo-nucleotides, produced largely from sardine and found in stacks of stuff) and insect bits in skittles (shellac, produced by indian lac insects for a special shine!) in skittles really i still like to check all the labels that arent straight forward without first eating the product as you please but the interesting thing is that searching turns out the end result of these products use (especially on mice and rats if you read google!) or its chemical formula (just try additives on wikipedia) but the original basic thing that additive was called and made of is often hard to find. i eat lots of food but search that ingredient and it might say "ox tail is usually a cows bumpiece". if you do not list at least one source your article will be rejected. <a href="http://www.google.com" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com</a> and search for "shellac" and go to the shops to check the skittles ingredients. or search for "di-sodium ribonucleotides" which sounds like a chinese vitamin and turns out to be salt of sardine(miniature fishes)and is found in a stack of products including pringles.</p>

<p>Christian Konrad Sprengel (* 22. September 1750, Brandenburg an der Havel, Germany; † 7. April 1816, Berlin, Germany) was a german theologist, teacher and, most important, a naturalist. He discovered <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexuality.html" title="Sexuality">sexuality</a> in the plant kingdom.</p>
<p>Sprengel studied <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a> in <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halle.html" title="Halle">Halle</a>, Germany. In 1774 he became teacher in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>. Since about 1787, Sprengel did considerable research on the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pollination.html" title="Pollination">pollination</a> of plants and the interaction between flowers and their insect visitors. With his work "Das entdeckte Geheimnis der Natur im Bau und in der Befruchtung der Blumen" (Berlin 1793), he was one of the founders of pollination ecology as a scientific discipline. Together with one of his predecessors, Köhlreuter, he is still the most classic author in this field.</p>
<p>During his lifetime, his work was neglected, not only becuse it seemed to a lot of his contemporaries as obscene that flowers had something to do with sexual functions, but also because the immanent importance of his findings on the aspects of of <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selection.html" title="Selection">selection</a> and <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> was not recognised. Until Charles Darwins book "On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing." (London 1862), floral ecology was not considered a 'proper science'.</p>
<p>Important successors like Paul Knuth, Fritz Knoll and Hans Kugler were inspired by Sprengel and brought great advance to the field of pollination ecology. After the second World War, their work was continued by and Stefan Vogel, Knut Faegri, Leendert van der Pijl, Amos Dafni, <a href="../../../g/2E/_/G._Ledyard_Stebbins_5e45.html" title="G. Ledyard Stebbins">G. Ledyard Stebbins</a> as well as Herbert and Irene <a href="../../../b/a/k/Baker.html" title="Baker">Baker</a>.</p>
<p>The ideas and terms inherited out of Sprengel's fundamental work last forth.</p>
<p>Sprengel is buried at the Invalidenfriedhof in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, Germany. A small monument designed after the frontispice of his fundamental work can be seen in Berlin Botanical Gardens.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-24_6f3c.html" title="Edit section: The Intrepid Fox Pub">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Intrepid Fox Pub</span></h2>
<p>Britain’s first foreign secretary, Charles James Fox, founded the Intrepid Fox pub in 1784. It is said that he promised to give a free beer to anyone who offered him electoral support.</p>
<p>The Intrepid Fox is a pub that is popular with locals and tourists visiting the capital and is given a mention in tourist guidebooks as a place to visit. During most recent years it has been seen as one of the few remaining havens for fans of the metal, goth and rock culture of London and is said to have played an important part in rock history over the years.</p>
<p>Despite it being one of London’s oldest pubs, it is facing closure after the owning brewery Mitchells &amp; Butlers recently sold the property to developers, who wish to turn it into a series of trendy flats. According to manager Patrick Begent, who has been running the establishment for 15 years, he was given just three weeks in order to vacate the place. He says, "Its devastating. The Fox is an integral part of the alternative music scene in London and one of the few remaining."</p>
<p>The Intrepid Fox is just one in a whole group of 21 pubs across the city that Mitchells &amp; Butlers sold last month for a total of £53 million. The vast majority of the 21 pubs have been bought by individual property investors, although only two of the 21 sites are expected to be turned over to alternative use. The sale, which was revealed exclusively by the Morning Advertiser, means the company has already raised £88m in total in the year to date through individual pub sales - more than the £70m the company promised earlier in the year. A Mitchells &amp; Butlers spokeswoman said: "The Intrepid Fox has been sold as part of a package to investment companies and pub operators. The 21 pubs were all prime locations but quite small, with average weekly sales of £7,000. The rest of our pubs have average weekly sales of £16,000." Mitchells &amp; Butlers chief executive Tim Clarke said the sale value indicated property investors were valuing cash generative and asset-backed pub investments in a new way. He said: "There is a new breed of property investor coming in and buying pubs.” Mitchells &amp; Butlers have also stated that discussions relating to the sale of 101 smaller, wet-led pubs are in progress. The news on disposal activity came as Mitchells &amp; Butlers revealed that it was to launch a bond issue to increase securitised debt by £655 to £2.46m. The average value of pubs subject to a securitisation is now £2.8m, 40% higher than in 2003. A revaluation of the company's estate has put the total value of the company's property at over £5.5bn. In a bid to retain the pub, Robin Canon, a regular for the past two years, has launched a campaign. He wrote a petition and managed to inspire 5,000 people to sign their signatures in just nine days. "This pub has character and it makes you feel welcome, whatever your appearance," says Canon. "Its closure will mean sanitisation of the city's pub scene and loss of cultural diversity, which is important to London's development. The Intrepid Fox has been a central point for the London alternative scene for years. It's well loved and if it goes the currently small community will defiantly be badly affected - there's not that many other places for us to go - and certainly nowhere like the Fox. " But the "spirit of the Fox will live on", said Mr Begent, who plans to relocate the pub to another venue elsewhere. "We'll ensure the Fox survives the hunt."</p>

<p>Jennifer Convertibles, Inc. (AMEX: JEN) operates and licenses a chain of specialty furniture stores in 19 states plus the District of Columbia. It addition to being the largest specialty retailer of sofabeds in the country, it is also Americas largest leather specialist.</p>
<p>Jennifer Convertibles, Inc., was incorporated in 1986 and began operations with a single retail store in Paramus, NJ. It currently operates almost 200 stores coast to coast.</p>
<p>Their marketing strategy is to highlight the multi-functionality of a sofabed, which acts as a sofa for seating comfort in the daytime and converting into a bed, for overnight guests. As America’s largest sofabed specialist they are able to offer all this to the consumer for unbelievable value. A great example of this is their Microfiber sofabed with an innerspring mattress for only $299. To expand their livingroom offerings they recently began selling motion furniture, which include dual reclining sofas and reclining chairs, all at similar promotional prices.</p>

<p>Ranks</p>
<p>There are many ranks in the Aaron Empire ranging from Emperor (Aaron Hall) to Head of The Navy a.k.a. Grand Admeral (Aaron Schroeder) to science advisors. All of which, maybe not suprisingly have jobs that are nothing like what the title sounds like.</p>

<p>The Clean Air Conservancy (CAC) is a not-for-profit environmental organization based in the United States that was founded in 1992 as INHALE (National Healthy Air License Exchange) by Cleveland lawyer David B. Webster. The organization’s stated goal is to promote market-based approaches to the problems of air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. The CAC uses donor funds to purchase and then retire tradable emission allowances and reduction credits, and has developed the legal instruments allowing US companies to make tax-deductible contributions of emission allowances and certified reductions to the CAC. Shortly after its founding, the CAC was recognized by Outside magazine as a “Mighty Might” - one of the ten “best” small environmental non-profit organizations. By participating in the first annual air pollution allowance auction in the United States (March 1992), the CAC began buying and permanently retiring a portion of the Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) emission allowances sold by the Chicago Board of Trade on behalf of the US EPA Acid Rain program. The EPA Acid Rain Program was world’s first mandatory “Cap-and -Trade” pollution allowance program and it allowed the CAC to pioneer the concept of “retiring” tradable allowances as a tool for reducing harmful air pollution.</p>
<p>The CAC supported air pollution education and published a curriculum in 2003 called Clean Air Activities: Exercises for a Cleaner Tomorrow through Humanics Learning. The organization also built a national network of schools regularly buying allowances to offset each participating school’s “SO2 footprint”. The CAC also established a pilot program of community-based monitoring and reporting of ground-level ozone using a network of trained volunteers with hand-held detectors. This pilot program was later duplicated in other US cities, including Atlanta, Buffalo, Dayton, Houston, Los Angeles and Minneapolis.</p>
<p>In 2001, the CAC collaborated with the Olympic Organizing Committee (OOC) on the first major “event greening” by assisting the OOC to calculate the environmental impact of the Salt Lake City Winter Olympic Games. The CAC then worked with several large U.S. corporations to donate and retire enough Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrous Oxide (NOx), and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emission reduction credits to completely offset, or “Net Zero”, the air pollution and greenhouse gas generated by the event.</p>
<p>In 2006, Clean Air Conservancy initiated an expanded “NETZERO” program to put emerging Carbon trading platforms within reach of individuals, civic groups, and schools. It also began selling CO2 equivalent Emission Reduction Credits through its website and enables individuals buy and retire credits to voluntarily offset the CO2 emissions of their private automobiles, air travel and small boats.</p>
<p>The CAC is also a participating member of the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) and began buying and retiring Carbon Financial Instruments (CFI). Each of the CFIs represents 100 Metric Tons of third-party certified CO2 equivalent emission reduction credits sold in the United States. The CAC has also established an “e-store” on eBay to sell emissions reduction credits and allowances for Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Nitrous Oxides (NOx), and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) to individuals for retirement.</p>

<p>A school bus stop sign is a mechanical device used for safety when a stopped school bus is loading or unloading children. The first school buses to have them had a single sign with a warning message, usually "stop." Lights were later added to the stop sign, early signs had each light blinking once each time, but many now have lights that blink twice at a time instead. Also, older buses usually have a single sign. Many newer buses have a second sign toward the rear, as well as the front. The most recent improvement was making it so the word "stop," written on the sign blinked instead of separate lights. Also, on the rear sign, the message was usually removed from the front, but remained on the back, which couldn't be seen unless the sign swung out. Even the newer signs with blinking warnings have the writing removed on the front of the rear sign.</p>

When it was available, it came bundled with a bonus live DVD with unreleased footage and a live performance. Due to its short existance, this album is very rare and is owned by few people. The songs are in abundance on file-sharing networks, however.</p>

<p>Enchanteddrmzceo 22:21, 21 September 2006 (UTC) •About Enchanted DreamZ... • Enchanted DreamZ is a Car &amp; Bike Club founded on December 2000 in Miami, Florida by a boy who was 17 years old at the time, Dimitris "The Dream Boy" Labatos. We are a club that accepts Lowriders, Imports, Lowrider Bikes, &amp; even Classics. We also accept stock cars and give our members time to hook up their ride. ENCHANTED DREAMZ travels to different local cities depending on the chapter presidents, to compete and show-off our lowrider bikes &amp; our cars. Our club colors are Blue &amp; White as we show them off through shirts, hats, banners, ETC. We are always looking for members &amp; chapters, so if your intrested in any information just check out our contact page. At this time, Enchanted DreamZ has 4 chapters (Miami, FL; Ft. Lauderdale, FL; New Iberia, LA; &amp; Orlando, FL ) &amp; has 17 members.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>•The Story on how it all Started... • In the early months of 2000, Dimitris was looking around for a car club to join. Dimitris had the idea to customize his 1994 Nissan Sentra. He came about a childhood friend (Ralph) in October 2000 and both attempted to start a club called "Wicked Ryders". After a couple of weeks, the club was abandoned and Dimitris went on the road to search for a club to join. When searching, he saw that many clubs didn’t let anyone join the club unless their car was in showroom condition and the member had to go to a meeting every week. So, Dimitris didn’t like the idea of that and wanted to start his own club that would let people join the club with their ride stock and would give them time to customize it.</p>
<p>On December 19, 2000, Dimitris was thinking of a name for the club when he was listening to Power96© (radio station in Miami) and heard a commercial from Santa’s Enchanted Forest©. He liked the word, Enchanted, so he thought about which word would sound good together with Enchanted. He tried the word, Dreams but with a "Z" instead of the "S". That same day, Dimitris asked several friends including Cynthia Cuevas of Naples, FL., what they thought of the name.</p>
<p>Four days later on December 23, 2000, Dimitris "The Dream Boy" Labatos and Yoniel Boza got the process started &amp; officially establish the club becoming the first members of the club &amp; registering with the National Lowrider Club Registry.</p>

<p>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Checkmate is a brand new novel that is set to be released November 7, 2006, it is the third novel in the Splinter Cell Series and although unknown, this could be a sequel to the previous novel Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Operation Barracuda. The writer, Raymond Benson(under the pseudonym David Michaels) although said to be the final novel written by Benson, something must have changed his mind and no information seems to be available at the moment at his website.</p>

<p>LOLA RODRIGUEZ (born October 10, 1952 in New York, NY) is an American writer, poet, and musical theatre composer.</p>
<p>The author and spoken-word performer has written on various topics, including culture, performance, the arts, and poetry, appearing in journals, books, and anthologies both in the United States and abroad.</p>
<p>Lola Rodriguez was chosen by Los Angeles’ Latin Beat Magazine as one of the most important women in the arts today. Her work is collected in the books, The Coffeehouse Poetry Anthology, Poets and Painters, New to North America, and Tokens: Contemporary Poetry of the Subway.</p>
<p>She is published in journals including The Columbia Review, Barrow Street, Calyx, American Mensa Wordfun, Flyway, Women’s Poetry Journal, The Caribbean Writer, Peau Sensible, US 1 (Princeton), Angle Magazine: A Journal of Arts and Culture, Excursis, Lungfull!, Afro-Hispanic Review, Forum, Tamarind, Down Under Manhattan Bridge, Chachalaca Poetry Review, English Journal, The Paterson Literary Review, A Gathering of the Tribes and numerous others. Rodriguez is the author of Notes from a Solitary Rhumba, The Ancestry of Hunger, and the forthcoming book, Lions in Manhattan.</p>
<p>The writer is listed in the International Who’s Who in Poetry and was nominated for The Pushcart Prize, considered to be the most honored literary series in America. She participates in Poets and Writers Readings/Workshops Programs, is an Allen Ginsberg Poetry Award and Hipster Haiku finalist. Rodriguez is a distinguished scholar and recipient of numerous professional and academic awards and grants including the Lila Acheson Wallace Reader’s Digest Foundation Grant, the Award of Merit for Significant Academic and Creative Achievement, the James Beardslee Grant and others. Originally from New York City, Rodriguez has traveled throughout North America, living on both coasts, Canada, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. She was named Lola after a seashell collector who wrote the national anthem of Puerto Rico and began reading at age three using Voltaire’s Candide as a primer, writing her first poem by age five, and winning first prize at age 10 in an all school citywide competition for her essay: Fire: Friend or Foe?</p>
<p>Solo performances in theatres, clubs, and coffeehouses feature a multimedia performer who incorporates music, drama, and dance into dramatic readings. Lola Rodriguez, resides at the intersection between the concerto and the mambo.</p>
<p>Rodriguez has appeared as a spoken word artist in one-woman shows and collaborations in venues worldwide, including The Whitney Museum of American Art, London’s Institute for Contemporary Art, St. Mark’s Poetry Project, La Mama Theatre/ La Galleria, The Nuyorican Poets Café, Life Café’s The Literary Life series with George Plimpton, Taylor Mead, and others, Mercer Gallery, Exit Art, Tribes Gallery, Telephone Bar, University of the Streets/Liquid Sound Lounge, Teachers and Writers Collective, The Knitting Factory, The Gershwin, Biblio’s Bookstore, Barnes and Noble (NYC), Hispanic Pride Festival, Cleveland Public Theatre (OH), Café No Bar, The Red Room/Reckless in Hell’s Kitchen, Kenkelaba House Gallery and La Casa Maya (Merida, Yucatan, Mexico). In addition to her stage performances, she is a musical theatre composer and librettist who has written over 100 songs.</p>
<p>Lola Rodriguez says, about her poem Manhatt/Antilles:</p>
<p>This poem is about voluntary repatriation, but most importantly, self-patriation, a return to the country of the self. For the New York Puerto Rican, there’s one special wave where the mainland and island meet in the divided soul.</p>
<p>Picture this secret place, far out to sea, located somewhere between where Lady Liberty drowned herself, the Bermuda Triangle, and a glorious Spanglish speaking Atlantis. Manhattan. Antilles. ManhatAntillas.</p>
<p><br />
MANHATTANTILLES/MANHATANTILLAS</p>
<p>Manhatantillana que soy that I am, Whose expatriate, exiled sounds Shout from my lips In gasps of half-heard freedoms made word, Escupo mudo, Mute spit.</p>
<p>Whose voice is extinguished Behind the deaf bars of my teeth, A voice that sings to the people, Without reply.</p>
<p>My feet without ground, Like air-less wings These songs have No place to belong. They stretch between Two islands like the hangman’s rope Assassinating my soul With the authenticity of death, A clothesline with souls flapping Above the invisible place Between,where the Caribbean Sea And the Atlantic Ocean meet.</p>
<p>An ocean within That swallows my words, That silences my voice With a wave, a tongue, Then another. Manhatantillas, Can be found at the top of a wave, Since there is no shore where oceans meet. Voices sinking to the bottom, Rising to the top, Where the mouth of the sky Will form syllables for the wind.</p>
<p>The night, too, will form lips. Mixing its disowned and desired sounds Into creole beauty noise Blending shouts With longing.</p>
<p>El oceano que traga mi voz Con una ola, una lengua Y otra. El oceano que corta la lengua en tiras, El oceano que hace trizas de la alma.</p>
<p>The ocean that swallows my voice With one wave, a tongue, Then another. The ocean that slices my tongue, Manhatantillana que soy. The ocean that shreds my soul.</p>
<p><br />
In addition to her work as a performing artist, the writer is also known for her prose and text-bound poetry, exemplified in the following poem beginning with a quotation from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s This Side of Paradise.</p>
<p><br />
PRINCETON FOUNTAIN</p>
<p><br />
…Well this side of Paradise!... There’s little comfort in the wise. --Rupert Brooke.</p>
<p><br />
If I miss the last train, will the drunken boat still hold me? The distant carillon of Cleveland Tower peppers the air with bells. I am looking to return to earlier chaos with new equations. “Is late Picasso, bad Picasso?” is not a question asked on the other side of the wall.</p>
<p>In Prospect Gardens, I study multiple reflections of my face In the fountain, beneath the watery centaur spring. The ripples, jets, and depths do not disguise Conflicting golden eyes, A double lens, With tomes and goblets in the left, tenements in the right.</p>
<p>My third eye, developing A shutter opening against a double image of typology and contradiction, Uniting in a singularity of perfect vision, Gentility and rage, Infinity and limitation Semester of myself.</p>
<p>Does the flaccid bee drifting between the loose pine blades In the water of the Sculpture Fountain, Curl into death because the water is green And there is late summer musk in the air? On a submerged penny, the wavy, still lingering eye Winks because its fortune is not in season, The perfect sound of water slowly cutting the display of stone That the years have altered, giving motion as a gift to light, The sun diving to find the bottom of the pool.</p>
<p>And, on the surface, the wasp has come to drink, Yet, many are still searching for some source to quench their thirst. Leaves, and beetles and Aeschylus are fragments of the years hanging, Watery chatelaines on the garment of time. Fashionable semester.</p>
<p>On moving day, rental trucks burst with essentials, Caravans of comfort to what is already verdant, Could soon become desert (the wasp has come to drink). What oasis necessary to form the future’s mass?</p>
<p>The stage manager choreographs The tattered couches into position. On the manicured green, Just beneath the castle windows of shadowing towers, Watchful medieval rabbits, feral deer In a tapestry of hopeful scholars. It is the semester of the first act.</p>
<p>I stray from the season of my path, the blossom-fluted garden Not yet amber, evergreen and flat top canopy, Silence trumpeting the elephant leaves, I have No name for flowers which bring me closer to the moment That releases me, Infant who would be cultivator or keeper of the spirit’s peace.</p>
<p>Minutes pass at the perimeter of moss, of granite, Where falling water is thought traveling Between personal histories and the stories of civilizations, Where the Self confronts millennia, Dilutes fortune to build substance, constructs possibilities; These are the gardens of epics I will build, (There) I will meet you at the edge of this fountain where I loved myself, Where history is polite, but not suspended. Semester of my soul.</p>

<p>Swiss-American Surrealist artist, born Basel 1900, died Sugar Loaf, New York, USA, 1962.</p>
<p>Seligmann came to Paris in 1929 determined to pursue a career as an artist after several unsatisfying years working in his father's furniture store in Basel, Switzerland. In Paris, he met other Swiss, such as the painter-architect Le Corbusier (with whom he travled to Greece), the sculptor Alberto Giacometti (with whom he had studied in Geneva), the artist Jean Hans Arp, and the art historian Pierre Courthion. Through them he became acquinted with the group called Abstraction Art Non Figuratif, whose ranks he joined with works that showed a tendency toward biomorphism but with a menacing character. From these he grandually evolved a style that was increasingly baroque with imagery derived from Medieval pagentry, the Basel Carnival he had known since childhood and the Dance Macabre of such Germanic artists of the Reformation as Urs Graf and Manuel Deutsch. His mature work combined these influences with a particular violent expressiveness depicting slender figures adorned with all the paraphernalia of the heraldic knight errant: plumes of feathers, armor, swashbuckling drapery and capes, often adapted to stories of Greek mythology.</p>
<p>Seligmann married the former Arlette Paraf, a grandaughter of the founder of the Wildenstein Gallery, in 1935. In 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, he was the first Surrealist to settle in New York. He died of an accidental gunshot wound at his farm in Sugar Loaf, New York, on the morning of January 2, 1962.</p>

<p>Some know this website as "Lol the internet" thats where it began, it only changed its name to interflop recently in spring of 2005. I was only a member on lol the internet for a short time under the identity of "fatty mchamburger" a name my friend thought up.</p>
<p>Some concider lol the internet to be one of the greatest websites in the world. Some despised it, main reason was because of its anti-semetic and crude humor. But I see it as a failed attempt to show the world a better more jew-hating internet. Interflop died recently at the end of the summer in 2006 but it lives on in every hitler loving nazi today.</p>

<p><b>Jasper Morello</b> is a fictional character, and central protagonist, from the 2005 Australian animated feature film, <b>The Mysterious Geographic Explorations of Jasper Morello</b>.</p>

<p>According to the official website, of the Mysterious Geograhic Explorations of Jasper Morello, Jasper Morello's official ranks and positions, within the ABoC, include "Navigator, 3rd Royal Cartographers", and "Difference Engine Operator 2nd Class". Prior to his appearnace, within the film, Morello became married to Amelia, the sole surviving daughter of Admiral Fortinbras, and a Gothian nurse. At one point, during his career as a navigator, Morello had been installed upon the Airship, Resolution, under the command of Captain Otto Griswald. During one of the airship's journeys, through the Lawrencian Quarter, the Resolution was required to successfully navigate the nearby Weather Station 2C41; Jasper, however, made an accidental, one degree error, resulting in a collision with the complex, and the death of a crewmember (having being thrown overboard, from the force of the Resolution's impact). Subsequently, Morello was temporarily suspended from his duties, until, three months later, the ABoC chose to reprieve him, and re-assign him to the Resolution. Following the airship's initial departure from Gothia, the crew was assigned to deploy weather becons, en route to Lawrencia. During this time, Jasper became well acquianted with the Resolution's guest passenger, Doctor Claude Belgon (a scientist, assigned to to the ship, in order to discover whether certain altitudes of oxygen provided a cure, for the epidemical Magnetic Plague), and assisted him with a number of experiments. Following a heavy storm, the Resolution collided with the derlict fishing ship, the Hieronymous, and during the crews escape, from the doomed airship, Jasper lost his compass (and therefore, his means of navigation). After the discovery, that the Heironymous' deceased crew were fishing on an uncharted island, Doctor Belgon insisted that the crew investigate the fishermen's cause of death; later that evening, however, Jasper discovered that Amelia had become infected, with the Magnetic Plague. In a state of extreme desporation, Jasper attempted to turn the Hieronymous around, only to be held in place by the crew, and sedated by Doctor Belgon. Later, having regained his senses, Jasper successfully navigated the airship through a field of rocks, towards the uncharted island. After landing on the island, Jasper was attracted into a nearby forest, by a strange, siren-like bird call; upon finding the seeming-bird, emmitting the sound, Jasper approached it, only to have the creature transform, into a strange, arachnid monster. Jasper is nearly consumed by the beast, when it drags him towards itself with its branch-like tendrils, but is saved when his fellow crewman, Kovacs, kills the creature with a rifle. That night, the creatre's remains are cooked by the crew, and Jasper makes a broth out of the animal's blood, which he feeds to an ailing LeBrun (the ship's cook, having been infected, by the Plague). The following morning, when the crew discovers that the monster's blood has cured LeBrun, Doctor Belgon proposes the obtaining, of a number of the creatures' coccoons, to return to Gothia with; Jasper assists the crew's attempts, to obtain these coccoons. Sometime later, during the Hieronymous' return journey to Gothia, Jasper discovers Claude, feeding a now partly-metamorphised coccoon, with his own blood. Later, Doctor Belgon invites Morello back to the creature's room, where the animal is now hatching. Shocked by the larvae's size, Morello insists that the Doctor throw the monster overboard, and proceeds to inform Captain Griswald. Belgon, however, protests, believing that the crew will kill the creature; Jasper subsequently chooses to keep the monster's development a secret, in fear that the crew will destroy the animal (and, therefore, eliminate the possibility of Amelia being cured). Several days later, Kovacs catches a delicate "Porkfish", causing the crew to subsequently celebrate, that evening. Interestingly, Jasper notices that Claude had chosen to join the occasion, in an unusually cheerful manner, despite Morello never having seen him consumed alcohol, previously. The following morning, after Kovacs' disappearance becomes apparent, and Captain Griswald concludes the linesman had fallen overboard, Jasper begins to suspect Claude's involvement in his seeming death. Two days later, after LeBrun becomes absent, Morello enters the creature's room, only to discover the monster consuming the chef. During his temporary horror, Jasper is sedated by Belgon, who chains him to the Hieronymous' helm. Upon regaining consciousness, Morello learns that the Doctor has sedated the remaining crewmwmbers (who are now awaiting inevitable consumption, by the creature), and that Belgon intends for him to navigate the airship, the final stretch of the return journey. After steering the ship, into an arctic region, Jasper realizes that the Doctor, having become insane, will most likely kill, prior to the Hieronymous reaching Gothia, and to prevent this, Morello rams the airship, into a nearby iceberg. The impact knocks Belgon overboard, and, after regaining his grip, on the side of the helm's ralings, and begging for a chained Morello to help him, is crushed to death, on the side of the frozen obstacle. After unchaining himself, Jasper freezes the interior of the creature's room, causing the animal to go into hybernation, and, knowing that he must retain the animal, in order to preserve Amelia's cure, begins to transfer his blood, into the monster. Morello recites that, although he may not survive, before the airship reaches home, he will be with the "Great company of souls, riding the borealis to eternity". "Perhaps," he lastly recites, "They will require a navigator".</p>

<p>The original Eddie mask was created by an art student called David Brown. He used to live next door to Dave (Lights) Beasley back when Iron Maiden was just about to break through. There a few references to that time on an old german website (now defunkt) and several others including the BBC. David Brown made the original masks at his college (East Ham College of Technology) and several to Dave Beasley and one was used in the Ruskin concert in August 1979. This was the initial inspiration for Eddy. The masks very very fragile and life size and by October they were using a bigger, flatter face which looks a bit like a "Grey" alien. The original mask was taken from a plaster cast of another student in the class -ironically, the best looking guy in the class.</p>

Records of the game being played date back to the mid-1910's. Half-Rubber has been played for several generations in the south, and had a large regional popularity in the 1970's. Recently, however, interest in the game has waned.</p>

<p>At any time there will be a pitcher, a catcher, and a batter. The goal for the batter is to hit the pitched ball at least a bat's length in front of himself. When he does this, he has one man on base. He does not run to a base as in <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a>, but as in <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a>, when he gets four bases loaded, the fourth base forces home a run.The batter continues to try to hit pitched balls until he swings at a pitch and misses the ball and the catcher sucessfully catches the ball. When that happens, the catcher becomes the batter, the hitter becomes the pitcher, and the pitcher becomes the catcher. In this scenario for the game, each of the three individuals is playing against the others and the score is kept for all three. In team play, two teams usually comprised of one pitcher and one catcher per team play a similarly comprised team. Each team has two "at bats". Again a batter is out when he swings at a pitched ball that is successfully caught by the catcher.</p>
<p>The advantage to the team competition is that the pitcher and catcher are usually well matched. In individual play too often a good pitcher is frustrated by a poor catcher and the batter scores because the catcher cannot catch not because of the skill of the batter.</p>
<p>A good game ensues when pitchers can develop the correct combination of speed on the ball, accuracy over the "strike" (even though there are no strikes), and manipulation of the up and down flight of the sailing ball making it difficult for the batter to hit but still making a pitch in such fashion as to be hittable.</p>

<p>The game as well as the players themselves are called Jugger(s).</p>
<p>The main goal of the game is to place the Jugg (the ball which traditionally has the shape of a dog's skull) into the opponents' goal. Since only one player of each of the two teams is allowed to take the Jugg with his hands, he must be guarded by his teammates, who are armed with padded weapons.</p>

<p>The idea of the sport came from the movie <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blood_of_Heroes_e2ee.html" title="The Blood of Heroes">The Blood of Heroes</a> (<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> with <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutger_Hauer_6bde.html" title="Rutger Hauer">Rutger Hauer</a>), in which nomadic teams wander from town to town and fight for money. While the fights in the movie are very violent (wounds and fractures in almost every game), the sport is rather harmless.</p>
<p>It is uncertain where the sport was originally "invented". Teams in Germany play it since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, but there are also teams in the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>.</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>The <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a> rules are different from the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> ones, so only the basics are listed here.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The field is a huge rectangle with cut corners (so there are 8 corners in total). There is one goal on each of the short sides of the field (a small base in which the Jugg can be placed).</p>
<p>The teams consist of 5 to 8 players: One runner (Quick or Qwik) who is the only person allowed to grab the Jugg and 4 fighting players, of which at most one may have a chain. The other 3 players are armed with sticks of different sizes. There may also be up to 3 substitute players.</p>
<p>Time was traditionally measured by throwing stones against a gong, but it is also possible to hit a drum. One stone (hit) is approximately 1.5 to 2 seconds and a game can consist of 2 or 3 parts, which last 100 stones each.</p>
<p>When the game starts, the teams run towards each other and start fighting to make the way free for their runner. When somebody is hit by a weapon (strikes against the head or the groin are forbidden and the wepaons must be sufficiently padded), the player must kneel down on the ground and wait a fixed time until he can stand back up and rejoin the play. The two runners may wrestle with each other, but may not beat or kick.</p>
<p>When the Jugg is placed onto the goal of a team, the other team gets a point and the game starts over. The team which has the most points at the end of the 200 or 300 stones, wins the game.</p>

<p>A banda joinvillense de Pagan/Heavy Metal Shadowings teve seu início em outubro de 2004, formada por Bruce Baiochi (vocal) e Alessandro "Caverna" Takassaki (guitarra) após terem deixado sua antiga banda Metatron No início o Shadowings era apenas um projeto, mas com a entrada de Alex Baiochi (teclados), Dian Carlo (bateria) e Pedro Allender (baixo), passa a ser banda em fevereiro de 2005, pouco tempo depois o segundo guitarrista Alex Ritter complementa a banda. Ao mesmo tempo que Pedro Allender deixa a banda por motivos pessoais. Depois de muita procura por um baixista, em fevereiro de 2006, Bruno Rollin se junta ao Shadowings. Com algumas composições antigas prontas o Shadowings entra em estúdio em dezembro de 2004 e inicia a produção do que viria a ser seu 1o trabalho, a Demo "Battle Songs and Steel Tales", as gravações terminaram em março de 2005. Sua música consiste em um Pagan/Heavy Metal primando pela melodia e naturalidade, com passagens épicas e clássicas, buscando a criação de um som original. Suas letras revivem batalhas épicas, idade média, a luta pela liberdade dos povos, da cultura pagã e a honra dos ancestrais.</p>

The rapidly expanding game of Vennis Ball was invented on 2nd March 2006, by Richard Lukeman, in Altrincham, near Manchester. Vennis Ball is a revolutionary development on the game of tennis. The first games of Vennis Ball was contested in the weeks following it's invention, by Richard Lukeman, Ben Winstanley, Robbie Greggory, and Daniel Conlon. The game of immediately viewed as a success, and has since expanded across the universities of Britain, and is on course to be accepted as an Olympic sport by 2020.</p>
<p>The rules of Vennis Ball are stated below: 1) Two players are on each team 2) Play takes place on a doubles tennis court 3) Tennis equipment must be used 4) The ball may bounce no more than once on the side of a team before the ball is hit by a team member 5) Once a team member has hit the ball, it can no longer bounce on their side, until hit by a member of the opposing team 6) The ball may be hit, on the volley, between members of the same team, on their own side, providing that the ball is hit alternately, from one team member to another 7) For a shot to be "in", both the first and the second bounce of the ball must be within the boundaries of the doubles court 8) Teams serve from the service line into the opposing, diagonal box. The ball must bounce before the opposing team hits the ball 9) Serving is alternate between teams, in the order of Player 1 (team 1); Player 3 (team 2); Player 2 (team 1); Player 4 (team 2). The ball is served from the right (team 1); right (team 2); left (team 1); left (team 2) 10) Sets are scored first to 11 points, and matches are first to 3 sets</p>
<p>Ammendments were added to the rules soon after the invention, and these are below:</p>
<p>1) Serves must be under-arm 2) To win a set, a team must win by 2 clear points 3) The ball may be hit four times, on the volley, on each side, before the ball is played over the net (the ball may only be hit twice by each team member on a given part of the ralley) 4) Jousting (leaning over the net, and hitting the ball past the net) is legal, as long as the ball is hit upwards</p>

<p>Mobile Defense is a term used to describe a military manouver of repulsing an attack by the use of well planned attacks by the defender which can out manouver the attacker.</p>
<p>The first modern example of mobile defense was during WWII during the third battle of Kharkov. German Commander von Manstein used the II SS Panzer Korps to launch an attack to the rear of the Russian spearhead force encircling it. This success lead to the stabilization of the German Army Group South. Manstein became a proponent of the use of a strategy of Mobile Defense on the Eastern Front as a whole. Manstein came to the conclution that Germany could not defeat Russia in a traditional Static Defensive system used in WWI and that the only chance to achieve a Draw was to wear down the Russian army in costly mobile battles.</p>
<p>Manstein formulated a plan for the summer of 1943 where he argued all mechanized forces should be deployed south of Kharkov and await the Russian summer offensive which was believed to be aimed at capturing the Donetz Basin. The mechanized force would launch an offensive south to the sea of Azov once the Basin had been captured by the Russians. Hitler ultimately rejected this and went with a more conventional, double envelopment attack on Kursk.</p>
<p>The concept was further used in Korea when the Chinese volunteer force was halted through the use of mobile defense leading to a stablilized situation that led to the cease fire.</p>

<p>Local Resort Manager Goes Abroad</p>
<p>February, 2006</p>
<p>Mr. Kenrick Theus, General Manager of The Placencia Hotel and Residences, left Placencia Village on January 22, 2006 for seven days of intense training in Guatemala City.</p>
<p>His training was sponsored by the well known group, Rainforest Alliance, based in New York City, and Programme for Belize. His training will center on the areas of nature conservancy, best practices in the Hospitality Industry and the implementation of cost cutting measures in Hotels of varying sizes. Mr. Theus heads the “Green Team” at the Placencia Hotel, a tight knit group of Junior Managers and Supervisors at the Hotel.</p>
<p>Some or the “Green Team” goals are to achieve reduced operational cost through innovative techniques and management styles, better control over natural resources and utilities at all levels and overall best practices in all aspects of the Hotel’s day to day operations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this training and its main goal will be to increase competitiveness and market access of sustainable tourism. Participation in this internationally accredited certification system will leave Mr. Theus with the distinction of being a Trained Hotel Auditor in Belize for Best Practices.</p>
<p>Mr. Theus would then be able to partnership with groups such as the Belize Hotel Association, Programme for Belize, Belize Tourism Industry Association and others to inspect hotels all over Belize whose management might wish to participate in the on-going Environmental Walk Through Programme (E.W.T.)</p>
<p>The Environmental Walk Through Programme allows for qualified Auditors to visit various Hotels and to make recommendations regarding conservation, best practices, sustainable tourism and overall improvements</p>

<p>Placencia - from sleepy fishing village to tourism mecca</p>
<p><br />
Friday, 02 December 2005</p>
<p>By Ann-Marie Williams - News Editor</p>
<p>What started out as a sleepy fishing village in the 1890s has literally transformed itself into a bustling tourist hide-away, part of Belize’s best kept secret.</p>
<p>What started out as a sleepy fishing village in the 1890s has literally transformed itself into a bustling tourist hide-away, part of Belize’s best kept secret.</p>
<p>The 23-mile long Placencia Peninsula known for its virgin mangroves and natural sandy beach stretch is located on the Caribbean Coast of Southern Belize in the Stann-Creek District.</p>
<p>While chunks of the peninsula remain undeveloped, the destination is literally on a construction journey.</p>
<p>New resorts dot the skyline frequently while additions improve the hotel and restaurant stock of southern Belize.</p>
<p>One new improvement of only two years in the area, is the Placencia Hotel, formerly Zeboz Caribbean Resort.</p>
<p>The spectacular destination, rated as the best in the country by Floyd Enriquez, Registrar of Hotels at the Belize Tourist Board, sits on a 9.5 acre plot of land.</p>
<p>The impressive structure consists of 44 rooms total, 20 seafronts and seaviews over looking a well manicured lawn.</p>
<p>General Manager, Kenrick Theus, says at present the 3-bedroom apartments are each sold at about U.S.$470,000 however rooms are always available as the hotel manages the property. An excellent time-sharing venture which in the end makes both owner and management happy.</p>
<p>The 80 staff members which include 12 ground keepers ensure the needs of each and every guest is taken care of.</p>
<p>The Placencia Hotel boasts a 280,000 gallon swimming pool, the largest in the country along with a 10,000 bottle wine cellar. Two attractions Enriquez was the first to admit add to the uniqueness of the property.</p>
<p>A lovely blue and white wedding chapel awaits for tourists and or locals who wish to tie the knot in an enchanting tropical setting. Three couples have since said their I dos’.</p>
<p>A thatched-roof pier bar where one can wild away the hours stretches into the aquamarine waters of the Caribbean Sea.</p>
<p>The ambience, view, food and the hospitality bring the guests back all the time; at a place where Belizeans can get up to 30% discount on their stay.</p>
<p>According to Theus, phase 2 &amp; 3 of the hotel will see the completion of six apartments with 12 rooms in March of the new year. The new year will also usher in a huge construction boom as the Placencia Hotel has bought over 100 acres of land across the road. To date it has cleared 49 acres and construction is underway. While on a walking tour of the property both Andrew Torrey, Marketing Executive and Theus sold Reporter the idea of the Placencia Hotel and Residences of the future.</p>
<p>“We will construct what we call documiniums, houses with boat docks where you can drive your boat right up to your private homes. We will put in a marina with a gas station, a casino, several boutiques, a conference room, a massage parlour, real estate office, beauty salon, gym and service provisioning facilities will also be offered,” both men enthusiastically pointed out.</p>
<p>The changing faces of Placencia Former Tourism Minister, Henry Young who also has strong roots on the peninsula told Reporter Editor, Ann-Marie Williams, the village was founded by one of two English brothers (the Garbutts’) around the turn of the 19th century. He recalled the man also owned Punta Negra Village and Monkey River which was a little southern town back then, it has since lost its grandeur and is today a village. The two brothers owned most of the land at Point Placencia. “The Eiley’s came and in the 1920s. My grandfather, Henry Young I also came. The Leslies’ came in out of Dangriga Town along with the Formans’ and the Vernons’,” Young recalled. A village which was once known as a place where family married and mated with each other has broadened its gene pool to embrace what is today known as a rich amalgam of people who came. The Garifuna from neighbouring Honduras, the East Indians, Kriols and those with Scottish blood, from the original Garbutt brothers to the native Americans now naturalised Belizeans make for a wonderful blend of cultures. Placencia-a place that is bizarre as it is beautiful.</p>

<p>Articles on San Pedro and Belize Calgarians land in middle of Temptation Island by: Calgary Herald</p>
<p><br />
Travel Calgary Herald Front Page, Feb. 23, 2001 Calgarians land in middle of Temptation Island Reality TV show becomes a real-life affair for the Scott family of Calgary</p>
<p>The Sundiver Beach Resort, operated by Calgary's Scott family, was home to the crew from Temptation Island.</p>
<p>When Jay Scott and his family said good-bye to city life in Calgary and hello to the beaches of Belize, they were seeking serenity.</p>
<p>What hit them was a storm of activity -- actually two.</p>
<p>There was Hurricane Keith -- the first hurricane to hit Belize in 30 years.</p>
<p>But the other was perhaps even more unexpected -- the crew for the reality television show Temptation Island blew into town.</p>
<p>Now even if you haven't actually watched a complete episode of Temptation Island, you've probably tuned in for a surreptitious peek just to see what all the hype is about.</p>
<p>It's the latest trend in titillating television: Fox Network's reality TV show that sets up four purportedly committed couples for "the big fall."</p>
<p>The show, currently airing across North America, gets its name from its contrived efforts to tempt said couples -- coincidently all young, slim and attractive -- into compromising situations with 26 equally buff and beautiful singles.</p>
<p>Fantasy? For most of us perhaps, but not for the Scott family of Calgary.</p>
<p>It all started when Jay Scott, a long-time fixture in the Calgary oilpatch, his wife Kathryn, daughters Arianna and Tazmara, and son-in-law Ross Gowans, decided it was time for a change in lifestyle.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that none of them had any experience in the hospitality industry, the family purchased an upscale Caribbean resort on the island of Ambergris Caye, Belize.</p>
<p>After only a month to learn the business, the Sundiver Beach Resort was hit by these two events, giving the family an unexpected crash course in the ups and downs of life in paradise.</p>
<p>The family's property was selected by the company producing Temptation Island to house 42 of the 120 production crew for the month of September 2000. The Sundiver was the perfect choice for several reasons. It's located halfway between the resort where the male halves of the couples were housed and the hotel where the women stayed. With 12 rooms and suites as well as five villas and a house, the Sundiver not only had the space, but the staff and amenities to accommodate the show's art department, camera crews and senior production executives.</p>
<p>With Jay commuting between England and Russia in his job with an overseas Canadian petroleum company and Arianna attending university in Kelowna, the responsibilities of hosting the group fell to Kathryn, Tazmara and Ross.</p>
<p>So did the Sundiver gang manage to catch any dirt on the show?</p>
<p>"The crew would share the daily news on who'd been voted off the island and told stories of the pranks they played on one another," Tazmara said, "but no matter how hard we tried, they wouldn't give us the juicy details we wanted." Word was the crews were forbidden to speak to the cast, even when spoken to, and were similarly disallowed from divulging anything that might give away the show's outcome.</p>
<p>Tazmara was, however, able to view the filming of the bonfire scenes, and remarked that both the males and the females seemed genuinely worried about the future of their relationships. She also met two of the designated "tempters," or single cast members.</p>
<p>"They told me they did it for the free vacation," said Tazmara, "but I think all of the cast discovered it's not much fun having a camera in your face 24/7."</p>
<p>As for the final word on what relationships endured and what couples split, Tazmara said, "The last night of shooting was closed to everyone so your guess is as good as mine."</p>
<p>Everyone with the show worked hard, but Kathryn pointed out there was a bit of down time for the crew.</p>
<p>"The odd day when they wrapped up early, they'd kick back and enjoy themselves," she said. "They're a very talented group and a couple of nights they held impromptu concerts in our dining room. One evening we found them doing some wild dance steps."</p>
<p>On another occasion it was the chef's day off, so a cameraman volunteered to cook, treating his colleagues and the Sundiver staff to a fabulous seafood jambalaya.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tazmara, whose official title is marketing reservations manager, gained some insights in how to take an already picture-perfect tropical paradise and redesign it for TV.</p>
<p>"I spent a couple of days shuttling the art department through the shops of San Pedro to purchase bamboo furniture and hundreds of potted plants," she said. "Then the photography and lighting directors put in countless hours making the locations look like Close Encounters of the Third Kind. We were amazed with the amount of work that went into preparing sets."</p>
<p>The crew's jobs were made even more difficult by the fact the only modes of transportation on the north part of the island are boats or golf carts -- no cars are permitted.</p>
<p>The days were long for the show's crew, but they were even longer for Sundiver personnel. Kathryn, ostensibly the managing director, took on the additional roles of handy person, accountant, breakfast cook and waitress.</p>
<p>"By 5 a.m. I was cooking eggs and trying to make the perfect cup of coffee for 42," she said. "Since I'm no cook, it was fortunate they wanted hot and filling, not gourmet. It took me several mornings to get the coffee strong enough to get two thumbs up."</p>
<p>That's not to say the guests went without fine food. Sundiver's chef, Kenrick Theus, has established the resort's reputation for some of the best fare on the island. By the second week of filming, word of his lobster quesadillas had spread to crews staying at other locations.</p>
<p>Ross, who served as food and beverage manager, boat pilot, bartender and grocery shopper, was often up until 3 a.m. ensuring everyone was fed.</p>
<p>On Sept. 28, after the cast left the island, the Sundiver group attended the crew's wrap-up party, which ultimately moved to the resort. The following morning, Kathryn showed up to cook one last batch of eggs. Tazmara and Ross ferried boatloads of guests to town to catch flights, but they encountered high winds and bad seas. A storm was brewing, but our intrepid Calgarians were assured it wouldn't affect their area.</p>
<p>Later that day, when all planes were grounded and residents were advised to stay put, it was clear the tropical storm had turned ugly. Out of one tempest and into another, Sundiver braced for Hurricane Keith.</p>
<p>"We still had 33 of the Temptation Island crew with us, and along with our staff and guests arriving from other badly damaged resorts, we scrambled to accommodate 45 to 50 people," Kathryn said. "The crew, not being the sort to sit around and watch, pitched in to pull the boats out of the water and board the windows."</p>
<p>"Hurricane Keith hit us straight on and didn't back down for three days," Tazmara said. With winds up to 241 km/h, power was cut off and water poured into the buildings. "Fortunately we had a generator, but only seven gallons of diesel which translates roughly to seven hours of power.</p>
<p>"Oddly enough, while most of the phones on the island went out, we had one phone line that had never worked before the hurricane, but started to work during the storm."</p>
<p>Kenrick worked tirelessly to feed the unexpected guests three meals a day, while Ross kept a constant vigil over the generator to keep the refrigerators and freezers cold and the phone working. "On Oct. 3 we awoke to one of the most beautiful sunrises I've ever seen," Tazmara said. "Then the cleanup began." The following day, the last of the Temptation Island crew left with tears and promises to return -- but not on the job and not during hurricane season.</p>
<p>After two months, the Sundiver Beach Resort was fully refurbished. It was finally time to get down to what the family hoped to do all along -- run an idyllic, destination resort.</p>
<p>Kathryn sums up the experience with good humour: "Where do we go from here? We move into 2001, confident that we can handle anything this business can throw at us."</p>
<p>If You Go The Sundiver Beach Resort -- located 7.5 kilometres north of the town of San Pedro on the island of Ambergris Caye, Belize -- is located on the beach overlooking the Caribbean Sea and the world's second-largest barrier reef.

<p>Supervielle, Jules (zhül süpervyel'), 1884–1960, French author, b. Uruguay. His life was divided between Montevideo, where he was born, and Paris, where he was educated. The freshness and originality of his works are often attributed to his South American background. His stories treat grand subjects with everyday simplicity, making much use of fantasy, allegory, and myth. Among his works are the novels L'Homme de la pampa (1923) and Le Survivant (1928); volumes of short stories including L'Enfant de la haute mer (1931) and Le Petit Bos (1942); plays such as Bolivar (1936); and volumes of poetry including Poèmes de la France malheureuse (1941).</p>
<p>One year before his death he was voted "Prince des poétes", meaning Prince of poets by a large number of French fellow poets in an event organized by the literary supplement of the well known French newspaper, Le Figaro.</p>

The freshness and originality of his works are often attributed to his South American background. His stories treat grand subjects with everyday simplicity, making much use of fantasy, allegory, and myth. Among his works are the novels L'Hom</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-24_6f3c.html" title="Edit section: Arthur Papadimitriou">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Arthur Papadimitriou</span></h2>
<p>Arthur Papadimitriou received the highest French award, Chevalier De Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, on the 20th April of 2006 by Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, Minister of Culture and Communication, for his contribution to French and Australian culture.</p>
<p>In 1994 Arthur Papadimitriou took his first professional job as a primary school teacher at Papunya, in remote NT. Arthur’s interest in indigenous art was stirred as he befriended some of the artists in the town, and as he learned more about the symbols, stories and meanings of the paintings, he began collecting artworks. These days, Arthur’s collection of Aboriginal art from the Central and Western desert regions is large, and his desire to share it has culminated in this exhibition, as well as a number of donations.</p>
<p>Arthur’s passion for Aboriginal art is matched by his generosity: he has donated seven works to Benalla Art Gallery over the past few years. These magnificent paintings form the core of Benalla’s burgeoning collection of indigenous art, much of which is also on display as part of ‘Connecting Collections’.</p>
<p>Benalla Art Gallery has acquired a number of major works by indigenous artists through donation and purchase. Through their fundraising efforts, the Friends of the Benalla Art Gallery have contributed four works by Aboriginal artists, including a magnificent Wandjina figure on bark and significant paintings by Emily Kngwarreye and Gloria Petyarre. Further donations have been made by private individuals, whose contributions cover a wide variety of Aboriginal art, and hence extend the capacity of Benalla Art Gallery to tell the story of Australia’s visual culture.</p>
<p>Also represented in the exhibition ‘Connecting Collections’ is the artwork donated by Arthur Papadimitriou to the Musée du Quai Branly, France’s new museum and study centre devoted to indigenous cultures of the world, scheduled to open its doors for the first time later this year. This is the first and last time the work will be publicly displayed in Australia before it is sent overseas, to become a significant component in the Musée’s display on Australian Aboriginal culture. The Cultural Counsellor from the Embassy of France in Australia, Monsieur Jean Poncet, will officially open this celebration of cultural connections.</p>
<p>On the 22nd June 2006, The Musee du Quai was officially open by Jacques Chirac and attending by figures such as Kofi Annan. Arthur Papadimitriou was an invited guest at the opening ceremonies, along with a delegation from the Benalla Art Gallery, with which Arthur Papadimitriou is a life member.</p>
<p>The Wilin Centre for Indigenous Arts and Cultural Development at the Victorian College of the Arts has an annual award titled “The Papadimitriou Inspirational Award” for students at the college.</p>

<p>Matt Kaeberlein is a professor in the <a href="http://www.pathology.washington.edu/" class="external text" title="http://www.pathology.washington.edu/" rel="nofollow">Pathology department</a> at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu" class="external text" title="http://www.washington.edu" rel="nofollow">University of Washington</a>. He has coauthored numerous scientific articles on aging and <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caloric_restriction.html" title="Caloric restriction">caloric restriction</a>. Kaeberlein, along with Brian Kennedy, proposed the hypothesis that life span extension by caloric restriction is mediated by the <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin.html" title="Mammalian target of rapamycin">TOR kinase</a> (1).</p>
<p>Kaeberlein was a graduate student in the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/biology/guarente/" class="external text" title="http://web.mit.edu/biology/guarente/" rel="nofollow">laboratory of Lenny Guarente</a> and the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/" class="external text" title="http://web.mit.edu/" rel="nofollow">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>. Part of his thesis research was the discovery that <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir2.html" title="Sir2">Sir2</a> regulates aging (2-3). Ironically, Kaeberlein has since been a vocal skeptic of the model that caloric restriction slows aging by activating Sir2 (4-5).</p>
<p>After graduate school, but prior to taking his current academic position, Kaeberlein co-founded a biotechnology company called <a href="http://www.longenity.com" class="external text" title="http://www.longenity.com" rel="nofollow">Longenity</a>.</p>
<p>A biography of Kaeberlein was published on <a href="http://sageke.sciencemag.org" class="external text" title="http://sageke.sciencemag.org" rel="nofollow">SAGE KE</a>in 2002 (6).</p>

<p><b>Chip<i>"z32fanatic"</i> Ferguson</b> (born <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_17.html" title="April 17">April 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>) is an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> professional <a href="../../../p/o/k/Poker.html" title="Poker">poker</a> player from <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Albany%2C_Ohio_53f0.html" title="New Albany, Ohio">New Albany, Ohio</a></p>
<p>Ferguson has played online poker for 4 years and is one of the most well respected No-Limit Texas Holdem Sit and Go (abbreviated "SNG") players in the world. By utilizing applied statistics and probability functions, he has become one of the most feared players on the online poker site Partypoker.com.</p>
<p>He is also a contributor to the poker forum 2+2, located at <a href="http://www.twoplustwo.com" class="external free" title="http://www.twoplustwo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.twoplustwo.com</a>. There, he posts under the pseudonym "z32fanatic," named for his childhood dream car the Nissan 300zx.</p>
<p>Chip has also coached many beginning poker players, teaching them the keys to success at SNGs.</p>
<p>While a freshman at Northwestern University, he first learned the game with his roommate, another well respected SNG player. They spent many hours studying the game, first playing NL cash games, followed by Pot Limit Omaha cash games, before switching to SNGs in September of 2005.</p>
<p>Chip has played under many aliases on Party Poker. Most recently he played under Rosekto. Currently he plays under the name z32fanatic6. Usually he will play $215 and $530 SNG tournaments, up to 12 at a time. In addition to playing a high number of tables simultaneously, he also logs many hours. In June he played over 2200 SNGs.</p>
<p>Chip has begun to extend his prowess into the live poker field after recently turning 21. This past summer, while residing in Las Vegas, Nevada during the summer, he played the World Series of Poker Main Event as well as several other preliminary events.</p>
<p>In terms of success, it is estimated that Chip has made more money playing SNGs than anyone on Party Poker during 2006. Also, his largest Multitable Tournament cash occurred in July when he won the Friday Special on PartyPoker.com, besting over 1000 entrants for a prize of $31,750.</p>

<p>Saarang Wafai</p>
<p>Data de Nascimento: 14/03/1950</p>
<p>Nacionalidade: Libanês</p>
<p>Aparência: 1,74 metros; 70 quilos; aspecto robusto, cabelos negros encaracolados, olhos negros. Suspeita-se que tenha passado por várias cirurgias plásticas o que, somado ao fato de ser perito em disfarces, torna sua identificação visual muito difícil.</p>
<p>Histórico: Nascido em uma proeminente família sunita de Beirute, Saarang Wafai teve uma infância tranqüila. Cresceu rejeitando a tendência de seus familiares em lidar com comércio, mostrando nítida preferência pelos estudos. No exterior, fez um curso técnico de química e graduou como médico. Retornou ao Líbano em 1975, mesmo ano em que se casou com Nazanin Alghaie. Perdeu a esposa e filhos durante a invasão israelense a Beirute em 1982. Juntou-se ao Hezbollah no mesmo ano, provavelmente em busca de uma chance de vingar a morte de seus entes queridos. Perito em químicos, Saarang preparou os explosivos de muitos homens e carros-bomba. Treinado como um dos melhores comandos do Hezbollah, acredita-se que tenha sido o mentor do atentado que matou o comandante israelense Isaac Eliezer, um dos responsáveis pela invasão a Beirute em 1982. Em 1989 foi dado como morto em uma ação do Exército Israelense na qual vários integrantes do Hezbollah, então refugiados na Palestina, foram eliminados. Porém nos dois anos seguintes foi avistado no Egito, Sudão, Argélia, Marrocos, França, Espanha, Brasil, Uruguai e Argentina, Irã e Iraque. Aparentemente Saarang se juntou a Gregori Asimov e a ARIMAN pouco antes da companhia ir à Guerra dos Bálcãs, usando o nome de Mohamed Ibn Abdul-Aziz.</p>
<p>Personalidade: Saarang é um homem muito introspectivo e calado quando na presença de estranhos, embora o faça mantendo uma aparência amigável. Muçulmano praticante costuma citar partes do Corão como bordões de sabedoria, mesmo não demonstrando tendências fundamentalistas. Ele foi avistado diversas vezes socorrendo civis feridos, especialmente mulheres e crianças, bem como distribuindo alimentos e remédios em áreas devastadas nas zonas de guerra. Cultivador de plantas exóticas usa algumas delas pra extrair venenos. Um hábito curioso diagnosticado a seu respeito, é uma insistência em procurar cozinhar os próprios alimentos, talvez por temer envenenamento.</p>
<p>Ações: Há confirmação de que atuou em Serra Leoa e nos Bálcãs junto com a ARIMAN. Sabe-se que sua ligação com os muçulmanos bósnios tornou-se bastante estreita com o decorrer da guerra. Foi o responsável pela adesão e comando de muitos guerrilheiros islâmicos estrangeiros nas batalhas contra os sérvios em Sarajevo e redondezas.</p>
<p>Especialidades: A quantidade de conhecimentos de Saarang Wafai é ímpar. Além de médico e químico, ele também é perito em furtividade, invasão, manufatura de venenos, remédios e explosivos. Sua capacidade de dissimulação, somada a uma impressionante perícia em disfarces o torna potencialmente capaz de enganar quaisquer investigadores. Saarang é um dos comandantes da ARIMAN, sendo responsável pela coordenação direta das ações de campo que envolvam subterfúgio e armadilhas.</p>
<p>Periculosidade: Alta. A experiência de Saarang em ações furtivas, somado a seu conhecimento de explosivos, venenos e agentes patológicos poderia fazer dele novamente um perigoso terrorista. Sua verdadeira identidade é conhecida por poucos.</p>
<p>Informações não confirmadas: Alguns fatos provenientes de investigações anteriores apontam que Saarang pode ter traído seus companheiros do Hezbollah em troca de um salvo conduto para fora da Palestina, dinheiro e uma identidade falsa. As tentativas de obter uma confirmação oficial do governo de Israel a respeito desse fato falharam.</p>
<p>Identidades falsas detectadas: Mohamed Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Hermano Villena Jalal, Frederich Talib, Alfredo Najib Carneiro, Jean Zakariyya, Ahmed Seif al Din.</p>

<p>Táticas: Saarang prefere evitar o combate, usando suas habilidades de furtividade e invasão para esconder-se do perigo. Caso forçado a entrar em alguma luta, irá tentar se defender e ganhar tempo para atacar o adversário com uma faca envenenada no momento mais oportuno. Se o oponente for mais hábil que ele no combate corpo-a-corpo, procurará alcançar uma distância adequada para utilizar sua pistola Desert Eagle. O veneno que ele mais utiliza é o de cascavel, mas guarda doses do de beladona para o caso de adversários mais resistentes. Caso tenha tempo disponível, Saarang pode preparar armadilhas com C4 no caminho dos adversários.</p>

<p>Ballsrus is a new brand emerging from all the sports brands in the world. I was the first one to visit it and i have to establish a few things. It is a good brand but nothing really makes it stand out. The staff are generally very helpfull and polite. To conclude i would say that ballsrus is just another highstreet brand.</p>

<p>The group was founded in 1994 and has since been a very popular concert attraction not only locally, but all throughout Germany. A notable feature about the band are their multilingual song lyrics. While most of the songs, as well as all of the album titles, are <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>, many compositions also feature <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> and even <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_language.html" title="Croatian language">Croatian</a> lyrics and titles. This made touring through most of Central Europe possible. BeNuts also claim to be the first German ska band to have played in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>. Only two of eight founding members remain in the group until today, namely Daniel Mauss (drums) and Alexander Erdody (bass). Especially the position of singer and frontman experienced a lot of changes through the years. From 2003 to May 2006, this spot was filled by <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> vocalist Robert Johnson. His successor, who joined the band in September of 2006, is a student in Munich <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatorium.html" title="Conservatorium">Conservatorium</a> nicknamed El Konno.</p>

<p>Passion fm Kildare, grew from humble beginings in 2001 from a garden shed in Kidare, Ireland. The studios where small and equipment limited. The main format of the station was just dance, but as the station grew and listenship also grew the management got a feeling to what the 15 - 25 year olds in Kildare wanted to listen too.</p>
<p>The station was owned and managed by Greg Browne. (see <a href="http://DJgregbrowne.bebo.com" class="external free" title="http://DJgregbrowne.bebo.com" rel="nofollow">http://DJgregbrowne.bebo.com</a>). Greg is still working in radio, currently he lives in the UK, working for Immedia Broadcasting ltd, (see www.immediabroadcasting.com) as a radio presenter for Irish national station Impulse live.</p>
<p>Original power was 100 watts - trough 2 - sdh 100 dipoles stacked to make an erp of 220 watts.</p>
<p>In late 2001 Greg Browne joined forces with an infuencial business man who provided much needed equipment.</p>
<p>Passion fm could now afford a mountain site, and got a custom made mast erected. On the mast where 4 cte dipoles and one 4 element yagi for FM.</p>
<p>The 4 CTE dipoles where fed by a 500 watt CTE transmitter (2000 watt ERP), which blasted into Kildare and was recievable as far as Belfast Northen Ireland. The freq was originally 107.7Mhz but later changed to 91.6 to gain better penetration into Dublin city.</p>
<p>The 4 element Yagi was fed by a 250 watt CTE, and was pointed towards Dublin. This was not strong enough to cover all of the city but it could be heard on 107.7 in some parts.</p>
<p>Next to the mountain site came the processing, Passion fm purchased the orginal optimod 8000A. (see www.orban.com) This processor was simple but gave a nice warm sound. This couppled with a Berhinger edison stereo enhancer and a 30 band graffic EQ made the sound nice and warm.</p>
<p>Towards the later stages of Passion fm bought an orban cpmpander (Preprocessor). Which added to the sound quality.</p>
<p>At this stage it was 2002/3 and Passion fm was bigger than ever. It was a fully automated service playing chart, dance and RnB. The audience was huge and advertisers jumped at the chance to advertise.</p>

<p>THE PUBLIC ANIMALS (TPA), founded in 1977 by VADE, DEMO and JOEY TC, became the largest, longest-lasting spray-paint crew in graffiti history.</p>
<p>JOEY TPA is the last remaining founder. His graffiti career began in NYC at the age of 10 years and grew to the more serious level of "train-hitting" in 1976, the year of the U.S. bicentennial. He quickly started following in the footsteps of the first generation writers and became very instrumental in recruiting other writers from the Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan, and Queens regions of NYC. In 1980-1981, he hung his cans up in retirement to pursue his fortunes elsewhere.</p>
<p>Today, in the twenty-first century, JOEY TPA has re-emerged into the graffiti scene on a different level. Rather than being a practicioner, he has assembled portions of his old crew for large-scale productions on a legal basis. Events include The Meeting of Styles, and Write for Gold. It would appear that his motivation is similar to the same motivations he had in his youthful career as a fledgling writer; to bring people together, regardless of the usual divisive lines among the general public. He truly seems to be more interested in using the "language of style" (his words, not mine) to help unify urban youth on a global basis with the aid of the internet and other modern ways of communication.</p>
<p>As the corporate CEO and Founder of TPA Productions LLC, it would appear that the young graffiti writer of yesterday has succeeded in fulfilling his goal today, roughly thirty years later. JOEY TPA has assembled notable writers from Australia, New Zealand, Germany, other various countries as well as his homeland, the U.S. in an effort to expand the original message of TPA: "One World, One Love".</p>
<p>TPA has seemingly re-emerged as an upcoming powerhouse in the graffiti/commercial/fashion world under the leadership of this original writer who helped found the original (TPA) band of graffiti-writing kids in NYC. TPA has gone from urban NYC to ALL-WORLD status under him.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-24_6f3c.html" title="Edit section: Massacre at Ayyadieh">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Massacre at Ayyadieh</span></h2>
<p>The massacre of Aayaideh occured on the 20th August 1191. It was perpetrated by Richard Cour de Lion, better known as Richard the Lion Heart, during the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusades.html" title="Crusades">crusades</a> to recover the holy land from the saracens under the command of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Saladin.html" title="Saladin">Saladin</a>. It is best understood in the context of Richards attempt to take the city of Acre. The struggle for the city was unusually vicious even by Crusade standards, where little mercy was shown or asked for by soldiers on either side, and massacres were common place, particularly against the citizens of a captured city.</p>
<p>On the fall of the <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acre.html" title="Acre">Acre</a>, Richard attempted to negotiate with Saladin offering a large number of captured prisoners in exchange for the True Cross (reputedly the actual cross upon which <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> had been crucified), together with a large ransom and a number of christian captives taken by Saladins men in earlier clashes with the crusaders.</p>
<p>Saladin stalled for time in the hope that an approaching <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> army would allow him to retake control of the city. When <a href="../../../s/a/l/Saladin.html" title="Saladin">Saladin</a> refused a request from Richard to provide a list of names of important christians held by the <a href="../../../s/a/r/Saracens.html" title="Saracens">Saracens</a>, Ricard Cour de Lion took this as the delaying tactic that it probably was, and insisted that the ransom payment and prisoner exchange should occur within one month. When the deadline was not met Richard became infuriated and decided on a savage punishment of Saladin for his perceived intransigence. Richard personally oversaw and planned the massacre which took place on a small hill called Ayyadieh, a few miles from <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acre.html" title="Acre">Acre</a>. The killings were carried out in full view of the muslim army and Saladins own field headquarters. Over 3000 men, women and children, were beaten to death, axed or killed with swords and lances.</p>
<p>A Muslim force so enraged by this act attempted to charge the crusader lines but was repeatedly beaten back, allowing Richard and his army to retire in good order.</p>
<p><b>Aftermath</b></p>
<p>Any hope of regaining the True Cross dissapeared after Ayyadieh, it was rumoured that Saladin sent it to Damascus. By his orders the Christian prisoners were executed in Damascus.</p>
<p>Aayadieh is perhaps the strongest refutation of Richard as a courteous and chivalrous warrior king. On this occasion his almost "theatrical" staging of the massacre showed that he was capable of using terror tactics in an attempt to terrify his opponents into submission. This form of warfare was used by both sides and the Muslims were no exception once a besieged city had fallen to them.</p>

<p>Patrique is an American author, socialite, pop singer and fashion designer.</p>
<p>Patrique first came in to the public eye in late 2005/early 2006 as a socialite when his antics with British socialite Shane Tyas became a fixture in internet gossip blogs. On December 23, 2005 Girlstalkinsmack.com reported that Patrique and Tyas would be starring in a Fox spinoff of the E! program "The Simple Life" starring Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. Then, on January 21, 2006 FadedYouth reported that Patrique would be suing Shane Tyas for $3 million. Patrique reportedly filed the lawsuit with Paris Hilton, and gossip blogger Perez Hilton.</p>
<p>In 2006, Patrique released his first book "Beverly Hills 60643" with print on demand company Lulu. The book chronicled the lives of four teenagers in the wealthy Chicago community of Beverly. The book recieved a fair amount of public attention, the book has yet to recieve any commercial success, lurking at the bottom of the Lulu.com sales chart.</p>
<p>Also in 2006 Patrique released his own clothing line called "Strength: By Patrique" the line featured highly priced clothes for all ages.</p>
<p>Patrique is in the process of recording an album, which will be a mixture of Pop and R&amp;B. On August 31, 2006 Patrique's song "All About Me" was leaked to the internet, the self affirming song is about Patrique and his material possesions.</p>

<p>It was mentioned by someone else on the squatting page, but i deleted it. i then decided it was perminatley evicted and it would be ok to document it. Being that it was never a legal squat i thought it would draw negitive attention.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-24_6f3c.html" title="Edit section: The Rivvits: Late 1970s Punk Band">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Rivvits: Late 1970s Punk Band</span></h2>
<p>The Rivvits (1977-79) were a West London-based punk band formed by vocalist and guitarist, Chris Burne, bassist Martin Godfrey, guitarist/keyboard player Nick Jones and drummer Dave Hawthorn. The band played ALL the influential punk/new wave clubs and pubs in and around London, such as, The Hope &amp; Anchor (Islington), The Roxy, The Vortex, Acklam Hall (Notting Hill), Notre Dame Hall (Leicester Square), The Red Cow (Hammersmith), The Windsor Castle (Harrow Road) and The Brecknock (Tufnell Park). The Rivvits played alongside (then) fledgling punk bands such as, the Lurkers, Subway Sect, The Slits, Jilted John, The Buzzcocks, The Adverts, Chelsea and UK Subs, among others.</p>
<p>The band signed to Alien Records in 1977 after an initial (unhappy) signing with London 'Prog Rock' manager, Del Taylor. It was said by friends of the band that Burne and Godfrey chased Taylor around his office in Hammersmith and threatened him with physical violence unless he released them from their draconian management contract. Strangely, Taylor did release the band from their contract rather quickly and with no financial penalties!</p>
<p>The Alien Record Company was run by their new manager, Nigel Lucas, jointly with Chris Burne and Martin Godfrey as artistic directors. Alien also handled the publishing of the Rivvit's material, although this later became a cause of contention. Chris Burne co-designed the Rivvits record sleeves with his then girlfriend, graphic designer, Sonia Ferrier (who sang some backing vocals on studio sessions) and he also wrote most of the Rivvits material, along with Martin.</p>
<p>The Rivvits toured extensively in England, Wales and Scotland playing medium and large venue gigs, and universities, throughout 1977/79, sometimes headlining, sometimes as support band. They toured the UK with famous rock 'n' roll act, The Pirates, in 1978, gaining much critical acclaim. Bernie Rhodes, The Clash manager, was at one time interested in managing them after seeing the Rivvit's at a Pirate's gig. Burne and Godfrey were not impressed with the details of his offer and so nothing came of it</p>
<p>Their first single was released as ALIX-1 in 1978: Saturday Night At The Dance (Burne) B/W The Girl Next Door (Godfrey) on Alien. This came with a FREE give-away of a flexi disk, a Duanne Eddy influenced rocker, Alright On The Night/ (one sided). Saturday Night at the Dance sold well for a new-wave single and reached the 40s in the UK chart after extensive publicity executed by the band themselves that was later an influence on today's Guerrilla Marketing techniques. They plastered London's underground, buses, cafes, bars and punk venues with distinctive circular Alien stickers advertising the single. Debbie Harry of Blondie was in London during this campaign and is said to have seen the stickers and bought the single. She is said to have liked it. 'Saturday Night at the Dance' is an up-tempo rock n' roll teen anthem with "Dance, dance, dance" as the chorus lyrics and a Chuck Berry-style lead guitar solo. "Girl Next Door" is a Buddy Holly-style spoof about an underwear fetishist.</p>
<p>"Never" is a more adventurous single. Written by Godfrey and arranged by Burne, it features unusual modal multi-sax harmony on the chorus, using elaborate counterpoint. Nigel Green, the sax player, then blasts into a jazz/blues sax solo over the following chorus. The sound is minor key, 60s, psych/garage-band influenced with a distinctive bass line by Godfrey. Julie Birchall was a fan of "Never" and gave it a good review in the NME. Her opening line was, "The Rivvits are cool and completly accepatble..." Praise indeed from the usually acid tongue of Miss B! "Never" is backed with "Boy Meets Girl," written by Chris Burne. This is a classic three minute pop single in very fast tempo with catchy 60s organ and antiphonal girl backing vocals on the chorus's "Boy Meets Girl" chant. The lyric is cynical about marriage and mortgages and is amusingly witty.</p>
<p>Alien Records continued to bring out singles into early 1980, using personnel formed from the Rivvits under various band names; The Beaks (Dr X), 1979, a spoof Hammer Horror influenced song written by Godfrey, with a strong Iggy/Stooges type bass and guitar riff; and, Nathaniel Halcrow &amp; The Mastodons (Move to the Right), written by Burne, which is a classic organ/bass riff pop song with a very catchy chorus. It's about liberty versus the dangers of extremist politics, both right and left!</p>
<p>Chris Burne also collaborated with noted keyboardist Vic Martin, in early 1979, on another Alien single that charted in several European countries, 'Don't Turn Me Away'. This is a synth-orchestrated slow ballad co-written by Martin and Burne. The singer was a strikingly attractive 19 year old brunette, a St Martin's art student named "Rexy", who spoke the vocals simply because she couldn't sing at all! Wistful harmonies on the chorus are by Martin, Burne and Ferrier. It was recorded in John Foxx's studio, The Garden, in Covent Garden. Vic Martin later went on to become the keyboard player with the Eurhythmics, then with Curiosity Killed the Cat, and he now plays with Gary Moore's Blues Band and occasionally, Alan Price's Band.</p>
<p>Chris Burne and Martin Godfrey split from Alien in late 1979, after a serious policy dispute over publishing rights with manager Nigel Lucas. Chris Burne had recently formed another band, 'Colour Vision,' playing many gigs in London (Dingwall's and the Music Machine (now Koko) gigs in Camden got good reviews) and various home-counties venues (Chelmsford Town Hall/Corn Exchange, Devizes). The backing band was formed of various seasoned players, including ace jazz/rock guitarist Clive Copland and legendary ex-Bob Marley drummer, Bob Drumbago. Colour Vision released one single on Alien, 'Until Tomorrow' as the A side, and 'Waiting into Eternity' on the B side, both written by Chris Burne.</p>
<p>Chris Burne has since forged a name for himself as a writer/teacher/composer/arranger and player in new wave/Rock/Improvisation, classical music and jazz, releasing material throughout the 1980s and 90s. Burne has also written media soundtracks and jingles, as well as a large body of classical material, including three string quartets, a symphony, string orchestra pieces and numerous chamber and vocal works, many of which have been performed on radio and at concert venues in Europe, the UK and the USA.</p>
<p>Nick Jones lives a life of rural seclusion in Leicestershire and hand-crafts musical instruments. He is an accomplished accordion maker and player and occasionally jams with various folk bands at festivals around the UK. Martin Godfrey runs an antique shop in the home counties. Dave Hawthorn is a qualified dentist, practising in London.</p>
<p>The Rivvits singles and other vinyl by Alien Records are collectable and are regularly sold on E-Bay and other auction sites.</p>
