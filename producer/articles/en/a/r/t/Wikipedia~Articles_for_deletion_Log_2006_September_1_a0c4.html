<li><b>Comment.</b> In response to the previous weak keep comment, this article has not been stubbed. No worries, I have stubbed it accordingly to give it a chance. A one sentence article about a Red Sox statistician is not encyclopedic, and the information presented in past versions from the <i>history</i> section were arguably useless. This one sentence can easily be plugged into the team's main article, or it can simply and effectively be deleted. – <a href="../../../h/a/m/Image%7EHammer_and_sickle.svg_8051.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/7/7e/Hammer_and_sickle.svg/16px-Hammer_and_sickle.svg.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" longdesc="../../../h/a/m/Image%7EHammer_and_sickle.svg_8051.html" /></a> <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotorious4life_30dc.html" title="User:Notorious4life">Я не имею никакой жизни</a> | <a href="../../../n/o/t/User_talk%7ENotorious4life_3a21.html" title="User talk:Notorious4life">существую</a> 05:56, 15 January 2006 (UTC))</li>

<li><b>Strong Merge</b>: Well, I don't wanna sound like I have anything against Pokémon (I can recite all 386 Pokémon in national Pokedex order by heart, for chrissakes!), but I think there are few locations outside the big cities within the Pokémon world's main regions worthy of an article of its own on Wikipedia. In the ideal world, I think, all articles on minor Pokemon locations (anything without a gym leader, in other words) would be merged into the articles on the regions themselves, with a crisp, summarized one-or-two-paragraph write-up on each location. I assume that having separate articles on each of the game's <i>big</i> towns and cities is the way it should be, and that's just fine; At the very least in any case, articles on caves, forests, and other locales without gym leaders should be merged into the articles on their respective regions. By that logic, Marine and Terra Cave should definitely be merged into the Hoenn article. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_fc38.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator">Erik Jensen</a> <b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErik_the_Appreciator_50c0.html" title="User talk:Erik the Appreciator">(I appreciate talk!)</a></sup></b> 21:59, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Probably hoax article. Full explanation on the article's talk page (Talk:Jean-Pierre Deveraux). In the last 20 minutes the editor, an (his?) IP, and another account have been playing games with the article, removing the cleanup tags I've added, blanking it, then restoring the content, and blanking again once I re-add the tags. Giving it the full AfD to settle the matter.

</ul>
<p><b>New Note</b></p>
<p>I am not quite sure how wikipedia works, but from my breif reading on the policies, wouldn't the following awards and accolades be significant to warrant representation? For example, there are a number of independent sources that have recognised this as being significant (e.g. the Australian Government, business magazines, prominent competitions). I would think that receiving a governement grant and being recognised as one of the "top 10 coolest comapanies" in all of Australia (by a respected source) would be something that would be remembered in the future. Also that fact that there is over 150,000 members from over 140 countries is significant.</p>
<p><b>Awards and Accolades</b></p>

<p>This article claims that the subject is an internationally known DJ who plays in Europe and North America. One would think that such a high-profile DJ would have some sort of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> talking about him. Well, a search came up with a total of 260 Google hits, only 18 of which showed outside of the "similar articles" selection. <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22DJ+Say-G%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22DJ+Say-G%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> These articles are MySpace pages, the artist's websites, and listings of DJs, as well as a couple of articles in (apparently) German that don't seem to be of substance. Thus, I feel that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> is lacking for this article. Looking at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, about the only guideline that might be met would be the appearances in North America and Europe - but again, there are no reliable sources that I've managed to turn up referring to them. So, again, I don't believe the artist meets the guidelines at all, despite the claims of notability in the article itself. Finally, the editor who has done most of the work on this article is Most Wanted Club - which happens to be the name of the subject's business. Thus I smell an advertisement attempt, and at very least a failure of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">vanity</a> guidelines. <b>Delete</b> unless someone can magic up some sources proving anything in it. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 04:01, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

"This article claims that the subject is an internationally known DJ who plays in Europe and North America."</p>
<p>THE ARTICLE DOES NOT CLAIM THIS&#160;!!! The only point the article refers to is that DJ SAY-G is booked in several countries. This does not mean that he (or whoever worte this text) claims to be internationally FAMOUS or KNOWN all over.</p>
<p>" 260 Google"</p>
<p>My research resulted in more results. However, this again does not deny any fact of the text given. As long as I understand the text, there is no phrase saying DJ SAY-G rules the Google Hits, nore doe sit represent his networking among international club promoters.</p>
<p>"appearances in North America and Europe - but again, there are no reliable sources that I've managed to turn up referring to them"</p>
<p>I don't know the company, but I think you can request a list of club references from Most Wanted Club Ent. with RELIABLE sources, such as telephone numbers to call and ask...</p>
<p>"User Name"</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; this really lacks proof...anybody can choose any name to edit&#160;!!! Imagine you were a representative of the company and somebody judges you because of somebody chose your name.</p>
<p>" Thus I smell an advertisement attempt"</p>
<p>I don't see any advertisement attempt. It is an infomative text.</p>
<p>FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW, IT'S A OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO&#160;!!!</p>

<li>In response to the IP (over and above Tony Fox's suggestion), a couple of minor points. It sounds from your comments that you believe that Wikipedia exists to document each and every DJ in the world. We don't. We exist to document each and every DJ (or singer, ski jumper, politician, doctor etc etc) who is actually notable. There is no indication on this DJ's article or on Google that he is in fact notable. If there are other DJs listed on Wikipedia who are not notable, then they stand a high chance of being deleted as well - the fact that they're here at the moment doesn't mean that they should be, it just means that nobody's put them up for deletion yet. What I said about "dealing with someone astronomically famous" was because of the fact that some of the pages which Google threw up as results were in German. Therefore, one might wonder if DJ SAY-G was perhaps very famous in Germany but not in the rest of the world (yes, this does happen every now and then, someone very famous in one country is nominated for deletion because he/she doesn't appear famous to someone in another country). However, because I speak German, I was able to read the pages in German and determine that not only is he not notable in English, neither is he notable in German. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 07:23, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Hate to be a tool and down on someone else's article, but this person is not notible enough for an article. Being on a reality show, especially <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Wants_to_be_a_Superhero__199e.html" title="Who Wants to be a Superhero?">Who Wants to be a Superhero?</a> does not yield the notibility for an article. Further, he is not a comics villain. The user(s) who made his article simply added the SHB incorrectly. Note that he's classified as a DC comics character. This is likely an error based on the similarity between the villain color and DC's color. (Don't get me started on how wrong that similarity is.) He was in the fake—I say, FAKE!—trailers because they didn't have anyone else to use. Viewers will note the other "villains" "problems" were "Chickman-man" (a giant baby chick) a fake asteroid and several pieces of footage ripped from other sci fi originals. These weren't perspective trailers for their possible sci fi films by any means. Finally, he appeared in his non-villainous costume at the end to congratulate Feedback. Feedback himself doesn't consider him his enemy. Bottomline, all we need is one article for the winner, who is and will be notible. That's not POV, either. These characters aren't even described in the reality show article.

<p>As I have now added, the group is quite notable and has been contacted by many other groups across the country and the world. The Oxford Alternotives performed a tour in the U.S. and chose Vandy Taal as an a cappella group to perform with. Even though the Alternotives only sing Western music, they passed on the chance to perform with Vanderbilt's other a cappella groups and instead chose Vandy Taal. Other universities have also contacted the group, but because of financial and scheduling reasons beyond the control of Vandy Taal, the group is currently unable to travel for performances while maintaining enough money to record its songs. However, the group is currently working for an increased budget from Vanderbilt University and hopes to attain the financial means to travel off campus for performances.

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. Admittedly, by strict tally, this argument is on the verge of being "no consensus." Considering that the keep arguments fail to engage on matters of policy (deferring instead to personal beliefs regarding the site's quality), the strength of argument weighs in favoring of deletion.

<li><b>Comment.</b> Well Google bases its hits ranking off the number of webpages that link to the site which is why Google is often used as a yardstick of sorts to determine Notability. Like I said the sheer number of those hits and the number of participating artists is reason enough for me. Like I said though it's just my opinion.

Subject: Re: Any college a cappella groups that perform all-original music?

Mike,

Other than Stanford Fleet Street's recent album of all original music (which
I think was a one-time project, not a permanent direction), I know of
nothing in your all-original league. I think you're safe calling yourselves
the first and only all-original collegiate a cappella group. Congrats!

&gt; Hi Mike-

&gt; I concur with Amanda - I don't know of any others. But Deke would
&gt; indeed be the guy who'd know, as he's the biggest promoter of contemporary
&gt; a cappella groups doing originals.

&gt; &gt; many a cappella groups on My Space, so he might have a more recent idea.
&gt; &gt; Don?

&gt; &gt; Good luck Mike. Hope we'll be hearing from Noteworthy this year!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;http://ucchoral.berkeley.edu/ucchoral/nworthy&gt;. The group is trying to
&gt; &gt; &gt; check if the claim is true that they are currently the only a college a
&gt; &gt; &gt; cappella group that performs only original music without any covers. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; figured BOCA would have the best chance of knowing of any other college
&gt; &gt; &gt; groups that exist that do not perform covers of songs.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; To the best of your knowledge, is there any other collegiate group that
&gt; &gt; &gt; you have run into that is performing only their own original music, past

I might also argue in this case that Noteworthy may satisfy the following guidelines of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Has composed a number of melodies, tunes or standards used in a notable genre, or tradition or school within a notable genre. <i>(To date, Noteworthy has written and performed 32 original songs. Whether a cappella counts as a notable genre is up for someone to argue.)</i></li>
<li>Has won or placed in a major music competition. <i>(Noteworthy came in 3rd in their competition, and not every group even makes it into the ICCA competition. Whether the ICCA quarter finals qualify as a major music competition is up for someone to argue.)</i></li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you for going out of your way to attempt to verify the "all-original" claim. However, private email correspondences do not meet the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> standards of Wikipedia. As for the composing songs, that criteria is in the "other" category, i.e. not a criteria for a musical group persay.</p>
<p>The claim about about reaching the "ICCA quarter finals" is not contained in the article (or sourced online as far as I can tell). I would argue that this does not meet that requirement anyway, as the ICCA contains many, many categories of awards, and 8 different groups would reach quarterfinals in each. I don't think that is sufficient. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 00:57, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What falls under the "other" category? Some may argue that a cappella falls "outside of mass media traditions".</p>
<p>If a local newspaper or school newspaper were to make a mention of the all-original claim (I'd have to research, but I'm sure any article on Noteworthy would have mentioned this), would that qualify for verifiability? Once sourced properly, would the only all-original collegiate group be enough to make the group "Noteworthy" enough? (pun fully intended)</p>
<p>As for sourcing the quarter finals thing (which I'll put in the main article if it's kept): <a href="http://www.varsityvocals.com/icca/results.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.varsityvocals.com/icca/results.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.varsityvocals.com/icca/results.shtml</a> - 2006 quarter finals results, West Region, University of Oregon If quarter finals aren't enough.... I guess they'll just have to make it further in this year's ICCAs. :-) (The same guy as before) 12.191.193.147 01:26, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep This Entry</b> I feel this is a valid entry: 1. I have seen many other entries for college a cappella groups that have developed into useful, well-written entries and I see no reason why the Gargoyles entry will not follow suite. 2. The Gargoyles are an a cappella group at Oxford University, one of the top academic institutions in the world, and I would argue that many outside of the Oxford community are indeed concerned with organizations formed within the context of such an important institution. 3. Merely listing the Gargoyles under the list of collegiate a cappella groups would not allow for much background information to be included such as the group's musical style, history, and other general facts. --68.193.181.153 11:18, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep This Entry</b> I agree that this is a valid entry fitting many of Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion in its own right. This UK-based group has undertaken two substantial tours to the US, when it visited several major universities, and during one of which it performed on national television (NBC Today programme). It was the first jazz a cappella group formed at Oxford University, and one of the first of its kind in the UK as a whole. As such it has been at the forefront of UK collegiate a cappella, both at home and abroad. Furthermore, in the UK the Gargoyles have appeared on local television and radio on many occasions, and been reviewed in the press. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 199.67.203.142 (<a href="../../../1/9/9/User_talk%7E199.67.203.142.html" title="User talk:199.67.203.142">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_199.67.203.142_f3d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/199.67.203.142">contribs</a>).</small> <small>14:10, 11 September 2006</small></li>

(2) I can't find any source that associates the book in any way with Robbins or Ziglar, so I have to wonder what that claim is based on. (3) It did not win "Book of the Year" as claimed. Writers Digest gave the book one of five <i>Honorable Mentions</i> in the category of self-published inspirational books.

<li><b>KEEP</b> based on relevence and notability even 690 google references sounds pretty good to me! seems to be a few voting for the delete but taking a closer look it appears only a couple people working to rid this one with sockpuppets.. BTW and OS DavidWBrooks.. I'm a looooooong time telegraph subscriber and I read your stuff man.. I was actually turned on to wikipedia by the piece you did on it earlier this month..

<li><b>Additional Comment</b> As I review this more It seems the people who want to delete argue "it's <b>only</b> listed at Barnes and Noble", It's <b>only</b> mentioned in this publication or that, It's <b>only</b> got 690 google references, it's <b>only</b> reviewed by this paper, the telegraph <b>only</b> mentions it for a writers signing at barnes and noble, it's <b>only</b> listed as a third party available on Amazon.. All these <b>onlys</b> add up to a pretty notable work. Far more notable than alot of entries on this site. You better carefully consider your actions as it is probable the next entry you add here will <b>only</b> be half as notable. It seems that the originator didn't realize the merit of this work but mistakes can be forgiven.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.61.91.82 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.61.91.82.html" title="User talk:24.61.91.82">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.61.91.82_7913.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.61.91.82">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>The result was <b>MERGE</b> into <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classes_in_World_of_Warcraft_1af8.html" title="Classes in World of Warcraft">Classes in World of Warcraft</a>. The raw totals are 9 Delete, 2 Keep, 4 Merge. Merge preserves the material, so collapse that into 9 Delete the material, 6 Keep the material in some form. That alone is not enough of a statistical edge to make a deletion a no-brainer. The argumentation is about equal. Therefore, no consensus to delete, defaults in this case to merge, since most of the Keep-the-material comments were to merg. Most of the merge votes were to merge the material. A couple of the Merge votes were to merge the material into the separate articles for each class, but these seem not to exist, so I merged into <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classes_in_World_of_Warcraft_1af8.html" title="Classes in World of Warcraft">Classes in World of Warcraft</a>. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 15:58, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm. as we can see here the page was first created at 04:15. I wasn't even done editing it when Herostratus surfed in and posted the AfD on it at 04:39. and then it disappeared altogether when Moriori redirected it to "homophobia", a page with many, many questions of neutrality, not to mention that "homophobia" has nothing whatsoever to do with anti-homosexualism. Why would Herostratus and Moriori be so blindingly quick to judge a page that was not even an hour old and was not even finished being created? I have reverted it now and continue to add more to it. I would appreciate it if everyone would lay off the page until I have had a chance to flesh it out.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I took a look at Herostratus' user page, and now I think I know what his problem with this page is, and it has nothing to do with "usefulness". He states on his user page that he is a <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitarian_Universalist_ee58.html" title="Unitarian Universalist">Unitarian Universalist</a>, a well known pro-homosexual organization. UU is something that I am quite familiar with. So it appears that he may have a bias against the subject matter of the page, rather than concern about the usefulness of the page. The reason I created this page is because "anti-homosexualism" is a plank in the KKK's supremacist philosophy and the Nazi's final solution and deserves its own article. I suspect that Herostratus' is trying to silence the article rather than add to its usefulness. This is a serious subject, and it deserves serious attention. "<a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">Homophobia</a>" on the other hand, is not a political philosophy and is a pejorative created and promoted by pro-homosexual activists for use against those that oppose their agenda and therefore has no relationship to this article. Anyone doubting that should read both pages and judge for themselves. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBritcom_bbf5.html" title="User:Britcom">Britcom</a> 11:42, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> as POV fork. I have never heard the term, and I get about 120 google hits for "anti-homosexualism" and less than half that for the unhyphenated version. (Weirdly, when I accidently clicked "maps" when googling <i>anti-homosexualism</i>, it found the Academy Awards.) The fact that the author cites the demonstrably false definition of homophobia as "fear" (<i>Anti-homosexualism is a calculated political philosophy ... It is not associated with a fear of homosexuals</i>), as well as his characterization of the UU church above, leads me to believe that this is an attempt to discredit the very common and well-understood word "homophobia" by introducing a near-<a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a>.

<dd>I don't see how anything I have placed in the article could be considered POV. It is mostly undisputed history. Anyway I don't own it, you can edit it if you don't like the way it reads.</dd>
<dd>I did not say "<a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a>" is a fear of homosexuals, the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a> Wikipage says that, and I didn't put it there. I was saying that the terms are distinct from each other.</dd>
<dd>I have sourced the term back to at least 1957 on the internet. I don't believe that there is another term that describes what the Nazi's policy was with regard to homosexuals and that was many years before 1957. I would not consider it a trivial event either. For example: "The extermination of homosexuals during WWII was as a result of Nazi ______________." What else fits in this blank?</dd>
<dd>About the UU, I can source what I said if you like. They are not afraid to admit that they have many openly gay leaders and members. I have met some of them.</dd>
<dd>Anti-homosexualism does not just encompass violence, it also encompasses political opposition, rhetoric, activism and institutional and religious opposition.</dd>
<dd>I don't think this time frame for AfD is fair. I am new at this and this page is being scrutinized even before it is a day old. Don't you think that the first editor of an article should be given 24 hours, not 24 minutes before someone slaps an AfD on it? --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBritcom_bbf5.html" title="User:Britcom">Britcom</a> 16:25, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry about the rapid AfD, but it's common practice to get an early start, partly because it's easiest to find new articles and partly because it'll save the authors a lot of time in the long run. In any case... the word "homophobia" fits in just fine in the sentence you propose; or a variant, like "national homophobic policies" or something perhaps more strongly worded. The first sentence of the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a> article says, <i>fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against homosexuality or homosexuals,</i> which overlaps pretty much completely with the definition you posit for "anti-homosexualism". I see that you found a 1957 reference (good work), but I still do not think the term is notable or widely used, even if it is occasionally used. (I find many more google hits for a term I thought I just made up at random, <i>anti-Big Mac</i>. Just because people string words together does not require us to have an encyclopedia article on them.) As for the UUs, of course they are open to gays, but I wouldn't call them <i>a well known pro-homosexual organization.</i> Finally, I suggest again that <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violence_against_gays%2C_lesbians%2C_bisexuals%2C_and_the_transgendered.html" title="Violence against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered">Violence against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered</a> is an appropriate (and existing) article for some of the detail you have included. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 16:48, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look again, I have shown that the two words are not synonyms and I have sourced literary usage in 1957 and 2000. The definitions are totally distinct and without similarity.

<dd>It is not a neurosis, and no one claims that it is.

<dd>Your argument is based on comparing apples and oranges. I am saying the terms are unrelated, distinct and should be understood that way. "Homophobia" describes an attitude within the mind of the individual. "Anti-homosexualism" is the political targeting of homosexuals for attack or opposition by a political or religious group. According to your logic, "<a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenophobia.html" title="Xenophobia">Xenophobia</a>" and "<a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a>" would mean the same thing.--<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBritcom_bbf5.html" title="User:Britcom">Britcom</a> 12:28, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Whoa There.</b> Yes when I nominated this article it was just a stub, and that happens sometimes. But even so, this is not a keepful article because <b>there ain't no such word</b>, it's a neologism made up by the author to try to tie together the Nazi Party and the Westboro Baptist Church (!) together into some kind of unified movement, which is about the silliest idea I've seen today. Sure the word "anti-homosexualism" is properly formed, but you can add "anti" to most <i>any</i> English word. "I really only like to have sofas in my house, I'm pretty much anti-chair" is a meaningful English sentence which has not doubt been uttered. Does that mean that "anti-chair" is a real English word that should have a dictionary definition or a Wikipedia article? No, and neither is "Anti-homosexualism". The whole unsaid but obvious <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> of the article is: Don't like gays? Well you're a Nazi of a Klanner then. But look. First of all, the Nazis hated lots of people, they weren't <i>primarily</i> an anti-gay organization and neither is the Klan. Second of all, <i>everybody</i> was anti-gay until about 1960 or whenever. Third of all, you'd have include the Catholic Church and the FBI and God knows who else if you want to list anti-gay organizations, if you're going to reach back into the 1940's or whatever. I mean since we're talking about organizations who showed "organized hostility toward or opposition against homosexuals as a group" but not as their primary thrust, you'd have to list <i>practically every social organization and private company</i> that existed, since we're going back into the 40's. Finally, the writer's contention that I'm against this article <i>because</i> I'm a Unitarian is just bizarre; I'm against it <i>in spite of</i> being a Unitarian, a denomination sympathetic to the writer's <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> (hey, my <i>minister</i> is gay), but, here, I'm a Wikipedian first.

<dd>I agree with you that the dispute shouldn't be about personalities, but your contention that the word is "a neologism made up by the author" surprised me when the author of the article cites verifiable usage of the word from 1957 and 1971. <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> is about <i>disrupting Wikipedia</i> to make a point.

<dd>Herostratus and Moriori (as shown above) are the two responsible for the "drive by" AfD and redirect. The two of them are just trying to defend their attack on the page that I am trying to work on. Moriori violated the AfD rules when he redirected the page to "Homophobia" 12 minutes after the AfD box was posted on the page. In light of their zeal to delete this page, even violating Wikipedia rules to do so, I think their opinions posted here are suspect. Remember, Wikipedia's code of conduct says "Assume good faith". I have no Wikipedia violations, and I have no axe to grind. This is my first page and I have done my best to be neutral with a topic that generates lots of emotions. The examples I chose are the most obvious examples of "Anti-homosexualism" that I can think of. I would love for other Wikiedians to add more or edit what I have written for accuracy. But that does not seem to be the agenda here. The agenda here is to attack me and my edits as worthless or underhanded. If they are so bad, then why not just edit them instead of jumping straight to deletion? Why not discuss it on the talk page? No, that’s not good enough for them they want to get rid of it so no one can read what it says. I thought we were supposed to be neutral here, and not favoring one side of a controversy. It seems to me that the word has a history and now apparently a controversy because some seemingly want to control what you read by forcing a proverbial square peg (political or religious hatred or opposition to homosexuality) into a round hole ("homophobia"). (See how many words I had to use to say what it is without using the one word "Anti-homosexualism".) Apparently we have two schools of thought here. One that says: "Oh the author has an agenda and that's the reason he set up the page." and on the other hand there is: "Oh the author just doesn't understand that we all have decided to change the definition of "Anti-homosexualism" to a word that makes it sound like those who are against homosexuals are suffering from a "phobia", and well, he must not have gotten the memo." Not one of them has addressed the glaring hole in their reasoning. Namely that "Anti-homosexualism" always refers to the <b>ACTIONS of organized groups</b>, and "homophobia" always refers to the <b>MINDSET of individuals</b>. The words are clearly not synonyms. Everybody can understand this when they read it. But some don't seem to want it put into print. That means they think they own Wikipedia. That also means that they think they know better than you what you should be reading. They are trying to slant Wikipedia's content, and by the same token, limit your access to knowledge they don't "approve" of. Is this what Wikipedia is about? Do these people represent a "neutral" viewpoint? It seems that I am getting a better education here than I bargained for, and unfortunately, its all bad. What a black-eye this is for Wikipedia. What a black-eye this is for the Internet. Sickening. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBritcom_bbf5.html" title="User:Britcom">Britcom</a> 12:28, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Bikeable is right that homophobia is a much more commonly used term than anti-homosexualism. However, the uncommon word was used in the 50s while the common one was coined for its current definition in the 60s. The neologism argument is unsound. The idea of having two or more articles on two or more related but not identical topics should not instill us with fear because there are precedents for this in Wikipedia. For example: <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judeophobia.html" title="Judeophobia">Judeophobia</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-semitism.html" title="Anti-semitism">Anti-semitism</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Judaism_7579.html" title="Anti-Judaism">Anti-Judaism</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_Jews_8014.html" title="Persecution of Jews">Persecution of Jews</a> are four closely related, non-identical topics.

The discussion or documentation of that subject within Wikipedia is not the same as the (above implied) claiming of any rights within Wikipedia.

<dd>Please don't speak for "every other poster here." Speak for yourself only. I'm a poster in here and I've never understood that the word "homophobia" has a clear meaning. The section dedicated to etymology and usage at the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a> article indicates a huge amount of confusion and debate over that term and its usage. "Common usage" is not a requirement for an article in Wikipedia. "Verifiable usage" is.

<dd>It's always a good idea to search through Wikipedia and create links to a new article at appropriate places. This is a good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia even though I understand it could be regarded as POV-pushing by someone who believes the article should not be included. An AfD shouldn't prevent someone from doing this. I think it is part of Wikipedia's mission to spread knowledge about concepts and their associated words regardless of whether the word is in common use. This is particularly true for a word like antihomosexualism that has existed and been used for decades. My impression is that debates about word choice and word usage occur at Wikipedia all the time in talk pages and AfD discussions, but I agree with Alabamaboy that they usually don't belong in the articles themselves. The "Modern usage" section of the article was POV-pushing when it said one word "should not be confused" with another and I've edited this. Better to provide footnotes to verifiable citations where the usage is discussed and leave it to the reader about what <i>should</i> be said or written.

Notice how assuming good faith is NOT encouraged in the presence of evidence to the contrary. Let's review. Britcom has 'attacked' Herostratus through his <i>religion</i>, claiming that it has a 'pro-homosexual' agenda (note how Britcom uses this AS an attack as if it were a BAD thing. Is it unreasonable that this leads me to question his motives?). What would we do if an editor who made an arguing point based upon the fact that their 'opponent's' Userpage had a "This user is Christian" or "This user is Catholic" userbox on it? Of course, we would begin to assume BAD faith (as we should). Britcom also says that the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a> article has a 'pro-homosexual' POV push. These are red flags to me, personally, and are enough for me to assume that this article was CREATED as a bad faith POV-fork of homophobia. That being said, there IS some good information here, and rather than being spent in a POV-fork article, it should be placed where it belongs, in one of the two articles I suggested. The forthing at the mouth that continues from editors who claim that <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a> does not include opposition to homosexuality or is limited to a FEAR of homosexuals (even though all common sense regarding the usage of the term in actual language would have us believe otherwise) is rather disconcerting and, in my opinion, damaging to the wiki. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECaveatLector_0bc2.html" title="User:CaveatLector">CaveatLector</a><sup><a href="../../../c/a/v/User_talk%7ECaveatLector_5e43.html" title="User talk:CaveatLector">Talk</a></sup> 21:47, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Diverting the discussion specifically of anti-homosexual bigotry over to a term which we can now see is not simply a contributor coinage affords the possibility of being able to discuss that with a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

I personally would move all the discussion of prejudice to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-homosexualism.html" title="Anti-homosexualism">anti-homosexualism</a> and have <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a> point back to it as a main article, but keep both articles. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 13:46, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I totally see where you are coming from and the issues with the usage of "homophobia". However, the plain fact is that "homophobia" <i>is used</i> for a great variety of meanings, and "anti-homosexualism" is hardly used at all. It would be nice if we could, as you suggest, "move the discussion of prejudice" to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-homosexualism.html" title="Anti-homosexualism">anti-homosexualism</a>, which I agree would make sense based on the <i>apparent</i> etymologies and what the words <i>ought</i> to mean. However, this would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. We cannot be <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistic_prescription.html" title="Linguistic prescription">prescriptive</a> about what words <i>should</i> or <i>should not</i> mean; we can only report what people use them for. I would recommend the article on <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistic_prescription.html" title="Linguistic prescription">Linguistic prescription</a> and I would argue that only a <i>descriptive</i> attitude is <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. A true description of usage is that many people use "homophobia" for diverse meanings, and very few use "anti-homosexualism", so we may not move the discussion from the former to the latter. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 17:52, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Unfortunately it seems to me that all your words here do not add up to the actuality of the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a> article. It is in fact used for POV-pushing as a matter of course, and its content is original research as a matter of course, because while we refer the daylights out of it in order to keep the various POV Patrols from reverting, the synthesis of those references into an article has to go beyond simply referring to an authoritative analysis. Without that, the article cannot be written.</dd>

<dd>For you to label one usage as "true" is, in the sense you prefer here, original research, for it is surely your sense of the world you are expressing here, and not some dilligently researched monograph on how the word is used. It is not my sense that the situation is so (if you will pardon the oxymoron) cleanly obscured. The article is being held hostage to the POV-pushing that the word suggests, for Wikipedia is not really distinct from the rest of the world in the issue of the supposed meaning for the word.</dd>

<dd>It isn't really true that people looking for anti-homosexual prejudice need be confounded by two articles. Indeed, were I editor-in-chief I would have the -phobia article point back to the other, prominently, above the text. But what you're saying here is that because a lot of people use the words in a muddled and inconstant fashion, that Wikipedia's discussion of the topic likewise must be muddled and inconstant, because it cannot be allowed to structurally reflect the real distinction between talking about that prejudice and speculating about the causes behind it. So we're to be stuck with an article that is structurally POV-pushing, because it doesn't permit a clear distinction.</dd>

<dd>Finally, NPOV is dead as a doornail if we are going to commit to a term which is the subject of POV bias in the real world. The suggested "new" term is perhaps uncommon, but is demonstrated to be not unknown, and it is certainly neutral. I say that this is good enough, and that the division between the two articles affords the possibility of real neutrality. The single article does not. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 21:39, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What we seem to have here is a failure to communicate (no seriously, I think this is the problem). Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedia of all knowledge, right? Since knowledge is inherently based upon its perception and uses within society (i.e. there is no 'TRUE' knowledge, only what people percieve that they know) and since homophobia is used <i>primarily</i> within society to refer to a variety of things <i>including</i> 'anti-homosexualism', the Wiki should <i>reflect</i> this knowledge. Anti-choice redirects to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-life.html" title="Pro-life">Pro-life</a>, and so it should. Even though it is <i>quite arguable that they are two completely different things</i> they are <i>essentially</i> the same thing, it's just that one is used <i>more frequently</i> than the other (Pro-life, that is) so the one used LESS frequently used redirects to the one used MORE frequently used. Why is this debate not turning out the same way? Probably because some people feel a linguistic imperative to associate homophobia with an actual FEAR, even though the common use of the word does not play out this out. Let's take the word <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrophobia.html" title="Hydrophobia">hydrophobia</a> as an example. Hydrophobia does not refer to a FEAR of water (yes, it goes to a disambig page, but if Wikipedia wishes to stay consistent, it really shouldn't). It's the medical term for <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabies.html" title="Rabies">rabies</a>. Should we create a <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrophobia.html" title="Hydrophobia">hydrophobia</a> article or redirect the link to <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquaphobia.html" title="Aquaphobia">aquaphobia</a> because we must insist that hydroPHOBIA MUST refer to a FEAR of water? Certainly not. This article is a POV fork resulting from an insecurity some people have with being called homoPHOBIC if they have a prejudice against homosexuals (for WHATEVER the reason). The fact is that common parlance has used the term in this fashion. Therefore, Wikipedia should reflect that. Not some idea of a 'correct' term or definition based upon its linguistics. No such 'correct' definition exists. As I have said, some of the content of this article IS valuable. But it should be merged and redirected, not kept as a fork. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECaveatLector_0bc2.html" title="User:CaveatLector">CaveatLector</a><sup><a href="../../../c/a/v/User_talk%7ECaveatLector_5e43.html" title="User talk:CaveatLector">Talk</a></sup> 23:00, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Saying that there is no true knowledge is merely a commitment to yet another POV, and in this context, a bad one. And you've neatly skipped over one of the two central objections: that the assertion of "common parlance" <i>is</i> original research-- namely, it's you presumably appealing to your own experience. I don't have that experience; I have the "it's the pet phrase of one faction and rejected by the other" experience. The homophobia article, most of the time, admits of this, though it is heavily edited to keep that mention to the slightest possible.</dd>

<dd>Your counterexamples are bad and misrepresent the coinage of homophobia-- which again I must point out is a matter of documented fact; the citation is, at this instant, in the third footnote in Weinberg's very first sentence. He intended it to mean exactly what the naive reader would guess; he states this bluntly and without room for equivocation. The dispute and POV-pushing from that point on are familiar, leading to the current situation in which Weinberg's meaning and a supposedly more general meaning (but which critics would say is contaminated by the original meaning) try to live side by side in the article.</dd>

<dd>I don't think we must be trapped by this state of confusion into writing something that is similarly confused. The other term may not be widely used, but it is there and it offers an opening for clarity. (The claims that it is a neologism have been demonstrated incorrect, after all.) It's easy enough for someone who is used to using "homophobia" in the more general sense to be directed to the other article. And I think the implication that there's something wrong with Wikipedia somehow influencing readers to stop using homophobia in the general sense is unjustified. Right now you are essentially settling for the position that we need to reinforce the confused usage by respecting it-- well, not rigorously, because the end result certainly isn't rigor, but out of sense of mechanical principle rather than out of sense of superior explanation. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 05:58, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The idea that the usuage of homophobia in common parlance is 'confused' is outright linguistically descriptive nonsense (sorry, but it is). Words do not have ESSENTIAL meanings, they only have the meanings that the society they are used in gives them. This is NOT a POV. This is a linguistic and literary FACT. To suppose that there is some sort of 'right' usage of a word and that a COMMON usage of the word is somehow 'wrong' or 'misguided' or 'confused' reeks of a philosophy guided by some sort of cultural superiority complex. The idea that recognizing a word's definition in common parlance is original research is complete bollocks, considering the comparative results from a mere Google search, much less a search through scholarly databases and journals, of homophobia and 'anti-homosexualism'. Also, Weinburg should not enter into a discussion of what homophobia MEANS other than to acknowledge why and how he coined it (NOT to proclaim his coinage as some sort of 'correct' definition of the word. His authority there expired as soon as the word entered common language). The fact of the matter is that there <i>is no superior explanation</i> in creating TWO articles, ONE for 'homophobia' and one for 'anti-homosexulism'. All this does is serve to CONFUSE the readers of the Wiki and advance the POV that these two terms somehow describe two different things (when common parlance has it that they do <i>not</i>). In the end, I am afraid I just have to state my belief that you are just resolutely incorrect when you say that Wikipedia should 'influence readers to stop using homophobia in the general sense'. There are plenty of WP:NOT pages, but one thing that an ENCYCLOPEDIA certainly IS NOT is a dogmatic excercise in pushing particular views of what words <b>mean</b>. It is meant to 'encircle all knowledge'. To split something that is seen as ONE concept within most of the English speaking world into TWO articles is to push the POV that the common use of the word is somehow 'incorrect', and is, to be flatly honest, downright ridiculous. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECaveatLector_0bc2.html" title="User:CaveatLector">CaveatLector</a><sup><a href="../../../c/a/v/User_talk%7ECaveatLector_5e43.html" title="User talk:CaveatLector">Talk</a></sup> 06:50, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You say "FACT"; I say, your evidence for "common parlance" is your own, one-POV-identified community. I find people using homophobia in both ways, and I especially see people using it with the <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denotation.html" title="Denotation">denotation</a> you assert and the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connotation.html" title="Connotation">connotation</a> of what the etymology implies and the coiner intended. And I find a lot of people avoiding the word, for this very reason. Talking about "most of the English-speaking world" is at best dubious and at worst a refusal to acknowledge sociental divisions that are measured with great accuracy at every election.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia cannot avoid being "a dogmatic exercise in pushing particular views of what words mean". The very basis of the conflict here is controlling whether Wikipedia authorizes <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-homosexualism.html" title="Anti-homosexualism">anti-homosexualism</a> as a name for one phenomenon. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 12:48, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

Which is infact one of the big reasons that people avoid 'homophobia', a desire to not admit that they think homosexuality is wrong.

<dd>So let's hold on a moment here. You just said that you find people using 'homophobia' in BOTH contexts...so isn't creating an entirely different word in order to split off one of those meanings a POV fork? You also now claim that Wikipedia IS a place that pushes a particular VIEW of what words mean. Doesn't that very idea violate WP:NPOV? I am NOT arguing that 'anti-homosexualism' does not mean 'being against homosexuals' (I mean, to be frank and French, no shit...), what I am saying is that concept is already described by the word 'homophobia', and to say 'No no no, all of you who are using that way are WRONG' by creating a seperate article for the concept is to push a POV. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECaveatLector_0bc2.html" title="User:CaveatLector">CaveatLector</a><sup><a href="../../../c/a/v/User_talk%7ECaveatLector_5e43.html" title="User talk:CaveatLector">Talk</a></sup> 15:42, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Precisely. Thank you, CL. I've never argued that there was only one meaning for "homophobia"; there are many usage, as is true with many words in English. Wikipeda should be reporting on those. Mangoe accuses us of thinking that <i>somehow influencing readers to stop using homophobia in the general sense is unjustified</i>. But this is precisely the point of <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Clearing up lingustic confusion is not our goal (never mind that the "coiner" of a word has no control over how it is used later!). Reporting accurately on the meanings of words (read: <i>usage</i>, of all stripes, not the meanings we think they should have) is the best we can do. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 16:23, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not a POV fork. Yes, Wikipedia is an agency in the control of the meaning of words, and no, this isn't intrinsically a POV issue (although in this case we both recognize, or should, that it is related to one of the POV divisions). If public discourse is dominated by weasel words on the one hand and/or slurs on the other, it's bloody obvious that a supposedly NPOV reference has to avoid popularly understood language. Since the controversy over the article consistently centers on exactly those concerns, it is entirely reasonable to fork the current content into two <i>subjects</i>-- NOT points of view, because they aren't. If your point of view on the subjects is to prevail, it can do so when they are kept distinct. People would approach two articles with distinct POVs, and would argue about each as before. I think the argument in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-homosexualism.html" title="Anti-homosexualism">anti-homosexualism</a> would probably relax some because the fact of bigotry and its expressions are more or less a matter of simple historical documentation. Conversely the argument over the phobic origin of antipathy to homosexuality might increase, but it might also improve in quality when it cannot hide behind the more general issue.</dd>

<dd>Mangoe, I didn't mean "accuse" in any particularly bad way; sorry. I understood you properly, I think. I agree that wikipedia should help with <i>clarity</i>, of course: we can make sure people understand what a word means (although this is really the function of a dictionary, and wp's purpose goes deeper). However, when a word has multiple meanings in common use, we should <i>not</i> be attempting to reassign one (or more) of those meanings to another word, even for the sake of clarity. For example, "moot" has two nearly opposed meanings ("open to debate" and, more recently, "not worth discussion"). Even if the latter is a confused usage of the former, it's not our place to correct the usage, but only to report on it. I think the is the issue we have here. (Incidentally, we should copy this discussion to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Talk%7EHomophobia_b495.html" title="Talk:Homophobia">Talk:Homophobia</a> after the AfD, as it's an interesting recap of a lot of points regularly brought up there.) <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 17:03, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

In practice the article is and is not edited this way, because it tends to reflect the connotation attached to phobias, and because the considerable denunciation of the term as reflecting this connotation is played down as much as can be gotten way with. What we get is an article which tends to assume that fixing homophobia-- which is to say, opposition to homosexuality-- is a matter of psychological treatment or at least conditioning.</dd>

<dd>Compared to the mess I'm having to deal with in <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway_signalling.html" title="Railway signalling">railway signalling</a>, this is a piece of cake. In that subject, American and British practices have evolved so separately that term-for-term substitution often isn't possible (as in the <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_siding.html" title="Rail siding">rail siding</a> versus <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passing_loop.html" title="Passing loop">passing loop</a> issue). Earlier in the summer, we had a big battle because the category of "locomotive engineers" had been created-- to tag people who <i>designed</i> locomotives, and not people who operated them (the American meaning). When I tried to change this to a more universally intelligible label, "locomotive designers", there was an uproar from some of the British contingent, who would not give up their term. Eventually, the need for an unambiguous term prevailed, leaving us with the possibility that Wikipedia may lead Brits to switch to American usage, but it's something we'll just have to live with. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 18:38, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems as though you feel that the term homophobia in all its uses will always and forever be connected with a psychological condition. But, then again, so is <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> in some aspects (being an '-ism'), and that does not even have a 'phobia' attached to it. Should those who object to such a 'negative' term for their beliefs be allowed to create an article entitled 'anti-African-Americanism' because they view an article on 'racism' as <i>biased</i>? This is a very simple issue, Mangoe, and your example actually <i>clarifies</i> what must be done here. What we have here is a group of people who are upset that a word that might be considered disparaging and its common usage (also disparaging) might refer to them. Now, the goal is to split this word into TWO words, and pretend as though the first word <i>does not</i> refer to what it actually refers to in common knowledge. I will say this again, because it bares being said over and over again. Wikipedia is <i>not</i> the place to push for a particular <i>meaning</i> for a word. One side of this debate wishes to acknowledge that a word has <b>multiple meanings</b> in common parlance. Most of the other side of the debate is getting red-faced at the possibility that they are inherently being <i>called</i> this word, screaming 'POV' and trying to create a fork that doesn't even come close to reflecting knowledge and usage. (<b>I would like to make a special note here that not all of those who support this side are homophobic. I tried to say that with 'most' but I realize it might be interpreted that way. It's entirely possible some want to include the fork based on a difference in philosophy regarding <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and not because they are homophobes.</b>) One of these sides is POV pushing. It is not the first one. In your example, you would not abide the creation of <i>two seperate catagories</i> to express the <i>same</i> profession because <i>one</i> group was upset by one of the terms. That is ludicrous. NPOV does <b>not</b> mean that the wiki should be modified from what it is meant to encompass (knoweldge and uses) in order that some people might not get offended. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECaveatLector_0bc2.html" title="User:CaveatLector">CaveatLector</a><sup><a href="../../../c/a/v/User_talk%7ECaveatLector_5e43.html" title="User talk:CaveatLector">Talk</a></sup> 19:07, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No amount of you repeating it is going to get rid of the reality that entries in Wikipedia are going to be used, and more or less correctly as that sort of thing goes, as a normative authority on what the words mean. Therefore it is not possible to assign names to articles and at the same time avoid pushing for particular meanings.</dd>

<dd>In your abandoment of good faith you've asserted that the rewritten <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a> would not even mention what you claim is the most common meaning of the word. I don't see you you can successfully defend that claim, if only because (in the event you don't prevail) you and a host of others are going to make absolutely sure that the one article refers prominently to the other. And so will I, for that matter. Splitting the issue across two articles is not going to prevent anyone from getting his or her points in, except for the connotation issue which you claim isn't really there anyway, so it wouldn't hurt your POV to have a structure which discouraged it.</dd>

<dd>It isn't just myself who refused two categories in the locomotive designer incident, but the rest of the community. It went up for a RfM, and my position prevailed. I don't recall whether two (redundant) categories was considered, but I suspect that if it had been proposed someone would have shot it down as a POV fork (which it would have been). <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 21:02, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECaveatLector_0bc2.html" title="User:CaveatLector">CaveatLector</a> hits the nail on the head when they say that homophobia really is an "ism", only named as such due to the complete awkwardness and lack of clarity in any possible names (homosexualism? Sexualitism? high-kinsey-scoreism?). This is what homophobia is recognised as, not a phobia. Yes, the word sucks, but anti-homosexualism is even more disjointed (anti-race? anti-coloured? anti-women?), and it really is not wikipedia's place to try and promote society to find a new word for something. As I've already hinted at, POV pushing runs both ways in this matter. <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">Homophobia</a> is seen as being "pro-gay", or at least not supportive of the voiced objections to sexuality. And quite frankly, <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> takes a similar, correct (<a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">non-attacking</a> stance. Anti-homophobia seems to be a term prefered by those who are seemingly "anti-gay", who would rather avoid the negative consequences of such a title. That's not to say that the current article is not nuetral, it's been well written. Whilst it is wrong to arbitarilly label peple as homophobic, I can see that if this article remains, attempts will occur to change any mentions of someone being 'homophobic', often even those straight out of a reference, over to the far kinder and less inflamatory (and hence more accepting) term of anti-homophobia. To finish, I'll repeat: homophobia is an 'ism', just like racism <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 22:16, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Redirect</b> I am changing my opinion from Keep to Weak Redirect. The primary (actually, the only) editor who contributed to this article has <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBritcom_6f30.html#Final_entry" title="User talk:Britcom">left Wikipedia</a> without replying to my suggestions for improvements on the article's <a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnti-homosexualism_8c2c.html#POV-pushing" title="Talk:Anti-homosexualism">talk page</a>. Unfortunately, without this editor taking suggestions from the community or even replying to them, I think this article will stagnate in its current form, and in its current form it is too POV to continue in the encyclopedia. For now, the word should redirect to homophobia. I hope a future editor creates a new anti-homosexualism article that is encyclopedic. I copied the article's content to <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBritcom_Anti-homosexualism_76f5.html" title="User talk:Britcom/Anti-homosexualism">User_talk:Britcom/Anti-homosexualism</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> This page contains no false information, and as a specific independent organization I think The New Blue merits its own individual page.

Such elaboration may be larging lacking on The New Blue page at this time, but as a stub it is implied that in the future more information will be added to the New Blue page.

<p>If I were to reattach this to Mapletip.com, the maplewiki.net domain was RECENTLY purchased as you can see on Whois, therefore the Alexa ranking is DEFINETLY low. And also, unique google hits will also be low due to the newness. When Maplewiki was attached to Mapletip, it obtained MANY articles with many people helping every day. But now, you are going with a new domain that was recently purchased for Maplewiki. Please reconsider. Sources, are of coures in the Maplewiki itself.</p>

<p>It is impossible to verify any of the details prevented on the Black River House website and other pages written by the site's owner through independent sources. No other articles on the Marchant case, even eleven years after the site claims the news broke upon the public, despite the highly sensational nature of the incident. No other articles on the dramatic and enigmatic disappearance of the band The Secret Method. No other articles on 2005 suicide at the house, aside from a PDF copy of a BBC article which may not be written in a professional tone and cannot now be located on the BBC website proper. Town of Kildubhan, Ireland does not appear to exist outside of references to the site. Book which the site's author claims to have written, published by Random House, does not appear to exist; should be some reference even if the edition was limited. Very probable hoax or publicity stunt. -- PegasusGrrl 11:24, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This object may not exist. A detailed explaination is presented on the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Sombrero_Galaxy_f3e0.html" title="Sombrero Galaxy">Sombrero Galaxy</a> page under "Environment". Basically, some papers using one group identification method have determined that M104 is part of a group (references include the <b>Nearby Galaxy Catalogue</b> by B. Tully, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992A&amp;AS...93..211F" class="external text" title="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992A&amp;AS...93..211F" rel="nofollow">Groups of galaxies within 80 Mpc.

The Atlas of the Universe website itself does not definitively state whether M104 belongs in a group; two different pages within it contain contradictory information. (Note that the Atlas of the Universe website uses the Tully, Fouque et al., Garcia, and Giuricin et al. references given above. The original references are more useful than the Atlas of the Universe website.) Since it is unclear as to whether a "M104 group" exists and since this is already discussed thoroughly in the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Sombrero_Galaxy_f3e0.html" title="Sombrero Galaxy">Sombrero Galaxy</a> article, the <a href="../../../m/1/0/M104_group_of_galaxies.html" title="M104 group of galaxies">M104 group of galaxies</a> article should be deleted.

<li><b>Delete</b> - the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Sombrero_Galaxy_f3e0.html" title="Sombrero Galaxy">Sombrero Galaxy</a> article discusses whether that galaxy should be regarded as being in a group - it isn't directly analogous to this article as it has no discussion of the legitimacy of the "M104 group" title. Redirecting would not be correct as it would suggest that the M104 group was a recognised entity (plus it has no main space links and isn't a likely search term anyway). There may be a possibility for a valid article about the existence of an M104 group to be created, but this article is poorly titled, uncited and factually lacking. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 14:39, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

I think Philemon is clearly excessive in his highly biased "entry-cleansing" zeal: to me, this looks like any other European think-tank albeit an embryonic one, because it was founded quite recently. Plus TEC clearly claims to be "independent and research-oriented" which removes all ambiguity and/or risk of it being confused with an official EU ministry or department. <b>I think we should definitely keep this entry.</b> Maybe Philemon (who seems to be a rightwing Polish <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irredentist.html" title="Irredentist">irredentist</a>...) doesn't like these guys because their vision of Europe includes Russia?.</p>

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. My reading of the debate is that there is a good case for an overview trilogy article that covers all three films, but the previous text on this page did not fulfil that adequately, so the article should be deleted as it stood. As it happens, it was turned into a disambig page during the debate, and there is a need for a disambig page. However, this is not really suitable as no one is likely to search for "Scream (trilogy)". I have therefore added Scream 2 and Scream 3 to the existing Scream disambig page to meet the need more usefully. If I have misread this and there is a need for a "Scream (trilogy)" disambig, then I will undelete it. As it stands, it can be recreated with good content, if anyone wishes, for an overview article. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 00:29, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

If we were doing an article about some arbitrary guy, would his website describing himself be a reliable source of information?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Obviously, as per my essays on the subject, I don't get involved in Wikipedia issues on the actual Wikipedia much, but I started getting contacted by a number of people about this particular debate, and wished to make a clear and concise statement. I run textfiles.com. I spend a large amount of my waking hours downloading, acquiring, and sorting through primary sources related to bulletin board systems, warez groups, online culture in general and a wide range of related subjects. I hand-scan printouts, transfer original floppy disks from dusty boxes, and travel to interview people who were involved in the various aspects of online life that I have on my site. I am in communication with other archivists doing similar work, or at least also collecting primary sources and information, and verifying, and doing all the proper background work one does when one collects history. Defacto2 is one of many groups doing this. We (defacto, myself, archive.org, Temple of the Screaming Electron (TOTSE) and many others) consider this information important, relevant, and we work to make it accurate and represent "what really happened". This is not the first time Mr. Lenahan has decided to put his mark on deleting aspects of this culture in the name of relevancy, and his statements in the past bear out a lack of perspective on the whole matter of inclusionism vs. deletionism. Focus on improvement, not destruction. I'm sorry to hear about your cat but there are better avenues to vent your sadness. --<a href="../../../j/s/c/User%7EJscott_f61d.html" title="User:Jscott">Jscott</a> 04:43, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> are you kidding? INC was the largest English PC Games Cracking Group I have ever seen (and I have seen quite a few during the last 15 years). At some point 1991/1992 did they absolutely dominate the PC Warez scene and ALL major english game titles were released by INC first, crushing all competition. Okay, there might have been 1-2 slip-throughs, but that makes it statistically still ALL.

<li>Name+industry+products+web site+short blurb. Three classic business directory entries combined into a single article. Given that the "key person" of all three listings is the same person, and that the blurb describes one of the companies as "the only organization which is dedicated to the quality in education in India" (something which I'm sure that the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Higher_Education_%28India%29_abf5.html" title="Department of Higher Education (India)">Department of Higher Education</a>, the Department of School Education and Literacy, and the various education boards would strongly dispute), at the very most this article requires a complete rewrite from scratch.

<p>New company, launched yesterday. Looks like a startup with <i>hopes</i> of becoming a major competitor to the existing telecom monopoly in South Africa. Most of their services won't actually be available until next year. Google for <i><a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=neotel+&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=south+africa&amp;lr=lang_en" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=neotel+&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=south+africa&amp;lr=lang_en" rel="nofollow">neotel "south africa"</a></i> doesn't turn up much, mainly press releases (there are other Neotel's in multiple countries). At this point, they've got investors and a lot of plans. Seems to me this isn't up to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> yet, and is rather crystal-ballish as to whether it will become a major company. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 13:12, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Following the end of AT&amp;T monopoly in the US 20 years ago, Sprint and MCI were formed to compete. So were a whole bunch of other companies that failed and have been pretty much forgotten.

<li><b>Comment</b> Surely it should qualify as an entry because it is both newsworthy and because it will provide coverage of an event that is in progress? Furthermore it does offer some services that have not been rolled out to the public yet. I can completely see the logic involved that would outlaw all businesses from having an article on Wikipedia because that would be tantamount to advertising. But this business holds significant national and regional impact on both the economy and the telecommunications industry. It may not have <i>properly launched</i> yet, but a wide cross-section of the public is aware of it because of the press. <a href="../../../r/f/w/User%7ERfwoolf_6c5c.html" title="User:Rfwoolf">Rfwoolf</a> 17:15, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself. The company is already in business, however they are not yet dealing directly with the South African public (these services will be available in April 2007), currently wholesale international bandwidth is being sold to ISP's and other enterprises. Furthermore they will become the first company other that <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telkom.html" title="Telkom">Telkom</a> to offer fix-line access to companies/consumers in the South African market (a market that is currently heavily over-priced due to <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telkom.html" title="Telkom">Telkom's</a> monopoly). In addition to that this company represents the liberation of the South African telecommunications market.

<li><b>Keep</b>: The company can be considered notable primarily due to its political interest to South Africa.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I use Wikipedia regularly to either make sense of terms I don't understand, or to get some basic information about organisations / people that I have been hearing about and want a 'factual' update on. I am not aware of the various policies and guidelines referred to above, but the vast media coverage it has been garnering over the last many days prompted me to check the info on Wikipedia - and the current entry gave me a quick basic overview. I also understand that the company, being the second operator in South Africa, breaking decades of monopoly, represents a historical landmark - enough for the President of the country to comment on its launch. I think therefore, that the entry should be retained - any material discerned as 'advertising' must of course be removed. 196.207.40.213 00:25, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A Google search isn't going to give accurate numbers on this. From the citations I've collected so far, many people don't quote the first part of the phrase (instead, they finish a sentence with some variation of "PYGMIES + DWARFS!!"). Even those who attempt to quote the entire quostion usually don't do it accurately. I'm not asserting that the phrase is common, but I am asserting that your proposed search string (and the results from it), don't reveal whether the phrase is common or not. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanguinity_33b2.html" title="User:Sanguinity">Sanguinity</a> 20:31, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That which is interesting about the argument, however, isn't the argument itself -- there are plenty of equally bizarre fallacies in his guide, none of which anyone is proposing as it's own article. The noteworthy thing about this one is that it has become a generalized tagline to label nonsensical rhetoric. I don't see that getting explained properly in Pinkoski's article. In fact, this may be one of the best reasons to keep this article where it is without merging it -- neutral ground, free of the inherent POV that would come with merging it to either place. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanguinity_33b2.html" title="User:Sanguinity">Sanguinity</a> 15:53, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Already has as much as is needed? I haven't compared the Myers rev-history to the date of your comment, but what's over there right now is... nothing. Except the link to this article.</dd>
<dd>As to your question about what, in my opinion, <i>should</i> be there.... I'd throw out the statement about "criticising at length Jim Pinkoski's comic books". It was only for a relatively short period that he was having a go at Pinkoski's books, and unless you were Pinkoski, about the only thing that ultimately mattered from that go-around is the persistence of "PYGMIES + DWARFS". I'd replace the Pinkoski-sentence with a statement that: One of Myers' creationist criticisms, the satirical use of "PYGMIES + DWARFS", has become a memetic tagline used by other science and political bloggers to highlight perceived logical fallacies of (insert NPOV wording here indicating that this is typically used by the political left when talking about the political right).

<dd>Myers did criticize Pinkoski at length. He tore apart him in several posts back in Sept 05. After the <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/why_is_it_called_biblical_literalism/" class="external text" title="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/why_is_it_called_biblical_literalism/" rel="nofollow">original post</a> he set about totally ridiculing the poor bastard. Then recently he reposted the lot on the new server, with an <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/08/the_pinkoski_files.php" class="external text" title="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/08/the_pinkoski_files.php" rel="nofollow">explainer post</a>. While it mentions that his motivation was people querying about P+G, it still fails to establish greater notabilty outside of a select insular group/club (see <a href="../../../s/k/o/WP%7ESKOOL_4d0d.html" title="WP:SKOOL">WP:SKOOL</a>). Its also never referred to as an argument. Actually more appropriately, the term "PYGMIES + DWARF" logic is used. The setting behind the movement needs to be explained, or its really useless to the average reader.--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 01:17, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> Sweetest Day is one of the most notable hoaxes of the 20th and 21st Centuries. October 8, 2006 will be the 85th anniversary of the first Sweetest Day, which was staged in Cleveland by the Candy Industry on October 7th and 8th 1921. In the beginning (1921), Sweetest Day started out as simple <i>consumer manipulation</i> by the Candy Industry, wherein the 12 Confectioners who constituted <i>The Sweetest Day in the Year Committee</i> co-ordinated advertising, news stories and editorials published in <i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> newspaper in order to (A) convince Clevelanders that a new candy-buying holiday was occurring nationally and (B) that they should buy candy for everyone they loved and cared about because everyone else was doing it nationally. The manipulation of Clevelanders' candy-buying habits continued over the first few years, and by 1924 editorials were being published in <i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> informing Clevelanders that Sweetest Day had become a <i>National Institution,</i> and advertisements were calling Sweetest Day <i>National Candy Day.</i> What is perhaps most notable about <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax</i> is that the hoax is still ongoing today, being perpetrated and enhanced by companies such as <i>American Greetings,</i> <i>Hallmark,</i> and Trade Organizations such as <i>Retail Confectioners International.</i> Evidence of the continued attempted manipulation of American Consumers' candy and gift-buying habits are clearly visible in the articles posted on these companies' websites <a href="http://pressroom.americangreetings.com/archives/fall04/sweetestday04.html" class="external text" title="http://pressroom.americangreetings.com/archives/fall04/sweetestday04.html" rel="nofollow">1</a> <a href="http://pressroom.hallmark.com/sweetest_day.html" class="external text" title="http://pressroom.hallmark.com/sweetest_day.html" rel="nofollow">2</a> <a href="http://www.retailconfectioners.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=60196&amp;module_id=3418" class="external text" title="http://www.retailconfectioners.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=60196&amp;module_id=3418" rel="nofollow">3</a> with the introduction of the phony <i>Herbert Birch Kingston</i> story during the 1990's. The attempts at manipulation can also be clearly seen on the current <i>Wikipedia</i> Sweetest Day site by viewing and comparing the former edits of the Sweetest Day page. The Sweetest Day Hoax has influenced millions of Americans and is a <i>multi-billion-dollar</i> effort on the part of Industry to manipulate the buying habits of Americans over the past 85 years. Wikipedia should allow the new article, <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax,</i> to replace the <i>Sweetest Day</i> article currently posted on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a> 16:29, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a>, this article is a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a> and the whole basic premise of it is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, inference based on primary sources, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unsourced</a> conjecture. The problem is that there are multiple sources purporting a version of events and it is not the place of Wikipedia, or wikipedia editors to decide which one is "right". Wikipedia is here to report <i>what has been written elsewhere</i>. The problem with this article (beyond the fact that it should never have been created; <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information should have been left in the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetest_Day_b5ea.html" title="Sweetest Day">Sweetest Day</a> article and editorial concerns worked through on the Talk page... which is what we were doing) is that you've inferred a hoax with no concrete evidence that one exists. You have presented circumstantial evidence and while it is certainly an interesting hypothesis, there are no secondary sources presented that point to anybody else supporting your <i>hoax</i> hypothesis. If there was a body of work out there that supported this hypothesis it would be one thing, but the only source for this that I see is your own website... and the Primary source you've provided only suggests there was a <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetest_Day_b5ea.html" title="Sweetest Day">Sweetest Day</a> committee of 12 men in 1921. It in no way suggests a candy-peddling cabal out to push a day of tooth-rotting sales.</li>

<dd>The origins of this day are murky at best, with the Kingston 1920's version being widely promoted as the "official" version (and I daresay the popularly accepted version).

<li><b>Comment</b> It took less than 2 hours at my local library to find all the information and photos contained in this article. <i>Hallmark</i> has been selling Sweetest Day cards for <i>half a century,</i> and only recently started using the premise of the Herbert Birch Kingston story. <i>American Greetings</i> (which has been located in Cleveland for the past 100 years), like Hallmark, has never reported <i>any</i> of this information about the origins of Sweetest Day. The Herbert Birch Kingston story has <i>zero</i> primary source references. <i>Zero.</i> A Google search for Sweetest Day returns <i>half a million</i> results. A Google search for Herbert Birch Kingston returns 254,000 results. A Google <i>image search</i>, however, returns <i>zero</i> results for Herbert Birch Kingston.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The salient questions <i>here</i> are:
<ol>
<li>Is Wikipedia really okay with you deciding that, even though it is <i>debated</i> in the real world which of the stories of the origin of "Sweetest Day" is accurate, <i>you</i> will choose for one of those stories to be presented on Wikipedia as "the truth"? (Hint: read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.)</li>
<li>Is Wikipedia really okay with you deciding that, if other editors will <i>not</i> let you present the side of the debate that you favor as the "truth" of the matter, you will start a <i>different</i> article that basically exists just to let you assert as "the truth" what you were not allowed to assert as truth at <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetest_Day_b5ea.html" title="Sweetest Day">Sweetest Day</a>? (Hint: read <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>By the way, I'd like to point out that you're not only violating the above policies, but <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">Wikipedia:Avoid self-references</a> as well. "The attempts at manipulation can also be clearly seen on the current Wikipedia Sweetest Day site by viewing and comparing the former edits of the Sweetest Day page." Aside from all the other policy violations this assertion represents, there's no reason why it should be assumed that the "current" Wikipedia Sweetest Day article will be "current" when the reader reads it, or that Wikipedia will indeed be relevant and of interest to the reader (since it may not be Wikipedia they're reading it on.) -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:06, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>So if I started going off on a complete tangent about, say, clowns and seaweed and red balloons, would you say that my tangent cannot be removed without making the discussion invalid? No? Then we are agreed that irrelevant comments can be removed without invalidating the discussion, and what we disagree on is whether the comments that Recury removed are relevant or irrelevant. Obviously you think they are relevant, or you would not have made them, but all I saw was you arguing <i>yet again</i> that your position on the origin of Sweetest Day trumps what everyone else has to say -- and even if that was <i>true</i>, it would still not be relevant to the question we are discussing <i>here</i>, which is what we should do with almost a textbook case of POV forking. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:18, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why did the textbook POV fork occur?

<li>My <i>sourced</i> arguments have now been removed from this discussion <b>3 times</b> by Recury and Antaeus Feldspar. <i>Transfinite</i> has also removed <i>sourced</i> information regarding the first Sweetest Day (October 8, 1921) posted on the 1921 event page.

<p>&lt;&lt;Discussion&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Do not remove or modify other people's comments even if you believe them to be in bad faith (unless the user has been banned from editing the relevant pages or is making a blatantly offensive personal attack). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> The actions of Recury and Antaeus Feldspar on this discussion page constitute the exact type of deletion/editing of <i>sourced</i> material which caused the POV fork on the <i>Sweetest Day</i> article in the first place. Deletion of <i>sourced</i> material on a discussion page or in a Wikipedia article should be frowned upon and discouraged. The only just solution in this dispute is to allow <b>both</b> pages, <i>Sweetest Day</i> and <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax</i> to remain on Wikipedia. After all, Wikipedia is not paper, so why not allow both articles to co-exist in peace. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a> 09:57, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a>, what this all boils down to is that you feel your sourced material is superior or "more correct" than the more numerous sources that do not agree with your assertions because your source is the older, or perhaps more "primary" source. That simply is not how it works at Wikipedia. If there are 20 sources that say "Apples are Green" and one older source that says "Apples are Red", then the article on <b>Apples</b> needs to present both pieces of information <i>without making a judgement which is the correct color of apples</i>. We also don't write a <b>Green Apples</b> and <b>Red Apples</b> article just because those supporting <b>Red Apples</b> don't like the way <b>Green Apples</b> are portrayed in the <b>Apples</b> article. The only solution is for this article to be deleted and for a <i>discussion</i> to start at <a href="../../../s/w/e/Talk%7ESweetest_Day_d377.html" title="Talk:Sweetest Day">Talk:Sweetest Day</a> about what is the appropriate and factual amount of information to be included from <i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> along with the "Kingston" version and Leigh Eric Schmidt's version. Right now, much of The Sweetest Day Hoax is assumptions, conjecture, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> that is better suited to your own personal website than a Wikipedia article. I'm willing to discuss the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetest_Day_b5ea.html" title="Sweetest Day">Sweetest Day</a> article content, but Wikipedia is a collaborative effort, so <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORKing</a> is never the answer to a content dispute.

<p><b>Response</b> Personally I like yellow apples: the skin on red apples is often too tough and green apples are too tart. Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia: &lt;&lt;This means that there is no practical limit to the number of topics we can cover other than verifiability and the other points presented on this page. There is a kind of feasible limit for individual article sizes that depends on page download size for our dial-up readers and readability considerations for everybody (see Wikipedia:Article size). After a point, splitting an article into separate articles and leaving adequate summaries is a natural part of growth for a topic (see Wikipedia:Summary style). Some topics are covered by print encyclopedias only in short, static articles, and since Wikipedia requires no paper we can give more thorough treatments, include many more relevant links, be more timely, etc. This also means you don't have to redirect one topic to a partially equivalent topic that is of more common usage. A "See also" section stating that further information on the topic is available on the page of a closely related topic may be preferable.&gt;&gt; Why does anyone have a problem with both articles co-existing on Wikipedia?

<p><b>Response</b> Hoaxes often involve <i>suppression and management of information,</i> which is exactly what was happening with the edits on the original <i>Sweetest Day</i> page resulting in the POV fork. Although all information posted in <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax</i> article is readily available at many Public Libraries, none of it has ever been published before to help make people aware of the methods used by advertisers and the Candy Industry to engineer the beginnings of Sweetest Day. The relentless deletions and re-wordings on the original Sweetest Day article constitute just such <i>information suppression and management.</i> There can be little doubt that Industry will continue their efforts at insidious deception and information management on <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax</i> page just as they have on the <i>Sweetest Day</i> page.

I've said this multiple times, but I will say it once more: you are drawing conclusions from the newspapter article that are not explicitly stated in those articles you've used as sources. The fact that none of the information you've cited has ever been used by anyone writing a piece using these primary sources as the basis for an article advancing the idea that Sweetest Day is a hoax started in 1921 <i>makes this whole contention a text-book case of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a></i> and thus not suitible for a Wikipedia ariticle. Furthermore, you are requesting protection for an article under the assumption that at some point someone is going to come along and engage in, as you've called it, <i>information suppression and management</i> when this has never happened in the article. Pages don't get protected against the assumption that at some point someone may edit them; that is the whole point of Wikipedia. You've created an article and now anyone can come alone and edit it provided they cite sources. Please read <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. Articles don't even get protected against the assumption that they may be <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">vandalised</a>. Protection is only used if and when it has been demonstrated that an article is being repeatedly vandalised and protection is the only way to stop that vandalism. Since the only edits to this article have been by you (other than me nominating it for deletion and <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">User:Dismas</a> doing minor wikification) there is no reason to protect this.

<p><b>Response</b> &lt;&lt;The fact that none of the information you've cited has ever been used by anyone writing a piece&gt;&gt;The October 15, 2005 article from <i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> which states that "Dozens of Cleveland's top candy makers concocted the [Sweetest Day] promotion 84 years ago" has been edited out of this discussion <b>3 times.</b> So let's put it back in again right here:</p>
<p>Idea behind Sweetest Day was to push candy, not love Saturday, October 15, 2005 Bill Lubinger Plain Dealer Reporter - Today will be sprinkled with cards and flowers, dinner dates and sex toys. - Except Sweetest Day wasn't supposed to be a day for lovers, but a day for lovers of sweets. - Dozens of Cleveland's top candy makers concocted the promotion 84 years ago and it stuck, although it never became as widely accepted as hoped. - "Sweetest Day is extremely regional," said Van Billington, spokesman for Retail Confectioners International. "It basically follows a path from Detroit to Buffalo." - The candy men of Cleveland proclaimed an annual "Sweetest Day of the Year" as a touching way to spread happiness -- not just for family and friends, but orphans and newsboys, too. - What better way to give 'em some sugar than with -- big shock -- candy, "because it has an appeal for everybody, rich and poor, old or young." - Chocolatiers delivered thousands of candy boxes to the needy. To the rest, they sold their product with outlandish claims. - In a special four-page Sweetest Day spread in The Cleveland Plain Dealer on Oct. 8, 1921, they pitched the benefits of confectionery delights. - They promoted everything from almond creams to fruit-centered milk chocolates, as if touting seaweed extract and fish oil. - "Scientists Say Man Can Walk Mile on Power Furnished by One Ordinary Caramel," reads one of the headlines. And did you know, the manufacturers fudged, that animals love candy, too. "Furthermore, most authorities agree that it is good for them." - Horses and dogs are especially keen on chocolate-covered varieties, they insisted. (No mention that chocolate can be toxic to a dog - even chocolate Labs.) - Candy makers wisely used the event to dispel popular myths that apparently hurt sales: Glucose doesn't contain glue, they informed readers, and the product isn't made from horses' hooves or coal tar. - Maybe they got one fact right, though. - "We are known as the greatest nation of candy eaters," the masters of marzipan bellowed proudly in print. "It has been said that all the rest of the world combined eats less candy than we do." - How sweet. - News Research Director Patti Graziano and and Deputy News Research Director Mary Ann Cofta contributed to this story. - To reach this Plain Dealer reporter: - blubinger@plaind.com, 216-999-5531</p>
<p><i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer,</i> being the <i>instrument</i> by which Sweetest Day was foisted upon Cleveland by the Candy Industry, is the <b>ultimate</b> source on Sweetest Day.

<p><b>Response</b> Right Feldspar. Just like Sweetest Day was founded by candy store employee Herbert Birch Kingston and his small group of friends doing good deeds for the forgotten. It's all in the wording and context, isn't it. There are two distinct points of view about Sweetest Day in our society: one held by those making profit from the event that it is a legitimate holiday, and one held by others that Sweetest Day is a made-up <i>Hallmark Holiday.</i> These two points of view cannot co-exist within the same article without one being cancelled out, because one is true and the other false. The truth does not attack a lie; it simply replaces it. Wikipedia is not paper. Both points of view should be allowed on Wikipedia until one just <i>disappears.</i> <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a> 17:30, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, Miracleimpulse. Both points of view should be allowed on Wikipedia, if they are both significant points of view.

<li>No, there is no equality between your scurrilous innuendo and the comments I made earlier today.

As for your "deceptive weasely motorist", I would not say that the motorist in my example was deceptive or weasely -- he <i>honestly</i> thinks that it is all right for him to violate the speed limit, if someone else did something they should not have which "forces" him to speed to make up for it.

<p><b>Conclusion</b> Until I began editing the <i>Sweetest Day</i> article on Wikipedia, the article was a basic copy (nearly word-for-word) of the Industry Spin used to sell this holiday on countless websites across the internet. Once I began posting actual facts and photos about the subject, editors appeared out of nowhere to contradict, alter and delete what has turned out to be <i>primary sourced information and photos.</i> To date, the <i>only</i> source referenced on the Sweetest Day page is <i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> and that reference is to the information I posted which remains on the site. To my knowledge, <i>American Greetings, Hallmark,</i> and <i>Retail Confectioners International</i> have <b>never</b> been listed even as secondary sources on the Sweetest Day page. Lacking any type of primary source reference <i>whatsoever,</i> it can only be concluded that the Herbert Birch Kingston story of the origins of Sweetest Day is a cleverly crafted industry-generated <b>hoax,</b> the purpose of which is <i>mass deception</i> about the true origins of Sweetest Day in order to increase sales of candy, greeting cards and other <i>Sweetest Day-related products.</i> This being the case, the Wikipedia article entitled <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax</i> is indeed a distinct <i>new</i> topic on Wikipedia which will provide accurate and <i>sourced</i> information on the real origins of Sweetest Day to Wikipedia readers for years to come. I would like to thank Wikipedia for the opportunity to post this information on their site and offer a word of caution: that Wikipedia can be and has been used by industry to promote disinformation about topics such as <i>Sweetest Day.</i> I also look forward to working with other interested Wikipedians to present all new information which comes to light regarding <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax.</i></p>
<p>Thank you again and best regards,</p>

<dd>"it can only be concluded that ..." Once again, incorrect. Someone who looks at the evidence <i>might</i> indeed conclude that the official story of Sweetest Day is an industry-concocted hoax. But then again, they might not. It is neither your duty nor your right to try and step in and <i>declare</i> which they will do -- declare your own view "the truth" and everything else falsehood. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:02, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>Antaeus has it exactly right. This conclusion is yet more unsourced conjecture and misrepresentation of the facts (for instance, <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetest_Day_b5ea.html" title="Sweetest Day">Sweetest Day</a> draws on many sources listed in the External links section, they are not listed in the "Sources" section because it would be redundant to do so. At this point I'm tired of reiterating the same points over and over and too many editors have spent too much time on this discussion. Bottom line, this is a clear <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a> and should be dealt with as such.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 03:38, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "All" meaning 1 newspaper article (that is a primary source) and "industry-generated hoax" being your interpretation of what was written in said article... you are filling in the blanks here with your own views and interpretations and that goes against <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

<p><b>Response</b> Incorrect, Isotope23. <b>All</b> means <b>All.</b> You are assuming that all primary source information has been posted, and it definitely has <b>not.</b> <i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> provides a treasure trove of <i>primary source information</i> on the origins of Sweetest Day beginning in 1921. <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax</i> article can and will be expanded exponentially using these sources. As is stated on the first edit summary, <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax</i> article is a work in progress (like all Wikipedia articles). Also, you are overlooking the US Census documents which have been posted that are <i>primary sources</i> of information. Meanwhile, the Herbert Birch Kingston story on the original Sweetest Day page (and all the other countless places it appears on the internet) remains unsourced in any way, primary or secondary. As a matter of fact, it seems like all editing on the original Sweetest Day page has stopped at a rather pathetic stage. What's up with that? <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a> 19:10, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> well, by all means... if you have "primary source information" that has not been posted here or in the article yet, that specifically proves this day was a hoax created by the 12 individuals you feel are responsible for it <i>and</i> refers to them as "founders" of Sweetest Day, then what are you waiting for? I for one welcome you to produce this evidence if it exists so I can stop wasting my time here... As for the census data, I'd already seen all that during the original AfD of <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetest_Day_b5ea.html" title="Sweetest Day">Sweetest Day</a> and I'm at a loss to see what you think that proves. It shows that he exists, that he resided in Cleveland, that he worked in advertising, and at some point he apparently owned a confectionery shop. How is that at odds with the popular mythology of "Herbert Birch Kingston, a philanthropist and candy company employee..." Candy companies employ advertisers. Anyone can be a philanthropist. The census data <i>proves nothing either way</i>... other than his exsitence, residence, and employment. As for sourcing, the current article is sourced by primary and secondary sources. I'm tired of explaining this... so I'll leave it at that. If you have problems with sourcing of information on other websites, I suggest you contact them. The original <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetest_Day_b5ea.html" title="Sweetest Day">Sweetest Day</a> page has stopped because it is finally to a point where it contains only information that is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>. You may think it pathetic, but IMO this is probably the best version of this page that has ever existed at this namespace... though it would be improved by Leigh Eric Schmidt's version of Sweetest Day from his book.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:04, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The point is not moot, so long as others try to use the lack of English material to disprove notability in this, or any other, AfD. My point applies equally to google as well as other online resources such as Amazon or whatever. For articles with the name in native form in the article, I don't think that any special knowledge of Japanese (or Arabic, or Chinese) is necessary to copy/paste it into google to get a more accurate representation. Whether or not the numbers mean anything is another matter.

<li><b>Keep</b> - To my mind, this is exactly the kind of thing that someone could come to Wikipedia looking for. There is no format violation to speak of as far as I can tell but if someone was to put forward a reasonable merge candidate, I'd look at it. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 22:22, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> — I'm very concerned about the process this has undergone. Firstly the article was "speedy" deleted by <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">User:Friday</a> without discussion, warning, or listing here. By the rationale given for the above nomination, and the discussion on <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html#Deleted_page" title="User talk:Friday">User talk:Friday#Deleted page</a>, this administrator seems to feel that any "list of..." pages are eligible for speedy deletion. Even just narrowing the objection to "list of X organisations" there's a whole category (<a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_organizations_2c4a.html" title="Category:Lists of organizations">Category:Lists of organizations</a>) that would have to be deleted, including such articles as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Kurdish_organisations_ea30.html" title="List of Kurdish organisations">List of Kurdish organisations</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_veterans%27_organizations.html" title="List of veterans' organizations">List of veterans' organizations</a>, etc. etc. I'm also concerned that Friday suggests there was a consensus for the speedy delete, and that "saying you want to follow a democratic process is, well, quite at odds with how things work here. Afd is not a democracy" (see user talk page). <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 23:23, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not sure why you'd say it was deleted without discussion.

I'm also not sure why you're continuing to go on about "process"- since there was a disagreement, I undeleted and brought this to Afd. Is that not exactly what you wanted? Can we use this Afd to talk about the merits of the article and whether or not it should be deleted rather than talking about process? <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 23:39, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm "continuing to go on about 'process'" precisely because you don't understand why it's important, and because you say things like "Not sure why you'd say it was deleted without discussion." For an administrator to believe that a speedy deletion consitutes discussion and consensus is very worrying.

<dd>I've now removed all the weblinks, support organisations, and associated dreck, and turned it into a standard list of links to other articles. There should be no excuse for deletiong this now. Trying to delete this on the basis that the "support groups" page was utterly disingenuous - while the other list was full of non-notable grounds with no public profile (and no intention of getting one), many of the groups on this list are well-known and very much deserving of individual articles. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 04:19, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I do not agree with the statement that the list's purpose could be fulfilled by a prospective category. There are uncountably many instances on Wikipedia where there exist both a list and a category about the exact same subject. I find the list useful and encyclopedic in its current state, I think that it should be maintained and improved, and that it will naturally transform from a list of external links into a list of Wikipedia articles as these organizations get to have their own articles. You should realize that not every single noteworthy organization has an article on Wikipedia yet, and this list also serves the purpose of keeping track of these related organizations until they might be covered by an article and put into a category. I urge you to also check the guideline of direct relation to this discussion: <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes_edc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes">Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes</a>.

<li><b>Keep.</b> I like how this list and the "support organization" list distinguish between service and advocacy. certainly over time, some of these groups will stand the test of time and have pages in their own right and some will not, but this list has the same red to blue ration I see in many political and geographic articles. <a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScarykitty_2934.html" title="User:Scarykitty">Scarykitty</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a directory or a repository for links. Additionally, the insane number or redlinks make this a pretty useless list. The main article namespace is not the appropriate place to make a list of articles that one believes should be created. If someone wants that kind of list, they're free to make it within their userspace. While redlinks are sometimes acceptible in lists for the sake of completeness, this list is almost nothing <i>but</i> redlinks.

If the organisations are not worthy of articles, they're not worthy of noting in a list.

<li>Nick, I would be surprised if you could provide any evidence of your accusations that Tilman is "promoting himself to be someone who is is not <sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]</sup>". In fact, I would be highly surprised if you could provide evidence that Tilman is promoting himself at all. This is in stark contrast to Johnny Lee Clary, who if I'm not mistaken created the original article on himself and (quite <b>obviously</b>) has been the recipient of heavy promotional efforts since. Johnny Lee Clary is not the first aggressive self-promoter we've dealt with. He isn't the first to try and <i>demand</i> his own article that reads like a press release; he isn't the first to interfere with the AfD on his article by erasing other people's words, and he surely wouldn't be the first self-promoter on Wikipedia to exaggerate modest indicators of notability and describe them as if they were proof (i.e., to use a notable example that I'm sure sticks in many Wikipedians' minds, "featured in the New York Times" turning out to mean "mentioned as an example in a single New York Times op-ed piece".) Clary may choose to make paranoid allegations about neo-Nazis on Wikipedia trying to oppress him (and you've chosen to go along with him) but in reality he has himself to blame. When Clary has shows that he has no moral scruples against making vicious, slanderous accusations against people who disagree with him,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Johnny_Lee_Clary&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51223316" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Johnny_Lee_Clary&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51223316" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> and shows that he has no moral scruples against tampering with a discussion to try and force it to come out his way,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FJohnny_Lee_Clary&amp;diff=51325502&amp;oldid=51298010" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FJohnny_Lee_Clary&amp;diff=51325502&amp;oldid=51298010" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> no one is going to take vague claims like 'he appeared on <i>Oprah</i>, at some point, and on <i>Donahue</i>, at some point, and that's proof that he's notable' at face value. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:11, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am sure that this nomination will be hotly contested, so I will explain my reasons carefully. Most of the article at present is either <b>OR</b> or unverifiable. I recently edited it to remove all this OR/unverifiable material, after which it looked like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bogan&amp;oldid=73137075" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bogan&amp;oldid=73137075" rel="nofollow">this</a>. The remnants of the article were basically a dicdef. In short, I think the only thing that an article about 'bogan' can be is a definition of the usage of the word, encompassing its etymology and the full extent of its usage, to be sure – but this is what an entry in a major dictionary looks like. In short, this is one for the Wiktionary and not for Wikipedia. I am of course open to persuasion on these points. <span style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none"><a href="../../../m/g/e/User%7EMgekelly_7b5b.html" title="User:Mgekelly">mg</a></span><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/g/e/User_talk%7EMgekelly_f99d.html" title="User talk:Mgekelly">kelly</a> 14:55, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Neutral</b> Neologism. There is quite a bit of stuff written on the subject, which is quite surprising for an article on a word. I personally don't know its notability in Australia and New Zealand, but it links to quite a bit of things on Wikipedia (nearly 100). However, according to <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, we try to avoid writing articles on neologisms because <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. This could be a candidate for a move to Wikitionary, but I think apparently that it's notable enough for Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="color:red"><b>Nish</b></span><span style="color:blue"><b>kid</b></span><span style="color:green"><b>64</b></span></a> 15:10, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The amount contained in the article isn't a good guideline. Articles on pejorative stereotypes are original research magnets, that, unless given attention, just grow and grow as editors add their favourite personal novel contributions to the stereotype. It's exceptionally tempting for people to add their own personal views of what the stereotype is to such articles, or to use it to make sly (and not so sly) digs at their friends and enemies. Editors regularly have to throw out such additions to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">chav</a>, for example, insisting upon sources. This article has not had the same attention paid to it, and cites no sources at all. How do we know that bogans are "prone to the use of marijuana", for example? How do we know that that wasn't simply made up by some editor who wanted to use Wikipedia insult their marijuana-using friend? The place to look to see whether there is a lot of stuff written on the subject is <i>outside</i> of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:02, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>But if you actually check out those 100 linking-to articles you'll find many are talk pages, are other class-based pejorative stereotypes like <a href="../../../r/i/f/Riff_Raff_a1d4.html" title="Riff Raff">Riff Raff</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redneck.html" title="Redneck">Redneck</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_trash.html" title="White trash">White trash</a>, and for some reason several characters of soap opera <i><a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighbours.html" title="Neighbours">Neighbours</a></i>, like <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindi_Watts_19b3.html" title="Sindi Watts">Sindi Watts</a>, have bio articles that use the term. Article <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Comedy_Company_41d4.html" title="The Comedy Company">The Comedy Company</a></i> describes how the word became popular. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 23:39, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Bogan is a term used very frequently in Australia, esp in the Southern parts like Melbourne and Adelaide. Just as much as America has head bangers and the UK has Punks Aussies have Bogans. <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotters_house_0b0e.html" title="User:Potters house">Potters house</a> 16:28, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, not a dictionary. Whether a word is in use isn't a relevant argument here. That's an argument for Wiktionary. The question to answer for Wikipedia, which you haven't addressed, is whether there is scope for an encyclopaedia article about the stereotype that the word denotes. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:02, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Bogan culture in Australia is unique and has been often mocked on comedy TV show etc. It is the mullet culture, and are basically the opposite to surfies. In Northern Parts of Australia they are called "Westies." Skeg is another term often used, and is equivilent to a surfie. For cultural trends bogans are described in a hit sone "No body likes a Bogan." How people in nothern Australai don't know what a bogan is and thus don't really get the song. But when I explain the "Westie" connection they understand compleatly. Perhaps the "Westie" could also be incorporated. Terms like "bogan mobile" refering to certain old trashy holden cars, a bogan hair cut - similar to the Mullet, these are cultural terms and shoud be revealed for wikipedians. <a href="../../../p/o/t/User%7EPotters_house_0b0e.html" title="User:Potters house">Potters house</a> 23:27, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> as the culture described is certainly notable in Australia (the word itself is a neologism, but it describes a cultural phenomenon, much like "goth" or "emo" IMO).

<li>If we're looking for scholarly articles, Melissa Campbell, an academic at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Melbourne_c667.html" title="University of Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a> has written a thesis and other articles, and given talks, on bogan culture. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 10:28, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

Campbell appears to be a graduate student, therefore only an 'academic' in a rather broad sense.

<li>I don't wish to inflate Ms Campbell's academic credentials at all, but that reference that she was a grad student is from 2002. I believe subsequently she was a staff researcher for the Cultural Studies Dept, possibly not "academic" enough for some people's definition. Also, I was not intending to cite Campbell's MA thesis as a source, more to check her bibliography for these elusive "reliable sources", which I will do tonight. Should provide more info than an abstract and a couple of web links. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 05:03, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - completely agree with Uncle G, this article is a magnet for editors to try and shoehorn in any old descriptions of people they don't like, or describe any tacky or trashy behavior. I keep trying to take out the long list of unverified exmaples, but any such deletions are regularly reverted. I was even called a vandal for deleting various things, even though each individual deletion was small and had a clear description to each edit. But maybe the only solution is indeed to move the entire thing to Wiktionary. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 23:05, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> it seems to me that no-one in this 'discussion' has managed to assert how this article can be more than a dicdef, which was my original reason for nominating the article. My use of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> was merely to point out that most of the article is at present OR, and that that's all that pads it beyond a dicdef. Even the assertion of fictional characters as bogans is largely unverifiable, except in a couple of seminal cases where the word 'bogan' was specifically used.

<li><b>Comment</b> agree with Mgekelly comment. No one wanting to keep the page seems to be coming up with any external references, which is what will save the page and its content. Deciding that Michelle and Ferrett (or any of these other fictional characters) are bogans is original research unless an external source can verify that they <i>are</i> bogans. (Personally I thought that Michelle and Ferrett were intended to represent anachronistic <a href="../../../m/o/d/Mod_Revival_6bd0.html" title="Mod Revival">Mod Revival</a> types with Michelle's platinum bob, black lipstick/white foundation combo and tight connie jacket and miniskirt - they are not like bogans at all.) It might be true that there are oddly dressed people around, and there are some commonly seen fashion trends visible, but for a Wikipedia editor to decide that these people are bogans or that a fashion look is that of a bogan is original research if there are no external references that designate the said people or fashion trend as that of a bogan. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 08:04, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

Point taken re: Michelle and Ferret, and I agree this is a large problem with the article - that much of its content is subjective categorisation. I'd be interested to know what people think of Melissa Campbell's (see above discussion) work or opinions on the matter (and she does by the way, class Michelle and Ferret as bogans <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/07/15/1026185158244.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/07/15/1026185158244.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>).

<li><b>Stong Keep</b>. I can't believe this is up for VfD, this is the Australian equivalent of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redneck.html" title="Redneck">Redneck</a> (which also doesn't cite any of its sources by the way, for the stereotype list or anything else) and a valid article for the exact same reasons (unless you think Redneck can't be more than a dicdef). Some sections, such as "Contemporary Evolution", could do with massive cleanup or complete removal, and it could probably be better structured, but calling for its deletion is absurd. The current citation-needed spam is also pedantic beyond belief for an article of this type; things like the stereotype of bogans being "Culturally blue-collar" is not remotely contentious to anyone even familiar with the term. I found <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/perhaps-theres-a-little-bogan-in-everyone/2006/06/07/1149359814143.html" class="external text" title="http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/perhaps-theres-a-little-bogan-in-everyone/2006/06/07/1149359814143.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> within 20 seconds of searching. Others will probably be more difficult to cite directly due to the nature of the phenomenon we're covering here, but the principle is the same.

<li><b>Keep</b> for now. This is an interesting case because at least part of this article is sourced from what I can see, though it could be seen as redundant with individual articles on saints and iconography, but I can see the benefit of having some of this information centralized so one doesn't have to go around and find individual articles; it's hard to know there is any sort of historical controversy about <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Veronica_9c8c.html" title="Saint Veronica">Saint Veronica</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigid_of_Kildare_4328.html" title="Brigid of Kildare">Brigid of Kildare</a>, or others since there doesn't appear to be a category for this.

<dd>Look at the articles on individual saints. Original publication of research for a specific PoV in one place is not what Wikipedia is for. The lead of this article and the assumption that these people are mythical paints the article into a PoV box. I am not of the opinion that AfD is nuclear.

I still don't see what you are asserting is OR... just becuase this doesn't agree with the articles on the individual saints doesn't mean it is OR; most of the assertions are not OR but are in fact based on externally written sources. The article just needs to be better sourced. As for PoV, there is nothing PoV about the lead in of this article. It states that "The historicity of several saints has often been treated skeptically by most academics..." and this is a true statement... there are many academics who question the historicity of Christian figures. Whether you agree with the contention or not doesn't change the fact that there is a significant body of work out there that explores the connection between mythological figures and traditional Christian figures. As long as the article doesn't "pick sides", IMO this is fine. I don't think this is painted into a POV box (and POV isn't a deletion reason anyway)... If there are NPOV concerns with the title than a <b>Move</b> is in order and should be discussed. If there is wording that is POV, then edits should be made. With a move, some editing, and some better sourcing, this could be a decent article.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:24, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b> Claims of this type have certainly been widely made. Much better sourcing is needed. If I recall correctly, about 25 years ago the Roman Catholic church deemphasized (or something stronger) a batch of saints whose historicity couldn't be adequately proven. Not that this behaviour was unique to Christianity - almost everywhere the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman.html" title="Roman">Romans</a> went they merged local dieties with the Roman pantheon. The article needs better sourcing and, if anyone can find a reliable source balancing these claims that way, or some other way, then it should go in also. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:48, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. I don't doubt the veracity, just the importance. It is an interesting slice of history but only asserts minimal and local importance.

<dd>Photo of Captain PJ (aka Paul Moss), taken by employeee on my camera and my film, processing paid for my me! and uploaded by Kiwi Musician. Captain PJ's Disco was the name of a musical group entertainment business, based in the Waikato, New Zealand from 1970 to 1981. Programmes was the name of the light-show operated in conjunction with the disco, and live bands. The company name was Grafix Programmes Limited. The disco operation started out operating under the name Spectra Studios. The photo was designed and commissioned by the company, and created by a contracted disc jockey. The copyright was owned by the company, until dissolution in 1983, and the original company owner and managing director, Paul Moss, has released the image to wikipedia, for free use. The business was widely advertised for many years in the local newspaper The Waikato Times for this business, and is verifiable at any library holding copies. The business belonged to the managing director of the company, and still exists in all the records of the period, the Telecom_New_Zealand phone books, newspapers, entertainment diaries. The image has been published since 2001 at nzreward. More info about Paul Moss can be found at User:Paul_Moss and User:Mozasaur. Further verification has been published at Paul Moss CV for 6 years, last update Dec 2004. all content moved here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Paul_Moss/Captain_PJs_Disco" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Paul_Moss/Captain_PJs_Disco" rel="nofollow">Captain_PJs_Disco</a> I think its called wikifying/userfying/jibbajabba.<a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 14:02, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Those results are more qualified. The question would seem to be what constitutes a well-known television show. A central character in a nationally syndicated American adaption of a nationally syndicated Austrailian reality show would seem to qualify for documentation. It isn't as if this is cable access we are discussing.

<dd><b>Comment</b> It would actually be more akin to keeping every actor who appeared on a nationally syndicated major network reality tv show (a very, very small set of people). I think you should provide more clarification as to what does and does not constitute a sufficiently famous reality television show character. The appearance of YouTube.com and other emerging on-demand media distribution techniques will most certainly make this an increasingly relevant question. <a href="../../../e/a/n/User_talk%7EEanschuessler_22fd.html" title="User talk:Eanschuessler">Ean Schuessler</a> 17:17, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> what distinguishes this from the thousands of other newsgroups in the rec.* hierarchy? Many Usenet groups have a long history, many have illustrious contributors, but even then most are essentially just a lot of people shooting the breeze. I don't see any compelling case to have articles on Usenet groups, much as I would love to document the fascinating goings-on at uk.rec.sheds. The sources, such as they are, are almost exclusively self-referential. Even though many of the groups have more contributors over their history than the average web forum, the number of active contributors at any one time is often small. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 16:22, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wikipedia already has an article for <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantilism.html" title="Infantilism">infantilism</a>. This article appears to be a vanity page for one or more people who identify with this type of paraphilia.

<dd><b>Response</b> How many of these results are actually relevant to the topic? As the article stands, it's just a spin-off of infantilism. It would be like having two seperate articles for both "straight" and "heterosexual." At best, I would propose that we delete this article and have "sissy baby" redirect to infantilism. If not, then the article needs to be trunceted down to a simple paragraph explaining what a "sissy baby" is and instead merge it with infantilism. Grendel 17:58, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If an encyclopedic treatment of such a character causes the article on the work itself to become long, then that character can be given a separate article."

<dd>Having just taken a quick look at all of these, I would say this: Spock has become part of the broader culture, and the article makes this point. I would definitely keep that. (Maybe in 10 years the same will properly be said of the nominees for deletion.) The article on Danny Tanner is a (somewhat) compelling analysis of the character--not just a summary of his actions on the show--so I would keep that. The Bartlet article is also a (somewhat) compelling portrayal--and, as the actions of Bartlet invite comparisons with real life, the article could potentially be expanded. Valerii and Brass--I would argue those do need to be deleted, as they are not compelling, nor do I see any potential for them to be expanded. Those articles are just a description of the characters' doings--like the present nominees for deletion. A description of the characters themselves could be summed up in 2 sentences, and are. So I would insert those 2 sentences into the main articles for the TV shows, and delete the rest. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:50, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Articles on episodes of television series, or fictional characters in movies are more likely to be labeled fancruft if they are primarily summaries, biographies of made-up people, or collections of trivia that relate to the continuity of a series rather than its critical or social reception."

<li>From the nominator.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>First,</b> I admit that in my nomination I didn't present my argument for deletion as thoroughly as I should have. This is because I truly thought the deletion should not be controversial (despite some here who shamefully assumed bad faith). So let me just re-emphasize the main point in favor of deletion that has come out in discussion: The articles are summaries of the characters' exploits--i.e. <b>plot summaries</b> (except for 2 lines at the beginning which should be merged into the main article). Therefore the articles:
<dl>
<dd>(1) violate <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> because plot summaries don't assert notability of the characters,</dd>
<dd>(2) violate <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> because of the 100 year test: "In 100 years time will anyone without a direct connection to the individual find the article useful?", and</dd>
<dd>(3) violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information</a>, which says: "Plot summaries - Wikipedia articles should not act solely as a summary of the plot of a work of fiction, but should offer comprehensive, summarised plots in conjunction with sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance within the article, or as part of a series of articles per Wikipedia:Article series."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Therefore these articles aren't encyclopedic treatments of the characters. So the articles also fail to satisfy <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>--"If an encyclopedic treatment of such a character causes the article on the work itself to become long, then that character can be given a separate article."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Second,</b> there is no available source for "analysis, ...details on...achievement[], impact, or historical significance" per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information</a>, so there is no potential for the articles to be re-written or expanded to an encyclopedic treatment. This is why deletion, not tags, is appropriate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Third,</b> on fancruft: Even though these articles are obviously fancruft, that's not a good reason for them to be deleted. But the fact that these articles have a fan base is a diagnosis of the reason why, despite their lack of encyclopedic content, these articles can be found on WP.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Fourth,</b> it is obvious that I've touched a nerve with some fans of Stargate. I understand what it must be like to have articles you've worked on very hard, and for a very long time, to be considered for deletion. I am truly sorry for that. But the fact remains that WP is not a place for fans of X to collect indiscriminate information about X. There are <i>plenty</i> of other places on the Internet for fanclubs.</dd>

<dd>(1) As in "Fourth...", above, I apologize to anyone I offended. It was a good faith nom, I thought this material unencyclopedic, and I stand by that. (2) I repeat my contention that summaries of characters' exploits are <b>plot summaries</b> which do not assert notability. (3) The fact that there are millions of fans of the show certainly explains why there is so much interest in putting and keeping this material on WP, and the fact that there are millions of fans justifies the article on Stargate Atlantis. But it doesn't justify the lengthy plot summaries whose deletion I am requesting, see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information</a>, no. 7. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 00:05, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Per this definition, I think the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Star_Trek_Encyclopedia_7742.html" title="The Star Trek Encyclopedia">The Star Trek Encyclopedia</a> is an encyclopedia as are the entries it contains. And if they're encyclopedic in that context, then I think they're encyclopedic in the context of Wikipedia, which I see as an encyclopedia for <i>every</i> niche.

<dd>Also, assume, for the moment, that your nomination for deletion succeeded and Stargate: Altantis only had one article. It'd then be expanded to such a point whereby editors would have little choice but to split it up into multiple articles. Soon, those articles would expand, and those articles, and so on and so forth, until you have what you have today.

<dd>I just think this nomination is funny. Out of about 25 voters, the nominator is the only one who thinks this is fancruft. Many of the voters have argued at length about why the nominator is wrong. Never before have I seen a AFD with such overwhelming resistance to the deletion. Usualy, even if there is consensus to keep there are at least one or two people who agree with the nominator. Here there is unanamous consensus. I'm just think that's kind of funny. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyk777_9e17.html" title="User:Tobyk777">Tobyk777</a> 06:37, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To show you how clueless I really am, I'll say this: Even if I had heard of the Snowball Clause, I still would have made the nomination, b/c I didn't think it would even be controversial, and I certainly had no idea I would be 1 against 1 million. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 13:13, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the laugh, 207.234.147.96 (I mean that). As to the serious point you are making, narratives of the exploits of WWII heroes are appropriate for WP. Narratives of the exploits of fictional characters are appropriate for fan websites, not WP.

<dd>1) As it states, the presence of a plot summary is not grounds for deletion. Even if these articles consisted only of plot summary, which they don't, it would not be grounds for deletion, only cleanup/revision.</dd>
<dd>2) These articles pass the 100 year test. Probably. The very nature of the test makes it hard to say with 100% certainty.</dd>
<dd>3) As it states, major characters get their own articles if proper treatment of them would cause the main article to become overlong.</dd>
<dd>In short, these three policies all say that we should keep the articles. Noneofyourbusiness 20:04, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Re: your point #1, The "expansion and cleanup" required by no. 7 is not possible w/ these articles b/c it is not possible to give them "real-world context and sourced analysis" (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information</a>). By the way, I note that the explicitly stated "Plot summaries are not grounds for deletion" (paraphrasing) was added <i>today</i>--probably in good faith, but that does sort of change the meaning of the policy, and maybe sd be reverted (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWhat_Wikipedia_is_not&amp;diff=73506100&amp;oldid=73428962" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWhat_Wikipedia_is_not&amp;diff=73506100&amp;oldid=73428962" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWhat_Wikipedia_is_not&amp;diff=73506100&amp;oldid=73428962</a>). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 20:19, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>From the nominator.</b> If this were a chess game, now would be the time to say "I resign." I gave it my best shot. Now (after more than 40K!) I want to <b>withdraw the nomination.</b> I apologize for what is now clear to me was an ill-advised nom as rootology said, since it had zero chance of succeeding, although that was certainly not clear to me when I made the nom. In fact I thought it wd be so uncontroversial that I used PROD before someone removed it.</p>
<p>Now that the debate is over, I want first to concede what I think are the three best arguments <i>against</i> my nom:</p>
<p>1. Inertia. These articles are so extensive, and have been on WP for so long, and are even part of a Stargate portal (God save us all!), that to delete them now would be disruptive to the portal and unfair to a relatively small but very hard-working chunk of the WP community.</p>
<p>2. Precedent. I assume discussions like these have come up before, whether formally in deletion nominations, or informally on talk pages, or both. The fact that articles like these have survived for such a long time despite such discussions, is precedent-setting, I suppose.</p>
<p>3. Fairness. If these articles were yanked, it would not be fair that hundreds, if not thousands (if not tens of thousands?--God save us all!) of comparable articles would remain, like the article on Soong which rootology mentioned.</p>
<p>I still think my basic argument is right: that WP is not an appropriate place for articles like these, including the Soong article, and WP would have a much better reputation if it cracked down on them. The fact that these articles are 95% plot narratives and 5% character analyses attests to their lack of significance to the real world today, lack of any artistic, philosophical, or literary merit, and certain lack of significance to anybody at all 100 years from now. So it's obvious to me that they're unencyclopedic faddish fancruft.</p>
<p>Worse, I get the impression that allowing these articles makes the WP community sort of like a high school student body, in that both are divided into cliques devoted to fads, rather than a cohesive community devoted to the whole WP project/high school sports &amp; academics. There is a clique devoted to Stargate, and a clique devoted to Pokemon, and a clique devoted to Survivor, and a clique devoted to Goth. Leaving high school aside, whether I'm right about the existence of cliques on WP or not, I'm probably right that Stargate et al are fads which will be forgotten 100 years from now. And it seems to me that at WP, the proponents of fad projects should take them off of WP and go elsewhere on the World Wide Web, which is pretty darn wide and would accommodate, and certainly already does accommodate, each one of these fads.</p>
<p>So again, I apologize for the nom. I also apologize for being blunt about what I called "fads," which may offend some people. Especially, I apologize for the rant you just read, because I know now (thanks rootology) that the appropriate place for that rant is in a discussion like the one at WP:FICT, not here. I just want to say, thanks to all of you who have contributed to this debate. Thanks especially to those of you who thoughtfully engaged me in some particulars of the debate, even though you could have just cited WP:SNOW and walked off. Y'all probably feel this debate was largely a waste of your time, and you may be right, but for me this has been an educational experience as I am new to the procedural part of WP (though I have been contributing substantively to WP for quite some time as described on <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">User:Pan Dan</a>, ahem, Matt and rootology). I have no hard feelings towards anybody here (yes, even you Matt, though next time a newcomer adopts a snowball-in-hell position, don't assume bad faith), although I understand if some of you have hard feelings towards me. Anyway, see you around WP! May the force be with you! or whatever. &#160;:-)</p>

<li>Will Stargate be forgotten a hundred years from now? Maybe so.

Whether something will be notable a century from now is inherently unknowable, and thus not a criteria for determining whether it's notable now. Assuming that Wikipedia still exists in 2106, these articles will be deleted by then if they've ceased to be notable. Currently, however, they are notable.

<dd>With respect, you're way off base here.

<li>The content could be valuable to people outside of the game who are considering beginning to play. It gives them an idea of the depth of various groups within the Shadowbane world. This can be informative to someone considering between two MMORPGs and enable him/her to choose one or the other based on how appropriate to their personalities the group descriptions are.

<dd>Sadly, forums are not considered reliable sources. The reason we use newspapers or books is that in order to be written about, the subject must be of interest to the general public. Gaming clans are generally only of interest to their own members and some players of the same game. For example, my own group, Sturmgrenadier, had an article for a while, but was, quite frankly, not notable. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sturmgrenadier_1ab4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sturmgrenadier">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sturmgrenadier</a> for details on why that one was deleted. (SG was <i>mentioned</i> in an article in USA Today, which was used for notability, but the article was not <i>about</i> SG.) One of things to consider is.... would your mother read about the group if you weren't the author of the article and a member? --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 14:14, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Wikipedia works using verifiable sources. If we need to consider something that is not within the article, I would suggest adding it to the article along with verifiable citations and commenting on this AfD entry once that has been accomplished.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I updated the Billy Lockwood page using verifiable sources and linking the page to them. I added many things that were not on there...but there still is more I will update.

<p>I believe that the whole premace of this article is original research. <a href="../../../p/d/x/User%7EPDXblazers_2cc8.html" title="User:PDXblazers">PDXblazers</a> 21:37, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This is an old article and although it could do with references it does appear to have had a lot of editors, and the talk page suggests a section was removed for being original research. This suggests that most contributors do not consider the whole article original research. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 21:53, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Keep. - The page may be based on original research done by Joseph Smith, but that's part of the argument. I added a lot of the Jewish information, and it was taken from other Wikipedia articles and other disparate sources. The comparison section is certainly not original research. Can't speak about the Mormon doctrine section. <a href="../../../f/i/v/User%7EFiveRings_f1e8.html" title="User:FiveRings">FiveRings</a> 22:23, 1 September 2006 (UTC) (oh, and for some strange reason a lot of the external references were moved to the bottom of the page. Not sure why, and I don't agree with the reformatting).</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Mormon theology claims a continuity with Judaism that goes beyond that of other Christian denominations (see <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaronic_Priesthood_2eef.html" title="Aaronic Priesthood">Aaronic Priesthood</a>) and this article should cover that. However, the material that talks about each religion separately should go. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 01:10, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>MERGE &amp; REDIRECT</b> While it does smack of original research, the information should be condensed into a section on the main <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormonism.html" title="Mormonism">Mormonism</a> article either something dealing with historical origins/continuity or doctrine. Subject doesn't deserve its own article. Needs citations, by the way. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 03:54, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormonism.html" title="Mormonism">Mormonism</a> article is already quite long and imho doesn't need any more sections adding to it. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 10:43, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Addendum</b>: I guess my original motivation for submitting this article was a bit brief - but to me it seemed like a clear-cut case that only needed a brief notice, but obviously it does need some more explanation:</dd>
<dd>While this list may be "interesting" and "timely", that alone does not justify inclusion here. The main hurdles it has to overcome are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original Research</a>.
<ul>
<li>Verifiability: Classifying a person as a critic is very hard to prove. First of all, what is a "critic"? Does he have to reject Islam altogether? Does he have to <i>hate</i> it? Or is it enough to just be dissatisfied with certain aspects? Then - even if a clear definition could be agreed upon, how will inclusion in this list be determined? A brief quote might be helpful, but what if it's taken out of context? What if that person later changed his mind? What if the person approves <i>some</i> parts of Islam, but rejects <i>other</i> parts? Which gets us to the next hurdle:</li>
<li>No Original Research: Who will decide who fits the criteria of being a critic? The WP editors? That will be a lot of judgement calls to make, and will probably only end up in an edit war. Islam-opponents will try to classify <i>everybody</i> as a critic, and Islam-proponents will try their best to achieve the opposite. Unless we have a third-party source that did the classification already, these are too fundamental a judgement to make for editors.</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> because this list is worthless unless we attempt to define critical first. Just about every Muslim scholar has had a problem with something the academic community would call Islamic. Amina Wadud doesn't like many salafi tendencies Ibn Wahhab doesn't like Sufis. They are all critics in some sense. We could narrow this down to non-Muslim critics but then we have to figure out who is Muslim and who isn't--which, I think we should be able to agree that self-identification is the important aspect but it will inevitably lead to vandalism with people removing Amina Wadud and Rashid Khalifa because they "aren't Muslims". As it stands now this list is completely anecdotal. Does it matter that Dante had a few lines critical of Islam? It seems to me that's about the same as putting Mel Gibson into critics of Judaism. I think we should agree that critics applies to people who have made actually critically studied Islam. Wansbrough and Crone (as far as I know) don't get into moral judgments about Islam but they question the typical assumptions of Qur'anic origins. The main issue we need to deal with is Muslim critics of various aspects within Islam. To call them "reformers" is rather aggrandizing and just about every Muslims author I can think of fits this category in some way. How do we deal with that? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 11:44, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I could be misunderstanding those who worked in it, but I think this list means people who are critical of Islam in any form rather than a particular element of it.

Like people who feel that the Qur'an and the basis of Islam is based on false notions or write about why they feel Islam is inferior to other religious or philosophical positions. Some of this could dovetail into general critics of religion, but I think they're wanting people known for focussing on Islam.

<li><b>Weak provisional keep</b>. The nominator's argument for deletion is essentially "oh no, there could be a content dispute about inclusion", which is unpersuasive.

One positive surprise that came out of this though, was the discovery that there <i>are</i> some truly independent and neutral editors out there, who aren't attached to <i>any</i> fixed POV, and who work to defend WP, not their own propaganda.

Of course, as I said, there are <i>some</i> editors where it's impossible to tell from their history what their personal POV is. <i>That's</i> how it should be.

<li>It turns out there is already a Wikipedia article that covers aha calculus at <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_fraction.html" title="Egyptian fraction">Egyptian fraction</a>. It appears that Aha Variable is not so much a hoax as a fairly significant mis-interpretation of aha calculus.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. If you delete this, you'll have to delete all of the coasters in the "Roller coasters at Hersheypark" box, and then why have roller coaster boxes for major amusement parks anyway. Heck, delete all of the roller coaster articles. I'm sure <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Roller_Coasters_4fce.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Roller Coasters">Wikipedia:WikiProject Roller Coasters</a> will love it. The unique water aspect alone makes it notable: a steel inverted coaster (not a flume) in which riders and spectators get soaked. It's obvious that Angry Lawyer, Blood red sandman and Eugene2x are completely ignorant of the subject ("some guy's theme park"??!) of the article and have not bothered to do any research before voting. The damn thing's a stub. You wouldn't have nominated it for AfD if it was as completely written as some of the other roller coaster articles. 12.22.250.4 21:43, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I completely agree with your point, but let's assume good faith here.

<li><b>Comment.</b> Whether a person believes in prodding articles is his own decision. However, <i>removing</i> a prod to take an article AfD is, in my opinion, an abuse of process. The rules for AfD stipulate that you should first check to see if an article is a candidate for <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletions_bb1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletions">Wikipedia:speedy deletions</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">Wikipedia:Proposed deletion</a>--the implication being that if it is, you shouldn't take it to AfD. A page with a {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} tag on it is <i>clearly</i> a candidate for proposed deletion. If you think the article should be deleted and it has a {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} tag on it, you can put {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd2_41fe.html" title="Template:Prod2">prod2</a>}} on it, add it to your watch page, and then take it to AfD if the prod is contested. A lot of articles are drive-by creations--the authors make the page and never come back. Sometimes prod works. I know it's frustrating--personally, I'd like to see a rule that prevents authors from removing prod tags on their own articles without comment--but <a href="../../../r/u/l/WP%7ERULES_e375.html" title="WP:RULES">dem's the rules</a>. -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope">Merope</a> 01:02, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Alright, I apologize for taking this to AFD from a PROD. I wasn't aware that such an action was considered out of process. I won't take such an action again. If this has to go back to PROD to put in back in its appropriate process, that'll be fine. I'll remove this nomination then. --<a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETargetter_27f5.html" title="User:Targetter">Targetter</a> <a href="../../../t/a/r/User_talk%7ETargetter_4bda.html" title="User talk:Targetter"><sup><tt style="color:#900;">(Lock On)</tt></sup></a> 01:18, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Unfortunately, that would be against the rules. As the rules on PROD are written currently, 1) PROD can only ever be tried once on an article, and also 2) that if there has ever been an AFD then PROD can't be done. So we have to finish out the AFD. Someday we'll get prod updated with a reasonable time horizon about at least the prior PROD - maybe a year or two... Don't feel too bad about the process goof, they happen, just learn from it for the future. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:05, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - the original page looked like poorly-written adverspam, so I might have been a little hasty in nominating it.--86.133.180.144 11:02, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. If 86.133.180.144 is Angry Lawyer, does the later comment count as a retraction? The Trailblazer is noteworthy as Hersheypark's second oldest still extant coaster, as an early steel coaster, for its quad helix and for the gentleness of the ride (it's advertised as a "family coaster" and is one of the few steel thrill coasters frequented by pre-teens). Hersheypark is hardly "some guy's theme park", it's nationally known and is home to some of the better coasters on the East Coast. Every Hersheypark coaster is worthy of inclusion if any is, and if you're going to delete Trailblazer you will logically have to delete all the rest as well, and why stop there? Let's ditch all the roller coaster articles. Heck, we can do without <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Roller_Coasters_4fce.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Roller Coasters">Wikipedia:WikiProject Roller Coasters</a> too, can't we? If it remains a stub for much longer, perhaps merging with the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hersheypark.html" title="Hersheypark">Hersheypark</a> article would make sense, but as part of a series of articles on Hersheypark coasters a merge does not make sense.

<li>If Capitalistroadster can see scope for a decent article, I won't vote to delete this. I will express concern about the ambiguity of the term "Oceania", which in this article appears to be being used in a slightly unusual way -- for example, "Oceania" nearly always includes Australia in my experience, but this article seems to describe Australia as not even in the same region? This needs clarifying, and if an alternative title can be found ("Relations of Japan with Pacific island nations"?) then that might be preferable.<br />
Besides, Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 10:21, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I originally tagged the article for speedy deletion as not asserting the notability of the band. A little research showed no evidence of meeting <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>; an unsigned band (all albums are self-released), no entry on Amazon or AllMusic. The author contested the speedy and explained on the talk page they had provided the soundtrack for a skiing movie, possibly satisfying that point of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but it's still a fairly slim claim. This isn't as totally clear-cut as the usual "this band was formed in early 2006 and will be a big hit real soon!" fare that warrants speedying, so opening this up to AfD. ~<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatticus78_82c5.html" title="User talk:Matticus78">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matticus78_2dbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matticus78">C</a></sub> 23:10, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

I come up with (including the nominator): 1 Keep, 2 Delete, 3 Merge of various types (including 1 Merge or Keep), 1 Neutral (the article creator, oringally a Keep but later amended by the statement "I don't care anymore whether or not you delete My Evaline."

<p>Contested prod. Basically, this is your classic case of not everything that a notable band (Weezer) does being notable in and of itself. We're dealing here with a 44sec track which is available according to the article on one version of their debut album and (mistitled) on one version of one single. I don't see notability anywhere there. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 23:13, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let me further explain...</p>
<p>I feel this song is important because it shows another side of the band. Instead of a rock song they did a barbershop song. this particular B-side is much more notable because it shows Weezer doing something that isn't their usual sound. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlinkchillie90_5656.html" title="User:Blinkchillie90">Blinkchillie90</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/i/User_talk%7EBlinkchillie90_ea18.html" title="User talk:Blinkchillie90">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blinkchillie90_cf91.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blinkchillie90">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>True enough, but it doesn't satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_SONG_0353.html" title="WP:MUSIC/SONG">WP:MUSIC/SONG</a> that I can see. The fact that the song was not even released as a single in its own right is the major hurdle. Perhaps a line or two on the article about the album? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 23:26, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The album that the song is from has an article. What I'm suggesting is that you add into that article a sentence or two about this song and the fact that it "shows another side of the band". That way, the information will be there for the world to see. On its own, this song is not notable. Also, please sign your posts. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 23:36, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey this is blinkchillie90 again. I guess i could add it to that particular article. Just give me some time before you delete this article so i copy and paste some of the stuff I have typed on this one over to the other article. Also I don't know how to sign my posts. I have also noticed that you have also put the nomination for deletion on some of the other song articles for weezer. I understand that you feel a song article is only needed for Singles. But i disagree. I want some time to edit those articles to make those wiki-worthy. I actually was planning on just setting up the format today (sept 1) and tomorrow doing some work on them. You can delete the songs for the deluxe edition such as "Susanne," "Mykel and Carli" and "my Evaline." But I feel the regular blue album songs are important and need articles. These songs are considered Weezer Classics. I know tons of unique and important information on those songs.</p>
<p>So in conclusion I ask you to take those articles off the nominated for deletion list. So i can have some time to edit it. I mean I just put up the song articles today. I havent even had a chance to really do anything to them. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlinkchillie90_5656.html" title="User:Blinkchillie90">Blinkchillie90</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/i/User_talk%7EBlinkchillie90_ea18.html" title="User talk:Blinkchillie90">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blinkchillie90_cf91.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blinkchillie90">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>To sign your posts, just use the "tilde" key (~) four times. That will expand out to your username and the time that you typed the post. As far as time goes, an AfD remains open for 5 days in the general course of events, so that should be enough time. If you're concerned that it won't be, you might want to copy and paste the text of this article to a file on your computer so that you can add it later on when you get the chance. The same timeframe (5 days) is used for any other template which I've added, so you have that long to demonstrate the notability of the song - and that goes for any song, whether it was on the regular album or the deluxe edition. The thing is, though, that the general consensus has historically been that it's only singles and a handful of very important album tracks that get their own articles, so you'll need to show that the tracks on the regular blue album are sufficiently important. I'm not saying that they aren't, they may well be, but going on their current articles, they don't appear to be. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 00:51, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My Evaline is notable in its own right as Blinkchillie90 has explained. Apart from that, any song by a notable band is something wikipedia users should be able to read about, and thus not a candidate for deletion, although album tracks are certainly mergeable. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 02:27, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. A 44 second song available on one edition of an album (notable as the album may be) and one release of a single (notable as the A-side of the single may be) by any given band (notable as the band may be), even if it shows the band exploring a different style to that which they're known for performing doesn't sound notable to me. It would be notable if Weezer then became a barbershop act, but that didn't happen. The information on the other songs I've bundled with this one <i>is</i> able to be read about in the article on the album. The only difference between the tracklisting there and the article here is that the article is written in a sentence. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 02:43, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm back! BigHaz I understand everything you're saying. you must realize something all these songs are considered extremely important in the world of Weezer. "Only in dreams" and "the world has turned and left me here" are considered weezer classics. When fans go to see them in concert they hope they play a large abundant of Blue Album songs. My original intention was to expand the page of one of my favorite albums. I wanted to expand the songs. I wasn't going to do that all in a day. If you look at other album pages such as <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_side_of_the_moon.html" title="Dark side of the moon">Dark side of the moon</a> you'll notice that all the tracks have thier own page. in the world of weezer, the Blue Album is considered their "magnum opus." Just like people consider Dark side of the moon is Pink Floyd's magnum opus I felt you nominated everything for deletion way too early before anything could be done to them. (something I have explained before) It was unfair to nominate for deletion. You should've checked the dates the pages were added. I feel if the pages had been up for a few monthes but were still a 1 sentence article then they are appropriate for nomination! But in this case it definitely wasn't <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlinkchillie90_5656.html" title="User:Blinkchillie90">User:Blinkchillie90</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Fair points (and good to see you've got the signature working), but if you look at the information contained in every one of the DSOTM song articles, it establishes notability. Currently, most of these articles just say "X is a song written by Rivers Cuomo for Weezer's debut album in 1994" or words to that effect. My suggestion would be to take a cue from the DSOTM article and do up a table with songwriter/producer/whathaveyou credits on the "Blue Album" article and add all of that in there (tables look better than lists, I'd say). Then it would be a case of establishing notability for any individual album track, since I'll grant that a single is notable <i>per se</i>. The catch is going to be, though, that an album track which is really well-known by fans of the band may not be notable enough for a general encyclopedia - my father would probably love to see articles on every B-Side by the Rolling Stones, but I doubt they're all that notable. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 03:54, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok I have stopped caring about the B-sides I simply want to save the regular album tracks. Those tracks are the ones that truely matter. I don't care anymore whether or not you delete My Evaline. In fact as the creator of the <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Evaline_05ce.html" title="My Evaline">My Evaline</a> page I am encouraging you to just delete it along with "susanne." But not "Mykel and Carli" that song is important. But "surf wax" and "Only in dreams" are the ones that deserve their own page along with the all the Blue album songs. I will also consider that table idea as well.

<li><b>weak keep</b>. They appear to be a professional band on a major label, and have relased an album and DVD (I haven't found any info on how these did sales-wise, but as they're a classical group not pop/rock don't expect to find them on top 40/bilboard charts). According to the official website one of the members is a celebrity in Serbia from when she was a TV presenter "on a popular morning program". They've had a track produced by Jeff Lynne (and I doubt he'd do that for every fledgling band), and appear to have been on hevy rotation on an Australian TV channel.
