<dd>Before my original deletion tag i checked Allmusic and read <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and still believe that he is not notable enough to be included here. JUST because you've released two albums doesn't infer notability. Like the IP poster above said...his albums were ranked 90,000th or lower on the Amazon.com website. Nobody had submitted reviews, I just returned from my local Best Buy, they had no album of his. Allmusic.com is very much like IMDB.com, i could submit my name to it and it would be included in a future update, its not reliable. What is more reliable is checking google...which brings FEW mentions of this "notable" rapper. I stand by my deletion tag as non-notable and probably a vanity page. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 00:56, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, by the way, how many non notable artists have singles that go for 70 bucks on ebay? <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=4829386147&amp;category=306" class="external autonumber" title="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=4829386147&amp;category=306" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHasNoClue_3d03.html" title="User:HasNoClue">HasNoClue</a> 02:10, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Quite the contrary, it would appear you are the one who "HasNoClue." I made an effort to find information on this artist. I tried to find a cd at my local music store....nothing. Tried to find mention of him on reputable web-pages like billboard charts, or the like...nothing. If he's now signed with "Rap-a-Lot" records....great! When he's satisfied the criteria for inclusion here....which by the way is TWO albums released on a well known/major record label...then by all means...include him. The article as is reads as vanity and non-notable content. I'm also looking through ebay and don't see a $70.00 single for this artist anywhere...do you have a link for that? And please, leave your personal "weirdo" attacks out of here, or you'll be blocked from editing here. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 02:18, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, because he was listed as non-notable. And does not meet the Music requirements of having released TWO albums on a major label. We'll let a moderator determine the outcome of the debate. What you've provided is that at least 12 people bid on a cd of his, and a few people talk about him on blogs. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 05:25, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure about the radio stations, but the magazine XLR8R listed as a major music media in WP:MUSIC.

<li>Uh, Batman, the WP:MUSIC page clearly states that they only have to meet <i>one or more</i> of the qualifications. Are you suggesting that every musical artist on wikipedia has to have 2 albums on a major label? You're wrong. Secondly, I proved that his music is in demand enough to fetch 70 dollars per single (if you want to know why that is notable i suggest reading up on <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics.html" title="Economics">economics</a>), I proved that he has had heavy rotation on radio stations, I proved that he's been reviewed by a major music mag, I proved that he is mentioned on numerous blogs, AND I proved that he has worked with extremely well-known artists like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Game_def0.html" title="The Game">The Game</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Wall_d364.html" title="Paul Wall">Paul Wall</a> (see the interview for that info). To the other guy, my guess is that I'm the only person defending notability 1. because the nomination is old, 2. because Wikipedia editors don't tend to be fans of the genre that he's in, and 3. because 90% of the people who vote on this stuff consider themselves 'deletionists' and take pride, for some ridiculous reason, in removing stuff that they haven't heard of or don't care about. And no, it's not the same guy, cryptic. --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHasNoClue_3d03.html" title="User:HasNoClue">HasNoClue</a> 05:42, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Furthermore, you demonstrated your lack of knowledge about notability requirements by stating that an artist had to have 2 albums on a major label to be notable (you should probably go nominate all independent artists for deletion, since they don't meet that requirement).
