Although he has two articles about him, he also does not appear to meet two other points in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> - "The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field" - At this time he has generated a stir amongst the establishment, but there is no indication that this would pass the 10 year test, or anything else. Also, because the subject is a rabbi and religious figure, it is analogous to a religious academic - a look at <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> version of the biography guideline shows that he is a long way from a religious equivalent of being a academically/theologically respected scholar in any sense.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 00:11, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Excuse me?? This is the full text of that article: <a href="http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=11082" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=11082" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The only way you could have thought that the article contained only a passing mention is if you either did not read it, or completely had no <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a> in the fact that I had read the full text. The subject of this Afd is a critical of the theme of that article, as the reporter could not have chosen anyone at random to fill his shoes. Three paragraphs are focused on the man with two non-trivial quotes. As a result, I dont think the mention can be called <b>trivial</b>, which is the way <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is framed. That said, the notion of <i>non-trivial</i> is IMO one of the most subjective part of the main notability criteria, so its hard to argue either way on borderline cases. But I dont see how this is a borderline case. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 00:02, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To clarify, the focus of this 48 paragraph article is not about him, rather it quotes Sokolovsky over 3 paragraphs as saying that the rebbe is alive because he is a <a href="../../../t/z/a/Tzadik.html" title="Tzadik">Tzadik</a>... This quote from him, in my humble opinion does not qualify as a newspaper article about someone that makes them notable. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinchasC_0ba2.html" title="User:PinchasC">PinchasC</a> | <a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinchasC_df31.html" title="User talk:PinchasC"><small>£€åV€ m€ å m€§§åg€</small></a> 03:59, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If this article was in isolation, I would agree it isnt enough. But there are other sources as well, and if use this article as an example, he is being used as a source along side a crowd of other notable people. Four people are quoted in the article (in order of the size of the quotes):
<ul>
<li>Rabbi <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Berger_%28professor%29_b57e.html" title="David Berger (professor)">David Berger (professor)</a>, a history professor at Brooklyn College</li>
<li>Rabbi Ariel Sokolovsky</li>
<li><i>Michael Rosenthal</i>, a 24-year-old Lubavitcher who works for the emissary in Great Neck, in an interview outside.</li>
<li>one anti-messianist not named</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>In addition, three other people are mentioned by name:
<ul>
<li>Rabbi <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson_07ba.html" title="Menachem Mendel Schneerson">Menachem Mendel Schneerson</a></li>
<li>Rabbi <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaim_Yehuda_Krinsky_8c15.html" title="Chaim Yehuda Krinsky">Chaim Yehuda Krinsky</a>, chairman of the Lubavitch organizations; declined to comment</li>
<li><i>Jeffrey Buss</i>, the attorney for the Gaboyim</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The way I read it was that the author of the article included Sokolovsky because he considered it worth of note. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 09:04, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
