<li>Never heard of him, which doesn't mean much, I don't follow wraslin. A quick look at his website suggests the organisation he started is basically limited to Sydney.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'll need to do plenty of cleanup to tidy up the article, trimming it down to the essentials but... he's wrestled in Japan for Z1 Max who are a big promotion.

<li>Quite right and my apologies. The speedy keep was in response to my original thinking that this was part of the systematic attack on wrestling articles. It was then pointed out on my talk page that the nominator was a user in good standing. I should have amended my&#160;!vote at the same time as mu opinion.

<dd>If wrestling in Australia is notable, then I guess this guy is also notable. It's not a very high standard, probably lower than I'd set, but I suspect he meets it (though I'd like to see some more sources to be 100% sure of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I guess I'm going to ask one question before I make up my mind. To be sure, there are a lot of other pages with less claim to exist than this does.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm not aware of how notable wrestling is or isn't in Australia, as I don't have much knowledge of it. However the crux of my argument isn't really anything to do with Australia, it's the fact he's wrestled in Japan for a mainstream promotion on national TV. That's at a far higher level than anything in Australia, and makes him notable in my opinion. With regards to verifiability, I'm planning to have a look at the article and trim out anything that can't be properly sourced. However I'm hoping that the reliable sources I provided about are sufficient to demonstrate his notability, which is the most important thing. Most of the content that isn't verified at present doesn't have any bearing on his notability as far as I can see. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 11:58, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I agree. However the linked articles are actually the results of shows that have already happened. This could also be confirmed by independent fan sites (which is worse in my opinion), and could also be confirmed by the Japanese press who do actually cover wrestling but foreign language sources aren't well liked. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 01:27, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It's been suggested to me that "Pro-wrestlers are entertainers participating in a scripted performance. They aren't sportspeople competing to the best of their ability in a contest of skill. Compare them to the actors section, because that's what they are" Without wishing to take a side on that argument, I'll copy the comment here and let people react as they will. Plus I'm not sure that BIO really covers actors outside of TV and movies. Perhaps a version of the professor test should apply: "Is this guy more significant than the average wrestler? Why or why not?" Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 09:05, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The "average" wrestler would depend on definition. There's hundreds and hundreds of "minor league" independent wrestlers, and not many who are "major league". So has this wrestler done anything to make him more significant than the hundreds of others, anything to make him stand out from the pack? Most definitely, he's been to Japan to work for a major promotion and appeared on TV. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 09:28, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'll own up to the criticism of the sport-person BIO test, and go along with this proposed modified Professor Test. Still no real opinion, I've not heard of him but <a href="../../../h/u/l/Hulk_Hogan_3ba4.html" title="Hulk Hogan">Hulk Hogan</a> is the <i>only</i> pro-wrestler I can both name and describe... vaguely! <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 05:31, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just to clarify why wrestling in Japan makes someone notable. Wrestling in Japan is a mainstream "sport", it's covered by newspapers and magazines on a daily basis. For example <a href="http://sportsnavi.yahoo.co.jp/" class="external text" title="http://sportsnavi.yahoo.co.jp/" rel="nofollow">sportsnavi</a> is part of Yahoo, and has a comprehensive section dedicated to <a href="http://sportsnavi.yahoo.co.jp/fight/data/index2007.html" class="external text" title="http://sportsnavi.yahoo.co.jp/fight/data/index2007.html" rel="nofollow">wrestling</a>, in addition to soccer, tennis, baseball etc. In fact, there is even a show report from one of the shows Bownds appeared on <a href="http://sportsnavi.yahoo.co.jp/fight/other/live/200608/25/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sportsnavi.yahoo.co.jp/fight/other/live/200608/25/index.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, where Google translation manages to rename him to <i>Orgy Osborne</i>. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 07:28, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
