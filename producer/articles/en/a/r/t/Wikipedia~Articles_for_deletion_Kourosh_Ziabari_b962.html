<p>This article, it seems, was written by Kourosh ziabari. There are a few hundred instances of him on the net; the 6 pages of his from the UK are basically him writing on blogs, though, and they don't particularly make sense. I skimmed over some of the Farsi links too, (although my grip on that language is not strong, to put it lightly,) and it seems that, on most of them, he is just bigging himself up. I highlight this for a votes for deletion because I am not sure whether his age and his 'acceptance' classified him as notable. If so, this article needs some deal of rewriting. If not, like I expect, then so be it. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">IINAG</a> 23:43, 24th August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree with you too. In fact, with all the links to him that I have read, he talks about being a journalist, but there are no examples of journalism! I fear that this may be a case of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Mitty_819c.html" title="Walter Mitty">Walter Mitty</a>, but perhaps it is just childish imagination.

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> - "World's youngest journalist" gets no relevant Google hits. As for the list of awards... I've won somewhere upwards of 25 regional, state and national honors for excellence in journalism, including five National Newspaper Pacemaker Awards - but that doesn't make me Wikipedia-worthy.

<ul>
<li>Kourosh, you should not remove votes from VfD discussions. It constitutes vandalism. And the criticism is legit - you flat-out stole that article from the health guide website. You even included the headers before the actual article, not bothering to even try to make it look like you wrote it. If this is all your "journalism" amounts to, it is not journalism, it's theft. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 10:24, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>An observation: There is a book by Elizabeth Laird titled "The House on the Hill," and I don't doubt it is a perfectly lovely book. However, acording to Amazon, it is aimed at children age 4 to 6. According to my local library catalog, it is 31 pages long, illustrated, and is intended as textbook for foreign speakers of English (part of MacMillan press' Heinemann system of guided readers). So I question its status as a "novel" as described on the page in question. It leads one to question the probable amount of exaggeration elsewhere in the page. <b>Userfy.</b> (On the other hand, Elizabeth Laird is a prolific author of children's books and probably deserves a Wiki page.) <small>(Unsigned vote by <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> (<a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECrypticfirefly_b19d.html" title="User talk:Crypticfirefly">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crypticfirefly_e504.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crypticfirefly">contribs</a>))</small></li>
<li>Just I was wondering how a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0435271733/459/202-8092711-1885407" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0435271733/459/202-8092711-1885407" rel="nofollow">31 page Beginner Level story in a series</a> could be called a novel. On the other hand, <a href="http://hemid.com/october-04/8x.html" class="external text" title="http://hemid.com/october-04/8x.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> is his translation of that 31 page. (At least, this was accessible through the internet). His translation is about 4000 words; therefore, I believe that Kourosh has just translated a part of that book , maybe one title and then has called it a novel. Am I right? Kourosh, don’t you think that you exaggerate everything (a little bit)? <small>(64.229.132.61 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.229.132.61_af19.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.229.132.61">contribs</a>))</small>
<ul>
<li>It could be a severely abridged version. Does someone actually understand Farsi, and can explain further about the translation? To me, Arabic script looks like gibberish. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 18:54, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Kourosh, your weblog is just two months old. How have you been writing in your weblog since 2002? How come?</dd>
<dd>Moreover, your claim to be "one of the most active persian Bloggers" makes no sense when you have posted only 13 entries so far.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<ul>
<li>In the sentence "he is one of the most active Persian bloggers", there are a couple of words missing: "spammers", and "among". So, we should have: "he is one of the most active spammers among Persian bloggers".</li>
<li>Warning! Do not let Kourosh Ziabari use Wikipedia for self advertising. This man is a very well known spammer (<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog_spam.html" title="Blog spam">weblogs spam</a>) among Persian bloggers.

<li>Hello again, Kourosh. Excuse me if I am curt, but I would not classify writing some web-logs as qualifying you as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prodigy.html" title="Prodigy">prodigy</a>.

Perhaps if you truly had written columns for the New York Times and the Washington Post, as you claimed elsewhere, you would have had our attention, already. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">IINAG</a> 13:24, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
