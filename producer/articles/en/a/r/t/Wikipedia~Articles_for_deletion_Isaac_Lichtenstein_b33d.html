<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. The subject appears to enjoy only minor notability within the group he is affiliated with, and little to no mention outside the group; some of the external links are circular and self-referential, others appear less than scholarly; the entire Life section is unsourced (how do we know that events depicted in it took place?); no polemics involving the subject are cited. Essentially, we have little beyond <i>mentions</i> in the scholarship, that is, nothing specifically dedicated to the subject (such as an entry in a biographical dictionary). As well, I found no mention of him in Israeli scholarship and only one single mention in Hebrew at all (in a Messianic organization-hosted link). <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 17:20, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Um, we have a partisan source getting its info second hand from a magazine in London about which we know nothing other than that its title hardly seems neutral. This hardly seems like a reliable source and in any event even if this were a reliable source this wouldn't show that he meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> anyways. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:19, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Oh, I don't know, maybe a general newspaper or an academic studying the history of messianic Judaism would be nice. Some actual indication that the man passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and some data from reliable sources. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:08, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The following <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria is met for Isaac Lichtenstein: 1) The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the <i>enduring historical record</i> in their specific field (emphasis mine). 2) Name recognition. Most Messianics familiar with Messianic Judaism and its history will recognize the name. 3) Search Engine Test -- Does a search for the subject produce a large number of distinguishable hits on Google ([1]), Alexa ([2]), Yahoo! ([3] or other well-known Internet search engine? Isaac Lichtenstein does. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 05:31, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ok, you'll have to forgive me but I would like explained what contribution he made that is part of the enduring historical record. Simply converting from one religion to another doesn't cut it. Name recognition is for "Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions" so I don't see how that's at all relevant. Finally the search engine test is listed under the alternative tests that have not gained consensus. Indeed, the fact that all the search results turn up just messianic webpages if anything would make a search engine test turn up negative. And he only gets 639 returns anyways. If this is the best you can do, he fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> so painfully it isn't funny. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:08, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you want to stay technical, then both the Search Engine, and the Verification test are listed under "alternative tests" in WP:BIO. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 20:42, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi Miri: Citing the Harvard library means that they have a record of something that goes under this name, it does not prove that the actual "Rabbi Isaac Lichtenstein" existed let alone that he was notable in any way, either to Judaism or Christianity. Sadly, many groups that have tried to undermine the Jews and Judaism over the millenia have created non-existant "<a href="../../../p/e/r/Personas.html" title="Personas">personas</a>" to suit their own nefarious ends, and this would be no exception. Another famous case in point is that of "<b><a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi_Emmanuel_Rabinovich_998a.html" title="Rabbi Emmanuel Rabinovich">Rabbi Emmanuel Rabinovich</a></b>" (See article: "Rabbi Emmanuel Rabinovich is a non-existent figure commonly cited in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">antisemitic</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>. One such fake is a supposed speech by "Rabbi Rabinovich" entitled <i>Our Race Will Rule Undisputed Over The World</i> to the "Emergency Council of European Rabbis" in Budapest, Hungary on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_12.html" title="January 12">January 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>. This forgery is taken as a "proof" of a Jewish plot against the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">whites</a> in much the same way as another <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">hoax</a>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_2073.html" title="The Protocols of the Elders of Zion">The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>,</i> invoked in the Rabinovich speech, is used as "proof" of Jewish <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_conspiracy.html" title="Global conspiracy">global conspiracy</a>." It should be noted that the time in which the stories about "Rabbi Isaac Lichtenstein" were created in the 1880s was a time when the modern Christian evangelical movement was born targeting the Jews and received huge amounts of money to do so from their Church groups and came up with many sophisticated ploys, and by concocting that some never-heard-of "rabbi" had legitimated <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostasy.html#In_Judaism" title="Apostasy">apostasy (<i>shmad</i>)</a> by accepting Jesus on his death bed was a perfect tool for the new brand of zealous misionaries who salivated at the thought of converting even one Jew to Christianity. Proof that this person is a sham is that not a single Jewish source even mentions him, and it is not because anyone is trying to hide anything. The history of the Jews and Judaism is an open book (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_converts_to_Christianity_a6c7.html#From_Judaism" title="List of converts to Christianity">List of converts to Christianity from Judaism</a> as an example, also the true story of an Orthodox Rabbi <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Zolli_e7b2.html" title="Israel Zolli">Israel Zolli</a> who apostasised to Catholicism), but the enemies of the Jews and Judaism prey on ignorance and they have no guilt in claiming that falsehoods are "true" as they do in the cases of "Rabbis" Isaac Lichtenstein and Emmanuel Rabinovich. Finally, if people really are that hungry for a fake rabbi, why not stick with <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofski_66b2.html" title="Rabbi Hyman Krustofski">Rabbi Hyman Krustofski</a> from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i> (and I will bet that there are people out there by now who are absolutely convince that "Rabbi" Krustofski is a real person too because he has "appeared" on The Simpsons so many times.) <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 13:03, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi Miri: The problem is that this article is presenting him as a "real" person, and if he ever existed, he is not notable despite all the efforts to embelish his "resume" and his story. He is <i>not</i> presented in the article as a fake creation of the Messianics who have their own agenda. If the article would turn around and describe him as just another type of <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi_Emmanuel_Rabinovich_998a.html" title="Rabbi Emmanuel Rabinovich">Rabbi Emmanuel Rabinovich</a> or a <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofski_66b2.html" title="Rabbi Hyman Krustofski">Rabbi Hyman Krustofski</a> then fine, but that is not what the openly POV Messianics are attemting to do here, they want to over-dramatize and pad something that probabaly never even happened in order to foist their <i>real</i> agenda here which is to lure Jews into becoming Christians by creating this overblown image of some unknown "rabbi" easing the path to "follow" characters like this Isaac Lichtenstein, and thereby assuage their natural guilt of abandoning Judaism. This is all about <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/smoke_and_mirrors" class="extiw" title="wikt:smoke_and_mirrors">smoke and mirrors</a> and guile in order to deceive the gullible on their path to apostasising from Judaism. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 15:08, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi Kendrick: Firstly, I am not saying that the Messianics made him up, I am pointing to the intensified efforts that various evangelical groups (mostly stemming from England) made starting from the mid to late 1800s to get Jews to apostasize, and that <i>they</i> created or embelished figures such as Isaac Lichtenstein. In Germany and Austria Jews sadly did this by themselves, many becoming Catholic several generations after becoming Reform Jews, which is a fact. Secondly, the name "Ignatz Lichtenstein" is totally unknown and meaningless to serious students of <i>any</i> Jewish history. Sure there were Jews who became Christians, but what kind of "rabbi" was this guy? Do you honestly think that <i>any</i> Orthodox rabbis could get away with such a thing? If anyone thinks that, they don't have a clue about how Orthodox Judaism and communities work. There was always a sprinkling of mostly simple people what were called "<i>meshumadim</i>" (apostates) but they were viewed as the town freaks and were outcasts and not heros to the Jews. For example, read the weird story of a true life rabbi who became an apostate, Rabbi <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Zolli_e7b2.html" title="Israel Zolli">Israel Zolli</a> of Rome, who was totally rejected by his community because of his association with the Catholics, which is very credible, and not like the puported case of Isaac/Ignatz Lichtenstein (and no-one, not even you, is sure if Isaac and Ignatz is the same person) who is painted as some sort of "hero" in this article, when, if at all true, at the time he would have been nothing but a total disgrace to his Jewish brethren who probably would have had him pilloried and run out of town at best, or perhaps even thrown into a local river. Could you imagine the fate of Jew who would have come into a devout Christian community or town in Central or Eastern Europe and preached to the gentiles to leave the "falsity of Christianity"? He would have become toast quicker than you could say "pass the fries, honey." Sad but true. 20:54, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>"when, if at all true, at the time he would have been nothing but a total disgrace to his Jewish brethren who probably would have had him pilloried and run out of town at best, or perhaps even thrown into a local river." I'm perplexed why this is any more tolerant than what Christians did. Granted Christians were worse because they/we had the power, but if either group responds by exiling or killing apostates I'm not sure where the difference lies. In any event <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Bodo_4e6a.html" title="Bishop Bodo">Bishop Bodo</a> was not "made toast" as far as I can tell, although he did flee to Spain. Likewise <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_ben_Abraham_8f7b.html" title="Abraham ben Abraham">Abraham ben Abraham</a>'s story has inspired some doubt, but the difference is he's notable. This character being non-notable, and claims about him being untrue, is the most important thing. I'm worried many of you are getting into POV issues about whether Messianic Jews are bad or good and whether Jews must, or must never, feel "natural guit" at leaving. If this character is notable we should just present facts. Not opinions about how holy he was for "realizing the truth of Christianity" or how he was "a total disgrace and freak" for apostasizing.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>That sound's reasonable; but that's exactly where the source material rings with veracity, which portrays the Rabbi as rejected by his fellow rabbis in Budapest but, by refusing to be baptized, confounding them. His charisma, were it really enough to sway his own fellow small-town villagers (who would have been imaginably less sophisticated, metropolitan, and battle-hardened than any collection of <i>Roman</i> Jews), may have confounded attempts to ostracize him further, as this would have just lost the whole lot of them from the Jewish faith. If you are going to make up a Christian-ic hero, you don't have them not baptized and thus, theologically, hell-bound. And there are plenty of historical examples of charismatic leaders convincing people of all sorts of strange beliefs; Jesus as messiah is a common one anyway, Jewish religious and cultural solidarity notwithstanding. As to Isaac/Ignatz, the Messianic-Judaic sources claim he wrote under the name "I. Lichtenstein" and is thus often confounded with a certain "J. Lichtenstein"; it seems Isaac is a misnomer as a result -- that's just my OR, but it's odd how the puzzle pieces fall into place. -- <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKendrick7_a50a.html" title="User talk:Kendrick7">talk</a></sup> 22:00, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If he kept his faith a secret, and then when he was found out he left his position, then there would seem to be no point to make a fuss, besides, just because there is a lack of English material on the subject from a non-pro perspective, and the fact I don't think we can fully appreciate the Jewish Hungarian perspective of his day, makes this argument irrelevant. <a href="../../../s/t/j/User%7EStjamie_0344.html" title="User:Stjamie">Jamie Guinn</a></li>

I also included the email of the main biographer. Check my sources, this man existed, and was who he was. Messianic Judaism may not be as notable as Greater Judaism or even Catholicism in numbers and therefore lack libraries worth of material. I also understand those of us in MJ are fighting an uphill battle with those with a hidden agenda of keeping us from making an contributions that would get noticed, including here on Wikipedia. I would ask the whoever makes the final decision would take into consideration the amount of tension that exists between MJ and Greater Judaism, and if need be, allowing this discussion to continue longer than normal so all avenues can be exhausted and the decider can get the proper NPOV perspective.

If this article was restructured as being about a belief, perhaps with a section on opinions on whether he was a real person, we could discuss <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> etc. under the appropriate category.

If he were a figure in a Messianic religious text we could identify him as such and say things like "According to [Messianic religious text]...", just as we do with figures in the Bible and other religious texts.

<li>Daniel375, you are stating your own POV. The question of Jewish identity has not been fully satisfied even today. All major branches of Judaism are still fighting amongst themselves over Jewish identity as well as in Israeli politics. Messianic Jews are making inroads in Israel as being recognized to make Aliyah (those who identify themselves as such, others who claim Jewish heritage are still allowed to make Aliya. It is the orthodox who continue to fight the current definition.). Until the argument is fully settled among normative Judaism you cannot post here who is and who is not Jewish, this is purely POV. <a href="../../../s/t/j/User%7EStjamie_0344.html" title="User:Stjamie">Jamie Guinn</a> 10:03, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't know of any halacha that says that a person who was born a Jew and converts out is not still a Jew. I'm fairly certain that Daniel575 made that up. Regardless, if has no bearing on this discussion. He figure inquestion is not notable.--<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMeshulam_1f5a.html" title="User:Meshulam">Meshulam</a> 12:07, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: "Continuous POV lies" are grounds for an NPOV template, but not for deletion if Lichtenstein is notable and there are enough verifiable sources about him to write an article. Currently I doubt both. The Rabbi probably was a real person, and there are some texts written by him (published by <i>Hebrew Christian Testimony to Israel</i>, according to Amazon, but not available). Is he notable as an author? As a convert? I doubt both. The utter lack of sources not associated with either Christian missionaries or Messianic Jews is also highly suspect. Concerning the Google results, there seems to be a painter of the same name who is responsible for some of the hits, leaving rather few about the Rabbi. --<a href="../../../h/u/o/User%7EHuon_18c0.html" title="User:Huon">Huon</a> 11:19, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Not notable. If he did exist, I haven't heard of him. Regardless of whether I've heard of him, there is nothing immediately notable about a Jew who apostacizes. If you had to write an article for every Jew who stopped behaving like a Jew, Wikipedia would soon becluttered with articles about Jews who are no longer doing X Y and Z. --<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMeshulam_1f5a.html" title="User:Meshulam">Meshulam</a> 12:06, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. He IS notable, maybe not to Judaism, since as Meshulam stated that many Jews have stopped acting according to normative Judaism, but he is certainly to Messianic Judaism, so much so that he has had a Messianic Jewish Yeshiva dedicated to his memory and work.

<li>He needs to be notable enough in general to be notable for Wikipedia. Issachar Bates is somewhat notable in the history of the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakers.html" title="Shakers">Shakers</a> and I could probably write an article on him if I desired.

<li><b>Comment</b> a Rabbi who taught that Jesus was the messiah seems to be notable, was apparently worth worldwide magazine articles about him in the mid-1890s, and would seem to be such a rarity that otherwise sane editors are jumping over themselves to ignore or dismiss what reliable sources say about him as if sources claimed he had three heads. -- <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKendrick7_a50a.html" title="User talk:Kendrick7">talk</a></sup> 19:16, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think that interested editors may wish to know that if you look at the talk page of the article it appears the sources which are claimed to be reliable can't even agree on his first name. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 00:47, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>How many Jews do you know who have two first names? Their given and their Hebrew. What's the problem? <a href="../../../s/t/j/User%7EStjamie_0344.html" title="User:Stjamie">Jamie Guinn</a> 05:33, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article currently claims his name isn't Isaac at all. It doesn't claim that Isaac is his first, middle, given, Hebrew, or whatever name, it claims that Isaac is an error based on a "misunderstanding of his pen name". So in effect it claims that all sources of the last 50 years, including the vast majority of the article's own sources, got his name wrong. Somehow that makes me doubt their reliability - or the article's. --<a href="../../../h/u/o/User%7EHuon_18c0.html" title="User:Huon">Huon</a> 09:58, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
