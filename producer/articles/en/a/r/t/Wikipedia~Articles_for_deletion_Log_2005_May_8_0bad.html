<p>This was originally created as a link page by the same IP address that added the name to a list of "Notable Cinematographers" on the <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinematographer.html" title="Cinematographer">cinematographer</a> page. A vanity page? A quick search of Google reveals little exceptional work, nor would the IMDb indicate otherwise - in fact, not a single one of his works is even available at Amazon. I have no idea which Oscar or what category the last bit refers to. In any case, I don't believe that the body of work at all has justified a 'pedia entry; there are thousands of DPs working around the world, most without any mention here. The entry to the "notable" list, admittedly, ticks me off - virtually all of those names are widely recognizable and respected among the cinematographic community. --<a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirolamo_Savonarola_76cd.html" title="User:Girolamo Savonarola">User:Girolamo Savonarola</a></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, notable cinematographer with plenty of verifiable credits and awards. I wasn't able to verify the Oscar claim, but one of the films he shot did win an Emmy. I have since cleaned up the article, which sadly needed a complete rewrite to remove the unverifiable stuff. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 12:45, May 8, 2005 (UTC)

The problem is that Baska is not really an exceptional artist within his field, nor has he worked on anything terribly high profile. Virtually any working cinematographer can list various awards the films he's worked on have garnered. His own <a href="http://www.baska.com.au/roman/awards.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.baska.com.au/roman/awards.htm" rel="nofollow">site</a> only lists one cinematography <i>nomination</i>. I'm sorry, but I have difficulty believing this is not complete vanity - he's not even listed on the <a href="http://www.cinematographers.nl/INDEXA-C.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cinematographers.nl/INDEXA-C.htm" rel="nofollow">Cinematographer's Encyclopedia</a>, which has many many names listed that we don't. --<a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirolamo_Savonarola_76cd.html" title="User:Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a> 15:43, 2005 May 8 (UTC)</li>

<p>Something smells fishy about this one. According to the page history, it seems to be a place in Andorra. BUT: Google gets ONE hit for Berfontaine, and it ain't a place in Andorra. No Andorran official website I've found seems to mention any of the communes listed, and several of them have names which don't look French, Spanish, Catalan or even Basque or Occitan. I suspect a hoax.

<li>I looked hard for anything that would back this up and found nothing. The commune names seem to be from Bulgarian, Catalan, German and other languages, but I'm no expert. None of them came up as a commune or village, but a few are islands, hotels or just everyday words. It just doesn't seem like a hoax though, and google <i>doesn't</i> know everything. <b>No vote</b> —<a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeknic_08a9.html" title="User:Teknic"><span style="color:green">Teknic</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeknic_5e83.html" title="User talk:Teknic">Talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Teknic_013e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Teknic">Mail</a></sup> 05:01, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

The result of the debate was delete both.</p>
<p>I count 11 clear "delete" votes for Thirteenth grade, 6 "keep" votes (but two discounted - one anon user and one probable troll) and one "redirect". I count 13 clear "delete" votes for Fourteenth grade against one "keep" by a probable troll. I count three votes as too ambiguous to call though their tone is skeptical. I note that many people continued to vote to delete Thirteenth grade even after the rewrite, leading me to believe that the early voters deliberately chose not to change their votes. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 05:03, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> thirteenth grade now, rewritten. The article nominated was "Thirteenth grade is the first year of college in most countries.

<li>No one uses "Thirteenth grade" when speaking of a College Freshman - at all. That kills that one.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Thryduulf - agreed re: difficulty level of the original article edit [I'm the writer, so hello]. I've made several changes to the 1st draft, including relevant links and cues as to the context of the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Net.art.html" title="Net.art">net.art</a> genre, where mezangelle slots within this, some historical foregrounding, and links to other/potential wikipedia articles. This article is my first wikipedia foray, and is the testing ground for subsequent <a href="../../../n/e/t/Net.art.html" title="Net.art">net.art</a>-based/satellite articles [I'm especially keen to flesh out the article on <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codework.html" title="Codework">codework</a> and assume merging several of the articles could be a option]? I also assumed that edits were essentially an integral part of the wikipedia policy, and constructing the article through various rewrites was acceptable, rather than establishing from the get-go a polished, cohesive write. I intend to rewrite aspects of it given the overlap within the intended article-set devoted to the net.art field, with a comprehensive list of citations to accompany it/them [there is a mammoth amount of critical theory surrounding this genre]. If you require current validation of the genre/language/citations listed in the article, please feel free to google relevant terms such as <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=mezangelle&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=mezangelle&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">mezangelle</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22mary-anne+breeze%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22mary-anne+breeze%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">Mary-anne Breeze</a>, <a href="http://www.hotkey.net.au/~netwurker/nav.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.hotkey.net.au/~netwurker/nav.htm" rel="nofollow">netwurker</a>, <a href="http://www.litline.org/ABR/PDF/Volume22/sondheim.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.litline.org/ABR/PDF/Volume22/sondheim.pdf" rel="nofollow">codework</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=net.art&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=net.art&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">net.art</a> and judge their historical/educational value?

<li><b>Keep</b>, Obscurity is not a valid reason for deletion; consider a bird-watching guide with only the most common birds listed. I am an independent researcher at Indiana University and have been studying Mezangelle as a legitimate artistic style in the context of network formation. The style is referenced by multiple users across several locations in blogs and discussion boards and has the valuable qualities of distinctive form, unique name, and traceable dissemination across multiple internet locations. Unique, small, distinctive, labeled artistic styles have the benefit of allowing easy mapping of known (i.e. searchable in Google) links. Mapping searchable references to unique words is an effective tool for studying the dissemination of knowledge through the Internet and has value to research. Mezangelle is a genuine style used by multiple parties over a considerable period of time. Please leave the entry as a key means of communicating the definition of mezangelle to other researchers. 68.22.241.118 08:43, 9 May 2005 (UTC)John Burgoon

<li><b>Comment:</b> Again, mez here, the initial writer of the article under question. I'm resisting responding to any relevant comments or votes that do not adhere to officially stated Wikipedia Policy e.g. please do not bite the newcomers, <a href="../../../e/t/i/Wikipedia%7EEtiquette_76f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Etiquette">wikiquette</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_personal_attacks.html" title="No personal attacks">no personal attacks</a>, and <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civility.html" title="Civility">civility</a>. I'm also unkeen to respond to opinions or comments that aren't stated as recognised policy, such as referring to the content of the article as "not notable" or those votes based on material that could be considered spurious, speculative, or unsubstantiated eg "sock-puppet supported". I'm assuming those votes/actions/opinions that trangress those policies will be automatically discounted in the admin's final appraisal. What I am keen to address, however, is those comments and votes that do correspond to offical wikipedia policy and manage to successfully address the article without flippancy, sarcasm, or personal attacks. One of these comments/reasons is "<a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>", which is listed as a reason to support deletion votes. I'd like to suggest a reassessment of all votes based on this after considering the following information, which includes citations of relevant articles from 2003-2005 that list [at minimum] one peer-based review journal. I've also listed selected publications from this 2 year period [rather than a more comprehensive list from the decade preceding this] that have analysed or included mezangelle projects or exhibitions. The citations are not APA formatted, and include one of three New York Times articles involving mezangelle. Based on the citation-checking behaviour of the editors involved, I'm citing this evidence here for ease-of-access as it appears that they have not examined this material previous to voting:</li>

<dd>This article is needed only if an article on "Heterosexuality and morality" is also needed. But I don't see what use it would be to discuss either matter in such a context.

<dd>Don't you think that's a little reductive? The fact is that homosexuality is a distinct issue, and there are moral concerns associated with it. Saying "this article is needed only if an article on 'heterosexuality and morality' is also needed" is ridiculous. Should we also have one on "heterophobia," "anti-hetero slogan," "societal attitudes towards heterosexuality," "heterosexuality and religion," "hetero rights?" Though I agree the article is poorly written, especially the "reactions" section which needs some serious editing in the name of neutrality, and personally I don't think it would be missed if it were deleted, but if it were heavily revised instead, it would serve a valid encyclopedic function.

<li><b>Comments.</b> Regarding POV of content: This type of article is not designed to report whether or not homosexuality is right or wrong. It is intended to collect <i>what various parties think and say</i> about the subject. It can easily be NPOV in that a variety of viewpoints are covered, and no one in particular is favored by the article. Regarding the need for a "heterosexual foo" for every "homosexual foo": Such parallelism is makes for significant redundancy and a very short "heterosexual foo". It's much more useful, I've found, just to make "sexual orientation foo", and cover all aspects. I should note that we also have <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_morality.html" title="Sexual morality">Sexual morality</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_norm.html" title="Sexual norm">Sexual norm</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/u/Causes_of_sexual_orientation.html" title="Causes of sexual orientation">Causes of sexual orientation</a> is no longer its own article, by the way; I merged it into <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_orientation.html" title="Sexual orientation">Sexual orientation</a>. Pies and bassoons are different from sexuality, in that whatever moral implications their use may have, they are not the subject of raging national cultural and political controversies. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 02:56, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Move information to other articles as appropriate</b>. There is also a case for <b>moving some information to a new article: Homosexuality and ethics</b>, since there have been specific ethical positions consistently used to both condemn and justify homosexuality (natural law theory, divine command theory, and Kantianism on the one hand, and utilitarianism as a good example of the other).

<dd>I am the author/mantainer of this project and I'm suggesting this article to be deleted, possibly moving some parts of it to specific articles (such as tokenization, etc.). This article page was set up by one developer a long time ago and probably isn't very useful nowadays. The project is not actually "dead", the development has moved to an active project on computational linguistics (at <a href="http://hermes.sf.net/" class="external autonumber" title="http://hermes.sf.net/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>) that, one day, could result in a "new" Traduki. However, at this time, Traduki is almost inexistent and certainly is useless - thus this article can be quite confusing. As the author, it would be really good to have an article on it, but only when the software actually cames into existence. What do you people think?</dd>

Just because they're not mainstream doesn't mean they shouldn't be here. --<a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirolamo_Savonarola_76cd.html" title="User:Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a> 03:43, 2005 May 8 (UTC)

<li>Also looking at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> section, they have clearly qualified under criterion number 2 (see <a href="http://www.grandbuffet.com/news.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.grandbuffet.com/news.htm" rel="nofollow">Official site</a>) as they are currently touring in Europe; they have done this before, as well as going on several US nationwide tours and at least one tour of Canada (see article). I'd also argue criterion 6, although that is of course not as objectively verifiable as number 2. They also have representation via the Kork Agency, which handles many significant indie music acts; they've played SXSW; and toured with Wesley Willis. --<a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirolamo_Savonarola_76cd.html" title="User:Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a> 04:04, 2005 May 8 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's simply not true. Notability is an established and widely used shorthand that well captures many deletion criteria. Please see my <a href="../../../v/f/d/Wikipedia_talk%7EVfD_decisions_not_backed_by_current_policies_ab58.html" title="Wikipedia talk:VfD decisions not backed by current policies">earlier explanation</a> on this point.

<li>Actually, the working reference given above is a clear demonstration of the fact that "non-notability" is <i>not</i> a valid deletion criterion. A mere personal shorthand used by <i>some</i> editors is not a policy consensus - as the immediately adjacent reference to "unencyclopedic" even more clearly shows. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 23:58, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed. Postdlf, what you 'understand' to be policy may just possibly not actually <i>be</i> policy.&#160;:-) I would agree, however, that it is indeed erroneously becoming "established" - this is exactly what I'm trying to fix. <a href="../../../j/d/f/User%7EJdforrester_f39b.html" title="User:Jdforrester">James F.</a> <a href="../../../j/d/f/User_talk%7EJdforrester_2f42.html" title="User talk:Jdforrester">(talk)</a> 00:03, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Since when did we need a policy consensus on what words we could use to express ourselves on VfD pages? It's the substance that matters, and the substance of "not notable" is not only always tied to specific deletion criteria, it often overlaps more than one. I went into quite a bit of detailed explanation to show how notability is at the heart of at least most of the deletion criteria—can you elaborate on "no, you're wrong," or "no, we never approved that word for expressive usage"? <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 04:40, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Umm, whut? Where on Earth did you get the impression that I was objecting to the word? I'm pointing out that notability - the concept, not the word - is not a ground for deletion. You can bend over backwards to show that other people have been using it as such, and indeed this is helpful to show where people have erred, but they are using it wrongly. There are many occassions when things that are unnotable <i>also</i> aren't suitable for the encyclopædia, but this is <i>not</i> a causal link. <a href="../../../j/d/f/User%7EJdforrester_f39b.html" title="User:Jdforrester">James F.</a> <a href="../../../j/d/f/User_talk%7EJdforrester_2f42.html" title="User talk:Jdforrester">(talk)</a> 12:59, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think you're still missing the whole thrust of what I was saying, but let's drop it here.

<li>I guess this is now my standard <i>Idol</i> contestant vote: <b>Keep</b>. By the policy that each episode of a major television series merits an article, we could recast all the losing contestant articles into Australian Idol season 2 episode (Dan O'Connor eliminated), etc., or however we'd title them.

<li><b>Keep</b> this person has ongoing notability - Dan O'Connor is now starring in a soap opera in Australia, but quite a different one as it will feature on mobile phones (please see updated article and associated link to <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> article). The proposal to delete this article was too soon (only just over 6 months after the chap was eliminated from Ausralian Idol). It seems that in Australia an Idol finalist is likely to have a career break into the entertainment industry. A search on Australian google (it is a common name after all) indicates that he has been employed in bits and pieces since the television show. There are plenty less notable biographies on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 23:41, 8 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Both imdb and tvtome like the allmusic.com website are US web sites. It seems to have escaped some people's notice that he is an Australian. Like other Australians he is under-represented in such US web sites. Reference to representation on these web sites is a fine criteria for evaluating a US actor or musician - it is not OK for other places in the world. Australian soaps are extremely popular in the UK and Europe and thus it is quite an export industry for our nation. Hence in Wikipedia there are a lot of minor soap stars with wiki biographies - eg the entire cast of <i>Neighbours</i> past and present seems to score their own individual entry. This person is at least as notable as the others.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 08:11, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Penises come in different sizes (though not as differently as some people appear to enjoy thinking). Sometimes they're "small". It might be a bit "humiliating" (or embarrassing or discomforting or whatever) to be a postpubertal male and have one that's small (or bent over, or bifurcated, or green, or decorated with the "Louis Vuitton" monogram, or whatever). Thereupon you'd have "small penis humiliation". It's a string of words that appears to be used by sellers of snake-oil, or perhaps I should say trouser-snake-oil, to the gullible and nervous; and also perhaps by easily amused teenagers, etc. It's too trivial, a mere arbitrary string of words to be giggled at.</p>
<p>But perhaps I'm wrong. Could somebody with medical or psychotherapeutic knowledge set us straight? Then I might change my vote from <b>delete</b>. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 08:05, 2005 May 8 (UTC)</p>

<li>It's crap, but it's slightly different crap than Hoary's description; it's not about run-of-the-mill embarrassment at having a small penis, but about a form of sex play that involves actually being <i>subjected</i> to a partner's verbal humiliation regarding one's penis size, and could conceivably be engaged in even if one were hung like <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Holmes_%28actor%29_3609.html" title="John Holmes (actor)">John Holmes</a>. People really will get off on just about <i>anything</i>.

<li><b>Don't delete</b> It is a paraphilia, analagous to exhibitionism or cuckoldry or some other oddity of human sexuality. Don't shoot the messenger. The paraphilia is a fact, exists , especially in porn and on the internet. It seems like people are opposed simply because they don't like the practice. I think it is becoming a bigger factor now as the media draws more attention to the size issue. See the BBC's new autobiographical documentary called "My penis and I" about a man with a small penis.

<li>Hoary, first you claim the phrase was entirely arbitrary. I pointed out that the phrase has 4000+ hits using quotes (not 400--why don't you correct your misinformation for Rift?)--and even has it's own forums and communities. Hell, the BBC has a documentary on the phenomenon! How many BBC doumentaries did that band get? Furthermore, the merging right away doesn't make much sense. Is it better to have smaller articles specialized for a topic and linked to related ones, or really long articles which contain everything -- a single page for all human paraphilias? All of the merge pages suggested were empty, redirects or lack content, ie. there is no big list of paraphilias. I suggest that since there is no hurry to delete this (again no real reason why has come forward, only that it is 'trivial' or 'not my thing' which is purely subjective) why not just leave it as a stub, see how it goes, and then keep it or merge it based upon the results. By the way, just reading the Wikipedia guide for deletion policy, it mentions this: <i>"All Wikipedians, however, should try not to appear terse, gruff, and abrupt in their VFD postings. All Wikipedians should do their best to treat contributors with respect and good will."</i> So does "grow the hell up" and "not encyclopedick" qualify? Thanks. <i>...added anonymously at 07:03 (and about 20 minutes later) 2005 May 10 by 62.180.212.222</i>

<li><b>Comment</b>: User:62.180.212.222, I didn't give a number of hits for this phrase, I merely pointed out that (i) a similar one had 400 or so hits, and (ii) the (unrelated) band Henry Cow had very more hits. Sorry, I don't know about BBC documentaries about Henry Cow. Incidentally, I do know that Channel 4 once had a (rather amusing) "documentary" titled "The Sex Shogun of Shinjuku": it was about a porn actor/producer called Muranishi who wasn't at all like a shōgun and had nothing to do with Shinjuku (merely chosen for alliterative effect). But all right, the phrase isn't arbitrary. And I think I've treated people with good will. (Incidentally, I'm opposed to any warning against terseness. Terseness is a Good Thing: it saves time.) -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:50, 2005 May 10 (UTC)

<li>Okay, so now you admit it is not arbitrary or random, but claim it is only a tiny number of people. Well how do you know? You don't have to answer that if you don't want to.&#160;:-) I checked Google Groups, and it gave 2000 plus pages in discussions. The phrase Wikipedia gets 60,000 there. That's only 30 times more. I'm not sure what that says about the people who frequent Google Groups (LOL) but it shows that it is a topic being discussed. Also, the terseness was not objectionable, but the rudeness (not by you but by people like Rift, who also kindly vandalized the main page before slinking off). <i>...added at 18:42 (and three minutes later), 2005 May 10 by Soda80</i>
<ul>
<li>I don't know that it's a tiny number of people; I was wondering if there was evidence that it was more than a tiny number of people. Google (the search engine, not the groups bit) suggests to me that this phrase is used by spammers (among others); if this is indeed so, I'm not surprised that it pops up in talk forums. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:35, 2005 May 11 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But Spammers appeal to what sells, whether you like it or not. If ads for SPH chat lines are common, it must be because people are secretly calling them, somewhat similar to dubious penis enlargement. By the way, without quotes SPH gets 355,000 hits. Overall this shows a preoccupation with penis size, yet a taboo on talking about it. SPH certainly does exist, on the internet, in adult videos, and phone sex lines, and amateur communities. I wonder why it is so bad to actually talk about it here? <i>... added at 08:45, 2005 May 11 by Soda80</i>
<ul>
<li>I haven't encountered ads for "SPH chat lines". I have encountered spam in which companies claim to increase dick size in order to avoid possible humiliation. That looks like the attempted inculcation of dangers that the potential customer hadn't even imagined -- a very old sales technique. Spammers also make great use of the phrase "horny 18-year-old sluts", but of itself this doesn't show (to me, at least) that WP need have an article on Horny 18-year-old sluts. 355,000 hits does sound quite a lot, but since it's not for the phrase but merely the cooccurrence of the three words this proves nothing. And I'm left wondering whether you're talking about the prevalence of this humiliation or the prevalence of talking about it. Lastly, please sign your entries with four twiddles: ~~~~.

<p>Describes a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perpetual_motion.html" title="Perpetual motion">perpetual motion</a> device that violates the laws of physics, probably spam. "The magic wheel generator is a free energy device in the sense that the electricity is zero cost ($0), except for the cost of buying the device." <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> 12:38, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The author added after the Vfd started "The magic wheel generator is not a perpetual motion machine. Eventually, the magnets lose their magnetism, and the wheel slows down. However, this takes over a hundred years to happen. The magnetism can be renewed by shocking the magnets with electricity. Also, it is not solid state. Because of it's moving part, it can break down." The usual perpetual motion machine claims of energy at zero cost still remain with statements like " If every home has private magic wheel generators in them, then no one would have to pay electric bills and home heating bills." <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> 13:04, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is rubbish. Nothing like this could exist, as indicated by the article <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_perpetual_motion_machines.html" title="History of perpetual motion machines">History of perpetual motion machines</a> - and I quote:</p>
<pre>
The lead allegedly blocked attraction as each magnet passes by it, so the wheel would keep moving for a time before
friction stopped it.
</pre>
<p>How could energy be got from such a 'magic wheel'? It couldn't. The author has spent too much time reading his socialist hippy propoganda magazine, 'The Free-Energy Device Handbook'.

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. This article is completely incorrect. Because of the lack of gravity in space, this wheel would stop moving in the right direction. And the magnets would make the wheel stop moving once they were located across their opposite pole. Even changing the polarization of the electric magnet in this thing wouldn't make the wheel move further.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>I've seen such a machine in Science class years ago and it didn't work then, so it won't now. Besides, if free energy is possible, wouldn't universities and corporations and loads of other people use it by now? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 14:57, May 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

Agree with Megan1967 and others: there's nothing inherently notable about this subtopic. Virtually all high-selling bands have some of their songs, especially hits, covered by other bands, usually wannabees, regardless of whether the material is high-quality or notable. It's also not very maintainable as new covers continue to be released. List of Pearl Jam songs covered by Johnny Cash would at least evince some notability, if there were enough examples for a list, but this topic hardly involves any significance at all. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 17:36, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Normally, I would have listed it under a speedy, but considering I was unsure if it was real or not, I chose to take the cautious path. In any case, unless we've got an article we can merge this into, I still say we should kill it. --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 20:25, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>How is this notable for one line for a character in a movie that doesn't even have an entry yet? Yes, if we even had a stub for the movie, we might have a place to merge this into. But as Starblind says, there's no point to having subsubsubstubs. --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 23:54, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I think you misunderstood. It says "born in 1337" as in 1337 <b>THE YEAR</b>! Also it says Zhang Wuji is a character in a book by the novelist <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jinyong.html" title="Jinyong">Jinyong</a>, who is said to be one of China's most influential novelists.

<li>Then some work is going to be done on it. Right now it reads exactly as I saw it, and a layman will think exactly as I did - it's a stupid prank. It's clear that this person/character does exist, and if so, the article will have to be expanded upon. But until then, it looks like a nuisance page, and until someone at least spruces it up a tad, my opinion is that it should be nuked. --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 00:08, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>I started going through google for this but I'm not finding anything enclyclopedic. Most of the entries seem to be jokes (or preposterous bragging). The original entry may have involved using the term to derogatorilly describe circumcision. I did find a hit that used this terminology for circumcision, but that is not what the article is talking about. Could rewrite it to an article about how some people refer to circumcision as penis reduction surgery (if this is common enough to warrant it) but otherwise delete as non-sense (unless someone can find evidence this actually exists and documents it). <a href="../../../r/j/f/User%7ERJFJR_0643.html" title="User:RJFJR">RJFJR</a> 21:05, May 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regarding comments below, the phrase "neighborhood" is probably not the best one here, although it may be what people locally use. It's definitely not the same thing in any way as <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bel-Air%2C_Los_Angeles%2C_California_a3b5.html" title="Bel-Air, Los Angeles, California">Bel-Air, Los Angeles, California</a>, which is a district within an urban setting, or most "neighborhood" articles in Wikipedia. Although I haven't been to this particular New Jersey community, if it is like many unincorporated communities, then it is probably a stand-alone, recognizable unincorporated community, with its own post office and zip code. Here's the Google search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Newfoundland%2C+New+Jersey&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Newfoundland%2C+New+Jersey&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, for example. I know for a fact that it appears on the map as would a real "town". The culprit here is the strange, somewhat archaic boundaries of New Jersey municipalities, which quite often diverge from the actual community structures which have emerged over the last 100 years. Some "towns" in New Jersey are almost like sub-counties, drawing together several distinct unincorporated communities into a common governmental structure. -- <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDecumanus_9e44.html" title="User:Decumanus">Decumanus</a> 23:30, 2005 May 9 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't delete: he was in all those productions. Actually he's not an understudy. He alternated with another boy named Neil Shastri so he did half of the performances and Neil did half of the peroformances. The Actor's Equity Union has a rule that any minor cannot perform more than 4 shows a week. Therefore I say Tanvir should not be deleted.</p>

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 18 "delete" votes, 6 "keep as is" votes, 3 "keep but move" or "merge" votes and 3 votes too ambiguous to call. Most of the delete votes very clearly objected to the early content. The article was extensively rewritten on 12 May. Voters after the rewrite remained split with (my count) 3 "deletes" to 2 "keeps". Only one person appeared to return to change his/her vote. (I'm not sure whether this was because they reviewed the revised article and were unswayed by the changes or whether this is a result of the recent decision to chop up the VfD page, making it more cumbersome to review previous discussions.)</p>
<p>I am going to call this one as a "no concensus" (which defaults to keep for now). If, after a reasonable period of time (and potentially a name change), this article still has not fully resolved the issues discussed below, it may become appropriate to renominate this article for deletion.</p>

<dd>Irrelevant. Metaphysically, morality is much more susceptible to POV-only speech than pedophilia is. You can point to "pedophilia", out there in the real world, and talk about it in NPOV terms (even though, I'll admit, it's hard to do so and it's very easy to switch into POV language). It's much harder to point to "morality" in the real world and talk about it in the same way. (Pragmatically, it's probably <i>easier</i> to talk about "morality" without getting tempers flaring, but that's not my point—my point is that pedophilia <i>can</i> be discussed in an NPOV way.) <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreyHarris_636a.html" title="User:TreyHarris">TreyHarris</a> 23:20, 8 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep pending re-write</b> - While, doubtlessly, this article would become as controversial/argued over/vandalized as much as the NAMBLA article (ick *shudder*), there is a fair handful of information that could be put here... though ensuring it is NPOV would take significant effort on the behalf of several individuals. If nothing more, it could look at (as already included) the history of pedophilia advocates trying to piggyback upon LGBT organizations back during the fledgling stages of the gay pride/rights movement, as well as address more current events, such as Texas' most recent legislation preventing GLBT Americans from adopting children - even to the point of allowing the state to investigate foster parent hopefuls to make sure they aren't hiding their sexual orientation - due to the legislator's reliance upon the trumped up "research" of Dr. Cameron.

<li>No vote. I disagree with the nominators attitude of equating pedophilia with child abuse; take a look at <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">pedophilia</a>. In particular, "pedophilia can be diagnosed solely in the presence of fantasies or sexual urges on the subject's part — it need not involve sexual acts with children". It also discusses the media's misuse of the term. This article isn't terrible, and in fact it doesn't even appear to directly connect homosexuality to pedophilia (it only claims that certain activists act on behalf of both groups). However, unless verifiable references are given I'm not giving a keep. <a href="../../../d/c/o/User%7EDcoetzee_a2a7.html" title="User:Dcoetzee">Deco</a> 04:50, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> there has been historically a strong tendency to validate pederasty as the only acceptable version of homosexuality. It is also just a political maneuver, albeit a common and useful one, to say, "people exclusively attracted to the same sex who are also primarily attracted to underage people aren't gay". The gay rights movement was also allied for a time with groups like NAMBLA. Finally, there is a strong tendency in modern society to connect homosexuality to pedophilia. These are all valid topics for an article with the title <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia_and_homosexuality.html" title="Pedophilia and homosexuality">Pedophilia and homosexuality</a>. The article as it stands reads to me not so much like an anti-gay POV as an anti-linking-pedophilia-with-homosexuality-in-any-way POV. It needs to be rewritten, but a useful article could have this title. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 08:46, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note: Women and pedophilia aren't seen as connected in our society, and neither are heterosexuality and pedophilia. Men and pedophilia might be a valid article title, because there is a perceived connection. Look, the purpose of an article with a title like <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia_and_homosexuality.html" title="Pedophilia and homosexuality">Pedophilia and homosexuality</a> doesn't have to be to reinforce that connection (though it would be POV to insist the two never intersect). It can just as well be used to dispel the myth of a necessary connection while at the same time noting that, like heterosexual relationships, throughout much of history the kind of gay relationships people were most likely to see were intergenerational. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 19:04, May 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I dispute that <i>"Women and pedophilia aren't seen as connected in our society, and neither are heterosexuality and pedophilia"</i>: there are many incidents reported in the popular press of women pedophiles. Similarly, there are many incidents of "heterosexual" pedophillia. I agree in principal that the subject can be discussed neutrally with the above but I don't think this page title is the place to have such an article. Too many editors in Wikipedia use article titles as POV and make dubious connections between things explicit. The defence is always that it's just a title! A policy of neutrality should not only apply to article content, but also to article title's. --<a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 10:19, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is a huge difference between knowing that something happens and believing that there is a connection between two things. Of course people know that straight people molest children. I don't think, though, that most people, on the news or not, believe that women molest children. Regardless, if you want to find out, go out and ask 50 people to rate in order who they would feel most comfortable leaving their child alone with: a straight woman they don't know, a straight man they don't know, a lesbian they don't know, or a gay man they don't know. Gay men will come out on the bottom, straight women on the top. Whether or not they're willing to admit it, a lot of people believe at some level that gay men are after children in one way or another. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 05:01, May 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argument_from_common_consent.html" title="Argument from common consent">argument from common consent</a> is fallacious here - no-one disputes that some people link pedophillia with homosexuality (although I dispute your hypothetical example - evidence?). The point is irrelevant in a discussion on how to present such discussion neutrally without making explicit a controversial link and creating a non-neutral title for an article. This also does not negate my point that there have been high-profile cases of alleged straight-female pedophiles and yet this does not warrent a page on women and pedophillia, for example. --<a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 11:08, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're exactly right, IMO. As <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> said, "A useful article could have this title." The connection (if any) between pedophilia and homosexuality has been famously and heatedly debated in society; it's a natural (if contentious) topic for an article. I would urge people who vote to delete to consider two other points: 1) just because an article is POV is not a valid reason to delete it -- the preferred approach is to fix it (see <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>); and 2) if you google "pedophilia" and "homosexuality" you get about 85,000 hits. I don't think most of these hits get you to NPOV articles -- Wikipedia could provide one of the few. I would think that in particular those people interested in gay-related issues would want an accurate article widely available, rather than abandon the issue to polemicists on the Internet. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> 09:23, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Aside: This points to an interesting issue. The topic of "Pedophilia and homosexuality" is an extremely well known one. If this article is deleted (or watered down via renaming and the like in order to palliate the actual issue), it automatically goes to the top of the list of "Well-known topics that are <a href="../../../t/a/b/Taboo.html" title="Taboo">taboo</a> on Wikipedia." That's pretty fascinating, considering that Wikipedia covers (in theory) pretty much everything of significance; those interested in Wikipedia as a sociological/cultural phenomenon will want to take note. Are there are other well-known topics that are taboo as the subject of an article?

The fact <i>is</i> that, whether or not they're true, there are popular links between pedophilia and especially gay male homosexuality. Discussion of these links, where they come from (there is some great literature on the topic), and so on, is important, and worthwhile. I, of course, think this article should stay, but if it is deleted, any relevant points should be moved to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">Homosexuality</a>, not just <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a>, since the focus of the beliefs is on what <i>gay people</i> do, not what all pedophiles do. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 19:42, May 11, 2005 (UTC)'

<li>I don't think anyone arguing to keep actually believes that homosexuals are much more likely to be pedophiles than heterosexuals.

<li>I'll just cut and paste from a previous comment that covers this complaint as well: <i>There is a huge difference between knowing that something happens and believing that there is a connection between two things. Of course people know that straight people molest children. I don't think, though, that most people, on the news or not, believe that women molest children. Regardless, if you want to find out, go out and ask 50 people to rate in order who they would feel most comfortable leaving their child alone with: a straight woman they don't know, a straight man they don't know, a lesbian they don't know, or a gay man they don't know. Gay men will come out on the bottom, straight women on the top. Whether or not they're willing to admit it, a lot of people believe at some level that gay men are after children in one way or another.</i> -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 03:45, May 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There are far too many statements that are put forth as fact (without reference) that are completely *FALSE* based on what (at least I) consider to be the definitive opinion - that of mental health professionals. It was unanimously declared by mental health professionals that homosexuality is not a disorder and that homosexuals can live normal, healthy lives; this has never been asserted about practicing pedophiles. Thus the comment "Of course, homosexuality was once considered (and is still considered by some) to be a psychological affliction" would seem to me to be <i>original research</i> in that it states the <b>complete opposite</b> of what is believed by the world of mental health professionals. I don't care if those "some" that still believe it are millions of people worldwide; millions of people also believe that other people should be property based on skin color. This article is littered with non-factual comments and that is just so; my (or anyone's) opinion on the content is not relevant. So, in this vein, it has also been asserted that there is *NO* association between pedophilia and homosexuality by these same mental health professionals. Not *SOME*, not *MAYBE,* but *NONE.* To use analogy, saying there is a connection because SOME pedophiles are also homosexuals is like saying that because *SOME* heterosexuals practice S&amp;M, there is a connection between S&amp;M and heterosexuality. And this is quickly dissolving into a rant, so if you haven't gotten the point by now, you never will... <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 05:36, 16 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm. Perhaps the problem here is that we're viewing the article in different ways. I see it as a sociology article, chronicalling why homosexuality and pedophilia have been historically linked despite the complete lack of scientific correlation. You seem concerned that it is a psychology/biology article that will condemn homosexuality as related to pedophilia. I would ask that you consider the article as sociology - not having it would be comparable to having no article explaining that "millions of people also believe that other people should be property based on skin color" (which is clearly of note). <a href="../../../l/i/z/User%7ELizardWizard_a997.html" title="User:LizardWizard">LizardWizard</a> 08:46, May 16, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think that's right on target with what he/she is saying though. Just because some people think there is a link between pedephilia and homosexuality doesn't make it so. I don't know how I can stress this point more clearly than I did above. It is a false conclusion based on non-logic! Look at it analogously: All scissors are used for cutting. Some scissors are used to cut bananas. Therefore all scissors are used to cut bananas. Does that make sense? No! You're jumping to a conclusion that has not been proven. Just because SOME pedophiles happen to <b>ALSO BE HOMOSEXUALS</b> does not link the two. If that was the case we would have an article called "Pedophilia and Blonde Hair" or "Pedophilia and Left-Handed-People", using the exact same kind of logic. Why not have an article called "Pedophilia and Molestation Survivors?"...since it far more likely that a pedophile was abused themself than it is that they are a genuine homosexual person. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 21:19, 16 May 2005 (UTC)

A discussion of the fact that people think there is a necessary connection, that at certain periods in the past pederasty, at least, has been thought to be the only acceptable form of homosexuality, and so on, would make for a perfectly acceptable article. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 21:47, May 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

For example, the link you suggest is between pedophillia advocacy and gay rights, not homosexuality and pedophillia!

The fact is that the practices predate the <i>modern</i> concept of pedophilia itself (though the term is encountered in antiquity). As a matter of fact, we should think about making some distinction between pedophilia as a psychological dysfunction, with its constellation of social and sexual disabilities, and pedophilia as a cultural practice engaged in by healthy members of societies with other standards than our own (see <a href="http://www2.rz.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/GUS/MIDDLEEAST.HTM" class="external autonumber" title="http://www2.rz.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/GUS/MIDDLEEAST.HTM" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> on the Talmudic view of the betrothal of three-year-old girl children, and Gilbert Herdt on the Melanesian boy-insemination rites, for example.</li>

<li>The article is inherently POV, as its name is POV. At the least, the name should be changed. Proposed names: 1) 'Pedophilia and sexuality'</li>
<li>The article itself is inherently POV, as no link exists between homosexuality as a sexual orientation and pedophilia as a 'sexual orientation' or mental affliction. Deletion is the only remedy. The content of this article should be moved to other articles.</li>
<li>Though the article may be biased now, it could be edited to be NPOV. Criticism of the article should be put tp use, to remove bias.</li>
<li>This content should be merged with <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">pedophilia</a></li>
<li>This content should be merged with <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childlove_movement.html" title="Childlove movement">childlove movement</a></li>
<li>This content should be merged with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-gay_slogan.html" title="Anti-gay slogan">anti-gay slogan</a>; as the percieved link is often used as a slur.</li>
<li>The article shouldn't be removed, regardless of bias. Wikipedia needs an article like this, and removing it would be biased and would suggest a <a href="../../../t/a/b/Taboo.html" title="Taboo">taboo</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I may have missed a few points. In my opinion, the article should remain. I would not object to a rename, provided the new name was fitting.

<li><b>Delete</b>, neologism not in widespread use, trivial content with no potential to become encyclopedic. Would Kappa also say that line-numbering conventions in BASIC are encyclopedic? Variable capitalization conventions in Visual C++? The convention for what column holds the continuation indicator for commands longer than 80 characters in FORTRAN? All are code layout conventions of at least as much significance as whether a THEN clause's end-brace and an ELSE clause's start-brace are on the same line as the "else" keyword between them. I could imagine finding them somewhere in Wikibooks, but as a programmer for over a quarter-century, I can say that none of these are significant enough for a WP article. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 17:51, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Challenged to delete false data I did. The article now reads</li>
</ul>
<p>Young Earth Creationists base their beliefs on the evidence from Scripture, such as described in Genesis Chapters 1-3, clarified in Exodus 20:9-11, and alluded to by Christ, Himself, in Matthew 19:4</p>
<p>They also pick and choose from many different Geophysical, Astronomical, Bioligical, and Historical evidences to justify their prior held beliefs.</p>
<p>For example, the oldest living tree is between 4,000 and 5,000 years old, and yet it is still living. Perhaps it will live for another 10,000 (or more years). Using this as one evidence that something happened about 4,500 years ago that wiped out virtually all life on Planet Earth, such as the Flood of Noah is an example of that picking and choosing. 4.250.201.207 12:10, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Regardless of content change, the name of the page itself does not lend itself for Wikipedia's purposes—it ends in a comma.

Any kind of superstition that garners this much controversy is noteworthy, but it's been better-documented before, and WP doesn't need poorly-presented and poorly-titled pieces rehashing the old unscientific claims.
