<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable Brigadier General and probable vanity. Non-notable because in looking at the other Brigadier Generals that have wiki articles, they all have a major accomplishment or scandal tied to them. <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Bryant_Jr_cf85.html" title="Albert Bryant Jr">Albert Bryant Jr</a>'s involvment with the 4th ID (of which one unit actually captured Saddam Hussein) is probably the most notable thing in this article, but he was not personally involved in the capture. The rest of the article details some great accomplishments, but nothing that really stands out from the accomplishments of other military top brass... which brings me to my second point: vanity. I don't know what relation User25be is to the Bryant's but the level of biographical detail in all these articles, the pictures, and the trail of edits User25be has made (all are about Bryants or auxillary articles about awards they've acheived, etc.) lead me to believe that this is something of a vanity project for this user. User25be has a real flair for writing wiki articles; technically these articles are near perfect... my only beef is that there is too much information in some articles (for example Renee Bryant's awards listed in articles other then her own). I hope that regardless of the outcome of these AfD's User25be continues to contribute because he or she has a real knack for writing.</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> for a couple of reasons. Let's dispense with the less weighty one first: I came across this article while following links from other articles being considered for deletion and I found myself actually interested. This family is obviously accomplished and by the time I got to this bio, I felt like I had learned something. That kind of gut reaction, genuine interest in the subject generated by the entry, means something. With the extended bandwith Wikipedia has to offer, as I mentioned in another post, there is room for the "B-listers" who are notable, if not as notable as those who can be included in more restricted informational resources. The second is that I legitimately feel this person is notable, but notable in sum, if not for one reason only. The accomplishments are legitimate and the career is clearly noted. The link to Saddam Hussein's capture is legitimate as he was the Assistant Division Commander of the unit. It would be different if he were a fellow soldier, but he was the second in command at the time and that is significant. Also, his wife has won the third and fourth highest awards the Secretary of the Army can award to civilians, and his son is a decorated veteran as well (this is bolstered when you look at some of the other Bryant entries...this is clearly a military "dynasty" of sorts, with EVERY SINGLE eligible member--subject, subject's father, subject's father-in-law--making it to the General Officer level, and son and wife receiving military decorations, as well as the other son working on the highest-profile Coast Guard project undertaken. I am from a military family myself and thus know that these are not things easily achieved and I have great respect for the people who have done so (my father and grandfather never got past MAJ and LTC in 20 and 25 years respectively, and they were not chopped liver.)
<ul>
<li><i>Though I do wish user25be had offered more than a cut-and-paste of BG Bryant's official bio. If he/she is as close to the subjects as he/she appears to be (which in of itself should NOT be a disqualifying factor) I think a fleshed out entry would give us a better idea of whether or not this person is as notable as he appears to be (or not to be). If he/she reads this before the 5-day period closes, I invite user25be to elaborate (and justify, to an extent) his/her inclusion of these entries. I have noted that I believe some of his/her entries are strong keeps, while others are weak keeps. I would appreciate his/her reasoning. el_amante 20:12, 12 October 2005</i></li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Deputy Commander of Fort Knox qualifies as notable -- <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrmooky_35fe.html" title="User:Mrmooky">Mrmooky</a> 15:13, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but rewrite. Being in charge of the unit that captured Saddam Hussein makes him notable. But, calling him "BG Bryant" before he's actually promoted to Brigadier General is misleading, and the overall tone, to me, sounds a bit un-<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>. Otherwise, there's a lot of useful information, especially to someone writing a report on Fort Knox or the capture of Saddam Hussein. -<a href="../../../o/d/d/User%7EOddtoddnm_7ab2.html" title="User:Oddtoddnm">Oddtoddnm</a> 18:41, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
