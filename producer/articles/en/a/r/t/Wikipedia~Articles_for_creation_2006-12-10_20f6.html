<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-10_20f6.html" title="Edit section: Piarun">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Piarun</span></h2>
<p>In this article I will try to apply to the image of Piarun - an ancient God of thunderstorm and war. Choosing of this exactly God for resolute examination can be argued in following way. Yes, paganism includes in itself a big number of cults, and different aspects of our ancestors' belief are quite suitable for various life and historical situations. But in this very moment the historical epoch demands the revival of a rather certain cult. In the decisive battle against judeo-christian domination and demo-liberalism we must to be headed only by God of war, hate and courage - Piarun. No way to any snotty rituals of love and brotherhood in the modern communities of pseudo-pagans! Only destruction (personification of which is Piarun) is able to become a creative power! War till the victorious end! Death to deceitful christian dogs! That's what this God carries in himself and we must praise him! Not in vain the symbol of national-socialistic Germany was Wotan; the same must be happen in Belarus as well as in neighboring countries.</p>
<p>Perhaps none of Baltic/Slavonic pagan Gods cause such a great number of debates and wide-ranging opinions as Piarun. This God is thunderspewer, whom the natural elements of thunderstorm, thunder and lightning obeyed. Piarun was also a God of war, and that is an Indo-European tradition, where the thunder god most frequently carries out the war function as well. Thunder god is one of the most stable images of Aryan mythology - just draw parallels with such well-known Gods as Thor, Donar and Zeus. But the largest quantity of common features can be found when we apply to the images of Perkunas from Lithuanian mythology and Perkons from Latvian heritage. Also there can be traced the ethimological connection between Piarun and Parjania - one of the names of God Indra (the master of rain, thunder and lightning).</p>
<p>This information lets us date the origin of Piarun back to the common Indo-European epoch. V.V. Ivanov and V.N. Toporov believe that the epoch of Thunderspewer can be identified on the grounds of such specific features as the attributes of this hero of the myth (horse, chariot and bronze weapon together with outdated signs of stone arrows of the Thunderspewer). The appearance of these elements and their Indo-European names can be dated back to the beginning of the heroic epoch of settlement of Indo-Europeans seemingly from the end of the III millenium BC.</p>
<p>The name of Piarun is more frequently mentioned in chronicles, preachings against paganism and other mediaeval written records than the name of any other heathen God. The basic role in this phenomenon belongs to the reform of the pagan cult held in 980 by the knyaz Vladimir Sviatoslavich, the essence of which was in establishment of a strict pantheon of Gods headed by Piarun. No doubt, that Thundergod, the God of war at the same time the guardian of a social layer which lived on thanks to war, i.e. of prince's host, and consequently of prince's power. So, the universal pantheon was headed by Piarun, and that undoubtedly was to reflect in the social relations, where the full power became to concentrate in the hands of the great knyaz. This is how the chronicle describes it: "And there began to rule Vladimir in Kiev all by himself. And [he] put the idols outside the royal yard: wooden Piarun with silver head and golden whiskers, and Khors, and Dazhbog, and Stribog, and Simargl, and Mokash…"</p>
<dl>
<dd>The attempt of reform, in view of the fact of its obvious artificiality (the regional peculiarities of Kryvija and Novgorod weren't taken into consideration) failed. And then, to strengthen his personal dominion Vladimir betrayed the ancient sacred traditions (upon which he had already mocked enough) in favor of the jewish monotheism. And thus the christian plague came on to Slavonic and Baltic lands and thus the sacred knowledge became to fade, spilled with the blood of killed volhvs (pagan priests). All pagan idols which already became useless had to be destroyed. Also, unkindly was treated Piarun: "… There was an order to eradicate the idols and to burn them… But Piarun was ordered to be tied to horses' tails and pulled down from the hill, down Borichev to the Stream; and 12 men were assigned to carry that out."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Quite possible, that it was Piarun, whom Procopy Cesarean kept in mind, when he wrote about the supreme God of the ancient Slavs in his book "The war with Gotes": "…These tribes, Slavs and Ants… believe, that only one God, the creator of lightning is the emperor to everyone, and to him they sacrifice axes and perform other sacred rituals".</p>
<p>The short-lived supremacy of Piarun in the sacred place in Kiev and the statement of the Byzantine historian mentioned above (remember he was a christian!) gave grounds for a number of historians to put this God in the head of the ancient Slavonic pantheon. Recently this hypothesis was completely refuted, and then another extreme became dominant in researches, so that the cult of Piarun turned into just host and prince's cult of the Igoreviches. L. Gumilev even wrote, that the cult of Piarun was alien to Slavonic paganism and had been borrowed from Balts by the princes of Kiev. All these attempts to belittle the importance of the Thundergod not have any real grounds, otherwise how can we explain the fact that worshipping of Piarun turned out to be the most devoted to and remained right up till the 20th century (especially among the Belarusians), whereas Svarog, Simargl and other gods were long ago forgotten?</p>
<p>Here is how this God was imagined by the Belarusian peasants in the beginning of the 20th century: "Piarun is imperial, burly-figured, tall with black hair and long golden board. Sitting in the fiery chariot he moves through the Heaven with a bow and arrows. His thunderous bow is a stone hammer, sometimes a rainbow. His arrows are lightnings. By them Piarun destroys the enemy hordes of Charnabog (The Black God), which pile up huge rain clouds to obscure the Sun, to pick the Moon from the sky, to gather the life-giving water from the rain cloud. By one blow from the stone hammer Piarun crushes the rain cloud and fertilizing water at once pours down to the ground. The devils run away to the ground, but here Piarun's arrows get them. Devils know that Piarun loves people and takes care of them, that is why they rush to people's dwellings to be saved there. But in these cases Piarun destroys human dwelling too, and if an arrow happens to hit a man, then the Gods will reward him in his future life. That is why the Belarusians don't venture on rescuing someone who perished from lightning. The spirits serving to Piarun rush in the fields and forests as fast as an arrow; and their enemies Charnabogs, that means dark powers, in the image of birds of prey create winds and storm…" (D. Sobolevski "Belarus and the Belarusians", 1918).</p>
<p>Here we'll quote one more folk description of the formidable God: "Piarun, the God of the heavenly fire, kills sending his stone arrows all in a fire cloud, the arrows kill, and the fire burns. Piarun directs his blows most often down to the mountains. In thunderstorm devil like to shelter under trees, that's why it's dangerous to stand under a tree to hide from the rain: instead of devil Piarun can kill a man.</p>
<p>Piarun holds two huge millstones in his hands, rubs and hits one against another; by friction and hits he creates thunder and lightning - approximately like we get sparks hitting steel against silicon. The grains coming out from the millstones when they hit fall down on the ground like arrows. People call stone axes and knives as 'Piarun's arrows'…" (A. Bogdanovich "Relics of the ancient world-perception as Belarusians have it", 1895).</p>
<p>From these relics of the pagan belief, which have survived till nowadays, we can easily see that one of Piarun's attributes were stone axes ("thunderous" or "Piarun's" arrows). The cult of stone axe was popular through Belarus, Baltic countries, Poland, Germany and Carpathian tribes. While exploring Milagrad settlements, there were found small clay axes, which had sacred meaning. As long ago as 10-13 centuries among heathen Slavs the image of Piarun associated with a fiery axe flying in the sky. Stones also belonged to Piarun's weapons (in some places the sand smelted by lightning was called 'Piarun's stones').</p>
<dl>
<dd>Till this time a boulder near the village Raskhodna (Senno district) is called 'Piarun's stone'. In Niasvizh environs one of the ancient settlements is called 'Piarun's mountain'. Not far from the village Vierhauliany near a pagan sanctuary there's a 'Piarun's field'. A belief is connected with this field which is that in thunderstorm a clap of thunder definitely hits a man. In Igumen region so-called 'Piarun's bridge' is known.</dd>
</dl>
<p>On the bottom of Dneeper (near Kiev) in 1975 and also in the lower reaches of Dzisna in 1910 there were found trunks of oaks, which in ancient times were dedicated to the cult of Piarun. Into the trunks of the oaks there had been rammed accordingly nine and four jaws of wild boars all in the right order and edges out. The researchers suppose that these oaks are sacred trees, which had been used in magic rituals. According to the opinion of V. Timashchuk the semantics of the number "9" gives the evidence about connection with the Baltic mythological system. As he believes, the oak floated down the Dneeper from more northern regions, where Baltic population still remained (i.e. from Belarus). In Lithuanian texts on an equal footing with the four and seven hypostasis of Perkunas his nine hypostasis are mentioned. There are grounds to believe that one of the hypostasis, peculiar epithet of Piarun (and perhaps his son) was Jaryla.</p>
<p>In the time of christianity Piarun was replaced by the prophet Ilea riding through the Heaven in the fiery chariot. The day of Piarun was celebrated on the 20th of July and with supremacy of christianity this day became the day of Ilea who adopted the functions of ancient God connected with thunder and lightning. Even now among Belarusian peasants there exists a proverb (I heard it from my father): "Ilea will make some rotten stuff". It was believed that in this day there definitely must be at least a small rain, but must often it had been a thunderstorm with heavy downpour. Numerous old churches of Ilea were built on ancient places of worshipping Piarun - and that must serve us a note for the future.</p>
<p>Among a large number of Piarun's epithets in the tribal epoch on separate territories some local names could arise. Examining the legend about the Holy Mercury of Smolensk V. Lastowski signed out that in the basis of the Smolensk legend a very ancient folk myth had survived. The myth is about a young spring Sun, which in the image of furious Thunderspewer crushes a disgusting giant, the spirit of darkness and cold. The near stems of the names of Ilea Muromets and Mercury let us believe that both of them camouflage the pagan name with a similar stem, or an epithet of the God of Thunder.</p>
<p>Quite early representations of Piarun appear in the ancient art, then in religious symbolism and after that in military and state symbolism. On a Slavonic dish of 7-9 centuries from Wyszegrad-Drwalow (the territory of Poland) there's a picture of a rider with three zigzag-like outlines of lightning above him. Polish researcher V. Szafranski believes this picture to be an image of Piarun. Also this researcher connects an ancient Slavonic figurine of a horse and a slanting cross on it (Opol, Poland) with an uranic-athmospheric-astral God like Piarun-Svarog-Dazhbog in one image.</p>
<p>Mythology researchers V.V. Ivanov and V.N. Toporov in their book "Researches in the Field of Slavonic Antiquities" proposed their interpretation of the myth about Piarun, which has a subheading of "Reconstruction of Fragments of the Myth about the God of Thunderstorm and his Opponent". They came to the conclusion that christian saint Georgi-Yuri correlates with both heroes of main myth - i.e. with Piarun and Veles. In the system of binary oppositions Piarun is connected with the right top poles of the opposition, and his opponent Zmiej Garynycz belongs to the left, bottom poles. In ancient Kiev the idol of Piarun was put on a mountain while the idol of Veles was in the bottom (in Podol).</p>
<p>A characteristic feature of the rituals connected with Piarun is their correlation with oaks and oak groves, and hills upon which in ancient times people put idols of Piarun and his sanctuaries. Here is how a ritual of admiring Piarun described in the chronicle of the year 944: "And in the morning summoned Igor the forces (Greek ones) and came to the hill, where Piarun had been standing, and put his arms, and shields, and gold…"</p>
<p>One of the sanctuaries in honor of Piarun was set near Novgorod, in the natural boundary of Piaryn</p>
<p>One of the sanctuaries in honor of Piarun was set near Novgorod, in the natural boundary of Piaryn. When archeological excavations took place, it was found out that the central part of the sanctuary looked like a raised above the surrounding surface horizontal ground in the form of a right circle with the diameter of 21 meter. This ground was surrounded by a ring ditch, 7 meters wide and more than 1 meter deep. In the center of the circle there stood a wooden idol. In front of the idol it was an altar in the shape of the circle, made up of cobblestones. The ditch near the religious ground was like a rim resembling a large flower with 8 petals. In each of these ledges during pagan celebrations they made a sacred fire, and in the eastern petal there burned an "eternal" one. Gustyn chronicle tells about the worshipping Piarun in the following way: "For him as for the Lord they made sacrifices and burned an inextinguishable fire of oaken wood; and if only this fire happened to go out because of the carelessness of the attendant, this attendant was at once killed without any mercy".</p>
<p>The memory of this pagan sanctuary kept till the 17th century and evidence of that had been chronicled in 1654 by a traveler Adam Oleary.</p>
<p>There also exists a description of an ancient Lithuanian place of worshipping of Perkunas: "The last sanctuary of Perkunas, which had been seen not once by the knights, was in Vilna, in the valley called Svintaroha, where the prince of this name had chosen the place for burning the bodies of princes, and where his body was burned first by his son Germund in 1270. So there Germund still before that, in 1265 had founded a temple to Perkunas, among a beautiful sacred oaken grove. The sanctuary had about 150 arshins [arshin - unit of measurement equal to 0,71 m] long and 100 arshins wide: the height of the walls was up to 15 arshins. The sanctuary didn't have any roof; it has just one entrance in the western side. Opposite to the entrance there was a stone chapel with different vessels and sacred things, and under the chapel there was a cave, where snakes and other unpleasant creatures were kept. Above this chapel a stone gallery had been arranged, something like a pavilion, which was 16 arshins high over the chapel, and inside the pavilion a wooden idol of Perkunas had been placed, brought from the holy forests of Polagen. In front of the chapel an altar of 3 arshins high and 9 arshins wide elevated on 12 steps, which signified the phases of the Moon. Each step was half an arshin high, so in the whole the height of the altar was 9 arshins. On this particular altar an inextinguishable fire burned, which was called Znich. The fire days and nights kept up by the pagan priests and priestesses (vaidelots and vaidelottesses), blazed in the interior deepening in the wall, which had been arranged so fine, that neither wind, nor rain could put the fire out".</p>
<p>Here I summed up the basic historical facts collected by the science about the ancient heathen God, paying special attention to the information connected with my Motherland Belarus. Of course, one can maintain that these are but the bare facts, which are needed only for special researches, but we would just refer such a skeptic to "The Book of Veles", "The Starry Book of Koliada" and other pulp literature. We fight for the full revival of the ancient traditions of our ancestors; much of the sacred knowledge is already lost in a thousand-year battle against christianity - with more respect then should we take those grains of knowledge, which has been saved thanks to the living folk tradition and the fundamental researches of the historical science. We will create a new building having totally destroyed the christian civilization, but for this building to stand firmly, we need a stable foundation. And in its basis there will be put these very bare facts.</p>
<p>Back</p>
<p><b>Reject</b> - You need to provide us with some references to we can check the facts here. A Google search for Piarun did produce some sketchy information that seems to kinda sorta fit what you're saying here - but there are LOTS of names that you use here that do not have a single mention anywhere on the Internet. This adds up to something we can't publish. You don't give us any way to confirm your facts - neither in a book nor on the Internet. So this has to be a reject.

<p>David "Homer" Dewitt Bailey Jr. was born on May 3, 1986 in LaGrange, Texas. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the First Round and Seventh overall. He headed the USAToday 2004 All-USA High School baseball team. His high school stats were staggaring. He was 15-0 with a 0.68 ERA and 201 strikeouts in 92 2/3 innings his senior season and was 41-4 with 536 strikeouts, 0.98 ERA in 298 innings in his High School career. He has progressed as a minor league player and has recently proclaimed the third best prospect in the minor leagues and the best minor league pitcher. His pitching repertoire includes a mid to upper nineties fastball with good movement, a low eighties curve ball with 12-to-6 break.</p>
<p>He struggled for the first few years in the minor leagues, posting ERAs above 4.00. Part of this can be attributed to the "piggy-back" system that was put in place by Reds General Manager Dan O'Brien. He was also told to use his weakest pitch, the change-up, and learn to develop it so that he could use it in the more advanced levels. However, under new management in 2006, the Reds ditched the piggy-back system, allowing Bailey to pitch every fifth day on a regular basis, instead of cutting his work load and forcing him to pitch twice a week. 2006 became a breakout year for Bailey as he was named the top prospect for the Florida State League (Advanced A) where he played for the Sarasota Reds and the Southern League (AA)where he played for the Chattanooga Lookouts.</p>
<p><b>Concerns</b></p>
<p>Most scouts agree that the biggest problem with Homer Bailey is his occational control problems. However, in the 2006 season, he showed much more control than in previous years, allowing him to have a breakout year for himself.</p>

<p>Kledging, is the phrase used, when talking about a kite and sledge used in combination to create a fun an additional form of power kiting. The sport was discovered in 2006 by Sebastian Barnes. He was experimenting, by skidding with the pull of a kite, and had the idea to incorparate a sledge into the method. Thus creating Kledging. The way in which it works is, the person sits in there sledge, and begins the flight of the kite. They then recieve a pulling force from the kite, which propells the rider forward in the sledge. It a excitable sport, and very controlble to do, needing next to no skill levels, only the basic power kite flying skills.</p>

<p>Imagine a camera, with film enough for 36 shots, making its way to 36 cities around the globe -- and at every stop, one person takes just one photograph.</p>
<p>This traveling camera, a photographic ambassador of sorts, is the brainchild of Los Angeles-photographer, Wojtek Gil, whose belief that a moment of life captured in Sao Paulo might not look all that different from one captured in Osaka, comes to life in this innovative project.</p>
<p>“I wanted to do something to erase borders, to show just how much alike everyone is on a basic level,” Gil says. “How many people in the world saw a baby cry or a man riding a bicycle today? I would love to know! If 10,000 people saw a man riding a bicycle, then 10,000 people had the same experience.” For Gil, capturing everyday life is at the heart of this worldwide photographic endeavor.</p>
<p>The camera for his project, a 35mm Lomo Action Sampler, which Gil describes as “the hero of the journey”, produces four sequential pictures. Currently in Norway, the camera will spend several days with Jorn Stoylen, who will photograph an image that strikes him, adding a note about the shot before forwarding the Lomo Action Sampler to its next destination.</p>
<p>Combining technical ingenuity with an astute and instinctive eye, Gil has built an impressive portfolio that chronicles the sometimes gritty, always exquisite, human condition. "Around The World in One Camera" is his contribution to today's global experience - a literal and figurative snapshot from the unique and collective perspectives of the participants who have chosen to take this journey with him.</p>
<p>“People are grouped by how much money they make, by which disease they suffer from, the religion they practice, the color of their skin ¬ I could go on and on ¬ but at the end of the day, we all still see a man riding a bicycle.”</p>
<p>Please visit the “Around the World in One Camera” website at www.aroundtheworldinonecamera.com for daily updates on the journey or to join the Forum with your thoughts and comments.</p>

<p>Standing 4-foot-4, Matt Cappelli is the shortest Division-1 Athlete. Growing up outside of Philadelphia, he went to St. Joseph’s Prep in the city where he took part in Crew (Rowing) and won a high school national championship his freshman year (1999) and placed 2nd the following two years. He later went onto to Syracuse University (2002-2006) to study engineering and be a coxswain, where he held the record for shortest Division-1 athlete in America.</p>
<p>Point of interest 1: Craig Forth, of the SU Men's Basketball (2001-2005) team stood 7'0. The height difference of 2'8 is the greatest between two athletes at the same school.</p>
<p>Point of interest 2: some people say Cappelli currently resembles Peter Dinklage of Nip/Tuck fame. The winner of Project Runaway actually mistaken Cappelli for Peter on the Subway in NYC.</p>

<p><b>Reject</b> - Wikipedia has very strict and careful rules for articles on living people - and for notability of people listed for their athletic abilities. I don't think this meets those requirements - so sadly, I have to reject. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 18:53, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Second Peace of Paris was a treaty signed by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 after Napolean's 100 days as Emperor. It stated that France would be required to pay 700 million Francs and would loose all territory that was gained throughout the French Revolution. It was a far harsher sentence than that of the First Peace of Paris.</p>

<p>So why wasn't this added? Stacy Harris, the American-born author, broadcaster and musicologist, has more and higher-ranked entries in Google, Yahoo, MSN, GoodSearch.com, etc. than the Canadian-born actor? 170.190.40.78 18:29, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd say she's the most honest voice on Music Row. She didn't pull any punches commenting about Chris LeDoux and the people who let Chris down, either. 52.410.42.38 19:56, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Should the article be about this web site - or about the person? That's not clear to me. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 21:01, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Seems like either one would work. She has quite an accomplished online bio.</p>
<p>She's internationally-known through Stacy's Music Row Report, but her on-line bio lists a ton of accomplishments and quite diverse areas of expertise.</p>

She's also a contributor to Country Music Report. One of my favorite sites. Add that to everything everyone else has posted, as well as their sourcing of various references on the net, and it seems like a no-brainer for Wikipedia to me.</p>

<p>I found these comments on Wikipedia about Stacy Harris (the country-music expert, not the late actor):</p>
<p>Your speedy of STACY'S MUSIC ROW REPORT</p>
<p>The entry for Stacy Harris, Publisher/Editor of Stacy's Music Row Report, should be added to Wikipedia, so as to avoid confusion with lesser-known actor. The latter is actually not as well-known today as the internationally-known, Nashville-based author, print and broadcast journalist. Compare the on-line bios and see if you don't agree! 70.156.0.154 05:14, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree. Whenever I'm searching for information on Stacy Harris, the public speaker, author and country musicologist, of Stacy's Music Row Report fame, I get the dead actor instead! He wasn't on that Johnny Cash panel discussion at the Nashville Public Library October 15th with Don Cusic and Michael Streissguth, but she was- and did a great job detailing Cash's public vs. private side. 170.190.43.128 19:12, 21 October 2006 (UTC) What happened to that book that Tommy Cash announced he was writing with Stacy when Tommy appeared on WSM Radio? 72.154.193.107 04:32, 8 November 2006 (UTC) Why isn't there a Wikipedia entry for Stacy's Music Row Report? 65.1.218.131 06:26, 28 November 2006 (UTC) I don't know. Stacy Harris has a pretty high Celebrity Café rating and the wife of one of the Grascals raved about Stacy's Music Row Report in a post to Nashville is Talking. www.celebritycafe.com www.nashvilleistalking.com 70.156.8.59 05:17, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>To these I would add the following links in support of entries for both the Stacy Harris and the column (Stacy's Music Row Report) since Steve can't make up his mind:</p>

<p>We (my partner, who is a copyright attorney, and myself) don't understand the references to ccpyright violation. Stacy Harris has been a firm supporter of copyright. She credits her sources.</p>
<p>Yes, others do "lift" from Stacy'a Music Row Report. If this is what is referenced re: Stacy's Geocities site, her column is no longer found there. Updates are noted, but only with a few words linking readers to two other commercial sites in which Stacy apparently has some financial interest: Roughstock.com and Country Music Report.com</p>

<p>The Black Boy Inn (a listed building circa 1522) is situated within the historic town walls of the Royal borough of Caernarfon, a market town with an open air market every Saturday (Mondays also in Summer) and is a world heritage site with both Roman and Edwardian history. The Inn is within easy walking distance to the town centre, and the famous 13th Century Castle.</p>
<p>An old Inn dating back to 1522, some of its load bearing walls measure on average 1.2 to 1.5 metres thick ( four to five feet thick,) and with its wooden panelling, low ceilings, and thick wooden support beams it generates a cosy 'Olde Worlde' atmosphere. The town is ideally suited to explore the beauty of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Wales_df6e.html" title="North Wales">North Wales</a> and is only seven miles from <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowdon.html" title="Snowdon">Snowdon</a> the highest mountain in England and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>.</p>

In February, 1692 a grant from <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_and_Mary_edbe.html" title="William and Mary">William and Mary</a> empowered <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Neale_2a2e.html" title="Thomas Neale">Thomas Neale</a> "to erect, settle and establish within the chief parts of their majesties' colonies and plantations in America, an office or offices for the receiving and dispatching letters and pacquets, and to receive, send and deliver the same under such rates and sums of money as the planters shall agree to give, and to hold and enjoy the same for the term of twenty-one years."</p>
<p>As Postmaster General, he appointed Governor Andrew Hamilton of New Jersey as his Deputy Postmaster General. Neale's franchise cost him only 80 cents a year but was no bargain; he died heavily in debt, in 1699.</p>

<p><b>Reluctant Reject</b> -- Whilst this guy seems notable enough to warrant an article - the facts you present seem a bit 'off'. For example, <a href="http://www.askphil.org/b58.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.askphil.org/b58.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.askphil.org/b58.htm</a> ...says: "1677: John Hayward appointed postmaster of Boston" - so Neale wasn't America's first postmaster by at least 15 years.

<p>22:40, 9 December 2006 (UTC)Panthers801Sign your name It is amazing to find that Plato's 2,000 year old definition of knowledge was seemingly "snuffed out" by Edmund Gettier's 3-page paper in 1963.</p>
<p>When coupled with the defeasibility condition, justified true belief becomes more concrete. By making a justified belief knowledge only if there is no condition to defeat justifaction, knowledge then becomes undefeated justified true belief. This is a good example of something besides or in addition to justified true belief required to become knowledge.</p>
<p>Argument:</p>
<p>Is Faith Justified True Belief?</p>
<p>1. Eber believes the Old Testament is the word of God, to be taken literally.</p>
<p>2. Eber learns that the Old Testament is written by man, based on oral traditions and myths.</p>
<p>3. Eber's belief is threatened by finding that it is a work of man.</p>
<p>4. Eber must now base his belief on faith and trust in the men who compiled the Old Testament.</p>

<p><b>Rejected</b> - this submission was rejected yesterday - you have done nothing to answer the criticism from that rejection notice - so I have to reject again today. Please do not resubmit until you've addressed all of the concerns of the last reviewer. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 23:42, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually, I believe the criticism about my submission yesterday was that I had not provided sufficient information about the author. If you would care to take a closer look, you will see that I have, indeed, addressed that issues. Furthermore, you should also notice that the article was actually rejected earlier this evening.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also notice that you have rejected the article below: Falling (novel) which I also submitted yesterday. The partticular author in this case HAS got a page on Wikipedia, together with a substantial bibliography of her worls, so your rejection seems a little bizarre.</p>
<p>I am starting to wonder whether your decision may have been influenced by this previous reject. Consequently, I would like another editor to review them. 217.43.199.206 23:52, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The problem is that unless you clearly explain WHY the subject meets Wikipedias article guidelines, we can't easily tell whether to include it or not. For books, you need to explain why both the author and the book are significant. 99% of book article submissions are just 'The author is called this...Here is the plot' - and that's simply not enough either to justify the existance of the article - nor to get it started. Wikipedia isn't here to store plot synopsis for all of the hundreds of millions of books that are in print - they have to be NOTABLE. Please read the associated WP: guidelines. Furthermore, you cannot expect the reviewers here to be knowledgeable about ever single author and book title - that is why it is ESSENTIAL that you spell out why the author is significant - and why the book is important enough to justify an article. I did not feel you had adequately done that - so (as with most book submissions - sadly) - the previous reviewer asked for you to expand on those areas - and you did not...so I simply repeated their rejection. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 00:22, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Joshua Tierney is most remembered for his inspiring and innovative Stream Practices. He, also was a prominent writer whose most notable works include: "Stream, the story of my life", and "Paper, scissors, rock: obviously!." He also once drew a really good picture of a California raisin.</p>

<p>Born from a coccoon from the secret depths of Stream, young Joshua was destined to lead a life of greatness as one of the many hundreds of Support Professional's (aka. homeless people) employed by Stream. His first words&#160;: "FDR" and "checkdisk" were a strong indication of his determination to <i>stream</i> countless unsuspecting, gullible, stupid Americans (as well as substantially smarter and comparatively more attractive Canadians.)</p>
<p>From the age of 5, he was deeply touched by a California Raisins special which would stay imbedded in his gigantic muscular heart (more specifically his right atrium--more affectionately referred to as a <i>dried up fig</i> by he of which we write of.</p>
