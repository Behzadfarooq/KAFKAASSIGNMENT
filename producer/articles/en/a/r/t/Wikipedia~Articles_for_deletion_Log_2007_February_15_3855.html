<li><b>Strong keep</b> <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> says little about creation stories. If the material in this article which is not found in the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> article were added there, that article would be too long, and it would be overwhelmed with detailed analysis of the creation stories, which are only part of the material now in the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> article. This article is about the creation stories common to three great world religions, and these creation myths have been the subject of literally thousands of scholarly works. Since Wikipedia is not paper, I am not worried that we will run out of bandwidth by having an article on this important topic. Important topics deserve editing, not deletion, if someone disagrees with what the article says. I am not impressed by dire warnings that if we do not delete this article we will be swamped by having two article about every book of the Bible. If there are two encyclopedic topics dealing with something, and the article would be too long with both included in one article, Wikipedia policy calls for having two separate articles. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:26, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>:<a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> is a long article with one paragraph on creation that references this article as main. We have articles on <i>every single episode</i> of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> (See <a href="../../../s/t/a/Category%7EStar_Trek_episodes_86cb.html" title="Category:Star Trek episodes">Category:Star Trek episodes</a>).

<li><b>Comment</b> This isn't my area of expertise, but the article looks to be pretty well referenced and detailed. The question of whether or not this referenced subarticle should be merged into the main article for Genesis sounds to me like a question that should be handled with a merge tab and discussion on the talk pages of the articles. Short of that, I would want to hear a reason to <i>delete</i> (as opposed to simply saying the content can probably be merged) the article before supporting a deletion. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:56, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - although not because we have articles on every Star Trek episode. The existence of one article or set of articles has no bearing on whether this article should exist. No, keep because the nomination presents no compelling reason for deletion. This is a scholarly topic and an article on it is a reasonable addition to an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:28, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The creation stories in Genesis are such a controversial and well discussed topic that they deserve a focussed article, separate from the general <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> article. Having said that, I think this article could be cleaned up and improved considerably.<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonicthebrown_fe54.html" title="User:Tonicthebrown">Tonicthebrown</a> 00:38, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>merge or delete</b> - genesis can handle any extra info mentioned here. it's best to keep it as one article.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep or merge</b>. The nominator of this article is half-way correct. We don't necessarily need an evaluation of every book of the Bible, but I am a Christian and believe this article has some Religious truth to it. I also agree with Tonicthebrown, the article is so controversial a focused article is deserved. It should either be <b>Kept</b> or <b>Merged</b> into the article <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a>. <b>:^)</b> <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupaSoldier_ac22.html" title="User:SupaSoldier"><span style="font-family:Colonna MT;color:#009">§†SupaSoldier†§</span></a> 19:34, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>strong keep</b> This is a special aspect of the Book that merits an article. I think we do need an article on each truly major event in the Bible, and that the creation of the universe qualifies as major. And it's a good article, too. (Some of the part of it discussing the Mosaic origin of Genesis is more general, and does not belong--but that's for editing. I don't really think it necessary to give a detailed evolutionist critique of everything relating to the Biblical account every time it is mentioned, or a detailed atheist critique of every article on religion. Perhaps a sentence reminding people that non-Abrahamic religions and non-religious people don't think it happened that way, just in case any true beginner doesn't realize that.)<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:48, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>further reason to keep</b> - This is not the only expansion on the basic <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> article, focusing on a particular section of the book. There are also the articles: <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogies_of_Genesis_dc3f.html" title="Genealogies of Genesis">Genealogies of Genesis</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fall_of_man.html" title="Fall of man">Fall of man</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah%27s_ark.html" title="Noah's ark">Noah's ark</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_of_Babel_05fa.html" title="Tower of Babel">Tower of Babel</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abraham</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob.html" title="Jacob">Jacob</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_%28Hebrew_Bible%29_ca98.html" title="Joseph (Hebrew Bible)">Joseph (Hebrew Bible)</a> etc. The arguments in favour of deleting this article would also compel us to delete these others. I agree with Edison that a merge of material would have the result "that article would be too long, and it would be overwhelmed with detailed analysis of the creation stories". That's the whole point of these sub-articles. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonicthebrown_fe54.html" title="User:Tonicthebrown">Tonicthebrown</a> 07:40, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Eh, my main reason for wanting to combine this one was because I thought it did parts well done poorly in Genesis, whereas Genesis did parts well done poorly in it.

<li><b>Keep, but improve</b> There are a number of areas where this article could be expanded. I have in mind the long historical tradition of commentaries on the Seven days of creation.

<li><b>Keep and improve</b> I think that there is so much material in Genesis that there is no problem with having separate articles on each aspect.

<p>Questionable notability - and the article for this person is just a list. If notability is found to be good, this biography needs to be changed from a list to an extensively rewritten article describing the person, not what they have done.

<p>A so called fetish about, believe it or not, insertion. Totally original research. The article was proded with (paraphrased) "Original research that just makes the title into a sentence".

<li><b>Comment</b> It's occurred to me that rather then deleting a lot of these 'fetishes' that they should be merged into sections of a larger article, such as Uncommon Fetishes (or some title therefore of). This will delete the articles, while allowing what little information there is to be kept; it also means sections of fetishes that 'do' turn out to be 'fake' can be more easlly removed, with out ten thousand AfDs--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHoneymane_ba48.html" title="User:Honeymane"><font color="red" face="Old English Text MT, Papyrus">Honeymane</font></a><sub><a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHoneymane_56f3.html" title="User talk:Honeymane"><font face="Klingon, QuigleyWiggly">Heghlu meH QaQ jajvam</font></a></sub> 05:05, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi Ohconfucius, you did not delete the article about Professor Pham, but I blanked it because I did not have time to reply to your defamatory remarks.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I have stated before, <b>Professor Pham did not write his biography or any article in Wikipedia</b>. I wrote the article about the Manufacturing Engineering Centre because I saw many articles on similar centres in Wikipedia e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick_Manufacturing_Group" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick_Manufacturing_Group" rel="nofollow">Warwick Manufacturing Group</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfson_Centre_for_Magnetics" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfson_Centre_for_Magnetics" rel="nofollow">Wolfson Centre for Magnetics</a>, etc...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article I wrote initially did not contain a biography of Prof. Pham. After a few days, someone added a link to his name, that was when I filled in his biography (as I thought that the biography was required in order to complete the article - I am new to Wikipedia).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please be more constructive and check facts before publishing your remarks, and I do not wish to enter into any more arguments. Sweetpea2007 10:17, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArt_exhibitions_c420.html" title="Category:Art exhibitions">Category:Art exhibitions</a> which seems a rather mixed bag. It might be useful to have a "List of major art exhibitions" but it would need constant defence against the, well, minor ones. I think a regular exhibition can certainly be notable without implying that every artist who has been shown in it is - the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Academy_summer_exhibition_469b.html" title="Royal Academy summer exhibition">Royal Academy summer exhibition</a> for example shows about 500 living artists every year. I would not take the fact that an artist has exhibited there as in itself evidence of notability, although if they have exhibited every year for ten years, that is rather different. A link to an reputable external list on the visual arts project page or at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_exhibition.html" title="Art exhibition">Art exhibitionwould</a> be handy. All that goes in spades for galleries! <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> 01:35, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think something very useful that is emerging from these art AfDs is the type of specific criteria that apply. Guidelines should follow practice and not seek to impose on it. Exhibitions, for example, are peculiar to artists and one of the main means by which artists demonstrate their standing. Provided that the exhibitions can be verified, then they may form an important part of notability. Most artists do not often tend, for example, to be featured in newspapers, and many art magazines do not offer all their content on line. These ideas need working through and I think the best way is out here in the front line for now. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 05:42, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I tend to agree totally, but it is a complicated subject. Not every gallery has only notable expositions nor does every non-notable gallery have only unimportant artists. I could cite two examples right away: Before John Lennon's drawings went on world tour in the 1990 they were shown at a fairly small gallery in Darmstadt-Eberstadt/Germany located in the cellar of a bookstore. As far as I know that was the last notable artist to have a exposition there. On the other hand there is a gallery in La Coruña/Spain that has had expositions with paintings from Picasso, Miró and Dalí, yet most of their business is done with relatively unknown local artists. What we surely need to have is references to the likes of the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Documenta.html" title="Documenta">Documenta</a>, the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice_Biennale_e864.html" title="Venice Biennale">Venice Biennale</a> or the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_of_Asturias_Awards_3953.html#Arts" title="Prince of Asturias Awards">Prince of Asturias Awards#Arts</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 13:43, 18 February 2007 (UTC) (wikilinks added by <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 14:29, 18 February 2007 (UTC))

<dd>Alf, I think this is what Johnbod was getting at above. If we can create a list of the top exhibitions, with articles that have citations galore to prove it, it becomes easier to judge notability for the cases that probably should be "keep"s. The list doesnt need to be extensive either, nor would it need to be encycopedic. i.e. it could be out of the main name space (like Wikipedia:List of notable art exhibitions) and only used for the purposes of Afds. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 14:29, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think I'm disagreeing, because I go back to the standard requirement about always needing published sources that are non-trivial. Where I think a 1-line fact about a "good" exhibition helps, first, is that this increases the likelihood of (eventually) finding written sources in more depth, such as a catalogue or review that might not be on the internet. And, second, being well exhibited increases the chances of being influential on others and producing written sources after the event (e.g. "X's earliest influences were the photos of A and the paintings of B"). Both those argue for 1-line exhibition references having a useful role in AFD debates, particularly in identifying articles that should be given time to develop, but IMO they are not a permanent substitute for published sources that have depth of content. Meanwhile, would it help to take the generic discussion back at the project page?? <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMereda_55a9.html" title="User:Mereda">Mereda</a> 15:48, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>keep</b> Sources for a web or web-related game are usually found on appropriate websites, so this is adequately sourced. I do not see that its mention in some gaming magazine would add much. The article itself does not run to excess.

<p>Çiçek Izgara is a restaurant. All we know about it is that it is in Turkey, and, according to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, they supposedly have great chops and meatballs.

<li><b>Delete</b>. A restaurant needs a lot to be notable. Even "seats 150" doesn't necessarily mean it makes the cut - there are thousands of restaurants which do that.

<li><b>Comment</b> The restaurant name gets over 2000 Google hits, but in Turkish, so it is hard to tell if they count as good sources to show notability.

<li>The Frommers, N.Y. Times, and MSN references are the exact same one short paragraph restaurant review. The MSN reference is a one sentence plug saying that its is elegant and serves good food. The Webshots reference is a single picture of the restaurant. The Virtual Tourist reference is a review by a tourist. I'm sure that it's a good, probably even excellent restaurant, but there are a lot of excellent restaurants. The references fail to establish any notability beyond reviewing the food. -- <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArglebargleIV_fb51.html" title="User:ArglebargleIV">ArglebargleIV</a> 20:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, mostly on the basis that there's no reason to delete, and that, in the realm of professional wrestling (especially after the 1990s), ratings are very encyclopedic. <s>I do agree, though, that the WWE/TNA articles are now redundant with the creation of this article. I propose redirecting those to this one.</s> <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Silvers_da83.html" title="User:Jeff Silvers">Jeff Silvers</a> 04:17, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Removing my suggestion to redirect the WWE/TNA articles to 2007 professional wrestling television ratings. The WWE article also contains ratings for other WWE programs that are minor enough to warrant exclusion from this article but important enough to be noted in a WWE-centric article. The TNA article does this to a much lesser extent (having an "other" category), and <i>could</i> probably be redirected here. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Silvers_da83.html" title="User:Jeff Silvers">Jeff Silvers</a> 04:21, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> ratings are important for any tv-shows but even more so for continously live events. Bad ratings may result in a sudden change in storyline for example. It is also interesting to see how competing products are doing week for week.Ondbraddod 19:11, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b>. Ratings are still important. I suggest that we either keep this paticular page, or delete the seperate pages with ratings on them(TNA/WWE Ratings for 2007).</p>

<li><b>Delete, possibly transwiki to Wikisource</b> Some of the notes above refer to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>. However, note that this policy section does <i>not</i> apply to problems involving "trivia". In fact, an attempt to add a section for "almanac style information" (which this article is) to WP:NOT#IINFO failed last year due to lack of consensus. Thus arguments specifically using WP:NOT#IINFO should be considered an invalid use of that particular part of policy.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Now that all being said, the article does suffer from a couple of issues. First, the article appears to use original research in attempting to analyze the ratings, such as in the Notes section. This is presumably included to attempt to place some meaning on the raw ratings data and explain possible reasons for various highs and lows. Unfortunately, such original analysis of data isn't allowed since it is simply a form of original research. In order to keep those sorts of comments in the article, they would have to be properly cited. Second, it's not clear that any attempt is made in the article to assert that this information is somehow notable. In order to assert notability, the information in the article needs to be the subject of multiple <i>non-trivial</i> references about it. In this context, non-trivial means that it can't simply be a weekly data dump of ratings numbers, but has to be an actual discussion or analysis of these ratings.</dd>
<dd>So all in all the article should probably be deleted unless it can be made into an actual <i>article</i> with referenced context and analysis beyond just the raw numbers, and without resorting to original analysis and research (ie the analysis should have been published somewhere else). If deleted, I might be ok with the verifiable data itself being included in Wikisource, since Wikisource is specifically intended to provide publicly avaiable raw data sources of various types. Thus this might be a bad <i>article</i>, but it might be an ok <i>set of data points</i> for Wikisource. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:24, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>By the way, since this is a pretty interesting topic, I'll mention that I do think it's theoretically possible to have articles about television ratings in general. Television critics and the industry frequently publish analysis of the broad ratings for various weeks and quarters and seasons, and this information is extremely important to people in the industry and of interest to many television watchers. For example, I bet you could make a decent article entitled "2006 television ratings" that accumlates newspaper articles and interviews to analyze various aspects of the 2006 ratings period, such as notable highs and lows, possible ratings trends and analysis of reasons for major ratings changes, etc. I could probably support THAT kind of ratings article. The article in THIS afd, though, unfortunately doesn't reach that level. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:32, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Ratings are good to compare and show if there has been a decline or a rise in a certain promotion or show. Also WSX no longer has a page on its ratings so this is good for someone who wants to know wrestling ratings without going to pop-up filled websites. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBencey_46dc.html" title="User:Bencey">Bencey</a> 23:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Even assuming you're right that some readers might be interested in this info, that doesn't address the issues of original research and references, and the article doesn't present references to verify that the analysis of the data has been notably handled in publications. The article needs to take care of those problems before I could recommend a keep. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:59, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>WP:ORG isn't in dispute of its basic requirements, only the wording from the result of the merge of the articles. The fact is that the article does not show in any way how the organisation meets any of the requirements of WP:ORG.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I did not post it for deletion because it was non-notable, unverifiable or lacked reliable sources. It is posted for copyvio. It would be a worthy article, but not as a c&amp;p.

<li><b>Comment</b> It is no longer a copy of what is on the organization's webpage. I rewrote the portion of the article that seemed to be a copyvio so it is not.

<li><b>Preserve</b> In most cases, I would wholeheartedly agree that an article dedicated to a Jeopardy! contestant is inconsequential at best. However, this Frank Firke earned a measure of notoriety because of his response to an answer apropos the 19th Amendment. In other contexts, his "How much is 19?" remark would not be worthy of further consideration, but the very nature of both Jeopardy! and Jeopardy! fandom dictates that this incident is bound to go down in program history. That so many fans are so devoted to the history of such on-air mishaps bespeaks the power of his appearance on Jeopardy! In that light, it would be irresponsible for Wikipedia or its editors to delete "Frank Firke." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Studslonigan50 (<a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStudslonigan50_31f4.html" title="User talk:Studslonigan50">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Studslonigan50_3ba5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Studslonigan50">contribs</a>) 03:10, 16 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>Contested speedy deletion, I decided to bring it here.

<li>So what's the significance of having ANY society available on Wikipedia?--Uncalum 19:01, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because many have been written about non-trivially by published sources. E.g. <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_and_Bones_93ca.html" title="Skull and Bones">Skull and Bones</a>. We write articles based on those sources, if they don't exist, we can't really have an accurate, neutral article. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 19:04, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Isn't that the whole concept of Wikipedia: an article can exist and be edited until some neutrality is attained? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Uncalum (<a href="../../../u/n/c/User_talk%7EUncalum_8e01.html" title="User talk:Uncalum">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Uncalum_fb3c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Uncalum">contribs</a>) 19:54, 18 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li>But if they aren't drawn from any published sources, the contents of an article are just the opinions of the random anonymous editors of that article. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 20:04, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ok, I understand. However, these aren't opinions. Ahowever, just because no published articles have been written on the subject does not necessarily indicate that the information is purely opinion or untrue. I would think that the concept of Wikipedia would help this article reach a general consensus on the subject. You, obviously, have more experience in this matter, so obviously, it is up to you.Uncalum 01:30, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Such information really might exist, the link I mentioned above <a href="http://www.lib.unc.edu/mss/inv/htm/03819.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lib.unc.edu/mss/inv/htm/03819.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> is a strong clue.

<li>Without giving away too much information, I myself was a member of the organization, which is how I know of the existence and of specific details. I know it is difficult for that to be used as a source though, so if it needs to be deleted, I understand.Uncalum 02:06, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>An article about a photographer that doesn't claim any exhibition, any publication, or any other verifiable notability, and that also doesn't name any independent source. The links do suggest that he's a good photographer, but I don't think that this is enough. Google hittage is minimal. Not verifiable.

<li><b>KEEP</b> Self-promotion? to a degree yes, but not my complete CV or life story. My photographs aren't about ME, so any googling, while it does find me, it doesn't always find my works as I post and or donate most of my work annonomously. When I photograph for the state, county or some other group involved in historic perservation it's not so you can see my name on the picture, but rather so you will SEE the picture. ALSO I go by my e-mail name primairily, SHELKA04 a search under that reveals a few hundred additonal hits. My current project " a civil war era mental hospital" while still in progress can be viewed here: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/shelka04/upload.mov" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/shelka04/upload.mov" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/shelka04/upload.mov</a></li>

<p>again no name no credit taken as it's about BEING there and not who took the shot. Removing me from wiki may save a few Kb on the server and keep me from my 15 minutes of fame, BUT it will also impeed my ability to further contribute. By that, simply put, many groups I petition for access to photograph would have an easier time understanding my objectives if they could read a bit about me on more then just google. Long story short I would like to shoot the abandoned areas of ellis island, the georgia state pen and ASARCO's Utah copper mine, places that would be easier to access if as I said I could point people at what i was looking to accomplish. John kloepper OH and the hits on Google are mostly about me, I have interests also in computer, GIS, roofing , cycling, and music by peter gabriel, just didn't want to go off topic with them</p>

<li>Well, ah, this one has dodgier spelling for a start. No, the article on Enos is not so good. No, Enos is not so notable. But Enos is half of Streetstudio, which I think I remember reading about in a real, dead-trees newspaper, and which for example was a <a href="http://picks.yahoo.com/picks/20010709.html" class="external text" title="http://picks.yahoo.com/picks/20010709.html" rel="nofollow">Yahoo "pick"</a> (whatever that means) and which gets a lot more googlehittage than Kloepper does.

<li><b>Clarification</b>: The criteria for speedy deletion is based on the <i>article itself</i>, and not the subject of the article. CSD A7 states that the article <i>does not establish notability</i>, not that the subject is non-notable.

<li>He is unsuccessful in the sense that there is no way that a minor barrister working in a provincial set outside London is <i>ever</i> going to be notable enough to appear in Wikipedia, ceteris paribus. Once again- if you are chucking around allegations that I have some kind of political bias, please provide some <b>EVIDENCE</b>. Otherwise- retract your accusations, please. As for the articles themselves- you'd do well to stop launching <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> against me and instead start demonstrating just how the inclusion of any of these fits with Wikipedia policies. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 09:18, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I question the knowledge of the nominator when he says Dorset CF has no national profile. Oliver Letwin MP, head of Policy Review for the Conservative Party, is an active supporter and he is involved in one of our policy debates later this year. Similarly, Robert Syms MP and Tobias Ellwood MP have both contributed to the organisation and Mr Syms is our guest speaker next month. We have a page on the national Conservative page and we are spreading to Wiltshire as part of that Area Chair. And by saying it has no history you have overlooked its origins as the "Young Conservatives" in Bournemouth. Finally, in terms of notability, four of its members are standing for election this year to Dorset councils and one of its former members is a parliamentary candidate for a Dorset parliamentary seat. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardbooth_bdaa.html" title="User:Richardbooth">Richardbooth</a> 23:58, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>...so none of your members are actually serving as elected representatives, and the highest any of your former members has ever reached is being a candidate for an election that won't happen for another 3 years. If your organisation has ever been profiled in the national media, or if you have evidence that it has a high national profile, by all means provide links here. Otherwise, see <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 00:21, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>In fact one of our affiliated members, Tobias Ellwood, is the Member of Parliament for Bournemouth East. Its national profile can be found on the Conservative Party website and several articles will be appearing in Dorset-wide press (such as The Daily Echo) during the April run-up to the local elections. As a final point, considering David Cameron's drive to promote youth interest in politics, I think this article is very relevant as evidence that shows we are embracing his campaign. In fact, Nick King's parliamentary campaign office is establishing an Executive position to deal with Dorset CF and youth-based constituency matters. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardbooth_bdaa.html" title="User:Richardbooth">Richardbooth</a> 00:26, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>WIkipedia is an encyclopaedia, not a forum for demonstrating that the modern Conservatives (or Labour, or Liberals....) are "down with de kidz". The fact that this article highlights your embrace of David Cameron's ideas and policies is utterly, utterly 1000% irrelevent, I'm afraid. This is not a political soapbox, or an indiscriminate collection of information. Sorry, but that's the way it is. The right thing to do is to restrict that sort of material to party or personal blogs and websites- it has no place in an encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 01:17, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> Dorset Conservative Future is an official ofshoot of the United Kingdom Conservative Party. It is a registered branch which is supported and endorsed by many senior figures in the party. I am concerned that in this situation a political bias against the party is occuring, and this is especially worrying when an article about the youth organisation of the BNP has been allowed to remain unchallenged on the site.

<li>I certainly have no political agenda for my own part, and I think that some of the above&#160;!voters are&#160;!British even, so I suspect that the only issue at hand here is whether this page (and by extension the related vanity/self promotion pages that I came across today and put up for deletion) is, or is!, in line with policy, particularly that on notability. In my view, they blatantly are not. So far, no-one here (with the exception of one dubious possible meat puppet) has&#160;!voted to keep the article that is not directly mentioned in it as an active member of DCF. That seems to say it all really. If you feel the BNP article (which I am not aware of) does not confirm to policy then feel free to nominate it so that the issue can be discussed. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 00:28, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have no idea who Twiggybriggy is - he could very well be a lurker who objects to your seemingly political agenda. In actual fact, looking at your comment on the history page ("Sock it to us, Twigster!"), it looks like you're making a mockery of this entire process. If the national Conservative Party has a page on Wikipedia, it makes sense for its county-wide offshoots to have pages as well, especially when we play an active role in formulating local Conservative policy and holding debates against institutions such as Bournemouth Council. As I've already written, we also have several notable members. I am not comfortable with <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">User:Badgerpatrol</a> making this administrative decision due to political bias reasons; I hope a neutral figure can step in, and not one who has a vendetta against certain users and organisations. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardbooth_bdaa.html" title="User:Richardbooth">Richardbooth</a> 00:36, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>With respect, you clearly have no idea how AfD works. I am not an admin and I have no power to delete the article; after the discussion has run its course, an admin will step in and make a decision as to whether the page's inclusion in the encyclopaedia is in accordance with policy, as demonstrated by the arguments and evidence in this discussion. It is certainly <i>not</i> logical that every local offshoot of a national organisation is automatically notable- because <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesco.html" title="Tesco">Tesco</a> or <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> are notable organisations, does that mean that <i>every</i> one of their local stores should have its own article automatically? Of course not. Again, the only issue here is whether or not this article conforms to policy. It does not, in my opinion, and neither does it seemingly in the opinion of the other disinterested correspondents so far. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 00:45, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I also take exception to your personal attack btw, for the record. I have no vendetta against any organisation- in fact, I rarely edit political articles. Please provide some evidence that I have any kind of vendetta against <i>"certain users and organisations"</i>, as I feel that's a pretty serious accusation. I first became aware of the existence of these (DCF) articles and users less than 24 hours ago...the simple fact is, that the subjects of this and the other related articles are not at all notable, per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 12:45, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Redundant with the plot section in <i><a href="../../../s/c/r/Scream_%28film%29.html" title="Scream (film)">Scream (film)</a></i>. Expanding upon that is horror fancruft. It is violating the growing consensus for a word limit for film plot synopses. (<i>Scream'</i>s "synopsis" is already huge). I have also seen a more basic list of deaths being added to the films' articles: these are redundant to the plot section and looks like something an amateur fan site would do. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS"><font color="purple">The <b>JP</b>S</font></a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_JPS_6a61.html" title="User talk:The JPS"><b><font color="purple"><b>talk</b> to me</font></b></a></sup> 12:36, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I really don't think the 'deaths' section is a good idea.

<li>I'm skeptical that there is a common understanding of "merge." An example of what I think you mean by a deaths section is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=I_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer&amp;diff=108455457&amp;oldid=108442541" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=I_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer&amp;diff=108455457&amp;oldid=108442541" rel="nofollow">illustrated here</a>. I more encyclopedic, mature version would be ensuring that such detail is integrated within the plot in context. Those 'deaths' (and sometimes 'Survivors') sections are really cheap and beneath us. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS"><font color="purple">The <b>JP</b>S</font></a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_JPS_6a61.html" title="User talk:The JPS"><b><font color="purple"><b>talk</b> to me</font></b></a></sup> 19:25, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with JPS. I'd be interested to know what the purpose of listing the deaths is, whether as a section or a separate article. What's the benefit to the reader, even if it were decided that it's all encyclopedic? Would someone who's not a hardcore fan have some reason to read that, and if so, what's the reason? <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 19:59, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Then it would appear that there is a disagreement about how to present the information. Some editors seem to think that a section listing or describing the deaths of the characters in the movie deserves a section apart from the section describing the plot of the movie. I don't know what the right venue would be for a discussion of that point... I imagine the only time it would get cleared up would be at a request for arbritration. With that said, thanks for responding to my query. I'm going to assume that you would take <b>merge</b> to mean <b>make sure it's covered in the plot section</b>. -- <a href="../../../s/w/e/User%7ESwerdnaneb_2a97.html" title="User:Swerdnaneb">Ben</a> 06:46, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> One article should be enough, whether this is merged into the main one or not. Response to JPS: More immature than the movie? I have no opinion on merging.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 23:45, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't see what the problem is. You don't request to delete other death lists like the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_deaths_in_the_Friday_the_13th_series_8eaa.html" title="List of deaths in the Friday the 13th series">List of deaths in the Friday the 13th series</a> and the Final Destination ones. So what's the problem? If you do delete this then I think you should be deleting those ones too.

Completely trivial, and nothing to write an article from. The second, a CNN transcript, has two sentences, one saying Weise posted there, the other with some CNN commentator saying essentially "I browsed the website!" The third has no content at all, it's just a list, no hint of a reliable source whatsoever, and it's on a K-12 teacher's website (nothing scholarly, for sure). The fourth, an MTV link, has one sentence and again quotes from the nazi.org press release. The fifth is a Yahoo Answers link that contains a cut and paste of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_dd3b.html" title="Bill White">Bill White</a> article! The links themselves are very strong arguments for just mentioning the site at <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Weise_64a3.html" title="Jeff Weise">Jeff Weise</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_dd3b.html" title="Bill White">Bill White</a> (no real need for a merge, even), and <i>at the very best</i> leaving this page as a redirect to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_dd3b.html" title="Bill White">Bill White</a>.

Bill White has a history of grabbing attention for himself by claiming to be "public relations" for whatever made-up white power slogan he can get his hands on, and there's no evidence that this "group" amounts to anything but its own name.

Note that all the notability they may have picked up has only been for Bill White or for Jeff Weise and his webforum posts. No notability for any "Party", and so no notability for the supposed subject of this article. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 20:34, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>In order to delete something on the grouds of it being a hoax you have to prove it is a hoax. Simply saying "it sounds like a hoax to me!" is not acceptable esp when the subject has garnered this attention from reliable sources. Like I said this is all to be hashed out in the article itself. I'm not saying the article is good one way or the other, I'm saying that the subject itself meets all the requirements for a article on wikipedia. Barring real evidence that it is a hoax (not having "real members" like the two major political parties could mean it is impossible to register as a member of the party which still makes it an ideological group, not uncommon or grouds to label it a hoax) this doesn't meet a single portion of the criteria for deletion.

<li>I understand that it might or might not be a joke. For the sake of argument let us say that it is. With all the events surrounding this topic the subject retains it's notability. If you have issues with the verifiability of some statments in the article then go ahead and change the article. The subject itself though, and it effects, are documented and verifiable, therefore the article is alright.

<li>No, you're making sense, but I just don't think the sources argue for any notability of the "Party". The fact that Bill White argues it's real is evidence that it's not real, just like the <a href="../../../u/t/o/Utopian_Anarchist_Party_c724.html" title="Utopian Anarchist Party">Utopian Anarchist Party</a>.

<li>That's an outstanding quote. I suppose the difference is that the "Party", which in all probability is not an actual entity, does not warrant an article under <a href="../../../h/o/a/WP%7EHOAX_ea37.html" title="WP:HOAX">WP:HOAX</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> with the first policy cancelling out the primary "reliable sources" which could be used to establish the second. With that in mind I would still say the subject of the article is notable and verifiable in popular culture, all things considered. If there is not enough material to substain a rewritten article with this in mind I would not be opposed to a redirect and merge to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_%28neo-nazi%29_48b0.html" title="Bill White (neo-nazi)">Bill White (neo-nazi)</a> and a mention in the two realvent school shooting articles.

<li>If nazi.org is notable on its own, then there will be third party coverage out there, independent of the situations involving Bill White and Jeff Weise. There is no such coverage. There is no notability for nazi.org except as it pertains to these two individuals, and so it should not have its own article but should simply be mentioned in those individuals' articles. The point of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#The_primary_notability_criterion" title="WP:N">WP:N#The primary notability criterion</a> is that "<i>In order to have a verifiable article, a topic must be notable enough that the information about it will have been researched, checked, and evaluated through publication in independent reliable sources. [And] In order to have a neutral article, a topic must be notable enough that the information about it will be from unbiased and unaffiliated sources; and that those interested in the article will not be exclusively partisan or fanatic editors.</i>" The problem with this article is that because all the sources are really about Jeff Weise and Bill White, the coverage of nazi.org is all <i>trivial</i>. There is not enough <i>non-trivial</i> coverage to write a verifiable, npov article about nazi.org. This is a controversial topic, which is why it's <i>extremely important</i> that the content of the article be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, however, with the triviality of the sources, this is impossible.

The fact is that all these links you've come up with are trivial, and thus they all fail <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> (which says the sources must be <i>non-trivial</i>), because you can't write an article from them. Let's actually look at the links you've provided (<b>the reader is strongly encouraged to actually click on these links and follow along</b>). Besides the google cache of arizona.edu, you've got something from artsandlettersmagazine.com,<a href="http://www.artsandlettersmagazine.com/FeaturedStoryHMathewBarkhausenIII.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.artsandlettersmagazine.com/FeaturedStoryHMathewBarkhausenIII.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> which has <i>two sentences</i>, both saying that the "Party" issued a statement: they "refused to wring hands over a 'tragedy'...", etc. Does this tell us anything we can write an article from? No, it belongs in <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Weise_64a3.html" title="Jeff Weise">Jeff Weise</a>'s article, because it doesn't inform us at all about the "Party". Let's look at your NPR link.<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4557742" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4557742" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> It's about Weise, again, and it says that he posted lots of messages to lots of (other non-notable) neo-nazi web forums. It's got <b>one</b> sentence, at the very end, which says that Weise posted some messages to nazi.org. What does this tell us about the "Party"? What information here can we write an article from? We can certainly add the short reference into <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Weise_64a3.html" title="Jeff Weise">Jeff Weise</a>'s article, but that's it. Again, because you seem to have overlooked this, the point of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#The_primary_notability_criterion" title="WP:N">WP:N#The primary notability criterion</a>, which asks for <b>non-trivial</b> coverage, is that "<i>In order to have a verifiable article, a topic must be notable enough that the information about it will have been researched, checked, and evaluated through publication in independent reliable sources. [And] In order to have a neutral article, a topic must be notable enough that the information about it will be from unbiased and unaffiliated sources; and that those interested in the article will not be exclusively partisan or fanatic editors.</i>" There's no non-trivial coverage yet to use. Let's look at the Guardian link,<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1443462,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1443462,00.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> which is again that exact same issued statement that was in the artsandlettersmagazine link. It's just direct quotation from nazi.org,<a href="http://www.nazi.org/nazi/policy/weise/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nazi.org/nazi/policy/weise/" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> but no independent investigative reporting, no verifiability here. As <a href="http://www.nazi.org/nazi/policy/weise/" class="external free" title="http://www.nazi.org/nazi/policy/weise/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nazi.org/nazi/policy/weise/</a> demonstrates, it's a press release, expressly forbidden by <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, which clearly says: "<i>The "independence" qualification excludes all ... press releases</i>". There's nothing more in the Guardian link besides a reprint of the press release, so this is both trivial <i>and</i> not independent. Still failing our simplest notability requirements. What about CNN?<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/03/22/school.shooting/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/03/22/school.shooting/index.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> One sentence that says <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Weise_64a3.html" title="Jeff Weise">Jeff Weise</a> posted there, again, fine for his article, and then <i>more reprinting of the nazi.org press release</i>. There's absolutely nothing there, in all of those links, to write any kind of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wp%7Everifiable.html" title="Wp:verifiable">wp:verifiable</a> article from. And the fact that nobody has actually bothered to investigate them is evidence that nazi.org is in fact non-notable; no journalists or academics are interested in them enough to study them and write anything approaching a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wp%7Ereliable_source.html" title="Wp:reliable source">wp:reliable source</a>, because they have no notability whatsoever outside of the <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Weise_64a3.html" title="Jeff Weise">Jeff Weise</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_dd3b.html" title="Bill White">Bill White</a> articles. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 20:46, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. A website is not a political party. They have run no candidates, have held no conventions, no membership to speak of, no major role in any significant protest movements, no publications outside of their own website. They do seem to have gotten some attention in outside articles but only because of the utter weirdness of the idea or speculation whether this is a joke, so does not completely fail <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> but doesn't clearly pass WP:ORG either.

<li><b>keep</b> If people treat this party as real, then it is real as a concept, and since it is obviously N judged by the comments above--even of those who were arguing for delete. If there were any doubt about N, it no longer exists, after Jeff Weise who is widely known to have supported their principles. it is the sort of think which goes into WP.

<li>I'll assume you weren't being intentionally disingenuous in saying that my words really amount to "keep". Even with honest intention, it's certainly not a fair argument. I believe I've been perfectly clear in the reasons why this article fails notability, and you haven't addressed those reasons. Simply, without reliable sources to write an article from, <i>we cannot create a "relatively reliable guide</i>" for anyone to read here. In addition to non-notabilty, the article fails <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, and it fails hard, as I've demonstrated above. Discuss the sources if you like, but as the case currently stands, we have no verifiable content whatsoever except "Jeff Weise posted some messages and Bill White distributed a press release." And no one is showing up with better sources. <span style="white-space: nowrap">— <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span>acan</a></span> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant: small-caps">lk</span></a> — 04:28, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That was me removing a red link to List of members of State and Territory parliaments that was created a month ago by moving one of the incomplete and unmaintained sublists out of this page. That article was deleted under the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} process as <i>Incomplete list of past and present members of eight different parliaments, 15 different houses, over 150 years for some of them.

<li><b>Keep</b> for the reasons listed at the list of former politicians debate.

<li>If this article is kept or recreated, it should be made a list of complete lists for each of the 16 houses of state territory or federal parliament.

<li><b>Further comment</b> Since it looks likely thst this page might be kept, I have replaced the link to the recently deleted articles with a complete list of links to the lists of current members of each parliament. The page is still odd now as it has links to 15 lists of current members, and 15 links to people who were members of colonial parliaments over 100 years ago.

<p>This is a meaningless article. Patents cannot be granted through the PCT procedure, it is merely a centralised system for prosecuting patent <b>applications</b> which must then be turned into individual patent applications before each national office in question who will then decide, under their own laws, whether or not to grant a patent. Article is therefore misleading and unecessary in view of existing articles on software patents under US, UK, EP and JP law. Have nevertheless copied text into <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_Cooperation_Treaty_222a.html" title="Patent Cooperation Treaty">Patent Cooperation Treaty</a> article in case something useful can be salvaged from the discussion of the various Rules and Articles of the PCT that are mentioned.

<ul>
<li>Let me give an example as I fear I'm not explaining this properly. Say I create an article called "Blah". The content of that article is little more than "blah, blah, blah", but in the middle of the article is an inciteful, referenced section about the works of Mozart. I want to keep the bit about Mozart and merge it into the existing Mozart article, but the article as a whole is clearly up for deletion. Are you saying that merging the Mozart bits into Mozart means the rest of the article cannot be deleted? Surely not. I feel that this is a comparable case. The article, and the title of the article was meaningless and no record of it should remain on Wikipedia, even though some intelligent and well-versed contributors referenced interesting parts of the PCT in a (failed, in my view) attempt to make the article as a whole make sense. <a href="../../../g/d/a/User%7EGDallimore_1dd1.html" title="User:GDallimore">GDallimore</a> 19:35, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

On the contrary, it suggests merging as a resolution to many issues, with the article then being reduced to a redirect. However, the only reason for keeping even a redirect is because of the links from 9 articles which would then be broken. Since the only thing which can be said about the subject is "the PCT doesn't say anything about the whether software can be patented", a better solution would be to delete the links themselves.

<li>Uncle G is correct.

<li>I don't actually care about the fate of this page (that is, redirect or delete - I don't think it ought to remain in its current form), but that is a nonsensical reading of the licence as it applies to Wikipedia. The current version of <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_Cooperation_Treaty_222a.html" title="Patent Cooperation Treaty">Patent Cooperation Treaty</a> contains none of the text from this article except for the quote from Article 27, which is, of course, not an original part of the contribution where it was added and therefore cannot be subject to the licence. The current PCT article section is not even a derivative work of the article since the remainder of the text was written from scratch, the only common themes, aside from the quote, being the general concept that someone might be interested in whether the PCT had any provisions on the substantive questions of what is patentable in a Contracting State and the fact that any useful statement of this must necessarily refer to Rule 67 and might refer to software patents as being a relevant example. If I understand your interpretation of GFDL, a person could prevent the deletion of <b>any</b> page by copying some of the text into another article and saying that even if it is immediately deleted again, it will remain available through the history of that page and consequently the original source page needs to be kept so that the history of the text can be seen. That would be a nonsense for text which was generally felt not to be needed at all in Wikipedia and was available only because it was inconvenient to delete sections of history of a different article (and near-impossible where the text was not deleted by the very next revision).

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. Agree that article was meaningless for reasons stated. Only relevance even to <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_Cooperation_Treaty_222a.html" title="Patent Cooperation Treaty">Patent Cooperation Treaty</a> was to highlight the fact that the PCT is neutral on whether this and other subject matter is patentable but allows an exclusion from international <i>search and</i> examination.

It still needs quite a lot of revision though - I would agree with GDallimore that Rules 39 and 67 are not (and cannot in view of Article 27(5)) be about the patentability of software according to the PCT. Rather, they are a statement about the limited <i>processing</i> of international applications relating to certain subject matter <i>during the international phase</i>, depending on whether a particular International Authority would refuse to process it under its national law (see the agreements between the International Authorities and the International Bureau for the specific link with national systems). It's not an article that I'm likely to bother attempting to improve in the near future though. Tim B 21:51, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I have entirely rewritten the article, highlighting the practical, historical and interpretive significance of the topic. The article is verifiable, provides sources, and the mere fact that the PCT would be "neutral" about the topic is a meaningless reason for nominating the article for deletion. Actually, the PCT is not neutral at all about the topic, as explained in the article (but even if it was, that would not mean nothing). <s>In addition, if there is a consensus (see <a href="../../../s/o/f/Talk%7ESoftware_patents_under_the_European_Patent_Convention_2ac9.html#Moving_page.2C_new_proposal" title="Talk:Software patents under the European Patent Convention">current debate</a>), <b>rename</b> to <i><a href="../../../p/a/t/Patentability_of_software_under_the_Patent_Cooperation_Treaty_b2df.html" title="Patentability of software under the Patent Cooperation Treaty">Patentability of software under the Patent Cooperation Treaty</a></i> (indeed the PCT does not grant patents, so that renaming the article could be appropriate).</s> --<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdcolins_06ae.html" title="User:Edcolins">Edcolins</a> 01:29, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The content is largely fine, but the open para and the title are both still wrong - and opening para highlights the reason I voted this article for deletion in the first place. Article says: "There are two provisions in the Regulations annexed to the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) that directly relate to the patentability of computer programs." This is not correct. There are no provisions that relate to the <i>patentability</i> of computer programs. All these provisions say is that, when it comes to computer programs (and other subject matter) ISAs/IPEAs don't have to search/examine such applications. This is not a comment on their patentability since the PCT does not (and may not) comment on whether or not such things should be patentable. As the article states "Article 27(5) PCT provides that, as far as substantive conditions of patentability are concerned, national and regional patent laws prevail". This content is still useful but would be better put in a more general article such as Search and examination procedure under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. Current article still needs deleting, or re-directing to newly title article if GFDL will not permit deletion. 18:07, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><s>I respectfully don't agree with you. IMHO, the sentence "There are two provisions in the Regulations annexed to the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) that directly relate to the patentability of computer programs" is correct. <a href="http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/articles/a33.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/articles/a33.htm" rel="nofollow">Article 33</a> <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_Cooperation_Treaty_222a.html" title="Patent Cooperation Treaty">PCT</a> says "The objective of the international preliminary examination is to formulate a preliminary and non-binding opinion on the questions whether the claimed invention appears to be <i>novel</i>, to involve an <i>inventive step</i> (to be non-obvious), and to be <i>industrially applicable</i>", so that a preliminary opinion on patentability is provided during an international examination during the PCT procedure. <a href="http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/rules/r39.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/rules/r39.htm" rel="nofollow">Rule 39.1</a> <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_Cooperation_Treaty_222a.html" title="Patent Cooperation Treaty">PCT</a> and <a href="http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/rules/r67.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/rules/r67.htm" rel="nofollow">Rule 67.1</a> <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_Cooperation_Treaty_222a.html" title="Patent Cooperation Treaty">PCT</a> relate to this preliminary opinion (written opinion of the ISA or examination by IPEA), and can have a direct impact on the outcome of the search or examination and therefore relate to patentability. By the way, the outcome of the search and examination are now called "International Preliminary Report on <i>Patentability</i> (Chapter I or II of the PCT)".

<li><b>keep</b> the very nature of such topics makes them difficult to document by conventional sources, and if WP is to have articles about anything on this general type of subject, then documentation such as this article has is sufficient. (&amp; considering recent talk on the N guidelines, there seems to be some acceptance of flexibility here). Personally, I wonder if some of the opposition to articles on fetishes etc. is perhaps based on unconscious discomfort with the topics. Topics people are uncomfortable with, just as in political or religious topics some people are uncomfortable with--should be included whenever any evidence of them is found, lest we indirectly censor. I certainly do not mean this is the motivation of anyone taking any particular position on this article--just a general comment/caution. Unless I watch myself, I find myself reacting similarly to certain types of articles. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:42, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just to be fair, though, Wikipedia <i>does</i> have articles about notable slang terms that are written to explore the history and usage nuances of the term that go beyond a typical dictionary definition. So if this article was likewise expanded with proper sources to that more encyclopedic level of information, then it would probably be ok. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:54, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Album is notable enough to keep.

<li><b>Keep</b> Normally if the artist is notable enough to warrant an article, their albums follow suit.

<li><b>Keep</b> due to the lack of a reason to delete (that it needs attention is unsurprising, but that's not a reason to kill it off). Additionally, I'd argue that the debut album of a notable artist is itself notable - as a kind of "notable first". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 21:45, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> Only one known reference at the moment, but the fact that it's in a NASA study tells me that it's more than just bunk, the study is also linked from the article, proving that it does indeed use the term. More than a mere dictdef, it contains interesting and sourced information on a topic that appears to be noteworthy. It's also pretty well-written. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 18:53, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>KEEP. The article just needs supporting references; it would be a shame to delete. Solipsism as a philosophy and solipsism as a syndrome are different enough to warrant two separate entries (with cross-references).</p>

<dd>Because the owner of the site was using that figure to claim notability, not only does it not establish notability, its not an accurate representation of how many hits it actually receives. What I propose is obviously whats covered in WP:WEP for establishing notability on a website. So even if we want to pretend that google hits has something to do with notability, we need to look at the correct number which is 44 per that search and not 800,000 any time google searches have been referenced its always the unique hits and not the magic number google pops up at the top which counts everytime its replicated on a page or site (like a forum where a term can easily have its google results blown through the roof if every members profile is indexed and each one contains that term).--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 00:57, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b>. The first argument for deletion is that only 37 search results for RateItAll came up in Google. This number I dispute. The real number is over 800,000. The second argument for deletion is the lack of noteworthy sources referring to RateItAll. PC Magazine and ABC News (TV) have both features the website. I dispute the assertion and call them noteworthy.</p>
<p>Just as a test, I just ran a Google search three times, again, and each time about 800,000 hits came up on the return. I would entertain a discussion as to how the figures could be so disparate. Please advise.</p>

<dd>Crossmr, the PCMag article is a 783 word feature article in a leading tech magazine. Under what criteria do you find this trivial?
<dl>
<dd>its not word count, its the nature of the coverage. There are a number of types of coverage described in the notability guidelines and I don't really feel this meets the required type of coverage to be a source. The ABC news report is obviously a good source, but this is simply a description of the sites features.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 03:30, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> on grounds of continued additions; dispute claim of lack of Google Hits/alleged status of "Spam"</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon researching the link listed above by one who says that there are only 37 hits for RateItAll on Google, I've found it to be very misleading: I actually clicked on the link, and it says "Results 31 - 40 of about 812,000 for "RateItAll". (0.27 seconds)". I am baffled that this would translate to being "37 hits" when it very clearly says there are "about 812,000".</p>
<p>In addition, I dispute that the article is an advertisement nor SPAM; there is no solicitation nor is it a PR piece, and upon taking a look at the epinions article on wikipedia, it really does not appear to have a significant difference in content.</p>
<p>Regardless, I would argue that the content of the page, though meager now, has a great deal of expansion capability. By all means, I would agree that the content requires a lot of work, but that comes with time, with thorough and proper research.</p>

<dd>As pointed out, the only thing that even remotely matters from google is the amount of unique hits. I'm also going to remind people that this is a discussion, not a vote.

<dd>I believe I can safely assume that the above comment is directed at my account: I wasn't aware that seniority was an issue at this site. As a first-time user, the small contribution that I had made so far IS on the one site that I feel I am familiar with enough to write on (rateitall), but simply because I don't have the expertise to edit pages entirely too well doesn't mean that, with practice, I won't expand to other articles. I don't think anyone here would believe that this is a matter of "voting" by any means, but I do feel that pointing out any differences in translation on what is "spam" and what is not certainly qualifies for legitimate consideration. Again, I still support the venture to put information on this website on Wikipedia, provided that it is expanded to a respectable amount of information (and I do agree that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is a legitimate concern that requires addressing, but as this is still a new article, I think it can be worked on]]</dd>

<dd>Its not a matter of seniority, its a matter of long history on wikipedia. Its not uncommon for things like <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppets</a> to suddenly spring up when an article is up for deletion, especially one that involves a website or web content. I'm not saying you're a sockpuppet, but any AfD which involves editors who have only made a few contributions and they're limited solely to the AfD and the article in question always has mention of that made, with a reminder that this is a discussion and not a vote.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 03:30, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Reply: While I understand the concern in regards to "sockpuppets" (I guess that's the Wikipedia equivalent to "multi-ID spammer", if I'm understanding the link's article correctly), that would be an unfortunate side effect from being a "newbie" here; I know the guy who started the article is new at this, and I only joined in because I didn't realize that RateItAll didn't have an article up here. Actually, it never occurred to me to look until I found out he was writing one. Unfortunately for him and the article, I myself also don't know anything about editing stuff on Wikipedia either, so now you've got something that's entered in by two newbies (his contribution more than mine by all means), and it's bound to be a rough article when you don't have any experience.</dd>

<dd>But, I digress; as a newbie here, the best means of telling what's "good" and "not good" is comparison. So, when I looked up an article on a similiar type of website, I tried to see what the difference was, in order to figure out what needs to be done to get it to be "acceptable". However, I am having difficulty discerning what the differences would be. Not to pick on them or anything, as I think the page is nice, but I'm trying to compare content in the epinions article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinions" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinions" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinions</a>) with the content on the rateitall article. If you can point out what, as far as differences, the rateitall article needs to do to be "up to par" for wikipedia's standards, that would be very helpful in getting the page to be acceptable.

<p>When he started adding his expression to the <i>e</i> page, I did some research to find out if the expression was actually known in the literature as "Keller's expression" or if Keller was known in the literature; my conclusion was that neither was. -- <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominus_070e.html" title="User:Dominus">Dominus</a> 16:43, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Felix Keller also is not listed as an author of any article in MathSciNet (nor is he mentioned in any review). This also looks like the kinda formula that any number of people have stumbled on. I'd vote <b>delete</b> for both, too.
<p>Steven Finch, on the other hand, has published a number of works. I'm gonna take a quick look through the book mentioned in MR2003519 to see if it mentions Keller. (And he does work at Mathsoft; see <a href="http://www.mathsoft.com/mathsoft_resources/mathsoft_constants/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mathsoft.com/mathsoft_resources/mathsoft_constants/" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>.) <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunch_e74c.html" title="User:Lunch">Lunch</a> 23:12, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The formula is listed in Finch's book on page 15, but it isn't credited to Keller. Finch gives an a reference to Richardson's 1927 paper that discusses using differencing methods to accelerate convergence of sequences when an asymptotic expression is known for the error (this method is now known as Richardon's extrapolation). Richardson doesn't mention that formula specifically, but with some tinkering one could infer it from the results there.
<p>As for Finch, the intro to the book says in part, "Steven R. Finch studied at Oberlin College and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and held positions at TASC, Lincoln Laboratory, and MathSoft. He is presently a freelance mathematician in the Boston area." <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunch_e74c.html" title="User:Lunch">Lunch</a> 00:03, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The only claim to notability of the person is the mathematical formula. The formula, however, has been well known to everyone at least since the 18th century and is found in all calculus textbooks. To say that it was introduced in 1975, when everyone had already learned it from calculus textbooks, is to ignore all of history except the biography of this one person. I anticipate that the author of this article will say that what the calculus textbooks actually say is</li>

<dd>but the differences are trivial and every freshman (except those who ultimately never become mathematicians) makes many many similar "original discoveries". What if <b>everyone</b> who "discovered" this formula were to have a Wikipedia article? How 'bout this: "<b>John Smith</b> in 1992 discovered this important formula: 1<sup>2</sup>&#160;+18<sup>2</sup> = 6<sup>2</sup>&#160;+&#160;17<sup>2</sup> = 10<sup>2</sup>&#160;+&#160;15<sup>2</sup>, known as <b>Smith's formula</b>."

<dd><b>COMMENT:</b> OK, a bit less hasty: The formula is correct, as follows:

<dd><img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/3/a/43a0fdd208b63ea6a01fc2749412a26b.png" alt="\left({n \over n-1}\right)^{n-1}\cdot n - \left({n-1 \over n-2}\right)^{n-2}\cdot (n - 1)," /></dd>

<dd>so we have an expression approaching <i>e</i> MINUS another expression approaching <i>e</i> PLUS another expression approaching <i>e</i>. The last term comes from the cancellation of two minus signs, one of which is in the "(<i>n</i>&#160;−&#160;1)" at the end. But still, it's a trivial consequence of a basic formula known at least since the 18th century. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 02:01, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I see that <b>two</b> articles nominated for deletion both link to this same deletion-discussion page. The other one is Keller's Expression. I have already noted that "Keller's expression" has been found in all calculus textbooks since long before Keller's birth, but observe also:
<ul>
<li>The phrase "for |<i>n</i>| &gt; 2" makes no sense. The variable <i>n</i> is <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_variables_and_bound_variables.html" title="Free variables and bound variables">bound</a>. Therefore, the value of the expression does not depend on anything called <i>n</i>.</li>
<li>It refers to "the natural logarithm e" when it presumable meant "the base of natural logarithms, <i>e</i>". Whoever wrote this is not particularly familiar with mathematical reasoning or conventions. (Nor with Wikipedia's conventions.) <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 20:14, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> As noted above, the author of the article must not know much about mathematics as the equation has a limiting up to infinity involved, which means given an arbitrarily small number <span class="texhtml">ε &gt; 0</span> there exists <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/f/6/df6ac9f78ab98b3032eff5319ad5a74f.png" alt="m \in \mathbb{Z}" /> such that for all <img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/d/b/cdba20f6d595e3e5ff892e406aaf0aa2.png" alt="n \geq m" />:</li>

The discoverer of a formula can be considered to have discovered all trivial consequences of the formula as well, so Mr. Keller didn't really discover his formula after all. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 20:35, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The primary problem is notability, the secondary, lack of references. The article claims without a reference that 'Jacek Yerka's work has been exhibited in Poland, Germany, Monaco, France, and the United States. His works also hang in Polish art museums.' Even if this is referenced, is it enough to have ones work displayed in few (what?) exhibitions and musems? Are they notable - or are they just an exhibition and museum in a small town or two...? <sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 16:59, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>To start, I am not <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">making a point</a> (any claims to the contrary are not <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> nor understand what WP:POINT means). This nomination stems from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_Daily_Show_guests_b91c.html" title="List of The Daily Show guests">List of The Daily Show guests</a> being deleted (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_The_Daily_Show_guests_%282nd_nomination%29_a152.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of The Daily Show guests (2nd nomination)">here</a>) for a second time for failing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for two reasons applicable here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> — it is a list of indiscriminate information</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> — it is a directory</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Subsequently, I fail to see how this article (and the thousands like it) are any different.</b></p>
<p>First, the individual items in this article have absolutely no correlation with each other other than when they occur, which makes them indiscriminate. From WP:NOT#IINFO:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Every one of these articles fits this: just because something happened does not mean it is suitable for Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Second, the items in this article consist of a "directory" because it is a list of loosely related items. The <b>only</b> thing binding these events together is when they happen. Two completely unrelated events having only time relating them is no different than two unrelated companies listed in the <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_pages.html" title="Yellow pages">yellow pages</a> because they live in the same city.</p>
<p><br />
I am nominating this because policy currently can be interpreted that lists such as this and guests on a very popular and very notable television show are indiscriminate directories and have no encyclopedic value.</p>
<p><br />
So what does current policy say to you? Does a list of events that are <b>completely</b> unrelated to each other except when (e.g., <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20</a>) or where (e.g., <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_the_United_Kingdom_8cc5.html" title="2006 in the United Kingdom">2006 in the United Kingdom</a>) they occur indiscriminate? <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 15:08, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Utterly strong keep</b> -- Holy Jesus, Mohammed, and Moses (add any other deities, prophets, or saints you want)! That being said, I will assume good faith and reply to the points you have raised.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> does not apply here because there is a discriminating criterion (time of occurrence). For the case of "Year by Country" articles, there are <i>two</i> discriminating criteria. This criterion may not be the best, but it is a discriminating criterion nonetheless.</li>
<li>Secondly, none of the three items listed at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> apply here: this is not a business directory (#3) or a geneological/phonebook entry (#2). I think your argument applies to #1: a list of loosely associated topics such as quotations, aphorisms, or persons. However, I think this is too much of a stretch to try to apply this here. "Year" entries are not merely lists of (loosely-associated) people. They are lists of people that were born/died and events that took place in a specific (and relatively short) period of time.</li>
<li>Thirdly, these articles qualify per <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> as informative, helping navigation (especially this one), and aiding development of new articles, so they should <i>definitely</i> be kept.</li>
<li>Fourthly, this is nothing like the yellow pages, etc., because <i>all</i> of the events/persons listed in "Year" articles are notable, whereas companies listed in the a business directory need not be. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:19, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> per Black Falcon. This is obviously a <i>discriminate</i> list. It is the march of time which is determining inclusion, not the judgement of an editor. (Also, while the cited Daily Show guest list is clearly a more arguable case either way, it actually does look like a no-consensus keep at this point; thus, no precedent.) --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 18:33, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>No-brainer Keep</b> because, duh, history is <i>encyclopedic</i>. The day historical events happened is pretty bloody important to any discussion of the event and an idex-type article of those events is perfectly appropriate. I have already commented on the TDS guest list nomination so I won't drag that discussion here any more than has already happened. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:01, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> not buying it.

<li><b>Keep</b> However, while we're talking <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>, we need to kill "References to 2007 in fiction" now.

By the way, nominating an obvious-keep article for deletion, in response to an AfD decision that you disagree with, most definitely <i>is</i> <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. -- <a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslaySolomon_7ae5.html" title="User:IslaySolomon"><font color="#153E7E">Islay</font><font color="#1589FF">Solomon</font></a> <font color="#153E7E">|</font> <a href="../../../i/s/l/User_talk%7EIslaySolomon_7b55.html" title="User talk:IslaySolomon"><font color="#006600">talk</font></a> 19:41, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. The current year is notable. I can source it by the calender on my wall, or if you prefer, you can look at my date stamp. For the record, because you disagree with the reason being offered for a deletion somewhere else, you're nominating an obviously valid article because "it fits the same criteria and therefore should be deleted". Not only does that assume that we're proving non-notability (notability can be reached in several ways, and only one is needed to be included, not the other way around), but it's most definitely <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">disrupting to prove a point</a>, despite what you think. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 21:14, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I fail to see how a list of Daily Show guests corresponds to a listing of events in the year 2007. I believe that a 2007 article has great value, and far more then any television show. Why bring up the Daily Show in your argument? If you believe an article needs to be deleted state the reasons why you think so, don't compare to another article or example ( see <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>). It sounds as if you have nominated this article to use as a soapbox ( see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAP" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#SOAP</a>) your argument to delete a listing of the Daily Show guests. If you wish to nominate an article for deletion simply list why you feel that way. In any case I feel an article on the current year of 2007 is of some significance. Jka02 21:22, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Sorry, but for me there really is no question here. Removing the 2007 article would justify removing the article for every previous year, which is clearly out of the question. What better thing to put in an encyclopaedia than a record of events? The article is undoubtedly useful. Further, it seems completely inappropriate to compare this article to that of Daily Show contestants -- from the perpective of a British person, I've probably watched the Daily Show twice. This one's a no-brainer for me.. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt.smart_fdd5.html" title="User:Matt.smart"><font color="blue"><b>matt</b></font><font color="purple">.</font><font color="red">smart</font></a> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatt.smart_6c22.html" title="User talk:Matt.smart"><sup><font color="purple">talk</font></sup></a><font color="blue">/</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matt.smart_8e6e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matt.smart"><small><font color="blue">contribs</font></small></a> 21:35, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per everyone above. Admittedly, the nearest the nominator comes to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> is the comment which suggests that nominating several articles for deletion in order to make a point is a bad thing (to my knowledge, only one is nominated), but that's roughly as close as one can come to it without actually going over the edge. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 21:41, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> A list of events in 2007 is encylopedic because an article about the year 2007 would be far to long considering all the significant events that could happen. The nomination is comparing apples to oranges. No one is going to look up lists that the nominator mentioned, but it is likly people will look up this list to see events from this year.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a> 22:02, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>del</b>. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Original research</a> by an editor who came and go and doesn't answer the questions in article and user talk pages.

While the topic is plausible, these people do exist, but as the article says, <i>"They have been neglected by researchers in linguistics and anthropology because of their identity mimicry"</i> or whatever, but wikipedia is not a vehicle for their revival. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 17:32, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- the fact that the historical region Moesia covers more or less the area where they are found, does not imply that one can change the name of the language according to it. These people are called <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timok_Vlachs_5e4d.html" title="Timok Vlachs">Timok Vlachs</a> in English, <i>Vlachs</i> in Serbo-Croatian, and themselves call <i>Rumâni</i>. They speak Romanian (a dialect, and for obvious reasons somewhat poorer in vocabulary). I coppied the content of the page into an item of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Talk%7ETimok_Vlachs_6844.html" title="Talk:Timok Vlachs">Talk:Timok Vlachs</a>, so that if there are 2-3 useful sentences, one can use that info in the appropriate page. It is a waste of AfD space and time to name an article for deletion when it is obvious an ad hoc invented title.

Many Liblogs members were given media accreditation at the convention. Liblogs has been featured in prominent "verifiable, reliable" media sources:

<p>Also, statements like "No evidence that this <i>website</i> has won notable awards" betray a fundamental ignorance about the article. <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liblogs.html" title="Liblogs">Liblogs</a> is not about www.liblogs.ca, it's about <i>all 250 sites</i> that comprise the group.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There is no realistic reason to treat The Blogging Tories, Progressive Bloggers or Liblogs differently. They are all lists of hundreds of bloggers in Canada and they are all read daily by Canadian opinion makers, including politicians, journalists and lobbyists. All three are integral to current Canadian politics and, unless Canadian politics is considered "trivial", all three should remain. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Cherniak_61e6.html" title="User:Jason Cherniak">Jason Cherniak</a> 13:22, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. The site liblogs.ca is mentioned in reliable sources, but in each case it's not the primary topic. Google finds 643 inbound links to www.liblogs.ca which is not tremendous. The argument for keeping this article would be based on the political significance of the site. I believe that it has about the same significance as <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogging_Tories_edf8.html" title="Blogging Tories">Blogging Tories</a>, so both should go together, but the references for this one are slightly better. If we deleted this article as well as <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogging_Tories_edf8.html" title="Blogging Tories">Blogging Tories</a> we would then have practically no coverage of political blogging in Canada. In fact, I might be persuaded to give up this article if someone would write Political blogging in Canada. The closest thing we have is <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_blogosphere.html" title="Canadian blogosphere">Canadian blogosphere</a> but that one is very short. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 16:46, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>As usual with these kinds of articles, we need to see notability. Why is the school notable&#160;? And what references can be provided to support this claim&#160;?

<p>I suspect this page about a book is a complete hoax. When searching for the book title on Barnes &amp; Noble, it returns no results. I repeated this on Amazon Book Search with the same result. Searching for <i>"big head little body" book</i> on Google returns under 400 results, none of which seem to relate to the article at all, which surely isn't right if, as the article says, the book was at the number one bestseller spot for three months in 1978? <a href="../../../h/4/c/User%7EH4cksaw_7364.html" title="User:H4cksaw"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: darkgreen; border: 1px solid;">&#160;H4cksaw&#160;</span></a> <small><a href="../../../h/4/c/User_talk%7EH4cksaw_6f39.html" title="User talk:H4cksaw"><span style="color: #3399FF; text-decoration: underline;">(talk)</span></a></small> 21:00, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Minor local councillor (the lowest level of elected officialdom in the UK- even a small village will have at least 2 or 3 councillors) in Bournemouth, a British seaside resort town.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Being a councillor in a unitary authority such as Bournemouth actually carries a lot of power and responsibility; far more than a town or district councillor has. In addition, Nick King is a parliamentary figure, a business entrepeneur (who won The Daily Echo award for one of Dorset's most promising entrepeneurs in 2006) and a rising star in the Conservative Party. By all means Wikify the article, but it has definite notability. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardbooth_bdaa.html" title="User:Richardbooth">Richardbooth</a> 23:53, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Nick King is a very well respected Conservative Councillor in Bournemouth and parliamentary candidate for Mid Poole North Dorset. The fact that he has his own page and biography on the official national Conservative Party website is grounds to prevent this article from deletion. Michael Griffiths</li>

<li>Both of these individuals are personal friends and colleagues of Mr. King, for the record- see e.g. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Michael_Griffiths_590f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Michael Griffiths">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Michael Griffiths</a> for details. I think, with respect, you guys need to have a good look at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Being mentioned in "The Daily Echo" (????) as <i>"one of Dorset's most promising entrepeneurs in 2006"</i> is not likely to be taken as grounds for notability. Of all the DCF-related articles however, King's is the closest to notable, on account of his selection as a parl candidate- but the next election will likely not be for 2-3 years, and he may not win anyway. Generally, local councillors and as-yet unelected parliamentary candidates are not considered notable here (at least, in and off themselves). If he actually has a national profile (e.g. multiple articles in respected, wide circulation national papers, or television, or similar) then please provide details here. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 00:37, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Being a Councillor in itself does not conduct any power or authority - only as a cabinet member on a local authority do you wield power and responsibility.

While their deletion processes do not apply to us, this does show that people have looked for sources and failed. The article is also largely incoherent and fails to note that this is very much a fringe candidate. A prod was removed without these issues being addressed. I was tempted to speedy delete this, but I think being a presidential candidate is a claim to notability. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../g/a/d/User_talk%7EGadfium_49fb.html" title="User talk:Gadfium"><font face="cursive" color="#808080">gadfium</font></a> 21:40, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Granted, and I'm not saying he necessarily <i>is</i> notable, but the fact is you haven't filed and campaigned whereas he has (multiple times in multiple elections). Whether the sources I've noted above make him notable...I don't know.

Tim Kalemkarian articles. Kalemkarian is an official Candidate registered with the Federal Election Commission. Kalemkarian spoke on a nationaly sindicated radio show with Hugh Hewitt the host. Hewitt can be contacted at web site hughhewitt.townhall.com . This article is very robust and vivacious. Tim Kalemkarian has inproved the article very much. Keep the article. author&#160;: Tim Kalemkarian. {{publish}} {{source:oricinal/author:Tim Kalemkarian}} [[Category:North America/United States/California/Los Angeles/Politics and Conflicts/United States Federal Elections, 2008]] <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Anonymous4 (<a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous4_80a2.html" title="User talk:Anonymous4">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anonymous4_9373.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anonymous4">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd><b>Delete</b>. None of the information currently in the article, except for bald facts about him being filed as a candidate in certain races, can be confirmed from the sources given. I looked him up in the FEC's database <a href="http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/norcansea.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/norcansea.shtml" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> by typing his last name into the search box. That database gives his full name, address, and names of his committees, which are mostly trivial strings of letters including his last name. Even the stuff in our article about his positions is completely unsourced. This article, if kept, will not be maintainable. Is it going to be our policy that anyone who files for president, in any state, deserves an article in Wikipedia? Surely in presidential politics, of all fields, you would expect that notable candidates would be covered in the press. There are no press mentions in the article, with the possible exception of the Hugh Hewitt show, which does not leave us with any actual text about him that we can cite.</dd>

<dd>In a previous comment, <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">User:Black Falcon</a> argued that the Talk page was in favor of a Keep. At a quick glance, nearly everything in the Talk page looks to be contributed by Kalemkarian himself, so I wouldn't consider that to be persuasive. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 02:13, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I meant the talk page of this AfD (and yes, you are right about the contributor). There exists some coverage of Mr. Kalemkarian in various places, but I don't know whether they qualify as "non-trivial" mentions. I remain, still, <i>neutral</i> (there is a claim of appearance on a radio show, but that claim is unsourced, so it does little to sway me toward a keep). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:46, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Including a brief summary of who each of the contestants was not only makes the article more informative but reflects the whole nature of the show.

<li><b>Comment</b> The nomination appears to be somewhat flawed. First, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> doesn't cover cast lists/lists of game show participants/etc. It's pretty specific on the areas it covers, and this isn't one of those areas. The list <i>might</i> fall under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIRECTORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIRECTORY</a> as a "list of loosely associated topics", but that's debatable since there are other generally accepted cast lists for other shows, including game shows such as Survivor. And since the list entries actually go into a little enyclopedic style detail on the individual people, it's not simply a directory of names. The nomination also assert, perhaps presumptively, that all the individuals on the list are not notable. But that isn't necessarilly the case, as we do have some articles about people who are primarily notable for being game show contestents because of the amount of verifiable published articles about them.</li>

<dd>So basically so far I'm not convinced that the article deserves deletion by the arguments presented above. If the question is whether or not this material should be merged, a better way to go about it might be to try a merge tag and discuss it on the talk pages of the articles to be merged. Off hand I don't see a reason yet for deletion. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:33, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> A redirect or delete is the most appropriate solution.

<dl>
<dd>I should mention that not all of the contestents have to be notable for the list as a whole to be notable. For example, an article about a tv series will usually have a cast list, and sometimes the cast list is split off as a seperate article due to its size. Not all the actors on the cast list are necessarilly individually notable, but the cast list as a whole for the show does usually have notability. So I can definitely see people reasonably arguing that this cast list article for this show is likewise, as a whole, notable, even though not everyone on the cast would be notable enough for their own article. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:04, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>The Amazing Race</i>, while not on the same caliber ratings- and notability-wise as <i>Survivor</i>, has produced over its years a large set of contestants. Many Survivor contestants, including pretty much all the winners and runners-up, have their own page, and I don't think it would be a necessarily bad thing to have a brief page describing a few notes about each contestant (with perhaps a bit more info than what's available on the CBS site). I think at the very least, if we can't make individual pages for the winners, then make them like a "team" page, like, for example, <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_and_Drew_Riker_ac8f.html" title="Derek and Drew Riker">Derek and Drew Riker</a>. Chip &amp; Kim, I would say, are notable winners, as well as Flo, and there are several, SEVERAL contestants who, while they didn't win, could easily merit their own page (a Charla Faddoul page, I think, is long overdue....)--<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansTAR_ef6a.html" title="User:HansTAR">HansTAR</a> 00:20, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As a compromise to the deletion of the David and Mary Conley articles, I had suggested that a single page be created, <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazing_Race_10_contestants_6159.html" title="Amazing Race 10 contestants">Amazing Race 10 contestants</a>, to encompass all the contestants. I went to work developing that page and similar pages for each of the seasons of TAR. Prior to my posting my work, I got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Evrik&amp;diff=107898180&amp;oldid=107871402#Proposed_.22Amazing_Race_X_contestants.22_articles" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Evrik&amp;diff=107898180&amp;oldid=107871402#Proposed_.22Amazing_Race_X_contestants.22_articles" rel="nofollow">message</a> from Madchester that led me to believe that this would not be welcome. I had laid out the structure on each of the pages for a ‘’Contestants” subpage, and created contestant pages, and was going to post them and any appropriate merge tags. Instead of causing an even bigger fiasco I decided to post just a single page and see how that was accepted.

<li><b>Comment</b>: As noted, taking out all but original research and merging the article back into the main TAR5 article would make the main TAR5 too large. However, leaving the basic information from this article on a page by itself would make this page too small and, as noted, worthy of deletion. For someone who's trying to make a similar page for TAR1, my suggestion there, and applies here, is that there should be a single "Notable Contestants from The Amazing Race" with season-specific sections. This doesn't require each team be listed, only those notable outside of the show (even if it's post-show fame they've capitalized on); doing a page for the entire show helps to prevent minimal per-season pages, though there's no reason that if a single season has many notable people as to make the overall show page too heavy, that that single season can be moved into a single page leaving a note on the all-season page. The idea being, like currently argued about some Survivor contestants, is that a per-person/team page is kruft since most of these people disappear after being on their show, but a catchall page for notable entries avoids much of this.--<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasem_8b9e.html" title="User:Masem">Masem</a> 14:38, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>And another article about a school... As usual, we need to see: a reason why the school is notable, and adequate evidence to support this claim. The article includes neither, so fails our basic guidelines. In particular, let's note that being the "second oldest" is not an adequate claim of notability: it is merely an observation of a unique quality, but having a unique quality is not per se notable. I, for example, am the only person born at a particular time and in a particular place: this does not make me notable, merely unique. Being "second oldest" may well be unique, but the principal response from us should be "so what?".

<li><b>Keep</b>. Constantly repeating that Wikipedia isn't a dictionary doesn't actually make this into a dictionary definition.

<li>In which case the dictionary is stretching its entries to include more than just definitions.</li>
<li>A dictionary definition is a definition that appears in a dictionary. A dictionary definition is not "*anything* which appears in a dictionary". If a dictionary includes encyclopediac material about something, that doesn't mean the encyclopediac material is a dictionary definition. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 21:49, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The policy is not "Wikipedia is not dictionary definitions", but "Wikipedia is not a dictionary", which <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DICT" title="WP:NOT">as you can see</a> includes usage guides. If the content doesn't go beyond what's in a dictionary, then it falls under there. What material do you feel is encyclopedic? There's an etymology that's more of a history of defnite articles than of the word "the", which looks like it's encyclopedic by mistake, but that can be merged. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 22:02, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Whilst <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> seems unhappy that other editors keep referring to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> policy, I would suggest that as <a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> has noted, this is very important as it states the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html#The_differences_between_encyclopaedia_and_dictionary_articles" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">differences between encyclopaedia and dictionary articles</a>. It also states <i>"A full dictionary article... will contain illustrative quotations for each listed meaning; etymologies; translations; inflections; links to related and derived terms; links to synonyms, antonyms, and homophones; a pronunciation guide in various dialects, including links to sound files; and usage notes; and can be very long indeed"</i>. My point being that the question is whether it should be a dictionary definition or an article on Wikipedia according to <i>these</i> criteria. We are referring specifically to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, not what any other dictionaries may or may not contain. We are not simply making the statement that 'Wikipedia is not a dictionary', we are referring to what that policy tells us should be on Wikipedia and what should be on Wiktionary. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambro_fced.html" title="User:Adambro">Adambro</a> 23:01, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The reason I said it that way is that several people specifically mentioned dictionary definitions, which this isn't. But even ignoring that, it has no similar words with different articles, no inflections, nobody is suggesting foreign language versions, and it certainly isn't a proper noun. While it is an article about a word, even the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> policy gives an example of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singular_they.html" title="Singular they">singular they</a>.

<p><b>Delete</b>: <i>Vanity page</i>: I read most of the articles linked to. The articles were either trivial or biased. The other links were to web sites that this guy owns. That's about as biased as it comes. It's <i>possible</i> that he's notable, but this article definitely looks like a PR piece to me. Also, "Eligo International" turns up very few references elsewhere, and the first few pages worth of links on Google are NN sources: phone books and things like Craigslist. <i>There's virtually no verifiable information on the guy on the Internet</i>. Isn't this odd for "one of the most decorated living Britons"? -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomXP411_f5b6.html" title="User:TomXP411">TomXP411</a><sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETomXP411_8736.html" title="User talk:TomXP411">[Talk]</a></sup></p>

<p><b>Keep</b> As one of the significant contributors to this article, I principally used the respected and newly published Debretts People of Today of 2007 to find most of this information including all the foreign honours and positions. I also used various online websites to back it up including as many non Bailey sites as possible ie medias. Bailey is an interesting person for me by the nature of his very wide activities, growing political influence and the fact that he has given money to a major UK political party during the ongoing political crisis here with the UK Government. I therefore oppose deletion but if you want me to re-edit it I can or you can. -- <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeisal_1c09.html" title="User:Seisal">Seisal</a><sup><a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeisal_8ceb.html" title="User talk:Seisal">[Talk]</a></sup><small>— <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeisal_1c09.html" title="User:Seisal">Seisal</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeisal_8ceb.html" title="User talk:Seisal">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__Seisal_5f07.html" title="Special:Contributions/ Seisal">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<dd>After a little more research, I've turned up some articles about him or his companies... but the way they all talk about him makes my skin crawl. It keeps triggering that "too good to be true" flag in my head. Also, his web sites (Elios, and the art foundation) don't have ANY links from other web sites. That seems odd for organizations that claim to be so important or influential. On the other hand, one article I found said that his fee for some arbitration was over £1 million. When you run in those circles, you don't exactly need Google for clients to find you. <i>If the article is kept</i>, there's got to be a way to make it sound less like a résumé and more like an encyclopedia entry. Perhaps, instead of listing all of his awards, charities, etc, we could shorten it and say "works with several organizations, the most notable are:" and "has received several awards, such as..." -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomXP411_f5b6.html" title="User:TomXP411">TomXP411</a><sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETomXP411_8736.html" title="User talk:TomXP411">[Talk]</a></sup> 06:22, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Investigate &amp; reduce to a stub</b> People in high positions do have links on Google, at least with respect to the organizations they are associated with. I notice that every one of the affiliations listed is one that is not available online. Almost every one of the awards listed will have a list of holders of some sort, and I think in these circumstances they have to be checked. We may find ourselves having made a mistake here. The proposed course of action will be to stubbify the article, and add data only as it becomes available. Has anyone checked the Times article, which is not available to me--the link is just to the Times website. It would at least demonstrate the existence of a person. by that name. The Evening Standard may or may not be a RS in general, but the material here is from the society gossip column, and sounds very much as if he wrote the press release. He claims one single million pound fee, but it does not say for what. Read the article sentence by sentence. The Painting &amp; Patronage web site, designed by his company, mentions him only in passing as a member of the advisory board. The Foreign Policy Centre seems to have the nest documentation for him--a brief bio. at <a href="http://fpc.org.uk/search/anthony+bailey/" class="external free" title="http://fpc.org.uk/search/anthony+bailey/" rel="nofollow">http://fpc.org.uk/search/anthony+bailey/</a></li>

<p>Eligo, his company, also makes charitable contributions and boasts about them on its website. Any company doing this makes very sure they get newspaper coverage. (And they don't just do diplomacy; they also do website design) The company site claims that he was Anthony Bailey appointed to the UK’s Ministerial Task Force on Gifted and Talented Education in Jan 07. Such appointments are announced. It isn't in google. The best positive evidence so far is photographs on the Eligo web site, which seem to show him with world leaders. Have we ever accepted that as a RS for N? <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:15, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm wondering if part of the problem is that most of his contributions are in the Middle East. The media in these countries won't be accessible to english-language search engines. This is so frustrating, because this guy may indeed be notable, but <i>I can't prove it</i>. I also can't prove that he's not. What I do know is that he is listed as an owner or major contributer to nearly every site that talks about him. -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomXP411_f5b6.html" title="User:TomXP411">TomXP411</a><sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETomXP411_8736.html" title="User talk:TomXP411">[Talk]</a></sup> 05:42, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All of those sources bar one are about some aristocratic religious club - I don't see wikipedia's notability guidelines indicating that as a cast iron reason to have article space. The other references simply indicates he owns a PR firm - again not any sort of reason for notability. The phrase "self publicist" jumps out at me with this case - and when phrases like that are about I am very careful about fuelling ego's - especially when they own a PR firm and there is a very high probability that the editors involved in creating this article have a COI. <a href="../../../s/f/c/User%7ESFC9394_9d0f.html" title="User:SFC9394">SFC9394</a> 13:55, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I suggest you revise the Education section to reflect his own (previously included), i.e. UCL, Budapest, and Sofia degrees, and not his work in the Education sector. You could also add a section on his actual accomplishments, as I advised before, e.g. what funds has he helped raise, and to what social or community benefit (impact on Passage Homeless Center? Impact of his assistance to Nuncio in Serbia? etc). What has been the impact of his particular diplomatic/brokerage activities, and can this be demonstrated verifiably? He presumably did not get his various knighthoods or awards just for being good at PR, but rather for having distinguished himself - so how did he do that, and what was/were its verifiable result/s? Also, he has been the object of some media controversy, e.g. his dealings with mid-east states and his one-time funding offer to the Labour Party, which was rejected at that time. How have these controversies been resolved? Why did he accept to become an Ambassador (to Europe) for Gambia, given the peculiarities of the latter's Prez and his so-called herbal cure for AIDS? Is that an honorary post or remunerated? And how does he square that with his foreign policy advisory role to Labour's FPC - is that not a COI? These issues are in the public domain already, and should be addressed via NPOV <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETricky_84ef.html" title="User:Tricky">Tricky</a> 22:44, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Thanks for your valuable comments. I have revised the article considerably again to reflect your opinions and added backed his education background and researched his various other roles and put why he got each honour in the relevant section where I could fine it from non Eligo sources. His education role seems quite considerable as it crosses into his fundraising and Middle Eastern roles as well as some of the honours he has received either for related work within the UK or abroad. I have sourced several national newspaper articles which refer to the £8m raised for city academies and added this into the article and linked it to some of his existing education roles. The United Learning Trust role is important since it directly links him to the two sheffield academies he fundraised and he sits of their board along side the like of Lord Carey of Clifton, Dame Angela Rumbold and Sir Anthony Greener. Interestingly the more I research him the more I can see that his PR role is very much secondry to his inter-religious, philtantropic and education roles. This is also backed up in the Sunday Times article which says he cleared just over £100k in one year through PR. I have had to be quite careful when refering to this article since it is subject to legal action and denied by the Prime Minister and others. Should I remove it all together or can I keep it as it is. I can only assume that the many other charitbale roles he has are also in the field of event organisation, protocol and fundraising although I cannot find verifiable proof as to which. Knowing of the problems of Serbia and Montenegro the work for the Holy See for which he was knighted is also related to inter-religious work and there is a picture of him with some muslims and jews on the official papal knights website. I cannot find anything on his Gambian role except one article which I have referred to from a Gambian paper shortly before his appointment as Ambassador. No idea of the AIDS herbal cure! What madness! Doubt he is getting paid to be an Ambassador at Large and the Gambian article I found seems to suggest he was in the ocuntry originally to assist business in the Gambia and therefore assume the Ambassadorial role relates to this somehow or the African Union summit which Gambia hosted last year. Very little in this regard at least in English. Believe I have answered now most of the points raised by the community and ignored some of the unnecessary personal attacks on Bailey himself in relation to politics and his future wife and suggest that it is a considered for <s><b>speedy keep</b></s> now unless there are other comments. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeisal_1c09.html" title="User:Seisal">Seisal</a></li>

<dd>I do not have any connection to Bailey but became interested in his inter-religious work as a British Catholic and have seen articles on him in the past in the Catholic press in this country. I too felt orginally that at his age it must be too good to be true but his story does stack up even when you remove all the eligo references. When I read in January his engagement to the Austrian Princess in the newspaper I was already aware through history books of the Hohenberg anti-Nazi role during the Second World War and saw that this was not properly reflected on the Wikipedia entry on the Family so added some. The connection between the two led me to start to investigate Bailey some more and I started adding to the existing page on him. I have never played a role on wikipedia before and so started to change articles without being properly qualified in terms of the community's requirements. Yes I made many mistakes but my persistence with this article is that I believe him to be notable in many circles but at the same time have learnt a great deal as to how wikipedia works and what is expected of it and I hope the community will understand - even those that seem to suggest that whatever I do on Bailey and spend so long to correct my mistakes and get it right in the end are unwilling to accept. It seems one or two in community have grudges against him for be a Labour Party supporter or for other reasons but that should not affect my work or indeed some of their comments in relation to the context of this article. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeisal_1c09.html" title="User:Seisal">Seisal</a></dd>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b>: For the record I don't play the game and I don't even have it installed. I created the article because it is a nethack clone, much like the other games that I have listed in the see also section, all of which don't have any sources listed. Those games are notable just because they are nethack clones. Well this game is a nethack clone and is 3D, while the others are just 2D. I first came across this game thru a british published magazine, that I bought while I was in the U.S. a few years back, so it was mentioned in print at somepoint, I don't have the magazine but now I know that it's called Linux Format [<a href="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">[73]</a>].

<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b></s>. The first problem I have with this here is that it's been covered (at least, so says the article), but there's nothing to back it up.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I created this article in order to allow Wikipedia readers to access information which I feel is valuable and interesting. Furthermore, the information presented is verifiable (by looking at the project webpage and looking at secondary sources, which can be found with a Google search). Regarding the POV comments, please note Black Falcon's statement above that the Index is POV, not the article (just like an article about the <a href="../../../k/l/u/Klu_Klux_Klan_07cc.html" title="Klu Klux Klan">Klu Klux Klan</a>, for example). Also, the objections explicitly raised in the nomination are invalid:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>The Index webpage is linked to multiple times in the article text and as an E.L... a pretty valid source when the question at hand is the content of the Index. (<i>contra</i>: "Has no reliable sources or references to the 'index'.")</li>
<li>The article certainly does not fail <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> -- it is mentioned and cited by numerous sources.</li>

<dd>However, an implicit objection was made which might be valid: non-notability. ("Appears to have been made up by one person".

I don't know on what criteria "notability" ought to be evaluated in this case, but I invite those editors who have not yet done so to read <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_Arguments_e228.html#Arguments_against_deleting_articles_for_non-notability" title="Wikipedia:Notability/Arguments">Arguments against deleting articles for non-notability</a> before voting against the article on that basis (and also to perform a Google search and note the numerous references to the Index). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Runger_5d8c.html" title="User:Dave Runger"><b><font color="#00EEEE">D</font><font color="#00EEEE">a</font><font color="#00CED1">v</font><font color="#00CED1">e</font> <font color="#009ACD">R</font><font color="#009ACD">u</font><font color="#00CED1">n</font><font color="#00CED1">g</font><font color="#00EEEE">e</font><font color="#00EEEE">r</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_Runger_1560.html" title="User talk:Dave Runger">(t)</a></sup>⁄<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dave_Runger_a590.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dave Runger">(c)</a></sub> 04:00, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Note also that Notability is not a specified requirement for Wikipedia articles. Articles are only required to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, avoid being <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and be written from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, and this article meets all of those qualifications. The "Notability" criterion which is often brought up in deletion discussions is done so (legitimately) usually because of concerns relating to the Verifiability requirement, but since the article only attempts to report on the contents of the Index (and these can be easily verified at the project webpage, which is linked from the article), such a non-notability criticism is not legitimate in this context. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Runger_5d8c.html" title="User:Dave Runger"><b><font color="#00EEEE">D</font><font color="#00EEEE">a</font><font color="#00CED1">v</font><font color="#00CED1">e</font> <font color="#009ACD">R</font><font color="#009ACD">u</font><font color="#00CED1">n</font><font color="#00CED1">g</font><font color="#00EEEE">e</font><font color="#00EEEE">r</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_Runger_1560.html" title="User talk:Dave Runger">(t)</a></sup>⁄<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dave_Runger_a590.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dave Runger">(c)</a></sub> 04:27, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

Also, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Runger_5d8c.html" title="User:Dave Runger">Dave_Runger</a>, please be aware that your arguments on the inclusion criteria are somewhat suspect. First of all, while <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a> is not in itself an ABSOLUTE requirement for inclusion in Wikipedia, it is an ABSOLUTELY valid reason for deletion as well as a guideline accepted by the majority of Wikipedia editors for both purposes. Further, google hits are not an accurate gauge of notability, they should only be used as anecdotal evidence in concert with other sources of information. Also note that <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> explains that "valuable and interesting" (as you and another have described the article in this discussion) are not themselves valid reasons for inclusion in Wikipedia. Even if we momentarily accept the premise of your argument, this article still fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Sources must be from reliable, third-party <i>published</i> sources, especially in a case like this in which the subject matter concerns a global review and is based on other, similar lists (which do, by the way, satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). If sources are included, such as printed newspaper, magazine, and/or journal articles, and the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> issue is addressed, I see no reason why this article needs to be deleted. However as it stands right now, I have to say delete. I can very easily create an index of similar sorts, that measures some arbitrary concept, find real research to back up my rankings, and calculate the index based on that evidence. Then I could just as easily plant this information online, maybe spread it around a bit, have it cited by some blogs, create a wikipedia entry for it, and maybe submit it to Digg or Fark. Even if I do all of these things, it would still not fit into an encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIRelayer_de15.html" title="User:IRelayer">IRelayer</a> 23:41, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Even if this were not the case, I believe the article has further problems, thank you for only addressing one of them and ignoring the rest. --<a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIRelayer_de15.html" title="User:IRelayer">IRelayer</a> 07:27, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>There's no need for sarcasm. I still don't see how the section is POV. "Pro-individual freedom, pro-economic freedom and pro-limited government stance" are, in fact, the very tenets of libertarianism. If it quacks, walks, and looks like a duck, it's not POV to call it a duck. However, to satisfy the concerns you've raised, I will replace it with a more neutral and better-sourced section tomorrow. Also, I did not "ignore the rest", but rather focused on what I perceived to be the most important. So, to reply to the other points you've raised:</li>

However, this index is noted in a number of sources, which I will add to the article (again, tomorrow). However, as a Google search will show, the index and its rankings are discussed by a number of sources (in my opinion unforunately as I believe the index to be a terrible cross-national indicator of "liberty").</li>

<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is about "verifiability" rather than being "verified". Most of the information in the article is in fact already verified, and that which is not is certainly verifiable.</li>

<dd>In all fairness, you did state that "If sources are included, such as printed newspaper, magazine, and/or journal articles, and the WP:NPOV issue is addressed, I see no reason why this article needs to be deleted." My comment was not intended to dismiss your arguments, but rather to try to understand why you perceived that section to be POV. I hope you will take a look at the revised version of the article and re-evaluate your position in light of its new state.

<li>My point was, that if I make up <i>Selket's world technology index</i> and rank all of the countries by their deployment of technology, <i>Selket's world technology index</i> doesn't deserve a wikipedia page because nobody reputable recognizes it. This has nothing to do with POV or validity of the index, my complaint is that this whole thing is published by some guy in his garage. --<b><a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/l/User_talk%7ESelket_51a5.html" title="User talk:Selket">Talk</a></sup> 07:39, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a>, even if your analogy is a good one (and I'm not saying it is, as you might be hard-pressed to find as many sources citing <i>Selket's world technology index</i> as the number that cite the State of World Liberty Index), I fail to understand what would be so bad about having a Wikipedia article about something some guy published in his garage. This article only represents the <i>subjective evaluation</i> of the State of World Liberty Project's founder. Therefore, his published views on the internet and citations of the Index by other sources is quite enough to establish <i>verifiably</i> that the Wikipedia article is, in fact, accurate in the claims it makes. The Wikipedia article is written in a NPOV, even if the index is not. Furthermore, the Wikipedia article is not a piece of original research. (The article merely reports on research/analysis done by the State of World Liberty Project, which in turn is based on the work of reputable organizations such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Heritage_Foundation_4ef6.html" title="The Heritage Foundation">The Heritage Foundation</a>/<a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_House_082a.html" title="Freedom House">Freedom House</a><a href="../../../r/e/p/Reporters_Without_Borders_f790.html" title="Reporters Without Borders">Reporters Without Borders</a>, etc.). I believe that I have demonstrated that the article meets the three qualifications demanded of Wikipedia article. Deletion votes seem to be based either on the erroneous belief that notability is a necessary quality of Wikipedia articles (though the Index might be "notable" anyhow) and a misunderstanding that a NPOV policy means that the subjects described in articles must have a NPOV. This is utterly false; the articles themselves are, however, required to be written with no POV. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Runger_5d8c.html" title="User:Dave Runger"><b><font color="#00EEEE">D</font><font color="#00EEEE">a</font><font color="#00CED1">v</font><font color="#00CED1">e</font> <font color="#009ACD">R</font><font color="#009ACD">u</font><font color="#00CED1">n</font><font color="#00CED1">g</font><font color="#00EEEE">e</font><font color="#00EEEE">r</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_Runger_1560.html" title="User talk:Dave Runger">(t)</a></sup>⁄<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dave_Runger_a590.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dave Runger">(c)</a></sub> 09:52, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>The State of World Liberty Index is a ranking of countries according to the degree of economic and personal freedoms which their citizens enjoy; each country is given a score between 0 and 100. The Index defines freedom as "the ability for the individual to live their lives as they choose, as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others to do the same." Only one report (the 2006 State of World Liberty Index, released 12 August 2006) has yet been produced by the State of World Liberty Project, but the organization has stated that it will continue to release updated reports annually.[1] 159 countries were ranked in the 2006 report.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>Where is the POV? It is a ranking of countries according to freedom. Maybe it's not a good ranking, but it's a ranking nonetheless. The definition of "freedom" is a quote. And only one report has been produced--that's a fact as well. I'm not sure where you see it as presented "as if it were objective and factual". I do not think this is a good index, but I can't see what problem people are having with the article. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:44, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
