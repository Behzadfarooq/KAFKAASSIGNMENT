<p><b>Closer's notes</b><br />
There were nearly fifty participants in this deletion debate, and opinion was widely divided between the various options presented. As such, no single option gained a sufficient consensus to be implemented. However, the following trends were evident:</p>
<ul>
<li>About half of the participants supported <b>deletion</b>, most on the grounds of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.</li>
<li>A further ten percent supported keeping the articles on China and the EU, and <b>deleting the rest</b>.</li>
<li>About thirteen percent supported <b>merging</b> any verifiable, sourced content into other articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus although no single option recieved consensus, there is a consensus that the content should not remain in its present form. I suggest that any relevant content be added to the relevant country articles, and <i>only once that is done</i> should the articles be re-nominated for deletion. Re-nominators may cite the result of this debate as:</p>

<dd>No consensus for a single option, but a general consensus that the articles not remain in their present form.</dd>

<b>Comment</b> - I would just like to say this to the users of wikipedia. The main reason for deleting these articles are that they do not provide references. Well, now the Indian article has got 5 references and I have created a section on it's Talk Page outlining the sections we need to find references to. Hopefully, this article will no longer have any issues by the end of this week.<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle">Nobleeagle</a> 09:25, 9 March 2006 (UTC)<br />
<big><b>UPDATE</b></big> - Fellow Wikipedians, I believe that this deletion vote could be either the best or worst thing that has happened to these articles in a long time. If they are deleted, that's the worst thing that has happened. But if you were to check the Potential Superpowers - India article now, you would realize that there are over 120 references, that's a heap of work, that's the best thing that could happen to this article. So please consider the work done before voting. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle">Nobleeagle</a> 08:57, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I don't think this is working. First of all, the people that have edited Superpower and Major powers agree that Russia, Japan and Brazil are NOT Potential Superpowers. They are not listed as potential superpowers and should not even have such a page. But seeing as they do have such a page, we need to create a seperate Articles for Deletion section when it comes to Russia, Brazil and Japan, as most people with a knowledge of the subject would agree that they are not potential superpowers anyway.<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle">Nobleeagle</a> 08:54, 9 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I support the addition of the others, as they are equivalent from a policy point of view. It seems at <a href="../../../s/u/p/Talk%7ESuperpower_492f.html" title="Talk:Superpower">Talk:Superpower</a> that it was realized in January that none of these articles had any verification. Instead of improving the articles, half of them were chosen to be orphaned and forgotten; and even <i>that</i> decision drew on no outside sources. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 09:14, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My point was that their articles for deletion section should be seperate from India, China and the E.U., because this changes my opinion and I'm sure many users will now have to go and change their views so that they say <b>Keep</b> this and <b>Delete</b> that...<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle">Nobleeagle</a> 09:17, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>It has long been agreed on the Superpower discussion that Brazil, Russia and Japan are not Potential Superpowers. Therefore, there is an extra reason to delete those three, because they shouldn't be there, they are Major Powers (and in Brazil's case, are barely Major Powers). But everyone must agree that India, China and the E.U. are Potential Superpowers, so therefore, atleast these articles are not misleading in their facts.<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle">Nobleeagle</a> 09:37, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm afraid you fail to understand my point of view. There was much debate on this matter and eventually the long-term editors of Superpower decided that Russia/Japan and Especially Brazil were definitely not Potential Superpowers. Wikipedia is here to present as much fact as it can to its readers and it is fact that India, China and the E.U. presently look like they will quickly rise to heights that Russia, Japan and Brazil will not rise to. Which (trying to draw it back to the topic) means that 3 should be deleted and 3 should be kept. But we're going off-topic, so I'll just stop this discussion in saying that we should have seperate deletion pages and since no-one has voted on Russia, Brazil and Japan yet, it is still not too late.<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle">Nobleeagle</a> 09:59, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think I do understand your point of view. You seem to expect the reader to trust your judgement, or the judgement of whoever hangs out on some talk page.

<dd>Exactly my point, I suggest we restart voting, since much has happened within this period of voting being opened. 1 Section for Russia, Japan and Brazil, one section for E.U., India and China.<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle">Nobleeagle</a> 09:37, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that the process has been bungled, and JJay's proposal to split sounds best, but I think it might be too late to do it without pissing someone off. It's not the end of the world if this AfD closes with no consensus; if necessary, we can revisit the individual articles in future months. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 10:45, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think this suggestion is indicative of the overal problem of these sets of articles. The solution to original research has become more original research which points in the other direction. This is an exceptional poor analysis anyway. It takes a lot of basic facts and from them extrapolates this geopolitical conclusion which is increasingly meaningless. Wikipedia should be a place that contains those facts, but it doesn't need to present them in a way that suggests a country will or will not become a superpower. Thus, no title change can solve this problem. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 06:30, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> India, <b>Improve</b> E.U., <b>Keep</b> China - I've been reading this article for a while, and I notice more and more that the data that is given in this article (to support the notion of India's rise) is more like a predicted extension of current events. That's right, prediction. Therefore, since it's more like crystal-balling, it is POV, and not reference is mentioned. And even worse, in my opinion, what they call "power points" to support India's rise is not even a power point at all.

As such, even if every bullet point were verified, the articles would still constitute original research. The China article is just barely an exception, because it links to a story that has both the words "China" and "superpower" in the title. Even there, the source does not support the article, and its mere presence doesn't vindicate the original research going on.

There are many references available, just haven't had the time to look at them yet.

<li>I honestly, really, appreciate that you have worked hard. But if you read through the "delete" comments above, you'll find that 130 one-sentence verifications do not address many of those contributors' concerns. At <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> you'll find the policy that bans "any new interpretation, analysis, or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts, or arguments that... would amount to a 'novel narrative or historical interpretation'". These articles seem like a textbook case of that problem. I'm satisfied that all 130 points are true and, in themselves, verifiable. But who decides which facts concerning India are relevant to its potential to be a superpower, or even which facts work towards or against becoming a superpower? The article does not name any scholars, authors, politicians, thinktanks, advocacy groups, governments, or <i>any</i> entity as having made those decisions; it is only fair to assume that they have been made by you. It is that kind of analysis -- that kind of synthesis -- that we must avoid if we are to build a meaningful and trustworthy <i>encyclopedic</i> article. Instead we have a potentially unlimited list of facts heaped into a "good" pile and a "bad" pile. If you find such a list helpful, you may want to preserve it somewhere else, but it does not belong on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 09:47, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Given the number of books and articles on the subject there is no OR. We did not invent the idea that these countries are being named as potential future superpowers. If we were doing articles like Potential Superpower: Belgium, or Potential Superpower: Monaco then your points might be valid. What is being offered is a synthesis, like with any encyclopedia article, of the ideas found in reputable sources. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 10:44, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

I do believe, unlike many of the delete voters, that would be possible and beneficial to write an article on this topic that adheres to policy. Nonetheless, this article is not it. If it really offers a synthesis of <i>ideas</i> found elsewhere, and not just a list of facts, why doesn't it identify where those ideas come from? "X group emphasizes the importance of Y to India's potential superpower status"; it's not that hard. Instead I see atlases, news items, and maps. The article jumps from primary sources to conclusions, and that's way too OR for me. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 11:08, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete all</b> and this vote should be sufficient to allow future ariticles like Potential Superpowers—Papau New Guinea to be deleted on sight - Melchoir and others are just on point on this issue. Adding sources for the individual facts (e.g. India' military budget is XXX, India is a democracy) does not change the fact that the overall point of the article, that the synethesis of all of this information into the conclusion that India may or may not be a rising superpower is original research. All of the facts in these articles could be merged into the respective articles or subarticles for those countries, but I am hesitant to vote merge becuase (1) it appears that these references have been added after the fact with the intent of camoflaguing the OR (2) all of the <i>facts</i> in this article are probably covered already, in those respective articles. (3) There is no one volunteering to perform such a merge and new "references" would likely be added to these articles faster than they could be merged.

<li>References have not even been added after the fact. I still see no indication of where these arguments come from; all we have is a list of facts and a huge "further reading" section that hasn't been used. This could be a worthy topic, but it needs to be done correctly. In particular, an article that focuses on speculation must meet higher standards than our average article that focuses on a well-understand, factual topic. OR is the most important policy here, and it has not been satisfied. Nor, in fact, does anyone seem to have a plan to satisfy it, except to verify all the individual minutae and point the reader to a slew of books we haven't read, which may or may not agree with the article.

<li>So in many of your minds, Wikipedia should go no without in depth acknowledgement of the power India, China and the European Union have. Re-read the articles, if you see anything un-mathematical or un-sourced that deals with the future then delete that bit. But what most of the article is, is an acknowledgement and list of the plus and minus points of a nation which will undoubtedly be helpful to the reader.

So long as the requisite sources/citations are provided, I think we should keep the article on Russia's potential to become a superpower in the future. The article is well written and summarizes the key issues very well. Besides, I think that Russia indeed has a potential to become one of the superpowers IN THE LONG RUN. Russia arguably has more natural resources and raw materials than any other country in the world and if wise policies are pursued, its prospects for economic recovery may be very strong. If nothing else, it can already be called an 'energy superpower'. As far as its military and space technology is concerned, it currently is far more advanced than China or India. It still has the capacity to make first class weapons that can rival those manufactured in the West. Russia has territories spreading through 11 time zones. Its geography can allow it to become a major player in European, Central Asian, Middle Eastern and Eastern Asian affairs simultaneously. Given these, it should be considered in a category separate from Japan who -in MILITARY terms is nothing more than a protectorate of the US- and Brazil which can only be considered a major REGIONAL power. There are major challenges lying ahead of Russia. Economy, demographics, territorial integrity and a demoralized army are just a few. However, so long as the country can have a strong and competent leadership,many of these challenges may be overcome, returning to Russia a status in international politics that it deserves. My suggestion is: DON'T REMOVE the article.</p>
<p>I suggest that you guys also consult these articles before reaching the final decision:</p>
