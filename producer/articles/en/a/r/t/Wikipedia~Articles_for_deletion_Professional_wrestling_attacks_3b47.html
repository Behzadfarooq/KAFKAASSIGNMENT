<li><b>Comment</b> These articles haven't been nominated for notability. You can't cite an event at which a move was used as a source. The information has to be verifiable, how do you suggest an editor verifies that not only did the move happen, but also that the move is correctly named? They can't go back in time. The only way that could be verified if the event (and also names and descriptions of the moves used) was covered by a reliable source. If you're referring to citing TV shows, I consider that problematic. How do you suggest an editor is able to verify information from a TV show that has aired and isn't repeated? <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 22:54, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Quite simply put, you're raising policy issues that don't exist, as well as a situation that is ludicrous.

You should always, always use an internet-based source if you can, but when there aren't any internet sources you use the primary source, e.g. the event.

Does Reverse Shining Wizard appear in a dictionary? No. Is Reverse Shining Wizard used outside of wrestling fans? No. By definition it is a neologism.

The descriptions of the moves are not sourced by the primary source. People are watching the TV shows, and making up descriptions of the moves based on seeing the moves.

<li><b>Comment</b> The techniques' respective names and the articles describing them are based on the association between a move observed during a professional wrestling event and the name given to it by the commentator. If the ringside announcer, whose job it is to describe to the fans what is happening with the correct jargon, expresses shock at the "octuple-bucky cokebottom buster" he just witnessed then that is what the maneuver is called. It could be said that all such terms are neologisms, but they do not have to pass <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> because they are being used within the context of a larger work of fiction (see <a href="../../../m/u/g/Muggle.html" title="Muggle">Muggle</a>). I really do think a good approach here would be to treat professional wrestling as one large work of fiction, as other editors have suggested, instead of some scholarly discipline. After all, the "tombstone piledriver" is rarely seen in real (meaning Greco-Roman) wrestling due to its unfortunate habit of paralysing its victims. By that logic, the entire series of professional wrestling spectacles becomes the only primary source. To track down the origin of each hold and throw to a specific appearance by a specific wrestler in one evening's event (whether the tape of said event is "pirated" or not is not relevant to this discussion; "ABC Wrestling FaceMasher XXV aired 32 Octember 1984" suffices) over the course of thirty years of wrestling is a colossal effort; one that is theoretically possible mind you, but not one that will be accomplished in the time normally permitted an AfD discussion.</li>

<li>While excessive detail is not in this case a reason to delete, do you really think that any level of detail is appropriate for any article? The fact that WP is not paper does not mean that any subject should receive an article or that no article could be too long. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 03:59, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>"do you really think that any level of detail is appropriate for any article?" I don't think that is what Xiahou is arguing Croctotheface, but rather the notion that "Absurdly excessive detail" is used as an argument in favor of deletion in this discussion. His statement regarding the non-physical properties of wikipedia was a reinforcement of the absurdity of that stand point. Simply put, editors of Wikipedia shouldn't be forced to take into consideration the length or verbosity of an entry (that otherwise meets the standards and guidelines of Wikipedia), especially when it's being written in plain English in a way to display the unique differences between various items, or creating a entry for an item that might need one due to having a large number of variants or a lengthy history. Additionally, Merging isn't much of an option due to the size of the meta article it would create. Personally, I feel that if articles like <a href="../../../a/x/e/Axel_jump.html" title="Axel jump">Axel_jump</a> for figure skating have the right to exist and have, as far as I'm aware, never been challenged for "Absurdly excessive detail" and "unverifiable original research," why should these articles? <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVladamireSteelwolf_c290.html" title="User:VladamireSteelwolf">Vladamire Steelwolf</a> 05:30, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. These articles are claimed to violate policies against original research, neologisms, and verifiability, but the nominator is selectively ignoring parts of those policies that make them inapplicable, as some commenters have explained many times. The rather bizarre interpretation of WP:NEO being used—that a term used only in a limited community and nearly unheard of out of it is a "neologism" in Wikipedia terms, even if within that group the term is understood and the definition widely agreed upon, regardless of how long it has been in use—would mean that practically <i>any</i> jargon term not taught in grade school would be a "neologism". That's mind-boggling. — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 06:47, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. These articles aren't original research or unverifiable. These moves are identified by the television announcers as they happen, and broadcasts of wrestling events where the announcers identify the moves can serve as references. I haven't watched wrestling in quite some time but I believe that there are several broadcasted events each week, one week of TV watching for reference gathering could provide references for a large swath of frequently-used moves. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradtcordeiro_239b.html" title="User:Bradtcordeiro">Brad T.

<p><b>Strong keep all</b> - It sounds to me like the nominator (not a real word i know) has something against wrestling or else NO knowledge of it and wants to cripple the entire Wrestling Wiki project on a technicality, deleting these articles would be an absurd move and only prove to sow that Wikipedia is more concerned with its own petty technical rules than to actually serves its fuction: To be a comprehensive guide. As someone learning Pro Wrestling these pages re a valuable asset, and I for one would have a difficult time without them, I am sure others are in the same boat as me there. Absolutely Keep keep keep keep keep, over and over again.</p>

<p><b>Strong keep</b> - Removing all of these articles is <b>ridiculous</b>. Why would you need references for wrestling moves? Are you saying that they don't exist? <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakiyu_fb88.html" title="User:Makiyu">Makiyu</a> 22:45, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep due to bad faith nom</b> - it really seems like the original nominator had contradictory reasons as to why they should be removed. A lot of said that the reasons cited are inapplicable with regards to the article's context. Nominator also nominated multiple articles along the same vein, and so the nomination may be viewed as an attempt to undermine continuing work of article building in the subject matter. An RFC on the original nominator or admin action may be necessary. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelvSYC_688e.html" title="User:KelvSYC">kelvSYC</a> 07:38, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Strong keep due to bad faith nom</b> - The original nominator has admitted on his user page that he despises professional wrestling; it is obvious that he is merely electing them for deletion due to his bias against the subject matter. <a href="../../../f/h/b/User%7EFhb3_3506.html" title="User:Fhb3">Fhb3</a> 10:33, 21 January 2007 (UTC)fhb3</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Fhb3, that wasn't him that put it there. Sorry. That was a joke. I messed with his page cause I was ticked and thought that might be true. I'll take it out right now. While I do agree that there might actually be bad faith involved, I want to make it clear that I put that "admission" there as a joke and that I am taking it out right now. Hickney did not actually admit to anything. Thank you very much. 63.215.29.185 10:43, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
