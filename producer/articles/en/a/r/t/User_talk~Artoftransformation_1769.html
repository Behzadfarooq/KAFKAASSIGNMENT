<dd>Sir: As someone who actually understands both Relitivity, and Quantium Electrodynamics, and have contributed to the wikipedia as such, I felt compelled to comment.

<dd>I just wanted to add:That after wading through his 1175 page tome, He might actually have something, but its so muddled up in simple errors, and typos, that... he misses. Certainly NOT Nobel prize quality, for which he is certainly claiming.

<p>Hi! I saw a complaint about an anoynomus user, and put the IP who is info there, so If he causes any more trouble, that his ISP contact informaiton is right there. I was able to trace down a user that is about two miles away from me, the same way. If there are any complaints, please let me know. Is this habit supurfulous or usefull? <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtoftransformation_6194.html" title="User:Artoftransformation">Artoftransformation</a> 10:20, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK. Your an admin, Im a user. What is the checkuser function?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, admins can't use it (that I know of), but it's got something to do with checking to see if a user X is a sockpuppet of user Y. At least, that's the purpose. I thought you might be doing something like that, but I guess not; sorry to have bothered you, sir. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian"><font color="#337147"><b>Merovingian</b></font></a> <a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerovingian_28b5.html" title="User talk:Merovingian">(t)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Merovingian_5415.html" title="Special:Contributions/Merovingian">(c)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">(<font color="green"><i>e</i></font>)</a> 10:39, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oh contraire mon frere. You did not bother me. I welcome words of wisdom from those more experenced. I would LOVE to know how to find sockpuppets. I just found out. I am no longer looking for this for any reason what so ever. ( You contact a developer&#160;::))Shhhhhh</p>
<dl>
<dd>You left a message on my talk page, but I don't know why. You didn't sign it. There was no link to a diff as evidence to suggest what bothered you nor why. Adding "whois" information manually to each anonymous user's talk page isn't much of a service. It's not the obvious nor correct place for this, it's easily edited, the information goes stale quickly, and would-be detectives are better off doing the lookup themselves to get current data. Individually, this information is of limited value because many people share a single address at a large provider. If a person and their suspected sockpuppets all share the same IP or ISP, this does become suspicious and this sort of analysis might be part of what checkuser does. As for me, all my edits have been in good faith, but the edits made in April and before weren't mine. Guess it's time for me to get a username. --24.20.130.253 17:45, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I just put that there to save me the time of having to hunt it down again, in case I have to contact your ISP. As you can see, I am sticking my neck out pretty far, and if you dont log in, I dont know who Im dealing with. If your an AOL IP, I can safely just ignore your stupidity. If your from the Provosts office at the University of Maryland, Im going to think diffrently. ( Universities, and Canadians get prefrential treatment.&#160;::))</dd>

<p>There seems to be some missing distinction about ownership of pages and Wikipedia in general.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ownership in common usage implies property rights, and in intellectual propery and media, reproduction rights.</dd>
<dd>Ownership in Wikipedia, implies the responsibility for both keeping us from copyright infringement lawsuits. ( See what happened to MathWorld at Wolfram Research ) AND the responsibility to explain things, and the responsibility to do it in a way that contributes to the community(Hense NPOV), and does it to add value to the community(We need to be flexable about critacizm). That is the reason behind the style guides. (And whether I agree with them or not, even if I VENEMATLY DISAGREE with them, for the good of the community, I will abide by them ).</dd>
<dd>I see Ownership in Wikipedia as COMMON RIGHTS. I own the whole damn thing. I can edit almost any page...but I am compelled by the value created to do it in a consistant manner to add value, not from what my opinion is, but from what others see as consistant with the purpose.</dd>
<dd>I am totally willing to have this page owned by someone, BUT it has to be consistant with the common good. I am struggling with this right now, on another page. I put DAYS into the reasearch, all to see, that in my exploration, The page really needs to be deleted, and sadly I have nominated it to be deleted. ( not this page.. )</dd>

<p>There is a reason why the archives are collecting dust - what you want to do will be a very tedious task! I'm not sure if there is a way of doing this easily other than opening up each archive and manually cutting and pasting the questions. Feel free to do whatever you please with the archives though - if you think it would help with the organization, go right ahead! Hardly anyone has touched the archives this past year. However, there is <i>a lot</i> of material there. I guess it wouldn't hurt to do a few questions here and there though. Whatever you fancy really&#160;:-)</p>

<p>I have responded to your question where you asked it, <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGangofOne_369e.html" title="User talk:GangofOne">User talk:GangofOne</a>. By the way, Viktor FranKL wrote "Man's Search for Meaning", I'm sure you won't mind my pointing this out, since you have an "attitude about accuracy." I haven't read it, looks good though. Also of interest, if you're interested in ramdom facts, I am a long-time resident of your native place.

<dd>Jeez! Did I screw that up? Viktor would KILL ME. Thanks for correcting it. DEWD! Go and buy the book, and dont read it, but keep it handy. The next time you get really upset, like ready to pull your hair out, read it. I read it, after I was beat up in Jail. Are you a long time resident of the Peoples Republic of Berkeley? or ...

<dd>What I was goading you to do is to find your faith, and express it to me.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have been mulling over how to answer it for the whole afternoon now...I haven't really thought much about that before. I guess I'm just here to make Wikipedia a better place&#160;:-) - Hmm...so in short, if you want to help out in that regard, the best thing to do is to treat any editor you encounter with dignity, respect, and integrity - the sort that you would want for yourself; the sort that you would want to project and share in abundance with others.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So you see Wikipedia's future in-the Integrity, and respect that it treats its subjects, articles, controversey and critics? Actually almost anyone future lies there. I would see dignity included in integrity, but in asking is there honor amoung wikipedians, honor being our internal codes, what are You committed to? What do you see as Your future expressed as Wikipdeia?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Consider that: if Dignity where HOW you excercise your committments, and Integrity is the Strength and Will that you devoted to keep your committments, then what is left is Respect, and Honoring. If you look carefully, its a big 3 dimensional dynamic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And byw, taking a whole afternoon, to mull over my question, both honors my question and me. Thank you for taking that time.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why is this important?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because really, nothing else is. I have seen first hand, open heart surgery. Your committment here, is why you spend your time here, why you do what you do, and why you invited me to participate: all are given by the committment you have. After you invited me to register as a user, I put up as many of my committments as display on my user page as I could at a time: <i>so that clearly</i> people would know who I am, and what I am committed to.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ultimately, Wikipedia would be nothing without its contributors and the community that arises from it as a consequence.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If all the contributors left today, what would be left? What would it look like tommorow? There will still be:
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>. Its detractors.</li>
<li>. Its harshest critics.</li>
<li>. Its Vandals.</li>
<li>. The people who have conversations about 'wikipedia done me wrong' ( Some blues guys is going to record this, and long with 'my artice got reverted' ... )</li>
<li>. Its undone work.</li>
<li>. Its poorly done work.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>and despite the rising tide of critics, you still believe that there is something important here for you to accomplish. That is extrodinary. But I would offer you, that you could be more effective if you took on addresseing the citics and detractors. It worked for me, in another setting.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Nurture these two, and the articles will be well taken care of. Of course, it's also important to strike a balance between Wikipedia and the self - recognize that one is not infallible, and be gracious and quick to admit when mistakes are made. If you are contributing to Wikipedia long term, make sure that your relationship with Wikipedia is a healthy one - work in a dedicated fashion, but not so hard as to burn yourself out.</p>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>Exactly. So many people here are on either Hiatus, or sneek contributers on Hiatus. ( its that...umm... forget it )</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Oh that page. It's existance is for me to peek at every once in a while, so that I can laugh out loud until my sides hurt, and milk will come out of my nostrals. The real humor, the really grizzly stuff lies in the subtily of the undetected. ( see Wu Who&#160;? )</dd>

<p>Now, if you want to collaborate on an article, I'd be all ears.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oo...read my user page twice in a row, and ask me the same question.</dd>

<p>I'd be willing to contribute anything and learn something new in the process. What did you have in mind?</p>

<dd>First you need to consider the oranization and classificaion of problems:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Easy problems: ( Also known as trival )
<dl>
<dd>Short term solutions:
<dl>
<dd>Blink your eyes. Eye hydration accomplished.</dd>
<dd>Breathe. ( see this later ).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Medium term solutions:
<dl>
<dd>Close your eyes for a few minutes to rest them from computer use.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Long term solutions: ( at the limits of extended concentration )
<dl>
<dd>Re-key 1000, locks.
<dl>
<dd>Dig a drainage system.</dd>
<dd>Develop habits to minimize the damage from extened comptuer use.</dd>
<dd>Breathe effectivly in times of extrodinary stress.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Medium problems: ( Also known as challenging, or mundane at best: Other wise known as work. )
<dl>
<dd>Short term solutions:</dd>
<dd>Medium term solutions:</dd>
<dd>Long term solutions:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Hard Problems: ( these requre both thought, dillagence, ingenuity, and a high degree of integrity )
<dl>
<dd>Short term solutions:</dd>
</dl>

<p>To a websurfer, the vikiPedia is basically a source for knowledge. To a webmaster, the vikiPeida is basically a place to defer refrences. To the scientist, the vikiPedia is basically a place of inaccuracy, and To a governarian, the vikiPedia is basically an experiment. To the Anarchist(A), the vikiPedia is a fertile ground for expression. To the vagabond, the vikiPedia is a fertile place to expound ideas, demonstrating nothing more than prestidigitation.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your Elepant, What view?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Is it *POSSIBLE* to take the view that accuracy and cataloging are the sort of drudgery that should not be infliced upon man, only because he is cababile of higher callings? ( Humor comes to mind, but I digress ).</p>
<p><i>I will take your views into consideration</i> -Baal, Prime Evil, upon his approach to Haragoth.</p>
<p>As you can see: Essai sur les données immédiates de la conscience is a hard problem, with a long term solution. I need to work on my understanding of exestinencial philoposhy, even thought I studied psychology, and philosophy, after a radical change in paradigm, I have to revaluate a lot of ideas. deeply. <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmark_Education_4c93.html" title="Landmark Education">Landmark_Education</a> is where my current sights are set, and Hydrino_Theory is where I cut my teeth, but It still needs to be rewritten critically.</p>
<p>I REQUEST: You assist me, in colaboration of the rewrite of Hydrino_Theory, and then on to the rewrite of Landmark Education. Since you know NOTHING about landmark education, your assistnace will be absultly invaluable, while all the while, I can pester the french philosophers about which translation they like the best. Its much easier to have them make up their minds about Wine or Mayors of Paris than philosophy. The long term goal, to take all three articles to featured status <i>consideration</i>. Some challenge huh?</p>
<p>Things: <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> Nice... Food for thought <a href="../../../c/o/t/WP%7ECOTW_227d.html" title="WP:COTW">WP:COTW</a> How do these things work <i>as a process</i></p>
<p>How about some timeframes? By when?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I Propose a game? Something simple.
<dl>
<dd>The game has 3 goals.
<ol>
<li>To have the Hydrio_Theory looked upon somone who makes consideration about featured articles, favorablly, buy November 30th.</li>
<li>Then Landmark</li>
<li>Then in 3 months time, The essay?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Interested?</dd>
</dl>
<p>I REQUEST: that you stand with me, for a revolution in accracy. Something that you will be continually be proud of. ( Something challenging perhaps? )</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm...A few things:
<ol>
<li>Put your user page on your watchlist, and check its page history - I did something to it which I hope you didn't mind&#160;:-)</li>
<li>I think I'll skip the hydrino theory. I work too closely with quantum mechanics already&#160;:P</li>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Just replying to the massages you left me in early November. You put them on my <a href="../../../s/c/z/User_talk%7ESCZenz_Archive1_7a43.html" title="User talk:SCZenz/Archive1">talk page archive</a> rather than talk page proper, so I didn't see them until now. (I did learn a valuable lesson, though, about watching my archives too.&#160;;) Anyway, to answer your questions...</p>
<ol>
<li>I am in principle interested in meeting for a root beer. However, with the semester winding down and having been sick recently, the near future isn't such a good time. Remind me again in January.&#160;;)</li>
<li>If you're referring to the Higgs boson diagram in the <a href="../../../a/t/l/ATLAS_experiment_2603.html#Physics_program" title="ATLAS experiment">physics program</a> section of the <a href="../../../a/t/l/ATLAS_experiment_2603.html" title="ATLAS experiment">ATLAS experiment</a> article, then the answer is yes. The particular diagram I made has a great deal to do with the capabilities of the detector. The <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_quark.html" title="Top quark">top quarks</a> make the event very distinctive, which aids in detecting and analyzing the event in various ways. One produces a high-<a href="../../../p/t/_/PT_3535.html" title="PT">pT</a> lepton which aids in <a href="../../../a/t/l/ATLAS_experiment_2603.html#Data_systems" title="ATLAS experiment">triggering</a> on the event, while the other decays entirely into jets so that its mass can be reconstructed with good accuracy. Both produce a <a href="../../../b/o/t/Bottom_quark.html" title="Bottom quark">bottom quark</a> <a href="../../../p/a/r/Particle_jet.html" title="Particle jet">jet</a>, which can <a href="../../../b/-/t/B-tagging.html" title="B-tagging">be identified</a> to confirm that there were top quarks and not just random jets. (The presence of top quarks, in particular, is by far the most likely, because the Higgs boson couples to quarks in proportion to their mass, and it's by far the heaviest quark.) Then the Higgs itself decays into bottom quarks (the most likely quark if it's too heavy to decay into top quarks), which can hopefully also be identified. So we end up with (if everything works) four b-jets and two light jets. We can add one b and the two light jets so that we reconstruct a top quark, then pick two of the three remaining b's (by trial and error) and get one whose <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invariant_mass.html" title="Invariant mass">invariant mass</a> is likely to be the higgs. If we see a bunch of events like that, with the same invariant mass, we've made a discovery. Of course, complex as the above is, with mis-tagging and so on the analysis is actually much more complicated.&#160;;)</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope that answers your question. Feel free to ask if you've got more. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 23:25, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
