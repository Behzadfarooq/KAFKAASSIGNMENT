<p>Emmy award winning broadcast journalist Isiah Carey was born in Baton Rouge, La. It was there that he got his first taste of broadcast news. He was a third-grade student at South Boulevard Elementary School when he realized he wanted to be a reporter. His teacher invited a television journalist to talk to his class. That reporter, Maxine Crump, provided Isiah the inspiration to pursue a career in TV journalism. After that reporter's visit, he wrote a letter to the news director, Carlton Cremeens, asking if he could work there in the summer. He was allowed to shadow for several years until he went away to college."</p>
<p>By the 10th grade, station personnel at WAFB TV were convinced he had a future in broadcast journalism when anchor Frank Hudson accepted his first script of a news story. After graduating from high school, Carey entered the University of Southwestern Louisiana in Lafayette in 1988 to study mass communications. In 1989, he enrolled at Southern University A&amp;M College in Baton Rouge and before graduation he worked as one of the city's youngest radio news anchor and reporters for WXOK radio in Baton Rouge.</p>
<p>By 1990, he was also news director and anchor at KQXL-FM and WYCT-FM. That same year, Isiah got his first break in TV as a reporter and weekend public affairs talk show host at WVLA-TV (NBC). In 1991, he joined WAFB where he remained for four years as a fill in co-host of a morning news program and general assignment reporter. He was very proud when the news director Liz Combs named the nightside segment after him calling it "Isiah Carey's Nightside".</p>
<p>His dedication to his work is evident, as Carey conducts interviews and develops a story that often starts with a simple tip in the form of a phone call from individuals who have come to respect his assertive, no-nonsense style of reporting.</p>
<p>Currently, Isiah is a reporter at FOX News in Houston where he's been since 2001. He's also worked at BET News, FOX Memphis and the NBC affiliate in Little Rock, Arkansas. You can get the latest on Isiah by visiting his website <a href="http://isiahcarey.blogspot.com" class="external free" title="http://isiahcarey.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://isiahcarey.blogspot.com</a>. Isiah covers various news stories from the trial of Enron founder Ken Lay to Rap Music.</p>
<p>Isiah appeared in the video the Women of Enron and rapper Pimp C's Pimpalation.</p>

<b>Kecojevići</b> (17 k., sv. Jovan). Po predanju Kecojevići su sa Kosova od nekoga Tripka vojvode, pa se posle Kosovske bitke krenuli na zapad sa ostalim narodom da traže novu otadžbinu. Tako lutajući na kraju se nastane u Banjanima. Od ovoga Tripka vojvode, vele, da su i ovi pivski rodovi: Jokovići, Banovići i Pejovići.</p>
<p><b>Kecojevici</b> su najstariji stanovnici sela Pirni Do, a doseljeni su iz Banjana nazad 250 godina. Vele, bila četiri brata i hajdukovali. Turci su ih gonili i oni su morali da beže iz Banjana. Jedan se otseli u Herceg Novi, krajem XVII veka a već 1726 g. pominje se u opštini Topla: seća Jovo Kecojević. Drugi pobegne u Pivu i nastani se u Pirnom Dolu. Ubrzo pogine i ostane mu žena Kanda sa četvoro dece. Treći brat pobegne u Nevesinje, tamo promeni prezime i zaturi trag, a s četvrtim šta je bilo ne zna se. Dubljevići (2 k.) od Dubljevića iz Dubljevića. Šipčići (3 k.) od Šipčića iz sela Crne Gore. Mićanovići (7 k.) od Mićanovića s Goranska. Jokovići (2 k.), rod s Jokovićima na Breznima. Cicmili (2 k.) od Cicmila iz Stoca.</p>
<p>Toma K. Popović: Hercegnovi, s. 139, navodi 1701 g. Nikolu Kecojevića kao doseljenika, a Kecojevići su Pivljani. 1701 godine - stoji među 6 potpisa i ime Nikola Kecoević (Kecović) Ivan Kecojević iz Pirnoga Dola, osamdesetih godina prošlog veka, bio je najviši čovek u Crnoj Gori: imao je oko 2.10 m.</p>
<p>text preuzet iz knjige Svetozara Tomića "Piva i Pivljani."</p>

<p>According to an interview with <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bret_Easton_Ellis_5a34.html" title="Bret Easton Ellis">Bret Easton Ellis</a>, the author of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> novel <i><a href="../../../l/e/s/Less_Than_Zero_e8dc.html" title="Less Than Zero">Less Than Zero</a></i>, he claims to have decided on making a sequel to the book featuring the main characters from the first novel in present day. He has quoted being hesitent about making a sequel: "It's a really dangerous thing to do. You've got to be super careful on how you're going to approach this. If I want to write it I'm going to have to write it. If it's going to mess up people's memories of the first one then so be it, there's really nothing I can do about that."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

Dustin Craig Javorsky was born in 1985 in Findlay, Ohio to Carolyn And Craig Durnwald residents then of Mount Blanchard, Ohio. About a year after his birth Dustin was taken by his mother along with his two siblings Stacey and Travis to Tuscon, Arizona, from there his mother divorced his father. Dustin was then enrolled in elementary school and lived with his mother and her boyfriend in a middle-class home in West Tuscon. At the age of four Dustin's mother again moved to Wellington, Colorado where he lived in a rural farming community North of Ft. Collins, Colorado. It was here Dustin attended school until the age of six. At the age of six Dustin's mother again moved from Colorado to Toledo, Ohio where she was to marry John J Javorsky. While living with John J Javorsky in an upper middle-class neighborhood he attended school until the age of eight, at age eight Dustin's family moved yet again to Boyington Beach, Florida because of an employment opportunity for his step father. Dustin was enrolled in a Magnet program school and was required to ride the public transit system from school every day, with his older sister. After a year or two in Boyington Beach, Florida; Dustin's step-father again relocated the family to Pueblo, Colorado where he began working with another company. Dustin was Thirteen years old, he was enrolled at Pueblo West High School. In the last year or so, Dustin had developed a strong interest in computers and was quite proficient in the finer points of using computers. While attending High School Dustin was asked to work for the school district when problems with the school's computers would occur. As luck would have it, the school's computers were having problems quite often, and for the next three years Dustin was rarely in class, he flew through High school and graduated with a average GPA. In Dustin's senior year at High School his mother and step father seperated, his step father moved to Salt Lake City, Utah where he had been working for the past two years, commuting back and forth every weekend. His mother moved into a older neighborhood in downtown Pueblo, Colorado. After a few months, Dustin moved with his family to Salt Lake City, Utah where they purchased a home in Draper, Utah. Dustin became employed by a Las Vegas, Nevada based company known as Knight Systems, where he worked for nine months while also working as a full-time security officer and attending night school at I.T.T. Technical Institute in Murray, Utah; before leaving for Hong Kong. Dustin arrived in Hong Kong to meet an aquaintence who was seeking crew to take a fifty-three foot steel ketch around the world, after spending a month in the company of Tom Blancarte and his ketch "Karaka" he departed seeking employment to Bangkok, Thailand; it was here that he was employed at the Islamic College of Thailand, he became a teacher of English for students ranging in age from 10-21. While in Thailand Dustin learned to speak the Thai language to a very advanced level, with no formal lessons he learned to speak the language from the inhabitants of his apartment building. While living in Thailand Dustin became romantically involved with a young Thai super model, Piraporn Tacheswaddin was attending a university where Dustin had been working temporarily. Dustin met Piraporn while interviewing Thai college students to assess their level of English. He was known to describe his first meeting with her as remarkable and life altering. He spent the next few months teaching and enjoying himself in Thailand. Around December of 2004 Piraporn's father was involved in an accident in his home and later died due to medical complications, Piraporn was devastated and Dustin's relationship with her never fully recovered. Depressed and seeking a change Dustin left for Seoul, South Korea; once in Korea Dustin was employed by Songang Language Program, a subsiderary of Songang University in Pusan, Korea. Dustin began his teaching in Korea as a kindergarten instructor, but found this to be quite difficult, he quickly changed to teaching students aged 8 to 14 years old. While living in Korea his employed provided him with everything he needed, from a four bedroom apartment on the fifteenth floor of a Seoul high rise to clothing and meals. While living in Korea Dustin struggled with the depression of his break-up with Piraporn, it was reported that he spent hours sitting in a large leather swivel chair where he could overlook the city below. After three short months in Korea, Dustin could not get his focus and his performance at his place of work was heavily affected. In March of 2005 he returned to Draper, Utah unsure of what he was to do. When he returned to Salt Lake City, Utah he became employed with several temporary staffing agencies, needing a constant change of pace Dustin struggled in positions that kept him in any form of routine. After working in Salt Lake City, Utah for a number of companies, some for only two or three days he quit and returned to Thailand in July of that year. While in Thailand he reunited with his former co-worker Paul Merrick an Australian native who had been working at the Islamic College at the same time as Dustin. Dustin spent a month in Northern Thailand in a small village known as Ban-Moo-Mon near the small town of Somdet near the border with Laos. Dustin took this time to travel Thailand and try to get a handle on what he wanted to do with his life; sadly he was unable to find his purpose here either. Dustin left Thailand shortly after and arrived in Kathmandu, Nepal. He was known to stay in Kathmandu, Nepal for only a few days before he departed for the Mount Everest base camp trail, Dustin departed Jiri in September 2005 and arrived in Everest base camp on October eighth, reaching a final altitude of 20,481ft above sea level. When Dustin returned to Kathmandu he travelled to Chitwan in Southern Nepal where he stayed with the family of a friend he met in the mountains, after a few weeks in Chitwan he departed for Nepalganj a town riding the border of India. There Dustin spent his time working as a volunteer teacher in a rural elementary school, while staying in the community Dustin donated over five thousand dollars to the local population who were without electricity or running water to purchase the equipment needed to make a smooth transition into modern life. After nearly two months in Nepal Dustin departed for Qatar, when he arrived in Qatar he faced a financial crisis of sorts, he had nearly no money left and was very far from home, he made a decision that would forever change the way he was to travel. He started walking everywhere, everywhere he went he walked or would wait until he was offered a ride. He was able to travel extremely cheap and he befriended an amazing assortment of people. Dustin walked from Qatar around the Arabian Penninsula via United Arab Emirates and Oman to the port city of Aden, Yemen. Once in Aden Dustin was at a deadlock, the continent of Africa laid out before him, he was able to hitch hike on a commercial freighter to Dijibouti where he travelled to Cairo, Egypt. When he arrived in Cairo, Egpyt he faced a deciscion that would make or break his travel, to return to Salt Lake City, Utah or to press on and drive his last few dollars into the ground. He chose to return home, and with his last dollars made it to his door step in Draper, Utah with less then ten dollars to spare. Once back in Utah he began to repay his student loans accumulated from I.T.T. Technical Institute of Murray, Utah. Dustin worked for a number of employers yet again unable to find a job that was fitting, his longest position was with Bridgestone Firestone of America for three months where he was able to save enough money to return to Africa. In 2006 Dustin returned to Africa via Paris, France and walked from Morocco to Cairo in nine months, almost all of which he spent in the Sahara desert living among the native tribal nomads. Dustin is currently in Salt Lake City, again repaying his student loans and preparing for a grand adventure to South America, not yet twenty-one years old he has accomplished a great deal and should be recognized as one of America's youngest adventurers, being only seventeen years old when he began to explore the world around him.</p>

<p>CorporateDramas.com, an innovative genre in business publishing is the brainchild of the young, charismatic and vivacious Ms. Kanan Bhatt. Kanan's romance with the corporate world dates back to her childhood. With her gorgeous looks, Kanan could have opted for a glamorous career as a model or an actress but she wanted to pursue a more cerebral profession that would add value to the industry and the society. Instead of Hollywood or Bollywood, she headed for the Corporate Woods.</p>
<p>For Kanan Bhatt corporate world is the most fascinating of all places According to Kanan, "The corporate world is the most fascinating of all places - the largest structured congregation in society where people from different backgrounds, upbringing, nationalities, cultures, races, religions, genders, habits &amp; temperaments come together to seemingly fulfill a common corporate mission; each with his or her own individual agenda, at times harmonious and at other times disjoint. While we try to term the time we spend here as the professional work life and many of us try to keep it separate from our personal lives, little do we realize that this is just a myth to fool our own minds. It is humanly impossible to compartmentalize the two. Majority of us carry forward our personal idiosyncrasies into our professional worlds and our professional baggage into our personal space, making each more challenging than the other, sometimes exhilarating and exasperating at other times. CorporateDramas.com is a realty and fiction series that gives a voice to this plethora of emotions."</p>
<p>After Bachelors in Engineering and an MBA from premier institutes, Kanan went on to manage complex technology businesses across the globe. For someone so young and spirited, she displays a much versatile and wiser disposition on life, achievement and values.</p>
<p>Despite her successful and illustrious career and her global exposure across Europe, the US and India, Kanan seems to exude a down to earth personality with an ebullient and bright charm.</p>
<p>"As an active and passive participant of the corporate world, it has been interesting to observe, analyze, experience and understand the vagaries of this world that make and mar destinies, where companies bloom and wither; icons are built and busted and products are taken from cradle to grave," says Kanan</p>
<p>Kanan's book "The Mist" drives home the age old theory of the power of purpose. Amidst sensational success and glittering glory, it awakens the corporate conscience to create heroes with social responsibility and emphasizes the importance of ethics in business and in life.</p>
<p>Her other fictional masterpiece "The Power of Weakness" exposes us to the negative powers lurking in corporate corridors that if left unchecked, can shake the very foundations of Business and the fabric of society.</p>
<p>The CorporateDramas.com series of books will appeal to all stakeholders and spectators of this corporate world -Senior management, operational managers, functional specialists, legal counselors, auditors and financiers, stock market analysts, vendors and the engineering, management and other graduating student population who will be spending majority of their adult life in the concrete, corporate jungle.</p>

<p>Cooperative breeding is a social system in which individuals help care for young that are not their own. The non-parental care givers (alloparents) may be other reproducing adults, as in the case of lionesses who litter at the same time nursing and caring for their cubs in communally, reproductively mature but non-reproducing adults, as in subordinate wolves helping to feed and protect the pups of the alpha female, sub-fertile or infertile adults, such as the worker castes in social insects species, post-reproductive adults, as in human grandmothers caring for their grandchildren, or sub-adults, as in young Florida scrub jays who stay with their parents a year or two as <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helpers_at_the_nest.html" title="Helpers at the nest">helpers at the nest</a> before leaving to mate. Bi-parental care, in which a male forgoes pursuit of additional mating opportunities to help care for youngsters that are likely his offspring, shares many characteristics with cooperative breeding and could be considered a subset of it.</p>
<p>Related terms: co-operative breeding, cooperative breeder, cooperatively breeding, communal breeding, breeding collective, bi-parental care, alloparent, allomother</p>

The <b>Open ePolicy Group</b> is a global network of technology experts, currently based at the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society, a policy center at Harvard Law School. Created in September 2005, the Open ePolicy Group provides policymakers and managers with thought leadership and tools related to leading technology issues. The Open ePolicy Group's first product, the <i>Roadmap for Open ICT Ecosystems</i>, is a meta-level framework of best practices, case studies and tools aimed at sensitizing policymakers, CIOs, industry and other stakeholders to the benefits of open information and communication technologies (ICT) ecosystems.</p>

<p>In its original formulation, the Open ePolicy Group, founded by Jeffrey A. Kaplan, an Affiliate at the Berkman Center, represented an unprecedented global collaboration among twenty-five individuals, including senior officials from thirteen nations, thought leaders from five global organizations including the World Bank and European Commission, experts from two leading technology companies and academics from one of the world’s most respected universities.</p>

<p>The <i>Roadmap for Open ICT Ecosystems</i> helps people understand what open ICT ecosystems are, why they are embraced and how to evolve them. It also demonstrates how introducing “openness” across an ICT ecosystem provides new ways to drive efficiency, innovation and growth to meet the needs of our high-speed, on-demand world.</p>
<p>The <i>Roadmap</i> focuses on ICT ecosystems, which is another way of saying the technology environment of a country, a locality, a government or an organization. In the view of the Open ePolicy Group, ICT ecosystems are: interoperable, user-centric, collaborative, sustainable and flexible</p>
<p>The <i>Roadmap for Open ICT Ecosystems</i> provides specific policy recommendations, tools and case studies related to ICT issues such as open standards, interoperability frameworks, open-source software and technology procurement.</p>
<p>To assist governments and enterprises, the <i>Roadmap</i> offers a new tool -- the Openness Maturity Model (OMM) -- to assess where an ICT ecosystem is and where it should be headed. Many capability maturity models exist to guide change management in an ICT environment, especially wit respect to software. The Open ePolicy Group, however, created the OMM gauge openness across an entire ICT ecosystem. The Openness Maturity Model is a first attempt to provide such a tool.</p>
<p>The model does not precisely measure openness, but instead organizes baseline data into a broader framework. It describes a pathway to open ICT ecosystems by examining certain basic features including interoperability, open technology usage, business process linkages, procurement strategies and collaborative development.</p>
<p>The <i>Roadmap</i> is currently available in five languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish.</p>

This is the latest installation by James Turrell and as his previous work has been in climates with far more light, one might have feared that it would fall flat. It does not. The installation is within the Yorkshire Sculpture Park which is the modern use of Bretton Park, an 18th and 19th century stately home and deer park. The buildings are in use by Leeds University and the parkland given over to the YSP. Within the park is the old deer shelter - a bad weather shelter typical of such estates - and in the hill behind the shelter Jamues Turrell has created another of his sky-scapes (2006) as a permanent feature. In the ceiling of a high room, whose walls are lined with austere concrete benches (with a nod, it seemed to me, to Egyptian funerary architecture) is a square aperture. It has no reveals, so there is no depth in what one looks up at, and this has the effect of collapsing the whole sky to just two dimensions and presenting it as a moving picture. The sky was perfectly grey when I lay on the floor of the installation (not sure if one is supposed to!) and the effect remarkable. The more so when I threw a coin up through the hole and gasped as it crossed into the apparently flat space before descending. Do go and see it. It has to be worth a 200 mile round trip (or in my case 400)</p>

<p><br />
A letter of credit normally issued by a bank to a beneficiary (say an exporter), to be used only when the applicant (say the importer) defaults on another agreed method of payment.</p>
<p>Typically, an exporter and an importer come to an agreement that on presentation of invoice and bill by the exporter, the importer will make payment from his own sources (or from a credit account that he may be enjoying). But the importer gives a 'standby letter of credit' from a bank which can be used by the exporter only if the importer fails to make payment as promised.</p>
<p>How it is different from a normal 'letter of credit'?</p>
<p>An issuing bank undertakes to directly pay the proceeds of a bill to the beneficiary (the exporter) on presentation of prescribed documents. After paying the beneficiary, the bank recovers the amount from the importer. Thus, the bank is under direct obligation here. In case of standby letter of credit, the bank's liability is secondary and takes effect only if the first obligant fails.</p>

<p>Fortunately, reliable sources are available for this term. Only I am surprised wikipedia did not have this information. For the record, I would recommend Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) site which is a treasure house of knowledge in terms of banking and finance. The specific URL I would recommend is: <a href="http://www.ubs.com/1/e/ubs_ch/bb_ch/finance/trade_exportfinance/bankgarantie/standbyl_c.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ubs.com/1/e/ubs_ch/bb_ch/finance/trade_exportfinance/bankgarantie/standbyl_c.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubs.com/1/e/ubs_ch/bb_ch/finance/trade_exportfinance/bankgarantie/standbyl_c.html</a></p>
<p>As for the definition, I could find the following web-definitions:</p>
<p>A letter of credit designed to be used only when the applicant defaults on another agreed method of payment. www.business-in-asia.com/glossary5.html</p>
<p>Issued by Johnson Bank at the request of our customer and is used on both a domestic and international basis . Generally, this Letter of Credit is a guarantee of a customer's obligation pursuant to an agreement or contract between two parties www.johnsonportal.com/international_glossary.asp</p>
<p>an obligation issued by a bank on behalf of a customer to a third party, states that the bank will pay the latter upon presentation of a statement signed by the beneficiary stating that the bank's customer has not fulfilled the terms of the contract www.amsouth.com/CBRC/glossary.asp</p>

Romanian football club, founded in 1921.<br />
<b>Early period.</b> The team has been competing in lower leagues (other names: U.F.H., I.M.S or Metalul), until it finally promotes in 1953 for the first time in the First National League (Divizia A, Liga 1).<br />
<b>Golden age.</b> Corvinul became a top club in Romania with the arrival of Mircea Lucescu as coach-player in 1979. The team has been relegated in the first season, but came back in the next season. The best season was 1980-81, when Corvinul reached the 3rd place and qualified for the UEFA Cup. It played against Grazer AK (1-1, 3-0) and FK Sarajevo (4-4, 4-0). In the following years, Corvinul has been one of the most admired teams in the Romanian championship, being especially strong on the home games ("norma hunedoreana" or the Hunedoara Plan, which meant that Corvinul scored at least 3 goals in each home game for the whole season, is still a legendary performance).<br />
During this period, it had provided numerous players to the Romania National Team: Michael Klein, Ioan Petcu, Ioan Andone, Mircea Rednic, Dorin Mateut, Romulus Gabor (1981 - best youth player in the world), Florea Vaetus.<br />
Current period. In 1992, Corvinul has relegated from the First League and it has never come back.<br /></p>

<p>The T-1 is a very primitive model terminator from the fictional <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terminator.html" title="Terminator">Terminator</a> universe. It was developed at Cyber Research Systems at Edwards Air Force base as a robotic warrior. T-1s are sensitive to heat, sound, and motion, and they are equipped with gatling guns as their primary weapons systems. T-1s utilize two sets of multiple, tracked wheels in order to move. They can also rotate 360 degrees. On Judgement Day, the T-1s were the first to begin exterminating humans as programmed by the <a href="../../../t/-/x/T-X_64dd.html" title="T-X">T-X</a>.</p>

<p>Oceangram is a fun and free version of the childhood game of putting a message in a bottle and casting it into the ocean. The choice is yours to either write a message or wait for one to come to you. Once a bottle appears either add on to the message or reject it and toss it back. Its a great way to share opinions and thoughs, or just ask, "Where are you from?".</p>

<p>Fast KARL (acronym for Kinetic, Artist, Robotic, Lifeform, or K.A.R.L. ) is the first truly autonomous robot of its kind capable of creating original painted works of art without intervention from the outside world. The robot's electronic brain or computational unit is an analog computer made up of integrated circuit chips containing operational amplifier circuits wired in such fashion as to allow the machine to seem almost alive at times as it interacts with the canvas and wet paint during its performances. The robot's design philosophy shares many of the concepts originally developed by Dr. W. Grey Walter in the 1940's and his experiments with robot tortoises as he called them that he built to test his theories of the properties of simple reflex actions propagating complex behavior arising from neural interconnections. The analog computer circuits inside of the robot Fast KARL form a simple neural network similar in fashion to that of the human brain and its array of neurons which permits the robot to "feel" and react to the artwork it is creating thus it is the first machine ever constructed that can paint what it feels.</p>

<p>—66.202.120.35 18:57, 14 August 2006 (UTC)Stroboflash Stroboflash is the name of one of the earliest commercially successful portable dry cell battery powered electronic flashes produced. It was designed and initially manufactured in 1942 by Strobo Research, a company founded by Edward Farber and Harold Edgerton that was located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Stroboflash electronic flashes were used extensively by newspaper photographers as an alternative to flash bulbs. In 1955, Stroboflash was sold by Strobo Research to Graflex, Inc., a now defunct company that also produced sheet film large format cameras and a host of camera accessories and was located in Rochester, New York. There were four models of Stroboflash, aptly designated as Stroboflash I, Stroboflash II, Stroboflash III and Stroboflash IV. The Stroboflash I used two 240 volt dry cell batteries that are no longer made and was the lightest of the four models and produced 50 watt seconds of light power. The Stroboflash II, III and IV were powered by two 225 volt dry cell batteries that are still produced by Eveready, but are now quite expensive (two #489 225 volt batteries hooked up to produce 450 volts). The Stroboflash II and Stroboflash IV were produced by Graflex through 1975, when Graflex, Inc. sold the Stroboflash IV to another company called Graflite that produced it until about 1978, then they also went out of business. The Stroboflash III was only produced for a few years. It put out 200 watt seconds of light power, but could not be turned down. It was replaced by the Stroboflash IV that had four power setting that could be selected via a rotary top mounted switch: 1/4 (50 watt seconds), 1/2(100 watt seconds), 3/4(150 watt seconds) and full (200 watt seconds). The Stroboflash II had a constant 100 watt second light output that was not adjustable. All four Stroboflash models consisted of a power pack that connected to a seperate flash head via a power cord and special plug and all used the same Stroboflash flash heads, which were light weight and had a satin reflector that produced very soft, non directional light. Professional photographers used Stroboflash II and IV electronic flashes extensively in the 50's through 80's because of the soft, well diffused light they produce. The Stroboflash electronic flash units are still considered flashes that produce excellent quality high power lighting, but the battery expense and the fact that the batteries only produce between 1,000 to 2,000 flashes (depending on the power level selected) and were not rechargeable led to professionals replacing these flashes with other models that were powered by AA batteries that could be recharged. There is a company who has developed a rechargeable power supply for the Stroboflash II, III and IV, which plugs right into the Stroboflash power pack instead of the original dry cell batteries and utilizes two 12 volt rechargeable battery packs. They also repair these flashes. This can be found at Stroboflash.com.</p>

<p>If it had to come down to two people a place and a time as complicated as Miami in the ninetine eighties, whithout a question the two would be Willy Falcon and Sal Magluta."Los Muchachos" as they became known,where the perfect enbodiment of the American success story perverted by the unique conditions created in a city at the intersection of short-sighted U.S. foreign policy and geographical manifest destiny.Willy and Sal were Cuban immigrants who became buddies at Miami High School.They dropped out before graduating,yet by the time they were 19 years old, they were already millionaires and had worked their way into the business of major cocaine traffickers.And they didn’t do it quietly.Both were champion powerboat racers who threw money around on prostitutes,night clubs,restaurants,diamond watches,cars, Miami Beach mansions,Lear jets,lions as pets,and even the Bee Gees,and the Miami Sound Machine, whom they hired to play at relative’s weddings. They became the biggest of the South Florida fish to be chased by law enforcement. They were the Miami Cocaine Cowboys.Finally it all caught up to them. In late 1991 they were arrested and accused of smuggling 85 tons of cocaine(roughly 2.3 billion dollars’worth) through Miami from 1978 to 1991. Authorities considered their operation to be the largest in the U.S. at the time.(fith largest in the world). At trial in Miami’s federal courthouse, the feds brought in 27 informants,though several others declaired missing or killed by hit men before they could testify.Willy and Sal bought the best defense lawyers money could buy — Roy Black, Martin Weinberg, and Albert Krieger.later charged with accepting illegal funds.Also know as the "Black-Tuna trials".The jury acquitted the pair on all charges. “I have to admit that even I was surprised,”opined Black after the trial.Prosecutors were stunned.It was the largest drug case ever lost by the U.S. Justice Department anywhere in the nation. Then-U.S.Attorney Kendall Coffey resigned soon afterward.But prosecutors kept trying to nail the boys, at first with lesser charges such as using phony passports and buying a gun. Then they learned why the first trial had nuked. Three jurors, including the foreman,had been bribed. The price was just a little more than one million dollars. Some of the witnesses were also bought off.Willy and Sal’s sheer homicidal chutzpah, and the inability of law enforcement to nail them for more than twenty years,summed up the "vice age".Not until 2002 was Magluta sentenced to 205 years and a $63 million dollar fine. for his role in money-laundering,witness-tampering and jury-bibery, although he was acquitted of ordering the hits.In 2003 Falcon received twenty years for money laundering plus a bill for one million dollars.Also that year Magluta’s father and his son were sent to prison for helping him hide more than $14 million in drug money. 23:29, 16 September 2006 (UTC)65.12.227.141Sandra Martinez</p>

<p>MAVERICK, Peter, engraver, born in New York city, 22 October, 1780; died there, 7 June, 1831. His father, Peter R. Maverick, was originally a silversmith, but became an etcher and engraver, and did much to aid the early progress of his art in this country. The son studied under his father and also became eminent as an engraver, working chiefly for book-publishers and bank-note companies. He instructed many pupils, among whom was Asher B. Durand, and in 1817 he formed a partnership with Mr. Durand, but it continued only a few years. Mr. Maverick was a National academician, having been one of the founders of the academy in 1826. Among his line-engravings are portraits of Henry Clay, from the painting by Charles King (Washington, 1822); Bishop Benjamin Moore, from that by William Dunlap (New York, 1823); and Andrew Jackson, from the fine portrait by Samuel L. Waldo.</p>

<p>www.tamilfilmratings.com is a novel initiative by dots&amp;pixels. This radical website is a frontrunner in India to introduce the concept of involving ardent movie fans to vote and rate Tamil movies on line. This novel attempt empowers movie viewers to make use of interactive concepts and rate movies unbiased on line.</p>
<p>This site will showcase special reviews and discussion boards for viewers to post their opinions, vote for the movie of the week, month and year. The site will host a variety of exciting entertainment options that will provide the ardent movie buff comprehensive entertainment. Often you felt let down by top ten’s and biased film magazines.</p>
<p>Your favorite hero’s performance is down the gutters. Not-so-enchanting music, a cacophony is top the ratings. Feel dejected as a true and lively Tamilfilm fan, Express yourself. Express it to us. A healthy debate is happening on tamil movies on this site,which is given below: Recent release 'Uyir', starring Sangeetha, Srikanth, Samvritha, has been running successfully and has raised several controversies.</p>
<p><br />
Sangeetha desires her brother-in-law, played by Srikanth. She and her husband had married for love. When he comes to know of her desire, he commits suicide. The widowed Sangeetha seeks to fulfill her desire by separating the lovers, Srikanth and Samvritha. She even dares to kill her child to this end. This is the story of 'Uyir'.</p>
<p>Previously, films like 'Vaali' and 'Kalaba Kadhalan' have dealt with the theme of illicit desire. The story of 'Uyir' has generated the kind of opposition that these films did not see. Some sections have accused the film of ruining Tamil culture. Director Sami, in an interview, accused the producer of having given undue prominence to Sangeetha in the posters and claimed that the movie was only intended to prove that it is foolish to sacrifice life for love, hence the title. "The people have begun to appreciate Sangeetha's character instead," he said.</p>
<p>Producer R. Balaji responded saying that Sangeetha was the most important character in the film and that the director could not interfere in the making of posters. At this point, the 110th day celebration of the film 'Thambi' was held at the Chennai Kamarajar Arangam and severe opposition to 'Uyir' was expressed at the function. 'Nakkeeran' Gopal claimed that the film was detrimental to the joint family system. Actor Vadivel, who spoke after him, said films portraying the desire of a woman for a brother-in-law would create needless suspicions within a family and wondered if the people who made such films did not have sisters. "Such people should be chased out of town and stamped upon. The government should form a committee to analyse the stories of films and ban such films. 'Uyir' should be banned," he demanded.</p>
<p>Following this, in an interview to a weekly, director Sami said Vadivel knew nothing. "Already films like Vaali, Uthiri Pookal and Aasai have been released. Doesn't Vadivel know of their existence? Did he keep his mouth shut then only because these films were about men desiring women who were not their wives? Male chauvinists like Vadivel are enraged now because 'Uyir' is about a woman's desire. The film is running successfully only with the support of Tamil Nadu's men.</p>
<p>'Uyir' is not imaginative fiction. It is the story of my friend. Vadivel is talking like this merely because the film is beating the big-budget film starring him as the '23rd Pulikesi'. He himself in films like 'Pambara Kannalae' has done characters that pimp other men's wives and rapes a schoolgirl.</p>
<p>'Uyir' follows the tale of 'Charulata', told by one of India's most talented directors, Satyajit Ray. What does Vadivel know about this? K. Balachander himself has praised the film after seeing it. Who is Vadivel before him?</p>
<p>Should a widow not desire to remarry? The films I had mentioned previously like 'Vaali' depict the women desired in a very indecent and obscene manner. But I have portrayed the characters in 'Uyir' without the least bit of obscenity. All Tamil and English journals have praised this.</p>
<p>Vadivel has abused all Tamil women in his speech. I express my regrets to all Tamil fans for his behaviour," he said.</p>
<p>In reply, Vadivel said that he could not tolerate films like 'Uyir' that were destroying Tamil families. "Even if I did the role he mentioned in 'Pambara Kannalae', the character I played gets soundly thrashed in the end. I do not even know who this director is. I hear that he is preparing a similar story for his next film. This man who is trying to spread such social evils as ganja should be done away with. I will fight legally to get 'Uyir' banned," he said. When inquiring about this in cinema circles, we heard such comments as: "It is not a healthy trend for people to interfere in a creator's work. If a committee such as Vadivel recommends is formed, will it be possible to make films criticising political figures? What is the Censor Board for then?</p>
<p>All our newspapers are filled with murders and illicit affairs. Why is it wrong to depict this in cinema?</p>
<p>Even our ancient epics have such relationships. Panchali weds five men in the Mahabharatha. Will they burn the Mahabharatha? Or ban it?</p>
<p>Already in the Kushboo issue, politicians needlessly got involved to raise a hue and cry. There may be politics behind what Vadivel has said too. The times are changing. There is a need to speak openly about several issues. People like Vadivel need to understand this."</p>
<p>Somehow, the speech of the 'Vaigai Puyal' has stirred up a storm of controversy. He has become a true 'Imsai Arasan' to the director of 'Uyir'. People may prepare to join both sides. It will be fine as long as the debate remains healthy. This debate was conducted by the site and released on press by its CEO Mr.IB Karthikeyan. Details of the website www.tamilfilmratings.com</p>

<p>A hosted bar refers to bar beverages at a social event. In the food &amp; beverage industry a hosted bar commonly refers to bar where the host of the event is offering a specific selection of beverages that are included with the price (if any) of the event; and that guests may have as many or as much as they choose from the “hosted” selections. It is opposed to a no host or cash bar, at which guests are required to pay for drinks themselves. A hosted bar differs from an open bar in that only the hosted selections are available to guests a no cost. If the bar at a particular social event has other beverages available that are not on the list of hosted bar selections, guests may normally order the beverages but would be required to pay full regular price for them, as they would in a no host or cash bar situation.</p>

<p>Kurt-Werner Schulz was the last victim of the <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_curtain.html" title="Iron curtain">Iron curtain</a>. He and his family arrived to Hungary for summer holidays in 1989 from <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weimar.html" title="Weimar">Weimar</a>, the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Democratic_Republic_b577.html" title="German Democratic Republic">German Democratic Republic</a>. They planned to visit <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Balaton_a640.html" title="Lake Balaton">Lake Balaton</a>, a popular holiday destination among both east and west Germans thus a meeting place for families and friends separated by the Iron curtain. After the TV reports of the Pan-European Picnic on august 19th, 1989 where several hundred citizen of the <a href="../../../g/d/r/GDR_bf47.html" title="GDR">GDR</a> broke through the border to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>, Kurt and Gundula decided to go to <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sopron.html" title="Sopron">Sopron</a> instead, a major Hungarian city near the Austrian border. They were caught by a patrol but they were released later that night. Next day, on the 21st of august they asked a local Hungarian man to show them the way to Austria. They managed to get through the fence but a border-police officer went after them and ordered them to stop. Kurt was caught by the officer, and fighting broke out among the two. He then tried to seize the officer's gun and was accidentally shot dead during the fight. They were on the border-land, between Austria and Hungary, moreover Hungarian border-police did not have the right to shot on illegal border-crossers at the time. Gundula was arrested but Hungarian authorities - fearing of a scandal with both western countries and with the GDR - released and took them to the Austrian border secretly. Kurt's body was taken back to the GDR, Gundula and her son started a new life in <a href="../../../a/a/c/Aachen.html" title="Aachen">Aachen</a>.</p>
<p>Ironically, just a few days after the incident the communist government of Hungary decided to open the Austrian border for east-German 'tourists'.</p>
<p>The story was covered by a Hungarian documentary, Határeset(Border-case) filmed by Peter Szalay in 2005. According to interviews both Gundula and the officer consider the death of Kurt-Werner Schulz a sad accident.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-15_8d75.html" title="Edit section: Open Bar">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Open Bar</span></h2>
<p>An open bar refers to bar beverages at a social event where the entire bar, including all available liquors and beverages, is “open” and paid for by the host, therefore available to guests at no cost. Sometimes referred to a hosted bar, an open bar differs from a hosted bar in that an open bar would typically imply that any and all available beverages a free, whereas a hosted bar offers only to a selected list of beverages which are offered for free. However, it is possible to have a hosted bar where the entire bar is open to guests. In this case either term would be appropriate, although in the Food &amp; Beverage industry, the term open bar is rarely used. Either of these would be opposed to a no host or cash bar, at which guests are required to pay for drinks themselves. When attending an event in the United States which offers an open bar, it is important to be aware that the presence of the open bar does not relieve guests of their moral obligation to tip bartenders and/or waitresses, as appropriate. Commonly suggested tipping amounts for open bar situations would include $1 per drink, or $1 per order if ordering drinks for more than one person. To continue to return to the bar for additional beverages without tipping is not only in bad taste, but would likely result in a very long wait for service as other (tipping) guests get served before you.</p>

<p>The Bay County Library System was established on January 1, 1974, after the county electorate approved a .7 mill tax levy for five years. The Library System brought together three libraries (Bay City Public Library and its Broadway Branch, Sage Library, Pinconning Library) which previously were funded separately and independently by the cities of Bay City and Pinconning. These branches, together with the Auburn Area Branch Library (established in September, 1973), the South Side Branch Library (formerly the Broadway Branch), and the Bookmobile (which began operation in March, 1975) comprise the six "service outlets" of the Library System.</p>

The Bay County Library System was established on January 1, 1974, after the county electorate approved a .7 mill tax levy for five years. The Library System brought together three libraries (Bay City Public Library and its Broadway Branch, Sage Library, Pinconning Library) which previously were funded separately and independently by the cities of Bay City and Pinconning. These branches, together with the Auburn Area Branch Library (established in September, 1973), the South Side Branch Library (formerly the Broadway Branch), and the Bookmobile (which began operation in March, 1975) comprise the six "service outlets" of the Library System.</p>

<p>Bernhard Henrik Crusell (1775-1838) was a Finnish-born composer of classical music, specializing in music for the clarinet, his own instrument. His family moved to Sweden when he was sixteen, and he lived in Stockholm for most of his life.</p>
<p>Crusell began his career as a clarinettist in a regimental band in Stockholm at the age of 8. He was apparently largely self-taught as a composer and performer. Fortunately, he was saved from the errors that usually accompany autodidactism by his taste, which lay towards Mozart. Crusell was perhaps the first to perform [Mozart]'s [Clarinet Concerto in A Major] in Sweden.</p>
<p>Crusell was responsible for three attractive concerti for the clarinet, no. 1 in E flat, no. 2 in F minor, and no. 3 in B flat. He also composed numerous songs, an opera, and clarinet quartets.</p>

<p>A germs burn is the scar left from the extinguishing of a lit cigarette on the inside of one's left wrist at the end of the radius. It is only a true germs burn if it is given by a member of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Germs_30a7.html" title="The Germs">The Germs</a>, or someone who already has one. The first germs burn was given to Lorna Doom by <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darby_Crash_12e7.html" title="Darby Crash">Darby Crash</a> in 1980. Since then, it has become an underground tradition for Germs fans as a pledge of loyalty to the band. The burn usually leaves a white, circular scar after the scab is removed several times.</p>
