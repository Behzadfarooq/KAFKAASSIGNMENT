Their differences were explained by classical Roman and Greek authors, albeit with potential bias, but nonetheless Etruscan society, mythology, culture, language, etc is fairly distinct from Roman culture for a few early authors to have mentioned differences in the first place! What I'm concerned about is that "Evan" is in fact not based on anything real, but simply taken from some crackpot Wiccan website, of which there are many. On these sites, so many of the deities are fictitious constructs meant to fill in gaps in historical knowledge via fertile <i>imagination</i> rather than honest academic research. --<a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGlengordon01_3627.html" title="User:Glengordon01">Glengordon01</a> 21:50, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>redundant and slippery category. What does "liberalism" means in a French context? This is very slippery category, because "liberalism" hasn't got the same sense in the US and in France. In France, "liberalism" refers to <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_liberalism.html" title="Economic liberalism">economic liberalism</a>, and is associated with right-wing parties, while in the States it is opposed to "conservative". But a party such as the Sarkozy's <a href="../../../u/m/p/UMP_6d4e.html" title="UMP">UMP</a> could be alternatively qualified as "conservative" and "liberal", and includes people from both tendencies!!! This is understandable enough, if one gets that this means that one may be conservative in the social sense and liberal in economics policies. Furthermore, "liberalism", in this French context, is opposed to <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaullism.html" title="Gaullism">gaullism</a>, which Jacques Chirac claims to be the heir, a claim laughed out by all political commentators!

<li><b>Delete</b> This is a very minor incident. Mention some appropriate details in the Robertson article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with MusicMaker and Yom that a good article could be written about this character, but also with Danny Lilithborne, Alphachimp, et. al. that this would make a supremely pointless redirect, no matter how cheap redirects are. If there was anything worth keeping, I'd say it would be worth it to go through with moving it and either keeping or deleting the redirect, but that's not the case in this one-sentence "article". If anyone wants to write a <i>real</i> article on this character, they can do so in the way Youngamerican mentioned and nothing will have been lost. ----<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 08:34, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete,</b> no redirect necessary. Unlike Youngamerican, this comment can be taken as an endorsement to create such an article, but there's no reason to bother keeping this single sentence. If you want a full article on Cory Matthews, <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">be bold</a> and edit the redirect there; I'd hope you can do it without this sentence as a starting point. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish">Northenglish</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a>) -- 14:25, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> to those voting keep: The issue here (for me) isn't so much whether Cory is notable or not. As I said above, if you want him to have his own article, go for it. However, your starting point should be splitting off the paragraph in the main <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_Meets_World_ff6b.html" title="Boy Meets World">Boy Meets World</a> article, not this sub-stub. <i>This</i> article and its page history are superfluous and should be deleted. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish">Northenglish</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a>) -- 23:12, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete both</b> as spam. Although there are indeed a good number of Ghits <b>only 300 unique Ghits</b>!

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Although PESA was only formed three years ago it has quickly become a <b>nationally recoginzed</b> organization.

<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry for asking again but what are the major national publications and the many financial institutions that provide such importance to PESA? You give two links: one is a google search and is hardly proof of anything. "pesa" is a four letter word and there is a good chance that you get a lot of hits for any four letter word on Google. For instance, "pese ebay" will give you 412 000 Ghits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1B2GGGL_enCA176&amp;q=pese+ebay" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1B2GGGL_enCA176&amp;q=pese+ebay" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, "pase ebay" gets you 329 000 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=fr&amp;q=pase+ebay&amp;btnG=Rechercher&amp;lr=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=fr&amp;q=pase+ebay&amp;btnG=Rechercher&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, "pena ebay" gives you 1 600 000 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=fr&amp;q=pena+ebay&amp;btnG=Rechercher&amp;lr=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=fr&amp;q=pena+ebay&amp;btnG=Rechercher&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. So please provide links to <b>very specific examples</b> of wide media recognition of PESA. You might find that difficult given that a google search for "Professional eBay Sellers Alliance" turns up 129 unique Ghits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Professional+eBay+Sellers+Alliance%22+&amp;hl=fr&amp;lr=&amp;start=120&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Professional+eBay+Sellers+Alliance%22+&amp;hl=fr&amp;lr=&amp;start=120&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. Now you might argue about your second link but given the lack of context (what's this conference? How where the companies chosen?) that still is pretty weak. Since the start of the debate you have reworked the references a bit, by including for instance at the top of the list a NYTimes article. Aaaah, I thought, at last a decent reference. But the article only mentions PESA in passing... <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 03:52, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Here's another free host webcomic, unlike the above nomination, you may not have heard of the host, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Genesis_e932.html" title="Comic Genesis">Comic Genesis</a>. Just think of it as a Geocities of the webcomic world. This furry webcomic (probably not safe for work) can be seen <a href="http://kitnkayboodle.comicgenesis.com/" class="external text" title="http://kitnkayboodle.comicgenesis.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. As Alexa is down right now, I can't tell you whether it features on the Alexa report for comic genesis. But you can still take a look at the Google links and see if you find any decent external critical comment or reviews of this work. Because the search for "kit n kay boodle", although bringing up <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22kit+n+kay+boodle%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22kit+n+kay+boodle%22" rel="nofollow">150 Google links</a>, you'll see that many of these results do not have anything to do with the comic, instead something to with kit cars, like the results on <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22kit+n+kay+boodle%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22kit+n+kay+boodle%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">this page</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - If I nominate a website and just say "nn - geocities", it'd probably work, because the general audience recognise that Geocities is a lame freehost for homebrew nn websites. Same for XOOM, bravenet and freewebs. It wouldn't work however with webcomics, if I say "nn - smack jeeves", the general audience wouldn't know what I meant and ignore the AFD or vote keep stating that my nom is too poorly researched. I'm just letting these guys know about the free webcomic hosts out there. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 14:43, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Why is it that <a href="../../../w/e/b/Category%7EWebcomics_03f4.html" title="Category:Webcomics">Category:Webcomics</a> is larger than <a href="../../../b/l/o/Category%7EBlogs_472d.html" title="Category:Blogs">Category:Blogs</a> or <a href="../../../e/r/o/Category%7EErotica_websites_68c9.html" title="Category:Erotica websites">Category:Erotica websites</a>? Is it because blogs and porn site are totally unrepresented on Wikipedia? That webcomics form a larger part of the Internet than porn sites or blogs? Or that webcomics are inherently more notable than other websites? Or maybe that webcomics are utterly overrepresented here on Wikipedia? I think its a bit of the first and more of the last. One of the possible reasons can be seen at the webcomic, <a href="http://www.zeldacomic.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.zeldacomic.net/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In the news post you can see that the author is flattered that someone has put together a Wikipedia page for his "little comic" and calling Wikipedia a "noble effort to amass information on just about every webcomic out there". This is not what Wikipedia is, yet many webcomic fans seem to think otherwise. This "little webcomic" belongs on comixpedia, which is an effort to amass webcomic information, and the only way we're going to change that community's perception of Wikipedia is to get these non-notable websites deleted. I think that this little comic isn't notable, nor does its author, a Google search doesn't bring back much relevence to this comic at all. I checked this on Alexa when it was still up, I can't remember the exact figure, but the rank was in the hundreds of thousands, it definitely wasn't good enough to not get blacklisted on my watchlist. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:45, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I absolutely knew you were advertising FOR Wikipedia when you made that news post on your front page. That's cool. But Wikipedia isn't a place to catalogue every webcomic, and the wikiproject isn't either. The wikiproject is a good place to sort out all webcomic stuff out, like categorisation, rating articles and wikifying them. It also creates new articles, but it doesn't cover every webcomic out there, nor should it. Just as we don't cover every blog, forum, deviantart profile or porn site. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 14:15, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>, Once again Hahnchen fails to read properly. First of all, on the comic's home page, mario states that it is the goal of WikiProject Webcomics (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Webcomics" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Webcomics" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>), NOT Wikipedia as a whole, to gather information on webcomics. Therefore mario is not at all promoting Wikipedia as an encyclopedia on Webcomics as Hahnchen so ignorantly states. I have a final question to add to the opening series of questions: "Or perhaps there is nothing wrong with webcomics, but I, Hahnchen, am just a biased asshole who hates things that bring people happiness?" 100% of all webcomic authors and fans agree: my added question is, in fact, the correct choice. (See Hahnchen, you're not the only one who can make up statistics.) But go ahead. Delete it anyway since it give you a chubby. Zelda Comic and all the other webcomics whose articles you've so ignorantly deleted are better than this bullshit encyclopedia. Mjc0961 12:25, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I congratulate you for putting together a comment without resorting to your favourite pastime on vandalising my user page with your favourite phallus pictures, although you have yet again inserted a phallic reference into your comment. Is that a theme with you? I pull statistics out of my ass all the time, it just happens that when I do it, they're correct and can be easily verified. It's just a gift that I have. Yours however, are wrong. The Wikiproject's aim is not to cover every single webcomic on earth, being that some like DSSB are totally obscure, lack any kind of redeeming quality, and add nothing to the encyclopedia's value. Zelda Comic's a bit better than that, but still, compared with the billions of websites out there, it's not notable. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 14:15, 11 July 2006 (UTC) - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 14:15, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Let me state right off that I am a fan of Zelda Comic. That out of the way, let me also state that I understand most of the comments about deletion. Sure, Zelda Comic is not particularly notable to people outside of its fanbase. Most of the arguments based on notability make sense, although Hanchen is a moron who doesn't read all the way through before commenting on something. One argument does not make sense to me, though, so could someone explain it to me? How in the nine hells does Mario linking to his wiki page on the front page of HIS website automatically fail him on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>? If I made an article on something that could be perfect in all aspects about some website I own, then I went and linked to the wiki article on MY WEBSITE, would that automatically disqualify the article? It makes no sense to me. 207.62.176.150 18:01, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Methinks Alphachimp was making a little joke when he said that linking to Wikipedia is a disqualifier for inclusion on Wikipedia. (The basis of the joke is that in general, sites that are important enough to merit inclusion in an encyclopedia generally do not get excited when a Wikipedia article on them appears. <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazon.com.html" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, for example, does not have a notice on its front page saying, "Look, everyone! There's a Wikipedia article about us!") The real reason the site fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is that it has not "been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works", it has not "won a well known and independent award", and its content is not "distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators". —<a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaesura_ad40.html" title="User:Caesura">Caesura</a><a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaesura_b24c.html" title="User talk:Caesura"><sup>(t)</sup></a> 18:19, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> The counterpoint to that frontpage comment is that the sheer size and mass of the internet make it impossible to catalog all information -- a common misconception is that Wikipedia indiscriminately collects information, and we don't. It's not that I hate you guys or anything, I'm sure you enjoy yourselves and I wish you nothing but the best. I only ask that you understand that we're literally <i>flooded</i> with hundreds or thousands of new articles every day, and if something even looks remotely like "This is a band my friends and I started," we're going to take a closer look. Have a glance at the criteria of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, if you will. Notability can be subjective, but it's an important concept; factual accuracy alone doesn't guarantee inclusion. Hope that helps a bit.

<li><b>Comment</b> We all understand that factual accuracy doesn't guarantee inclusion, and that Wikipedia isn't a blog for everyone to post about their little bands or whatnot on, Luna Santin. We're just plain sick of Hahnchen's bullshit where he acts like mario (or whatever author) wrote the article to promote his site and to promote Wikipedia as an index of all things webcomic. Then he <i>always</i> brings up Alexa and uses it to make it sound like only two or three people read the webcomic in question. You should not have admins on here insulting people like that for no reason whatsoever. What you have said above would be perfectly fine, but here comes this biased prick who has to come out and try to make every webcomic author out to be some jackass abusing Wikipedia when most of the time the author of the comic the article is about didn't even write the damn article in the first place! That's why it gets linked on their sites: they are excited to see that one of their fans took time out of their personal lives to write an article about their webcomic. And that's why you don't see Amazon.com putting "Look, everyone! There's a Wikipedia article about us!" -- because <i>they don't care if there's a Wikipedia article about them.</i> They're after money, and having a happy customer write an article about them doesn't interest them at all. In closing, it's nice to see someone explain why articles like this don't meet the standards of Wikipedia's guidelines without resorting to insulting the author of the webcomic. But as long as you have these assholes like Hahnchen here doing that, you're going to have pissed off fans like us coming here to stick up for the comics and authors in question.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I didn't act like Mario had written the article to promote his comic. I absolutely knew that he wrote the news post because he was he flattered that someone else thought his comic worthy of inclusion. My comment is on the feeling in the webcomic community that Wikipedia is used as a catalogue of all webcomics. If you had read my nomination, with eyes, you would have realised this.

<p>–I just have a simple question... why if they are the one to decide what is notable or not do they let's everyone write in the encyclopedia? I think that there is no not notable site. Even the www.perdu.com have the credit to make us laught. I think an information can be not notable if it's false... but this have no link with the popularity of this infomation. I understand the need to delete entrie about porn site, or terroriste site because children can consult this encyclopedia but a comic is not a dangerous site. I don't like particulary Zelda comic but if you think that this comic is not notable i think that tintin, asterix or megatokyo (a webcomic) is not notable either. P.S.

<li><b>Comment</b> The policies of Wikipedia decide what is notable and not-notable. This is an encyclopedia, so every article must have some reason for its existence. The article Zelda Comic is not notable according to Wikipedia policies (<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>). Everyone can edit this encyclopedia because that way, the greatest amount of information is available. However, certain policies here allow vandalism and non-notable articles to be removed. Notable porn sites must be kept, even though many people (myself among them) do not like them on moral grounds. Terrorist groups must be included in an encyclopedia because they are notable. Yes, children can access this website, but they must look up the pornographic page or terrorist group to access the corresponding article. Children can go to <i>google.com</i> and search for pornography and terrorist groups. An encyclopedia is a collection of important, notable information.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Why does it matter how many pages are on Wikipedia? The page will exist and if someone wants to read it, they may. If they don't, it won't come up in a search.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Take a look at Encyclopedia Brittanica. It has MUCH more stringent guidelines than Wikipedia. We have rules so that we don't have pointless articles. Encyclopedias are for notable things <i>only</i>. Take a look in your encyclopedia, if you have one. It doesn't have anything silly or pointless. It may have google.com because "google" is actually a verb accepted in the Oxford English Dictionary now. Your encyclopedia would not have a non-notable website in it. Everything in an encyclopedia must be able to attest to its own importance. The Zelda Comic cannot; it has no educational, social, historic, or scientific value. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b>Srose</b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(talk)</font></a> 20:28, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> as per nom. Transwiki to Comixpedia if they'll have it.

<li><b>Conflicted</b> If one were to delete this page based on the overabbundence of webcomics on wikipedia and only have a link to the comixpedia site, then one would also have to tell the animes to go to an anime wiki, video games to a video game wiki, and so. In my belief, this goes against the "wealth of human knowdlge" idea behind wikipedia. On the other hand, removing all non-necceary detail for this comic <i>and</i> include basics and a link to comixpedia, would make the article easier on the eyes and closer to wikipedia's guidelines. Subsequently, to be fair, one would have to go out and do the same thing for all topic-specific articles. Plus i can't officially mark myself for or against it, being i am one of the poeple who started the article. So, you see my conflict? In Addition, "a noble effort to amass information on just about every webcomic out there" is about the wikiproject webcomics", not wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBud0011_5a73.html" title="User:Bud0011">Bud0011</a> 15:47, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

The article that came up when I pressed "Random Article." If Wikipedia's keeping one-sentence stuff like that up, a webcomic with a decent following deserves its own article if the authors of said article take it seriously. Which they were. Unless an article was created by virtue of a typo (which can easily happen), is in some way a true form of "vandalism," or if simply Wikipedia runs out of server space, if it's well-written it should stay up, in my opinion. Of course Wikipedia doesn't have to follow the 1st Amendment and free speech and all that, but I always thought it took to heart its spirit.

<p>Keep - Not that I say Zelda comic isn't notable, but just because an article for an encyclopedia isn't "notable" doesn't mean a thing. An encyclopedia is used to find out information on a certain subject, correct? If so, it doesn't matter if it's "notable." The real question should be "moral." Which I believe Zelda comic, for the most part, is. Besides, the Wiki is based on the Internet. The Internet has vast amounts of space, so why shouldn't it include "pointless" material?</p>

<p>"Starfield Creations" is an unregistered company name created by an amateur "furry" porn artist. This page was clearly created as a personal promotion tactic by a friend of said artist under the guise of a legitimate business organization. Considering the fact that this site is not to be used for promotion of people or their "businesses" who are not particularly famous or noteworthy, I think it should be deleted. I have seen articles taken down about the work of people far better known in the art community, and this just seems to be a sneaky way for personal promotion of a recent amateur art school graduate.

<li><b>Keep</b> Your information for deletion is flaming BS and blatent defamation, I'm not a "furry porn artist" nor did I make this entry, nor did I ask a friend to make it.

<li><b>Keep until a better argument is made</b> per Adam Anania. I am not going to necessarily argue that the entry remain, but I would like to clearly state that KeijiIno's argument is completely incorrect and ridiculous. Checking the update history for this entry, I know for a fact that Andrew did not create nor has ever altered this entry. KeijiIno's argument is clearly full of bias, bitterness, and from my own knowledge of Andrew, mere lies. Neither Andrew nor I are overly familiar with Wikipedia's regulations on entries, but this entry is certainly not being used by Andrew himself for his own promotion, and KeijiIno's arguments for removing it are surely laughable. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.251.130.201 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.251.130.201_8107.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.251.130.201">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Regardless of who made the page in the first place, the fact remains that it's mere exsistence is in violation of Wikipedia's policy. Andrew isn't famous outside droves of slobering internet fans. I will say it again: "Wikipedia is not an advertising service. Promotional articles about yourself, your friends, your company or products; or articles written as part of a marketing or promotional campaign, may be deleted in accordance with our deletion policies. For more information, see Wikipedia:Spam.". I am quoting Wikipedia's policy on this. Regardless of wether Andrew is a furry porn artist (which he most certainly is, his DA gallery is full of proof), it is still against the rules for Andrew, or any of his fans, to make a page on Wikipedia about him. Being a small flea on the dog's hind quarters of the animation industry does not merit recognition on an online encyclopedia. KeijiIno</li>
<li><b>STRONG DELETE</b> This person and her organization might have a lot of fans who have come to defend it, but the fact still remains that Wikipedia is not meant to be used for personal promotion or the promotion of friends and friends' businesses. Please review the above point: "Wikipedia is not an advertising service. Promotional articles about yourself, your friends, your company or products; or articles written as part of a marketing or promotional campaign, may be deleted in accordance with our deletion policies. For more information, see Wikipedia:Spam." This was quoted from the Wikipedia user guide. It clearly states, whether said individual being defamed or not, that the promotion of an individual or his/her friends or businesses are not to be promoted here. Antarctic Press is a little known niche publisher and thus not notable as would be DC Comics or Marvel. Anyone can get amateur works published there. Bearing these facts in mind, I agree this is not an individual noteworthy enough to have a listing on Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Joseph Cabo (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Joseph_Cabo_f5df.html" title="Special:Contributions/Joseph Cabo">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I nominated it for deletion because I thought it was a poorly-written article with an unnecessary level of detail about one aspect of a classic novel: I would classify that as cruft. Everything encyclopaedic about the ship is already contained in <i><a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Thunder_Child_acb4.html" title="HMS Thunder Child">HMS Thunder Child</a></i> and I can't imagine anyone searching explicitly for the phrase 'sacrifice of thunder child'.

<li><b>Keep</b> — all information in the article is sourced from the novel; the article is no more original research than any other article about a novel, or for that matter, a movie or a game. "An unnecessary level of detail"? Since when is that a fault? That the article is something that the nominator "would classify ... as cruft"? The nominator's personal opinion is not a valid criterion for deletion. A nomination that begins with the admission that the nominator himself is "not quite sure why this article should be deleted" needs to be speedy kept to give the nominator a chance to review the deletion criteria and find a way to work within policy. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Epopt_6905.html" title="User:The Epopt">➥the Epopt</a> 05:37, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The title of the article is original research; the article itself is <i>not</i> about a novel, movie or game. What lacuna does the article <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Thunderchild_c232.html" title="HMS Thunderchild">HMS Thunderchild</a> have that necessitates this article? Forking is only acceptable when the <i>main article</i> has an unacceptable level of detail; there is nothing of the sort in War of The Worlds (novel). The event has no notability outside of the context of the book - why then is the article about it outside of the article on the book? As far as personal opinions go, in every case they determine what is deleted and what is kept. And the nominator has explained their reasons on this page. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus">speak up!</a></small> 09:39, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> redundant. We only need one article on Thunder Child, and this is the logical one to get rid of because for all that it is sourced from the book, it is essentially a plot summary of one part of the book with apparently <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">novel inferences</a>. We don't do plot summaries. The level of detail is excessive for a fictional plot device form one book. I am a huge SF fan, I love the books of Wells, but this level of details is just too much. I removed the cover image of the Wayne album (of which I am also a huge fan) since fair use does not allow it to be used other than in the article on the album itself.

<p>Both of you are missing the point, doesn't matter how many "google hits" it has, it's well known for what it does and anything looking for information on it be it history or what they are doing now, wikipedia has the info for them. I'm sure there are enough violations to remove 99% of the articles on wikipedia but all I'm saying is if you want to delete this one, then delete the other dozen articles that are similar to it which you think is nothing more than a promotion or advertising. Start here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_music_stores#Online_Music_Store_Comparison_table" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_music_stores#Online_Music_Store_Comparison_table" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_music_stores#Online_Music_Store_Comparison_table</a> and rid wikiepedia all of those violating articles like itunes, allofmp3.com, etc. Last I saw allofmp3.com has a wikipedia article and no one is really sure if that's even a legal business to begin with. My vote is in to keep it here since you have all those others, if you want to remove this one, then set and example and remove all the other advertisers as well please. - susan <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.238.243.83 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.238.243.83_1c43.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.238.243.83">contribs</a>) 03:55, 11 July 2006.</small></p>

The "not paper" proviso seems far more relevant here than not "TV/Radio Guide" as written. None of these are remotely about what's on tv tonight, upcoming network promotions, etc., which is clearly the gist of that heading. These lists are better organized than the categories, and therefore more useful. I've only known of their existence for a day, and already I've found them educational and a potentially good research tool. (I've been trying to piece together what was on Nick at Nite in 1985-1986 for my own use.) The ones I looked at need filling out, not deletion. On the other hand, if categories could be rigorously created and populated with everything from every deleted list, right down to the subheadings, I would be satisfied. This seems unlikely to happen, however, because many older shows have no articles to this point. Incidentally, I find Maximegalon's conduct here very much in good faith and highly ethical. This AFD proceeds logically from the Sci-Fi one, and notifying people on both sides of the previous vote is as fair as can be.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> per Karen and Rebecca. Really now, they're really quite referential and definately helpful as they are: lists and guides.

<dl>
<dd>There are many lists and they <i>do</i> serve a purpose. Deleting them so swiftly without remarking on their potential if they're somewhat short of that would be unjust to those who have spent time compiling them (although I know effort doesn't necessarily qualify as being encyclopaedicly valueable, they knew the benefit of having these things to their corresponding channel lists)... Like the many editors of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Sci_Fi_Channel_%28United_States%29_programs_a84e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Sci Fi Channel (United States) programs">the forementioned AfD</a>, who managed to sort things through well-enough considering.</dd>
<dd>Though, just <i>one thing to keep in mind</i>.... There should be some sources cited if there isn't already, since one can write something up for an obscure channel and the reader would not have anything to refer back onto to verify these listings. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorWho42_7447.html" title="User:DoctorWho42">DrWho42</a> 06:49, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Interesting. I'm seeing notable items (e.g., historically important tv shows), given additional notability by association with a particular network's history.

None of the five bulleted examples are comparable to this situation and the bolded instruction that "if you are unsure of whether to bundle an article or not, don't" suggests not bundling these. In any case, these sixty or so pages were the result of sometimes enormous effort, with some of them having over 250 edits in the history (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programs_broadcast_by_American_Broadcasting_Company&amp;limit=250&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programs_broadcast_by_American_Broadcasting_Company&amp;limit=250&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">this one</a>). If we're going to wipe out this much work, it ought to be in separate AfDs, or at the very least with more test cases. We owe that much to the people who've worked on these lists.

<li>Okay, let me rephrase: these pages are basically lists except for the schedules included in some of them. They should be deleted by <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. However, as plain lists by are quire useful. Hence, make a category for each of them and include the items from the relevant list. -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 09:30, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Note that while some of these have current schedules, most of them provide organized information. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_programs_broadcast_by_Adult_Swim_6073.html" title="List of programs broadcast by Adult Swim">List of programs broadcast by Adult Swim</a>, for example, which contains a notes column with useful information and grouped by theme. From WP:lists (but not <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELISTS_2571.html" title="WP:LISTS">WP:LISTS</a>), a guideline for when to create lists, <i>Lists on Wikipedia have three main purposes:</i> Information, Navigation, and Development. Number 2 doesn't really apply anymore because of Categories, but for quite a few of these, either 1 (Info) or 3 applies very well. For info: <i>The list may be a <b>valuable information source</b>. This is particularly the case for a <b>structured list</b>. Examples would include <b>lists organized chronologically, grouped by theme, or annotated lists.</b></i> It's clear, for example, that the above mentioned Adult Swim list is a valuable information source, grouping information by theme, chronologically, and containing significant notes on the programs. Moreover, a number of these lists, like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_programs_broadcast_by_Alpha_TV_8677.html" title="List of programs broadcast by Alpha TV">List of programs broadcast by Alpha TV</a>, for example, clearly fulfill the development aspect of Lists cited by Wikipedia as just reason to create a list (<i>Some lists are useful for Wikipedia development purposes. The lists of related topics give an indication of the state of the 'pedia, the articles that have been written, and the articles that have yet to be written.</i>) All of these reasons should make it obvious why these lists should be kept. Some of them seem to be better replaced by Categories, but there are many lists proposed for deletion that clearly fulfill one or two of the above reasons to create a list as per accepted WP guidelines. — <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">ዮም</font></a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="green">(Yom)</font></a> | <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">contribs</font></a></small> • <small><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a></small> • <small><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Ethiopia_7101.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Ethiopia"><font color="red">E</font></a></small> 09:38, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - If these were all <i>simply</i> lists of programs I would have no issue saying "delete". However, as Yom notes, there is usually relevant additional information. For instance, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_programs_broadcast_by_Global_42db.html" title="List of programs broadcast by Global">List of programs broadcast by Global</a> (a Canadian network which, like many Canadian networks, tends to buy the rights to more American shows than it can fit on) lists not only past, present, and future series, but also indicates the status of shows <i>might</i> air on that network depending on other factors. Others indicate what I consider relevant information about <i>when</i> programs aired, e.g. first-run vs. syndication. — <font face="Times New Roman" style="background: #000066;" color="#FFFFFF">stickguy (:^›)—</font> <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStickguy_d898.html" title="User:Stickguy">home</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStickguy_30f3.html" title="User talk:Stickguy">talk</a> - 10:40, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Additional comment</b> - I also take issue with the application of "WP is not a TV guide" insofar as listing <i>general</i> information about a channel's <b>current base</b> schedule. I'm not saying we should have schedules for the likes of ESPN where the idea of a season schedule is essentially meaningless. But even we were to have <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006-07_United_States_network_television_schedule_86b7.html" title="2006-07 United States network television schedule">2006-07 United States network television schedule</a>-type articles for all countries and channels covered, that's just the planned schedule as of the outset of the season. I consider the current main schedule of a channel, <i>exclusive of any specials or special airings</i>, not to be indiscriminate, and relevant to discussion of the competitive business of television. Whether or not they're relevant content in a "list" is debatable, although it seems preferable in contrast to a new "Current United States television schedules" page listing every network and cable channel known to man. — <font face="Times New Roman" style="background: #000066;" color="#FFFFFF">stickguy (:^›)—</font> <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStickguy_d898.html" title="User:Stickguy">home</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStickguy_30f3.html" title="User talk:Stickguy">talk</a> - 10:40, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reluctant Keep</b>. Reluctant because I don't believe lists of things actually belong on an encyclopaedia, but sadly there is enough precedent on here to keep these lists. As an aside, one of the things that bugs me the most is how so many of these lists are clearly incomplete yet adding more entries fails to add to their quality. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkb_3e6f.html" title="User:Markb">Markb</a> 12:50, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keepish</b> I don't particularly like the listyness of this and these lists will eventually become horrendously over-populated. I'm also not keen to be associated with arguments based on wikipedia not being paper. However, it occurs to me though that there are encylopedic articles that could be created from them for instance Television programmes broadcast by the BBC in the 1990s and these could become the parent articles. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 13:12, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, unless some good samaritan(s) categorizes each and every one. But many TV shows never will have their own articles, either because of non-notability or because of lack of interest, so categorization of the entire list will be impossible. If someone wants a complete and comprehensive list, this is the only place he/she can look. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 13:37, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> To be honest, although having a list of television shows that have been or will be broadcast in a region is not really what a traditional Encyclopedia was meant for - wikipedia is anything but a traditional encyclopedia. If we start pulling articles such as this because we feel that it is beyond what Wikipedia was meant for, then by the same means we need to pull articles on comics, trading cards, games, even theatre - because it is not what an encyclopedia is for. In other words, once we begin to restrict the content, where do we stop? I am extensively using the resource available for a website I am building that puts all current run TV shows into a game format; wikipedia is an invaluable resource for this purpose. I no longer have to go hunting each individual studio or network - I can use the wiki to find the majority of what I need in one easy spot. So in regards to whether this is useful content or not - I vote yes, because the way I see it - if even one person finds it useful - then it has served a purpose. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonChi_66fb.html" title="User:DragonChi">DragonChi</a> 17:59, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Useful as tracking lists, to see what shows WP has/has not got articles on. Potentially useful as a finding resource, for people who know the network a show was on, but not its precise name. Useful as a guide to the kind of output the network showed. Regarding lists vs categories: there's a place for both - lists can be a lot more systematic, and show redlinks. So Keep (and re-instate the Sci-Fi channel, which appears to have been deleted on the admin's personal view, rather than the balance of the Afd). <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheald_bb56.html" title="User:Jheald">Jheald</a> 07:53, 13 July 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The lists are quite useful in finding out what any particular network is showing or has showed over its history. To say is a TV guide is incorrect as it is not acting as a TV guide as it doesn’t show actual channel/time/date stuff. They do go to show who published or created any particular television show by this thinking, oher lists would also have to be deleted as well, it is the same thing as deleting the list of products offered by Microsoft, Boeing, Ford or Adobe. The lists are quite useful in seeing who created what and for comparing genres. A TV guide would show the time, date and channel any given program will be transmitted. This is more historical and cross-referencing here. Such information is not generally in a TV guide. The lists are a nice consolidation of information which one would otherwise have to look for in many different places. <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdelisle_6821.html" title="User:Bdelisle">Bdelisle</a> 01:29, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Addendum</b> Being that television programming is quite ingrained in to the culture of many countries, and the at many of the programming can be comparative of other programming having such a list makes for a great index. Also like said above, keep the current lists and re-instate the Sci-Fi channel programming list. Truly encyclopedic? Probably not. Of interest to people? Seems to be. There is a lot of stuff that would not go in to a traditional encyclopedia in Wikipedia. That is what makes it so interesting. I believe that a lot of AfD is done over-aggressively, much seems to be based on opinion which often seems to be counter-neutral itself. If we are truly encyclopedic then 90% of the pages dealing with television shows, programs, and stations should be deleted; as should most books, movies, biographical stubs and company lists. <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdelisle_6821.html" title="User:Bdelisle">Bdelisle</a> 20:24, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I <i>can</i> see people wanting to consult these lists; in fact, IIRC the whole idea of them was started precisely because people <i>were</i> adding exhaustive lists of past and present shows to the network articles themselves, which started to disrupt the quality of those articles. I don't have a particularly strong opinion on them, but I do find the "Wikipedia is not TV Guide" argument unconvincing, as that's not what these lists are <i>trying</i> to do. All in all, I don't see any reason to vote anything other than <b>keep</b>, although I could be swayed by a more convincing argument against them than I've seen here so far. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 22:08, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - why are these pages gone when the consensus, to me a slightly newbie wikipedian seems to be on the side of keeping them? Confused as to process. BTW I think that the amount of posters/traffic/etc. would indicate that there is demand for this content, it's useful, it's needed, and it evolved through the wikipedian process. this is a repository for information of which all of these pages are exactly that. anyone using these pages as their local listings would be quite disappointed as it takes a while to get them updated.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/x/d/User%7ERxdxt_ef39.html" title="User:Rxdxt">Rxdxt</a> (<a href="../../../r/x/d/User_talk%7ERxdxt_312d.html" title="User talk:Rxdxt">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rxdxt_0b30.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rxdxt">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I created the entry, with no intention of an attack or 'hit list.' The genesis behind it is that I was reading the article on <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike_action.html" title="Strike action">strikebreaking</a> and 'scabs' and remembering a few of my favorite sports players had actually crossed the picket lines and made successes of themselves. I thought it would be interesting to see how many strike breakers actually made it. Certainly -- the initial use of the word "scabs" on the list was changed with no objection from me, simply to Strikebreakers and it has since been combined in the title. I still have no objection to simply listing it as famous strikebreakers. Really, I was just using the term as it was being used on that other page and how it was used in the media. I really don't have an axe to grind here at all. I think a POV is being imputed by the above into the article - again, I think it is notable that many famous athletes, actors, musicians were involved in these labor disputes in this way. It is definitely part of the story. I do hope people decide to keep the list and update it -- there are several other notable strike breakers that are non-athletes/actors. I just haven't had the time to go ahead and do the research. In the meantime, as an expression of good faith -- I'll go ahead and change the substance to get rid of the offending word - "scabs". --<a href="../../../g/o/p/User%7EGopple_ff0a.html" title="User:Gopple">Gopple</a> 18:57, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Again, I think you're reading a bias into what it means to be a strike breaker. Is that supposed to be a good thing or a bad thing? Or is the point that it shouldn't matter--only that its part of the historical story.

<dd>I still fail to see how this is a "public shaming", as you've linked to twice now - Do you think the actions of those who worked during a strike shameful? That seems especially POV. I think Jimbobl's idea is a good one -- context is always important -- but so are the players in major economic/business standoff. I disagree that saying "X number of people crossed a picket line on Y date." The fact that every person on that list is notable enough to have their own wikipedia entry shows that its a part of their biography and the history of union/management standoffs in the United States.--<a href="../../../g/o/p/User%7EGopple_ff0a.html" title="User:Gopple">Gopple</a> 05:23, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This has plenty of relevant, publically accessable truthful (non-slanderous) content relevant to sports players. For example, every baseball strike breaker cannot join the <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLBPA_317a.html" title="MLBPA">MLBPA</a> and thus their name and likeness can't be licensed by the union. This is the reason players like <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Millar_f011.html" title="Kevin Millar">Kevin Millar</a> cannot be represented in video games. I think this article does correctly record valuable historical information about the players. I do think maybe each strike should be listed separately maybe with additional neutral point of view introductory paragraph, listing the views of the different parties (e.g., players union vs. players. vs. owners vs. fans) for each group of strike-breakers to put it in some context.--Jimbobl 14:44, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Alright, but I disagree. One, I disagree with your logic of article structure, and two, I disagree with Air having a complex plot. It was a tear-jerker, sure, but not hard to understand. But that's besides the point. Using a an article about a recap episode to talk about over-all plot elements is quite inappropriate. If it is too big for the main article then something like Plot Summary of Air should be made, like how is done with <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eureka_Seven_048a.html" title="Eureka Seven">Eureka Seven</a> and <a href="../../../p/l/o/Plot_Summary_of_Eureka_Seven_%28anime%29_a97a.html" title="Plot Summary of Eureka Seven (anime)">Plot Summary of Eureka Seven (anime)</a>. In fact, I'd favor that type of format over individual episode articles, or maybe even merging articles that share the same sub-plot arc, like eps 2,3,4 and then 5,6 and such. Again, I'm getting off topic, but you get my point about this article. Also, some of what you suggested sounds like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 11:08, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Plot Summary of Air, recap episode no real diference. A recap episode is a plot summary by definition. There is no original research issues when relating Misuzus condition to Kanna, is there? Excel has a basic plot. The only "real" plot is a world domination attempt, but no serious effort is made to that end throughout the series. Air on the other hand has a complex plot. All episodes are related to a degree. Even the Kano and Minagi arcs that kinda dont fit in like the rest (as they are supposed to be seperate endings for the game I believe) actualy relate to Kanna. There is a lot of referances back and forth which in my view should be covered (and the recap episode does a decent job covering this) --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 11:17, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have no solid plan on how to write the recap article. I wasn't geneticaly engineered with the recap episode engraved to my genes. I first have to rewatch it. If you have suggestions in improving the recap episode, feel free to do so in the articles talk page. If after the improvement drive there is a posibily to merge the article or move it elsewhere, that posibility can be investigated then.

<li><b>Delete</b>, It's kinda a gray area, as a page about an episode shoudl be about the episode, and a recap episode recaps the series to date, but if you're just going to turn it into a plot summary page, it should go into the main series page. Also, if you want to prove that the article has value, you better hurry up and write it. --<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPresN_40fd.html" title="User:PresN">PresN</a> 21:45, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">per concensus.</a> Editors on wikipedia should generally be given time to flesh out articles that they write. "Generally" is the key. Some types of articles which have tendencies to be trivial in nature (i.e. television episodes) should be developed in a way that conforms to concensus guidelines and policies created for those subject areas. The general concensus for these has been: 1) Create the article for the main series. 2) When and if section of that article overwhelms the main article, that section should be split into a new article and summarize section on main page. 3) When and if individual entities of a section in the secondary page become too large, split into a third article. I know the editor who created the article disagrees with these guidlines and policies. However, because those guidelines were based on concensus decisions and I find them to be very reasonable and quite useful to quality control at the project... my suggestion is to <b>delete</b>. Most of the current air episode articles are this type of one sentence article. Even the example of a "completed" episode page is very short and could easily merged into the list of air episodes. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 01:56, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do not disagree with guidelines/policies (just merely ignoring them as per "ignore all rules policy"), and I do not believe you know me (nor would that be relevant). Multiply the size of Breeze with 15 (we have 15 epidoes) and your number will easily exeed 32kb warranting this kind of seperation. I need to be given time to write the articles. People had been complaining ever since I created the stup pages which I intend to expand.

<ul>
<li>Your math is wrong. The Breeze episode is 1.8kb. There are 15 Episodes. That makes 27kb, not 32.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, the size argument is invalid. <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">WP:SIZE</a> states that the strict 32kb rule may be ignored for such things as lists. Thus, if that is your sole reason for creating seperate articles, I will happily go on a merging binge this weekend, just for you. Even if you choose to <i>ignore</i> another concensus policy, there are other ways to create lists of episodes with these extradionarily short plot summaries on wikipedia. The list could be divided into episodes arcs, or in half, or thirds. I find episode lists that concatenated on one page far easier to read, edit, keep track of vandalism, and more succinct than articles spread over a myriad of pages.</dd>
<dd>You stated that the above referenced episode as an example of an expanded article. If 1.8kb (with some chunky template code) is the intended size of this set of articles, then I say they <i>all</i> need to be merged no matter how much time you're given to expand.</dd>
<dd>Finally, per the comment of my talk page, I am not making personal comments about you, I am making comments about the quality of <i><b>your work</b></i> of wikipedia. I feel that a poor choice was made in creating this and its sibling articles when a handful of articles would suffice. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 02:35, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> How can a recap episode have any encyclopedic value? It adds nothing to the anime itself, let alone here. There was no new scenes, except the "next episode" preview (which is non-nontable), just a mash up of scenes from the series, and that offers no new interpretation or suggestions of anything that hasn't been brought up from the series. If there is any, then it's original research. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadkid_dk_3237.html" title="User:Deadkid dk">_dk</a> 09:33, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

It purports to explain what qualifies one for the title. But the references cited do not even tangentially discuss the subject of the article, making no mention whatsoever of "big" as a title let alone discussing the qualifications for, awarding of, and revocation of such a title; and the explanation of why people are accorded the title is clearly the promulgation directly in Wikipedia of a novel hypothesis that is not supported by any secondary sources.

<p>This nomination <s>will become</s> is complex. <s>Please bear with me until all the articles within it are completely listed</s> The articles are now completely listed Or I think they are!). The set of articles is here for the community to form a judgement on. At the end of this some may survive and others fail. We should thus attempt to be specific about those we wish, as individual articles, to keep.</p>
<p>The article "Fertility Retreat" is being used as a starting point to try to untangle what appears to be a publicity campaign <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> notwithstanding, by the article's creator on behalf of Randine Lewis, and one or more other people or organisations. There is a web of redirects and links and other additions that the closing admin will need to address in any articles flagged for deletion by consensus at the end.</p>
<p>My nomination is that they are all advertorial or designed to enhance the notability of the advertorial of other articles. Or, to put it simply: Spam. If there is a better route than AfD for this set of nominations that woudl be useful to know <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 07:26, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>remove Fios and Novas from this afd</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have just re-read Fertility Retreat. It says: "<i>Who first coined the phrase "Fertility Retreat"? Dr. Randine Lewis of The Fertile Soul was the first individual to offer fertility retreats. When news outlets started covering Dr. Lewis' fertility-enhancing retreat program and reporting on their effectiveness, other licensed acupuncturists and herbalists starting offering their own fertility retreat programs.</i>", thus it is also a self declared neologism. This adds to the rationale for review for deletion or retention. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 08:57, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> I don't understand why entries that I've made are being labeled as 'spam.' I have knowledge of these companies that I've made entries for and strayed away from any sort of 'advertisial speak' present. In fact, for the other entries (as well as this one) I've made I modeled the format after other similar entries. I think it's unfair to label me as being some sort of "PR person" just because I made several entries in a short amount of time. Sure, label me incorrectly as being this if I were to make entries that seemed like advertisements. But I do believe the entries I've made are neutral in language and provide information for people who are interested in that company and/or person.</p>
<p>In regards to Fertility Retreats, yes, I think it stands as being something notable. I tried to stay away from bias in any regard to Randine Lewis, just because I know who she is and have knowledge that there are other people who engage in these 'fertility retreats.' If someone believes that I'm 'spamming' or having an 'advertisial tone' in my entires (which I've entirely tried to stray away from), then I would appreciate it if you were to edit the page! I've provided a couple of articles that show some credibility into what a "fertility retreat" is and how it could be a notable entry for Wikipedia.</p>
<p>My hope is that users don't just read Fiddle Faddle's comments about me/my entries and automatically assume I'm spamming. If each user could take a little bit of time, look over the entries I've created/edited, and looked for themselves how they contain NO 'advertisial speak' AND no bias and are, in fact, MODELED after other entries in similar categories (my examples being <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synplicity.html" title="Synplicity">Synplicity</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mentor_Graphics_2479.html" title="Mentor Graphics">Mentor Graphics</a>, and <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synopsys.html" title="Synopsys">Synopsys</a> for the EDA category for my entry <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novas_Software_5a32.html" title="Novas Software">Novas Software</a>, which is also being targeted for deletion just because one user thought I was trying to advertise) then I would feel confident in the fact that other users would see entries I've created as being neutral and, in fact, informative and similar to other entries in their respective categories and fields. PLEASE take a look at this entry along with the others that I've created and see that I'm not employing in any "PR efforts" or trying to advertise for said companies - I'm just creating neutral entries for companies which are modeled after similar ones. Why I'm being targeted as 'spamming' and such, I don't know.</p>
<p>And to address Fiddle Faddle's latest comment - I do believe he's picking at straws to make sure all of my entries are deleted. I don't know what I did to this user, but it seems like he/she is on some sort of 'mini-mission' to have everything I've done on here deleted. If I engaged in any sort of advertisial tone or spamming, then I could see why he/she has his/her rationale. If you have a problem with anything in any entry I've made, made note of it, edit it, whatever.--<a href="../../../a/m/p/User%7EAmplifychristian_02f8.html" title="User:Amplifychristian">Christian B</a> 17:37, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm willing to assume that you're not a PR stooge. Still, you seem like a fan, no? The articles for Lewis and fetility retreats seem very positive in tone, mentioning nothing about the skepticism Western medicine has about whether any of this actually works (see <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A13240-2004Jun28_3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A13240-2004Jun28_3.html" rel="nofollow">page 3</a> of that Post piece and other news coverage linked from her <a href="http://www.thefertilesoul.com/About_Us/Media_Coverage/news.php" class="external text" title="http://www.thefertilesoul.com/About_Us/Media_Coverage/news.php" rel="nofollow">website</a>). In any case, the community is understandably very suspicious of anything that looks like advertising. It would have been helpful if you had provided links to the press coverage initially so that others could pitch in to get the article as <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> as possible.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 20:05, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Look, we already know you're heavily invested in keeping this article alive (one of the reasons, come to that, cited in both <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> why you shouldn't write an article about yourself). But quite aside from that being mentioned in another article isn't in of itself proof of notability - <i>I</i> am, in two articles yet, and that doesn't make <i>me</i> notable - such links are found in Wikipedia all the time, and isn't a particular deterrent to the AfD process. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 11:33, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>.

<p>However, Bite Records was created by the same person behind this article, and I can find no evidence that Bite Records actually exists.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've removed the speedy deletion tag from the article, since it clearly asserts notability (e.g. the subject released records and supported Tori Amos' tour). db-bio is only applicable to articles that fail to <i>assert</i> notability, not articles about non-notable subjects. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 12:07, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I can also confirm that I saw Lee Kaay perform as back up for Tori Amos so do not understand why it was ever considered for deletion.</p>
<p>Deletion should be removed as the artiste is not a non notable artiste having toured with Tori Amos and released 5 albums. (cheekychops)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Removing "proposed deletion" tags is in no way prohibited (unlike full AfD tags); it just contests the deletion. That's why I brought it here, so we may discuss the merits of the article. The main problem is that usually Wikipedia reserves articles only for topics that already <i>have</i> some sort of recognition. --<a href="../../../h/u/o/User%7EHuon_18c0.html" title="User:Huon">Huon</a> 10:04, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well in the criteria thats needed for a band to be on wikipedia in that link above, this band meets these criteria to my knowledge: a national your of a large country, i bleieve Australia is a large country. Also one of the members, Steven Gates, is part of a notibal band caled tripod who have a wikipedia article. Has been placed in rotation on a nationly radio station triple J, the songs aren't placed as often anymore but its still there. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDead_Chook_e63b.html" title="User:Dead Chook">Dead Chook</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDead_Chook_5a8a.html" title="User talk:Dead Chook">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dead_Chook_bace.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dead Chook">contribs</a>) 10:15, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>, though I will restore the content for transwiki if a) someone who is able to read Gujarati volunteers to do the Transwiki, and b) that person is familiar with Indian copyright law, and can assert that the poem is in the public domain - the poem was obviously published before 1923, but note that <a href="../../../p/d/_/WP%7EPD_9540.html" title="WP:PD">WP:PD</a> says <i>"When a work has not been published in the U.S. but in some other country, that other country's copyright laws also must be taken into account"</i>.</p>
<p>I don't expect a quick answer to either question, and it's very easy to restore deleted content, so to leave a patently unsuitable, possibly illegal article hanging in limbo indefinitely would be absurd. People who actually do transwikis are rare enough (much rarer than the people who move for them), and I suspect that the number of those who read Gujarati is zero. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 13:22, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes. The article is in Gujarati (my mothertongue&#160;:)). But I don't think it would be a canditate for wikipedia. First of all, it is a poem. Secondly, it is not a national song of <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarat.html" title="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>. Gujarat is a state of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> and would not have a national song. Still, if translation needs to be done, I would be happy to get someone to translate it (I am not that good at it).

<dd>Well, very notable poems often have articles with interpretations, and the fact that it is an Indian song does not make it less notable; so if it has high significance for Gujarat, then it should be good enough.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 07:43, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, only the last paragraph is relevant to the analysis.

<dd>Actually, it isn't a music competition. It's basically a music variety show, which is accompanied by short interviews resembling notable chat-shows. If he has become a regular performer who appears on each DVD show as a regular cast member, then it hasn't been claimed in the article. The songs wouldn't have gotten on National media in Vietnam as <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_by_Night_9d1a.html" title="Paris by Night">Paris by Night</a> is a diaspora show which is hosted by <a href="../../../n/g/u/Nguyen_Cao_Ky_Duyen_8b88.html" title="Nguyen Cao Ky Duyen">Nguyen Cao Ky Duyen</a>, the daughter of ex South-Vietnam Prime Minister <a href="../../../n/g/u/Nguyen_Cao_Ky_9562.html" title="Nguyen Cao Ky">Nguyen Cao Ky</a>, so I wouldn't be surprised if it was censored in Vietnam.

<dd>OK, It's not stated in the actual article, but he is a regular cast member for at least a year now.

<li><b>Keep</b>, There is no advertial tone in the entry whatsoever. If you take a look at the other entries I've created (due to knowing about their company) you'll see that those entires contain no sort of advertisial language whatsoever. This deletion, along with others, is being spearheaded by one user who feels as though I'm employing in some sort of "PR Campaigns" for companies. Please, I would request that each user take a look at the entry, others that are similar to it, and vote accordingly. Don't just read the rationale for deletion and vote. I assure you there is no sort of advertising going on here. If there were, then I would understand this unfair call-out to delete all of the entries that I've made. But, as you can see in the entry, I modeled after other similar entries. This entry is only up for deletion due to me having made entries in a short amount of time.

I even modeled the format for this entry after the many others in the EDA companies category. I specifically strayed from any sort of 'advertising speak'. The only reason I see why this entry (along with others I've posted due to having knowledge of those companies) is being considered for deletion is because I made three entries in a short time span. I don't think that's neccessarily fair. Nor do I believe if you took a look at the entry itself and compared it to other entries for EDA companies, this specific one would stick out as being an 'advertisement' in the slightest. PLEASE take a look at the entry itself before labeling it as a 'spam entry' due to reading the accusation that Fiddle Faddle has written about the author of the entry.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/m/p/User%7EAmplifychristian_02f8.html" title="User:Amplifychristian">Amplifychristian</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/p/User_talk%7EAmplifychristian_4a2e.html" title="User talk:Amplifychristian">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Amplifychristian_7b29.html" title="Special:Contributions/Amplifychristian">contribs</a>).</small>

<p>Also if you type "Caveman Robot" as two words you will see over 25 pages in google!</p>
<p><b>Keep</b>~ I get asked question about Caveman Robot all the time, and thought that 11 some odd years of production of numberous comics, dolls, and a full length play, plus reviews, and write up made something noteworthy. Yes the guy from the NY times did not like the musical, but it was still written up in the New York Times with a Photo! I am happy to reformat the page to make fit better in the wikipedia format, but I think deletion is unfair. How about helpping to make it a better entry instead of deleting?- Jason</p>
<p><b>Keep</b>~ It's worth mentioning that the scathing Times review actually did more to benefit the production with extra publicity (and seriously, New Yorkers take Times reviews with a grain of salt. Look at the <a href="http://brunidigest.blogspot.com" class="external text" title="http://brunidigest.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">Bruni Digest</a>). Plus, it was accompanied by a huge color photo, while a favorable review of another production on the same page warranted only a tiny B&amp;W picture.</p>
<p>I value Wikipedia for its range of coverage from the mundane to the localized eclectic. It would be very disappointing to see the Caveman Robot entry suddenly disappear.</p>

<p><b>Keep</b>~ I just read Wikipedia's deletion policy, inscrutibly worded as it was, and don't feel that anything in this entry is in violation of its edicts. The moves to delete strike me as tastemaking, and no one wants to go down that garden path. If anything, a pan in the New York Times is actually an arguement to KEEP the page up, as a mention in the New York Times found the subject worthy on an article in their publication in the first place. The hilarious supposition instead is that, if the Times LIKED the play, this debate wouldn't exist. Please.</p>

<p><b>The history page I wrote, which I later used as the bases for the Wikipedia entry came from the history of Caveman Robot Project which was written when Shoshanna Weinberger and I applied for the trademark in 2002. Since then I have been updating the Caveman Robot entry here on Wikipedia for the last 6 months trying to get it into the righ format. Once I saw that you guys wanted to delete it, I could not very well have a direct link on the caveman robot home page going to a wiki page with all these mean sprited comments. Here is what gets me, Caveman Robot projects have been mentioned/reviewed in The New York Times (twice, once with a giant photo) , Time Out New York (with a photo), the New City paper in Chicago, the Jack Kirby Collector, Oddball comics webpage (voted the best oddball comic of 2004), Factsheet Five, NyTheater.com (a review and a podcast interview), Off-Off Broadway.com, Theatermania.com, Comicbook reasources, and on dozens of blogs. I did ask people to come onto this page a voice their thoughts, but that was I, I did not tell people what to say. I read Wikipedia all the time and have actually added a few edits here and there, but there a many people out there that don't understand how to use your formating and this has keep them away from making entries.</b> It is not just a series of comics (The 2 most recent ones having been national distrubuted), but is was a real Off-Off Broadway musical that had a six week run, and a live performace at the Knitting Factory, Deitch Projects, Participant Inc. in New York, and Quimby's in Chicago. On top of all this a Caveman Robot sculpture has been on display at Quimby's for Ten years and is considered a mascot of the store. I think many of your editors are looking at this entry as a comic or a musical, it is not that it is a vast art project that has been created by dozens of artist,performers, musican, and fans. So you take this off if it means do much to you, really I don't understand you people.- Jason</p>

If I contributed to every forum I browsed on a daily basis, I'd have no life. Any entries I've considered adding to seem to have been already covered. That said, if anyone wants to breathe new life into the "musical" genre, it's beneficial to leave this entry, since interest in the traditional Broadway musical is currently very low among those of my generation. I can disclose I've been a resident of this neighborhood for 10 years, and have seen many bands, artists, shows from this immediate area go on to the mainstream. I can also say I've seen some of his work on display at local galleries, and it is on par with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Keene" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Keene" rel="nofollow">Steve Keene</a>, (who lives down the street from me). Call me a trendwatcher, but it's the truth. I'd imagine an orginization such as Wikipedia would also want to stay on top of the trends. It may not be the Archdiocese of Cheyenne or a tiny Canadian aiport, but don't dismiss the relevance of underground pop culture.</p>
<p><b>KEEP</b> I've picked up the Caveman Robot comic books at the last couple years at the San Diego comic con, and look forward to doing so this year. They are a lot better than a lot of the crap that is on comic store shelves now. I check out the Caveman Robot blog pretty frequently, and was shocked to see news of the possible deletion of the entry. Sure, a lot of people may have never heard of the character, but is that any reason to kill the entry. Isn't Wikipedia about spreading knowledge? Censoring information and excluding content based on taste works against this endeavor. Caveman Robot exists. Keep the entry, just edit it a little to meet Wikipedia style standards a bit better. - U.S. Ape</p>

<p><b>KEEP!</b> Caveman Robot is a true DIY phenomenon, a genuine example of the homegrown culture that can emerge from the “village media” model of locally rooted yet nationally significant creativity that the web has made possible. Wikipedia itself is a fine forum for “online communities” in the knowledge-seeking, non-cynical sense of the term, so a catchy yet essentially uncommercial enterprise like Caveman Robot is essential material for your archives. For any non-corporate, indie effort to crack the cultural radar of official history records like the Times, favorably or otherwise, is a sign of its importance. And though “Caveman Robot” may call up many google hits, the quality and consolidation of information Wikipedia offers is what makes the online experience meaningful and useful to begin with, amidst the same cultural din that Caveman Robot has had the quality and vision to rise above.172.128.41.151 03:30, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> - Caveman Robot has been supplying comedic and philosophical substance to art galleries in NYC, Philadelphia and Chicago. It has evolved from an individual artist's vision to that of a collection of artists who express their own views and styles through the character in different mediums ranging from painting and sculpture, comic books, graphic novels, music, costume and theatre! To me the deletion of an entire art community's collective dream is horrific, and I cannot understand what would motivate WikiPedia to remove it. If this happens, it will cause me to seriously reconsider the esteem with which I hold WikiPedia in conversations with others, my blogs and in my own personal use.</p>

<p>The term was first introduced in the peer-reviewed paper by L. Evans "Human behavior feedback and traffic safety." Human Factors 27: 555-576; 1985. This is a much-cited paper in the professional traffic safety literature. The effect is discussed in the 1991 book by Evans "Traffic Safety and the Driver". Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York, 1991. (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0442001630</a>) and more briefly in the same author's 2004 book "Traffic Safety (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0975487108</a>). More briefly because the whole point about science is that more data and understanding settles once-controversial issues. Nearly all of the many citations are from the paper-only era not available for internet searching.</p>
<p>The main article on "Traffic Safety" has three suggestions for further reading. One of the three "Death on the Streets: Cars and the mythology of road safety" is nothing more than a political tract. The book is owned by 11 US libraries listed in Library World Cat (<a href="http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/open/default.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/open/default.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/open/default.htm</a>), compared to 158 and 133 for the two Evans books mentioned above. It has just one Appendix -- a long one denouncing Evans as a spokesman for the safety establishment. Although I deny the charge -- surely an encyclopedia is supposed to convey the current state of main-stream knowledge.</p>
<p>I suggest that this item provides some modest counterbalance to the host of unfounded claims and explanations claimed effects (rejected by the traffic safety profession). Deleting this and everything now relating to traffic safety and starting again might make more sense than deleting just this one item.</p>
<p>My own articles in Encyclopedia Britannica, American Scientist and the like provide a reasonable summary of what science has taught us about the subject. What is now in Wikopedia is the stuff of First Amendment Rights (which I support vigorously), but it has no place in an encyclopedia. Leonard Evans Levanszzzz 23:55, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Neutral</b> I am neutral on whether or not this article should be deleted. But, I think I object to criteria on which the game's popularity/relevance is being based. A forum cannot reveal that much about the game's historical popularity. It is a MUD; most of its users will exist on the MUD itself, not on the forum. I visited the forum of another MUD on Wikipedia having just 75 members, but the MUD itself was famous. Moreover, how do you propose to judge the MUD's historical popularity based on its current popularity? I doubt many people play the Atari 2600 now, but Wikipedia has quite a few articles based on it and its games. Those games qualify based on the fact that they were popular at one point in their history. Those articles cannot be judged on the current popularity of their subjects, so upon which factors do decide that it is alright to base the judgement of this article on the game's current popularity? - wyrlum 18:39, 13 July 2006</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I should clarify - the article's creator <i>did not</i> remove either prod or CSD tag from the article itself.

<dd>On <i>Old Belarusian'</i> in main article <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanian_Metrica_9ad2.html" title="Lithuanian Metrica">Lithuanian Metrica</a> it is mentioned, that it was written in Ruthenian.

<li><b>Merge</b>. Lithuanian Metrica - not original, but the conditional name of a complex of documents. However this name is standard. "Ruthenian language" - not language, and the conditional general name of slavic languages in territory Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Ruthenian = Old Belarussian + Old Ukrainian. Lithuanian Metrica it is written basically Old Belarussian language, later Polish language.

<dd>Firstly I want to ask you – do you think name Lithuanian Metrica is bad for article or maybe you have other solutions?</dd>
<dd>I see you touched Volynian (Luck), but I feel duty to expand and a bit and adjust your comments. It is linguistically proven (Ch. Stang; Z.Zinkevičius; etc.) that Ruthenian lang. used in chancellery of Grand Duchy of Lithuania was dominated by Volynian until mid XVI century ( some linguist say that Volynian dominated until end of XVIc.). This conclusion was drown after analysis of Ruthenian documents issued by Grand Duchy of Lithuania chancellery. Second decisive moment is that when central dialect of present-day Belarus territory (roughly) was used – chancellery and spoken languages remain with notable differences; so it should be also clear division between chancellery and spoken languages – so it is another issue why terms with “old” can’t be applied without tremendous exceptions when talking about chancellery issues. <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 14:48, 13 July 2006 (UTC) p.s. when talking about languages of metrica don’t exclude Latin (German as minor).

<dd>1. Lithuanian Metrica - the standard conditional name (already it is above written by me). This name is necessary for using in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>2. "<i>… until mid XVI century … - … until end of XVI century.</i>" - a mistake. Correctly - "<i>until mid <b>XV</b> century - until end of <b>XV</b> century</i>". It speaks that Vitaut's Office was completed with the personnel on Volhynia in 1380-s years, and has then moved together with it to Vilnia. The Volynsk language influence was limited to the period of a life of the Volynsk personnel.
<dl>
<dd>Actually there <b>is no mistake at all</b>&#160;! I check and double check these conclusions and there are confirmed in other sources (“Definition problem of Slavic chancellery language in Grand Duchy of Lithuania”; “Inaccuracies of History approach” {my translations}; etc. etc. etc.). And all have <b>point of XVI</b> century as key moment. And analysis <b>was not only</b> Vytautas chancellery but much broader.</dd>

<dd>3. Old Belarussian and Old Ukrainian - not colloquial languages, but literary languages. Spoken languages were not used in office-work MDL. However, spoken languages influenced on literary - it distinctions between Old Belarussian and Old Ukrainian. Old Belarussian speak and Old Ukrainian were generated on the basis of Ruthenian language under influence of local dialects. Therefore in clause instead of "Latin, Ruthenian, Polish and German languages" it is necessary to write "Old Belarussian, Polish, Old Ukrainian, Latin and German languages".
<dl>
<dd>Here you confusing something, but not going to details - contemporary and scientific term Ruthenian taking into account all these “Old” with most care, so I convinced that chancellery issues should have Ruthenian definition.<a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 12:57, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>&lt;sigh&gt; Dear (Lithuanian) collegues. Some time ago, I'd noticed a dangling link to Metryka in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarusian_language.html" title="Belarusian language">Belarusian language</a> and reasoned that there's no article if the link remained empty for so long. So I'd made a stub with the info most pertinent to the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarusian_language.html" title="Belarusian language">Belarusian language</a>. I hadn't receive any notification from anybody that there is already a similar article. Maintainers stamped the article with categories etc. Then, out of the blue, this request for deletion happens. Frankly, I don't quite understand your problem.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I did stamp it with categories because you forgot to do it (it's for a more convenient way to find it). After that it was dicovered and proved, that it is a redundant dublicate.--<a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokyz_fe40.html" title="User:Lokyz">Lokyz</a> 08:11, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The article on <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanian_Metrica_9ad2.html" title="Lithuanian Metrica">Lithuanian Metrica</a> you are pointing me to, is, in all truth, just another stub. Decorated with secondary issues and portrait, I'll give you that. About 80% of the volume is dedicated to the geographical moving of the books. However, the article somehow manages not to mention the important (and confirmed) fact of the prevailing languages of the issued documents, the several previous publications influencing the contemporary historiography etc. The fact that "L.M." isn't even a name, but a conventional denotation, isn't mentioned.</li>
</ol>

<dd>Oh please! With your “criticism” - “About 80% of the volume is dedicated to the geographical moving of the books” just shows that you do not ready any articles about Metrica history, don’t you? Actually the scholars who wrote publications sometimes even divide Metrica history by it`s geographical location. You also making the mistake - <i>fact of the prevailing languages of the issued documents</i> - don’t you ever mixup archive of Metrica documents and issued documents as such. It is quite different things.</dd>
<dd>Metrica – is not a controversial name (even the Byelorussian scholars who worked (now not working due to lack of resources (finance and material) AFAIK) on international project “Lithuanian Metrica” agreed on this name), the true distortion and fantasy is name Myetrika of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia and Samogitia (if you tried to imitated the contemporary name – you badly failed)<a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 12:01, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The research is already done by professionals and we have their publications. Google is the tool of search. This means that with help of google we can see the spread of term in internet, books and this means that we have the greater chances that average user would be familiar with one or another term/word so in this order they could faster found this article in wiki.

<dd>Well, I don't yet know how to do it, procedurally, but I'm going to request the renaming of the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanian_Metrica_9ad2.html" title="Lithuanian Metrica">Lithuanian Metrica</a> as a misleading and informal. Any kind of word metrika in the main name (my version included) is misleading, actually. Metrika or whatever isn't even a word, it is just a very local convention only historian would recognise. The appropriate name would be smth. like <b>Archive of the G.D.L.R.S.</b> with various metrika* entries serving as a redirs into it. ---<a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">Yury Tarasievich</a> 09:36, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

So we have several possibilities – <a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">user:Yury Tarasievich</a> <b>lied</b> to as then he said that he used academic sources or <b>deliberately ignored</b> the facts or <b>deliberately chosen to mislead</b> reader.

<dd>Please, <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a>, credit me with some intelligence and knowledge of English. The text of the disputed stub is verbatim translation of the lead etc. But any rendering of "metrika" in name is, in fact, misleading for English reader, as it represents un-scientific, although conventional among specialists, name, which means nothing for non-historian and is not guessed easily from Polish or Cyrillic rendering. Just see how I missed when searching WP before creating the stub.</dd>
<dd>BTW, googling on Metrica <b>without</b> wikipedia yields at least 5 pages of Lithuanian-originating sources with 2 or 3 non-Lithuanian authors. So much for the established name. And I've seen the Lithuanian name is "metrika". Why the difference then?</dd>

<dd>Yury&#160;! You perfectly know that I can’t credit you intelligence, wisdom - these are goals of lifetime. I suggested you only to take more care that other editors are saying and asking; I also suggested to take a look in English sources how they formulating definitions. And now I also suggest you to relax a bit&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>About Metrica – are you sure that it is “un-scientific”? About “only historians would recognize” I asked for few people to provide history schoolbooks to me and you know these books talk about Metrica (of course in appropriate tongue).</dd>
<dd>About number of google sources in first page I counted “a bit” more then 2-3 sources of non-Lithuanian authors, while Myetrika none at all. Also you can see some of them of in English academic (academic +-) sources page. Why not “Metrika” there is several key points why is “Metrica” picked up one of them - see published metrica books of English part….<a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 12:57, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, when I tell you that googling <b>without</b> the word wikipedia yields 5 pages of Lithuanian-originating sources with 2 or 3 English or German, you may just dismiss that.&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>Like I've said before, the creation of Myetryka* was not the best move on my part and was conditioned only by not finding anything under the L. metryka or L. metrika. Creating the Archive* (understandably, now it would be created as a redir) would be much better for the common reader.</dd>
<dd>I know what I've seen, however (and I've saved all of the non-Lithuanian refs -- precisely for such occasion).</dd>
<dd>Yes, the decision on Metrica with native Metrika still seems strange to me. After all, this isn't translation (Archive is). Also, I don't know what the "appropriate tongue" would mean in such context.</dd>
<dd>The concept of "L.M." naming itself being un-scientifical isn't mine, it's moved by the researcher Halyenchanka in his ~5000 words encyclopedic article on L.M.</dd>
<dd>I've added the entry on the naming of the Old Belarusian preferred by Lithuanian researches. Let's have some names and refs there. ---<a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">Yury Tarasievich</a> 15:59, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, the sweet smell of victory.&#160;:) But this is very very marginal issue, after all. Re-read -- did I want to keep this at all cost? Nope. Why should I, in such an obvious situation?

However, you, obviously, still do not see any problem there. Okay. We all know what's really going on here. Big news. The "WP not playground" works all ways.

<li><b>Comment</b>: that's a reasonable opinion. However, I would like to point out that WP:PORN BIO is only a proposed guideline. Also, I think that it is unreasonably strict compared to the treatment that non-adult actors get on AfD.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I see your point. However, the question is, when it comes down to it, "Why should she have an article when all the other porn actresses who fail WP:PORN BIO don't?".

<p>This article satisfies those conditions for exclusion from the WWIN list. The PlayNOW! article described:</p>

<p>If we could just get past the pettyness of certain members who continue to vandalise valuable contributions to the project, there is much history to be added. I am somewhat new to this whole Wikipedia article writing thing, but it's fairly obvious to me that something needs to be done about the person who keeps deleting whole swathes of information, and replaces it with somewhat incoherent ramble.</p>
<p>The history of the site pre-hackings needs to be expanded somewhat, including describing just how large a portal it was for the Australian gaming community, and the sorts of competitions it ran, etc. We do not wish this site to be lost to the annals of time in such a poor fashion.</p>
<p>Certainly, it may not be notable at all to foreigners, but proposing that it be deleted purely because "nobody cares" is a bit rich. Who cares about a lot of the stuff that Wikipedia has in it?

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think these planets deserve a place in the wikipedia universe since they seem to be an important aspect of the power rangers oeuvre, although my statement might be based on pure speculation and mere opinion. In that sense, I would be on an equal footing with our nom, who brings no argument to the floor, but does state authoritatively that the articles present "<i>excessive fictional detail of interest to an extremely circumscribed minority of even the fans of the show</i>". I wonder what source the nom uses to support that statement of "fact"? Has the nom surveyed, polled or undertaken research among wikipedia users or even "fans of the show"? Or is the statement based solely on arbitrary guesswork, idle conjecture and perhaps a morbid fear of power ranger planets? The level of "fictional detail" here may be "excessive", but I would rather err on the side of some fictional detail, as opposed to no fictional detail. Lastly, I would also ask that the nom avoid attacking contributors through the use of non-words such as "cruft". --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 17:05, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>People keep asserting that such a consensus exists, but so far nobody has pointed me to any policy page that says any such thing.

<li><b>Comment</b>:Part of the problem is that, while there isn't a consensus to speak of, there <i>is</i> precedent, because handfuls of high schools have survived AfDs with votes of "(Precedent says) all high schools are inherently notable". Indeed, some people are of the opinion that any and all high schools are <i>on their own merits</i> notable, which I find sketchy, but I'm willing to live and let live if someone's willing to take the time to write an article about it. While there isn't an official consensus, Wikipedia has been acting as if there were an "unspoken consensus" for a while now. - <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_65d1.html" title="User:CheNuevara"><font color="darkblue">Che Nuevara:</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../c/h/e/User_talk%7ECheNuevara_5bc9.html" title="User talk:CheNuevara"><font color="red">Join</font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="darkgreen">the</font></a> <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_navbar_e72b.html" title="User:CheNuevara/navbar"><font color="orange">Revolution</font></a></sup> 20:18, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Since I became involved in 2003, it has been frequently asserted that "high schools are always kept" and therefore there's a de facto precedent. Back in 2004, I wondered whether this was true, so I spent some time tracking high school VfDs and the actual results can be found at <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_HS_e67d.html" title="WP:VFD/HS">WP:VFD/HS</a>. It was not even close to true. I don't mind disagreement about high schools, but I do mind misrepresentations by people attempting "proof by repeated assertion" of each others' inaccurate statements of nonexistent policy, nonexistence consensus, and nonexistent precedent.

Contact notability is suspicious as best - being the spouse of a notable person does not automatically provide notability, and that relationship is a lot more significant (and usually longer lasting) than attendance at a school - so even if the graduates were notable that would not necessarily make the school notable. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:57, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia is an encyclopedia but it is different from many other encyclopedia. If we maintain that a High School is not notable because it is a High School, then the same should be said of a great many articles from certain TV programmes etc. Perhaps we should just leave these articles be, as they do not cause harm, they share information which may well be relevant to educational researchers, local communities and other persons not yet known. It would certainly be interesting for me to see pages on all the High Schools in Coventry, England and know that wikipedia was such a useful repository. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidkinnen_8d64.html" title="User:Davidkinnen">Davidkinnen</a> 16:45, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per basically all above, and because me, friends, and teachers have written a relatively long article on our high school that took a lot of work, and I don't want to see all these articles of high schools get deleted. They are valuable articles. Another reason to keep high school articles is that they act as gateways from their students to Wikipedia. When students find out that their school is on this big, free, editable encyclopedia, they edit it. Point taken, some of this is vandalism and not notable stuff, but they really are gateways that can bring in valuable contributors. There really isn't any reason to delete this. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappa.jake_9f3e.html" title="User:Zappa.jake">zappa.jak</a><a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappa.jake_templates_esperanza_8fd0.html" title="User:Zappa.jake/templates/esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a> (<a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappa.jake_141a.html" title="User talk:Zappa.jake">talk</a>) 18:48, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

It was only a stub before - no sentences, no pictures, no references etc. I'm glad the nomination spurred you into make something of your page but you could have accomplished the same objective without spamming and ugliness. Pages that have been nominated before, which the creator and/or others support and want to keep, have been kept on the basis of the statement of that wish and a promise of a good faith effort to improve the page, without the unsavory use of spamming and making an ugly issue out of a mere nomination. You could have done the same. I have already indicated I will never ever touch a high school page again for any reason.

<p>Maybe it isn't notable, but does that mean it's worthless information? Maybe you think so, and that's respectable, but does that mean that as soon as someone finds it pointless it should be gone? There is an article for a hypothetical flag, but there's a problem with an existing zip code? All of the information here is fact--no opinion, no hypotheticals, and no vulgarity. Who does this article harm by existing? And by those same respects, why can't this be expanded in the future to have a history or geography so that it may spark someone's interest? I've seen stranger things become hobbies in the past. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMercer5089_6401.html" title="User:Mercer5089">Mercer5089</a> 16:28, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>&gt;Response</b> Likewise, there is a list of all the countries in the world, and yet each one has an individual article. Once again, why can't this be expanded in the future to have a history or geography so that it may spark someone's interest? I'm sorry if this article is harming someone, but I see this kind of article as the reason it is so important to have a user-built encyclopedia. Now, if this was an article on "123 Main Street, Fairbanks, Alaska, 99702" and had the text "John Brown lives here, who is 47 years old and likes to collect string," I would find that to be "not notable," as this is coverable under one's profile. But for this, I just can't accept the problem presented. I understand it, and I respect the motives, but I simply disagree. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMercer5089_6401.html" title="User:Mercer5089">Mercer5089</a> 16:57, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Define "notable." I don't want to get into a symantic game, but why delete it? What harm does it bring? Nobody has answered that question yet except to say "it's not notable." If I decide that the article on "rock paper scissors" or the "51 star flag" are not notable, how do I know if I'm right or not? How is this not notable? And then defend that by telling me what is. What is so scary about an article on "99775?" Are we afraid that what may follow is an article on (god help us all) an area code? What motivation is there to delete this other than to say "not notable?" I for one am not afraid of experimenting with knowledge and expanding its availability to those who's interests are less than known or popular. Don't tell me this isn't an issue about not wanting to expand knowledge, either, because as far as I can tell, there is no real reason to do this other than to say it was done and add another notch to the ol' wiki merit badge belt. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMercer5089_6401.html" title="User:Mercer5089">Mercer5089</a> 17:47, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>But you provide no substance - <s>DON'T DELETE</s></b> I understand that there is already a page for zip codes, but that page is a LIST, not a detail. And yes, there are links to the City of Fairbanks, but 99775 does not cover the city at all (UAF is outside the city), and yes, there is also one for UAF, but the one for UAF does not talk about the zip code. And why should it?? I don't think it should. It's not repetative because it provides informatino (and will provide more information in the future) that isn't centralized around this topic anywhere else, nor is it covered in the articles on Fairbanks of UAF. I think that a zip code can be valuable and can be expanded on with further research. Nobody gave this article any time to develop, not even from its author, before it was flagged. Zip codes are different from the cities and counties they overlay, just as area codes are different. Demographic information is important in this world--everybody wants to know how many people are where and how big the largest xyz is (or small) compared to another. Stop avoiding the question of who this hurts; or at least think about the fact that your interests don't reflect those of everyone else. You can not say with any certainty (or without lying) that nobody is going to take an interest in the possibilities this page could have. All you can say is "delete, not notable" or "delete, repetative" or "delete, jibberish." But nobody has defined notable, I've shown it's not repetative, and there are people who will take an interest. What fun is a user-based encyclopedia if Johnny Brown-Shirt is going to decide for everyone whether their information and their want to spread information regarding diverse interests is correct or not? This article does not express an opinion, it is not political, it is not profane, and it deals with a real subject that has tangible information associated with it. It's a tool for demographics and for geography, as well as a tool for those of us who are interested in the abstract. I'm sorry this article isn't about cartoon characters or star trek or fellatio or call centers, but I find each of those just as pointless as you find 99775. <b>and in terms of there being nothing special about it</b> there are pleanty of things that are the same way...look at the 2 line descriptions of cartoon characters from Doom. I could consider those just as not special as you consider 99775. I apologize for forgetting encyclopedias were not for information, and that wikipedia doesn't want to grow, by the way. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMercer5089_6401.html" title="User:Mercer5089">Mercer5089</a> 19:09, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Don't Delete</b></s> "90210" doesn't have an article because one hasn't been written yet. There were no articles on the Civil War, small pox, Australia, or the Beatles until one was written. The only one of you that makes sense is the special contribution to merge the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> I understand your point, <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMercer5089_6401.html" title="User:Mercer5089">Mercer5089</a>, but keeping this article would set a precedent in which all U.S. and international zip codes would get a wikipedia article. The vast majority of these articles won't have any information other than what's already in the article on the city/town, so there's no reason to go through the trouble. The only reason I could see this being useful is if you want to include the location of zip code borders in wikipedia, and this could be added to the article on the city in question. <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmazinglarry_1a7d.html" title="User:Amazinglarry">Amazinglarry</a> 20:46, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Don't Delete</b></s> What would go in these articles are demographics. It is possible to have the number of men, women, structures, and the borders of these areas. I don't care how many dog's bark all the damn time (nor do I care abour Doom, Ladybugs, or the ionosphere, but they all have articles too). This is information on the political divisions of the postal system and the demographics within them. And yes, it does set a precedence that zip codes get a page, but so what? Are you forced to go through every one before you can surf Wikipedia? I'm not. The irrelevant articles that <i>I</i> consider crap are still up there, but I really don't mind, because I ignore them. But all that aside, there IS information that can go there that doesn't have to do with drugs and dogs, and that I'm certain you can just forget it exists if you don't want to read it.<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMercer5089_6401.html" title="User:Mercer5089">Mercer5089</a> 16:53, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Don't Delete</b></s> It's not that it's so important. In fact, it's really not. The point is that it's not not important. Why is it so terrible to have an article on 99775? Yes, it opens the door for other zip codes, but why is that a problem either? This is so stupid, and all I wanted to do was expand the reaches of Wikipedia. Why do you all care so much if you'll never read this anyway?? What's the problem? Does this set the precedence that from now on whenever I find an article that doesn't interest me, I can flag it for deletion? Come on, guys, it's a stupid article to begin with, but that doesn't diminish the fact that it DOES provide information and that it has POTENTIAL to provide MORE information. Yeah, yeah, you see my point and you don't care. That's great. I see your point too and I don't care. But for whatever reason that doesn't seem to matter. What should matter is that Wikipedia is expanding and that I'm trying to help.

<li><b>Comment</b> Demographic and political makeup of a neighborhood, if needed, can be added to the article for the city it's in. Congressional districts already have their own articles, and for the most part, individual city wards do not warrant their own encyclopedia articles. Wikipedia is not the Chamber of Commerce. This is a three sentence article that has seen no improvement since the AfD began. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 13:43, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> But they aren't demographics of a neighborhood, since more than one neighborhood can be in a zip code. In addition, why is there allowed a page for every congressional district, but not every zip code (Other than this ludacrist excuse that there are 100,000 zip codes [which there aren't])? Political divisions (not Democrat and Republican, political as in a political map) are important to people for both research and interst. You're right, Wiki is not a CoC, but it's also not the George Washington Museum nor is it the Star Trek Fan Club, but that doesn't discredit the information being put on pages relating to either of those. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMercer5089_6401.html" title="User:Mercer5089">Mercer5089</a> 15:53, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Comment</b> I still don't think it's a good idea to have an article on every zip code, mainly because the information Mercer has mentioned (demographics, etc) mostly echoes what's already on city pages. But there actually is some precedent for having zip code articles on wikipedia - there are articles on all of the area codes in the U.S. The ones I looked at don't have much information on them except the current borders and history of how various area codes have been divided up over time, though. Would this precedent change anyone's votes? <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmazinglarry_1a7d.html" title="User:Amazinglarry">Amazinglarry</a> 15:41, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> Granted, it seems a little ludacrist to have an article for every zip code. But if that is true, why was there allowed the precedence that every number gets a page (ref: <a href="../../../1/_/_/1.html" title="1">1</a>, <a href="../../../2/_/_/2.html" title="2">2</a>, <a href="../../../3/_/_/3.html" title="3">3</a>...)? And you are correct, there is an article for each area code...even though the same arguments against a zip code page could be applied just as equally. If this is deleted, would you object to me campaigning for the area codes and the numbers to be deleted as well? Just as there is history in numbers and in area codes, and there is history in zip codes as well. Speaking of history, if every year gets a page, and the precedence has been set that a hypothetical <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_51-star_flag_de0a.html" title="United States 51-star flag">United States 51-star flag</a> gets a page, then aren't there a hypothetically infinite number of years that page could be created for? You're right, precedence is dangerous! Don't call them different...you're worried about precedence that allows 100,000 new pages and you're worried that the same info can be attached elsewhere. Numbers and years allow an infinite number of pages, and area codes could also be attached elsewhere. If you want to argue the slippery slope, then it's all or nothing, I guess. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMercer5089_6401.html" title="User:Mercer5089">Mercer5089</a> 03:17, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Not every individual number has its own page - guidelines for which numbers can have them are at <a href="../../../n/u/m/WP%7ENUM_2602.html" title="WP:NUM">WP:NUM</a> and <a href="../../../1/7/2/WP%7E1729_2c21.html" title="WP:1729">WP:1729</a>. Note that 90210 does _not_ pass these guidelines as a _number_. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 11:05, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> You are correct that there are guidelines, but those guidelines still allow a hypothetically infinite number of pages to be allowed, since an infinite number of 0s can be added to the end of any number. At the very least, zip codes are finite. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMercer5089_6401.html" title="User:Mercer5089">Mercer5089</a> 12:26, 13 July 2006 (CDT)
<ul>
<li><b>In addition</b> My I draw your attention to the existance of pages on highways. Since highways are contained entirely within cities, counties, or states, it would be correct through the above complaints about "99775" to say that these should be covered in their respective municipalities? In addition, why is there no fear that these highway pages will also create a large number of pages? <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMercer5089_6401.html" title="User:Mercer5089">Mercer5089</a> 03:23, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Basically the reason I've put it up for deletion is that under "Wiki is not a Soapbox" it states...</p>
<pre>
 3. Advertising. Articles about companies and products are acceptable if they are written in an objective and 
 unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small 
 "garage" <b>or local companies are not likely to be acceptable.</b> External links to commercial organizations 
 are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for 
 an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs. 
 See also WP:CORP for a proposal on corporate notability.
</pre>
<p>To my knowledge this article falls into being about a local company.</p>

<li>My name is Marcello Aprea (m.aprea@tiscali.it), I am consultant for Document Solutions, an Italian Company and I am a teacher of Computer Science in Italian High School. I added the voice for DS EXPLOit. I work on DS EXPLOit, and you could see a Running Demo on the link <a href="http://www.documentsolutions.it/versioneitaliana/demo.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.documentsolutions.it/versioneitaliana/demo.htm" rel="nofollow"><i><b>"http://www.documentsolutions.it/versioneitaliana/demo.htm"</b></i></a>. From the Demo you can deduce that DS EXPLOit is a true and genuine Content Management System. Please inspect the Running Demo, and after make sentencies. Do you want same my references on the Internet? So don't delete DS EXPLOit, delete EXPLOit that has same synonyms on Wikipedia.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Please note this is not a discussion about whether the software functions, or that it exists, and particularly it's not about you or your qualifications. How about you address the stated issues of the notability (see proposed guidelines at <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>) of the product, and try rewrite this so it's not an advertisement. Thanks. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 09:33, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>What I wrote is similar to what is written for other CMS (Content management System) products. I don't understand why others CMS products are listed into the list of CMS products, and each of them has an article as mine (DS EXPLOit)(Marcello Aprea)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> the straight application of policies here is effective 99% of the time, but that does not mean that users can't take into account certain <i>equitable considerations</i>.

<li><i>"benefiting from the recent success of its handheld Touch Screen Sudoku"</i> - <b>dubious</b>. Backed up by a guide from a website for the elderly which mentions the product, but says that is "creating a lot of excitement". To me "success" equals "profit", not "excitement". There was excitement about the Titanic.</li>
<li><i>"nominated for Toy of the Year in 2005"</i> - <b>verified</b>, but not much of an assertion of notability. According to the awarding body's official site, <i>"Representatives from any toy manufacturer or toy-related company are eligible to nominate products and/or companies for award categories defined in the T.O.T.Y. Awards Program Guidelines. TIA members may submit nominations free of charge."</i> <i><a href="http://www.toy-tia.org/content/navigationmenu/toy_industry_association/toty/Award_Guidelines/Award_Guidelines.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.toy-tia.org/content/navigationmenu/toy_industry_association/toty/Award_Guidelines/Award_Guidelines.htm" rel="nofollow">[41]</a></i></li>

<li><b>Response to</b> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a>: I looked into the award guidelines on the TIA (awarding body) site and it is a multi-stage process. From mid-September to the end of October in 2005, any toy company could write in a nomination for a product they believe deserves one of the 11 Toy of the Year awards. The TIA reviews all of the written nominations, tabulates them, and culls down the list to 5 nominees in each category. The TIA sends out this paper ballot to all TIA members who vote for the winner in each category. The winners were announced in February 2006. See the following site for reference:<br /></li>

<li><i>"featured in the celebrity 'swag' given out at the 12th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards"</i> - <b>verified</b>. Nice bit of trivia.</li>
<li><i>"one of the pioneers responsible for the rise of the 'retro gaming' market"</i> - <b>not verified</b>. The "source" is the interview with the Executive VP, and you can probably interpret his remarks as saying that... but we can't rely on one of the company directors for such of a claim.</li>
<li>Same claim as 4.</li>
<li><i>"with... the Intellivision 10, Techno Source sold over 1,000,000 units"</i>. <b>Questionable</b>. Sourced <a href="http://www.intellivisionlives.com/media/newsletters/news041101.html" class="external text" title="http://www.intellivisionlives.com/media/newsletters/news041101.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.intellivisionlives.com/retrotopia/direct2tv.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.intellivisionlives.com/retrotopia/direct2tv.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The former reports that a spokesman for the company claimed they sold 1m units - well, he's probably not lying, but he's not impartial, and the key is verifiability, not truth. There are a lot of ways to generate a million sales, and getting a million people to pay you full price to own your product is only the most obvious one. The latter, from the same website, repeats the 1,000,000 figure as fact, without attribution to the spokesman. Maybe that means they've checked and it's true, or maybe they just left the source out that time. As I said, questionable.</li>
<li><i>"and received the National Parenting Center Seal of Approval in 2004"</i>. <b>Verified</b> by the sources above. Ok, so it works.</li>
<li><i>"Techno Source has sold more Intellivision games today than Mattel Electronics originally sold in the 1980s".</i> <b>Verified</b>, probably. Sourced to <a href="http://www.thelogbook.com/zine/?cat=3" class="external text" title="http://www.thelogbook.com/zine/?cat=3" rel="nofollow">thelogbook.com</a>, who attribute it to <i>"the original programmers of the classic Intellivision video games"</i>, so no reason to doubt this. But how much can that be, really?</li>
<li><i>"Dr. Toy named Techno Source to its list of 100 Best Products for this assortment in 2005"</i>. <b>Verified</b>... but 100 every year is a lot of toys. Most of the companies on the list are probably not notable.</li>
<li><i>"The company has also grown through the success of its handheld Sudoku and other puzzle games"</i> - <b>not verified</b>, it's the About.com site again, which says that Techno Source sell handheld Sudoku, but nothing about 'other puzzle games', or that it's part of their growth.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>After all that, I'm still leaning towards a <s>weak keep</s> <small><i>(see below)</i></small>, as the amount of third-party coverage means the company is probably worth an article, there just don't seem to be strong concrete claims to being a particularly high-growth company (of which there are an awful lot in the technology sector with less ambiguous claims to fame). The claims of growth and suchlike are ephemeral - if I saw even a modest sourced turnover or profit growth figure, I'd be much happier than with a hundred more websites - and it's somewhat dubious how much of an achievement the other claims are. There just needs to be a more rigorous approach to sourcing in the article, being more cautious about the claims to notability if necessary. I do urge editors to check the quality, not just quantity, of sources when they support keeping on that basis.</li>
<li>And I guess selling 1,000,000 creaky old games is probably an achievement, even if the accountant in me is demanding "for how much? did they need to sell at a discount to move that many? did they cover overheads?" etc - after all, if it turns out they were selling them for peanuts and go bankrupt, we still cover notable failures. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:56, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think you are trivializing this award expecially since Techno Source is not even a member of the TIA. The fact that Techno Source was nominated even though they are not a member seems to at least partially counter your point.

The second test is inclusion of the company on ranking indices by well-known and independent publications - I don't see that in the citations of the article or in the evidence here. The first test is "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself". "Been the subject of "means that the article, or a large fraction of it, needs to be primarily about the company. Coverage of products does not meet the standard. I find no coverage that meets this test. The artcile also reads like advertising copy. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 16:49, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Please also take another look at the article. I have added several more sources that show Techno Source winning several awards for their educational products in preschool as well as entertainment products for older consumers. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay_23_a5ad.html" title="User:Jay 23">Jay 23</a> 19:02, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I said in my comment immediately before the request, the test is not whether there is coverage of the products (that would be relevant for an article on a specific product), it is whether there are multiple works about the company. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 20:49, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> This seems like a very difficult standard to attain for a private company because the very things that would make a company notable, such as sales volume, are the very things that are not publicly reported. In terms of notability, several sources I have cited state that Techno Source was one of the pioneers in the retro gaming market in 2003 when they partnered with Intellivision. Additionally, are not some companies defined by their products? In this case, award-winning products that have been well-received and written about by various publications for their entertainment and educational value should prove a degree of notability for the company that produces them.<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay_23_a5ad.html" title="User:Jay 23">Jay 23</a> 14:37, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Since a couple of people have suggested merging, I just wanted to clarify that the reason I said "do not merge" is that it doesn't seem to me that the license plate number of some car in a movie necessarily merits even a brief mention in an encyclopedia, unless that particular license plate number was significant to the plot in some way or is a focus of media or popular attention. Lots of movies have cars with license plate numbers, but that doesn't mean we need to include this information in the respective articles. (Of course, maybe this particular license plate number <i>is</i> a focus of media or popular attention and I'm just not aware of it, but a Google search didn't seem to indicate that.) —<a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaesura_ad40.html" title="User:Caesura">Caesura</a><a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaesura_b24c.html" title="User talk:Caesura"><sup>(t)</sup></a> 18:26, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>To all, I suppose this information doesn't warrant WP:CORP as much as it was going to cover the pioneering and business practices of Outdoor Wireless ISPs in 2001 using Acquired-Sight.com as an example.</p>
<p>Google hits a year or 2 ago would have provided more than enough chatter, however the business sold to a company who downsized it to be their 2nd income with existing customers. Their decision basically gave the appearance of ASDC being defunct. I will slow down the pace of updates to this article until it's determined that this article may stay. --thank you ~ ~ ~ ~ ASDC's entry author</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> If you want to write an article on the business practices of outdoor wireless ISP's, it shouldn't be titled so. Also, such an article could not use original research.

<li><b>Comment</b> Whether Kilah is deleted or not looks like it won't matter in the slightest. Please review the standards at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. An <u>upcoming</u> release on a label that has no other acts, and whose website is on a free site like cabspace.com, doesn't even remotely come close to those standards. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 18:42, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>After review of the rules, can the mention of the label remain in the articles of Young Crowd and Larry "LaPret" Pretlow II</b></p>
<p>I have read the presented regulations and I again ask to be forgiven. I fully understand that as far as certification goes KILAH WORLD ENTERTAINMENT cannot be proven to be a real label. Please note that it is a independent label located in D.C. they have severala acts who perform locally and also have local airplay of their singles in D.C.</p>
<p>I ask that these 2 articles not be deleted because they would really be of aid to both the careers of [Young Crowd]] and Larry "LaPret" Pretlow II. Both artist are preparing to sign professional recording deals and release professional singles. Just having an article on WIKIPEDIA regarding their carrers thus far would be a tremendous aspect of their Nation-Wide promotion. Thanks! Dontrell McBride - Writer 19:26, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm sorry, you don't seem to understand. KILAH is not the issue. There is, at this point, zero chance of any of these articles not being deleted.

<p><b>We're not using Wikipedia for Exposure</b></p>
<p>You misundersdtood what I'm saying. Young Crowd is currently touring the USA promoting their mixtape release on local radio. They also are conducting performances and youth speeches. The mixtape will be a nation-wide release just like a Beyonce album. Young Crowd is just signed with an independent label. Each day that passes more and more people become familiar with Young Crowd and their music. It would only be fair to allow the Young Crowd and LaPret articles to be aprt of the Wikipedia these teenagers are doing something that has not been done and its worthy of being one of the millions of articles featured on this website.

<li><b>Delete All</b> The Young Crowd article contains a claim to have an international release of a single, but offers no verification nor a basis for verification (no title for the single). If it has done a tour, the <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> standard is "Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country, reported in notable and verifiable sources." As no sources are used, this test is failed. As far as I can see, all of the tests in <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> are failed. In fact, as no sources are used in any of the articles, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is failed. The Young Crowd article is also signed, in violation of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>.

<p>First of all, I am neither a native English-speaker nor a regular user of the English Wikipedia, so if I am saying or doing something curious, it most probably isn’t on purpose.</p>
<p>For the article, I strongly believe it is fake. I first stumbled across it in April 2006 and was a bit surprised that I never heard about the band before, as I am fairly interested—and involved—in this kind of music for quite a while. So I consulted the two or three bigger search engines, and none of them returned a single match, which hardened my suspicion that this “band” doesn’t actually exist. I thereupon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_Nocturnal_Darkness&amp;oldid=46449151" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_Nocturnal_Darkness&amp;oldid=46449151" rel="nofollow">added a speedy deletion template</a> which has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_Nocturnal_Darkness&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46503237" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_Nocturnal_Darkness&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46503237" rel="nofollow">removed by DakotaKahn</a> some hours later. I wasn’t aware of the fact that in the English Wikipedia IPs aren’t allowed to nominate pages for speedy deletion. However, in view of the reason I gave, it, in my opinion, wasn’t the optimal way to remove the template without continuing the discussion elsewhere.</p>
<p>Since April, articles have been started in three further Wikipedias, the “band” has been added to the Metal Archives index, and appeared on various other web sites, yet I haven’t seen a single publication so far that isn’t entirely based on the above-mentioned article. I haven’t talked to a single black metal fan who has ever heard of this “band” before. So, as long as nobody is able to convince me of the opposite, I regard this “band” to be fake. --89.58.61.207 18:05, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"DO NOT DELETE" This article is still being edited to Wiki standards. Even if 1/5 of those 517 Google hits refer to Arth, isn't that notable? I read somewhere that 250,000 art prints of his have been sold. He has a published book. There have been a number of articles written about him. (signed) LynnD Don't delete. How about instead a less notable length for a less notable biography? elikqitie 01:39, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Metros232, I came up with 18,700 Google hits on Michael E. Arth and 28,100 hits under Michael Arth, for a total of 46,800 hits. I have no idea how many are unique to this particular Michael E. Arth, but after looking at several random pages, I'd say it's a lot. He was also a rock poster artist in the early 70s, and fine art posters he did in the 70s and 80s are still in circulation--so it's the same Arth, as artist, house designer/builder, urban designer, writer etc, etc.. He's had a lot of incarnations and at least a few of them are notable 04:16, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oddly, a second search through Safari came up with over 160,000 Google hits for Michael E. Arth and Michael Arth. Curious. Pablo Picasso brought 810,000 hits. There is probably only one Pablo Picasso though vs. maybe 4 or 5 Michael Arths. 04:25, 14 July 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Lynndunn (<a href="../../../l/y/n/User_talk%7ELynndunn_c413.html" title="User talk:Lynndunn">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lynndunn_586e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lynndunn">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>18,700 and 28,100? I have no clue what you're talking about. I did my Google searches again and came up with 68 and 597. Not even close to your search. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 11:02, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Metros232, That's strange. Do you have some finely tuned search system? If so,I'd like to get that. I reran the searches. I now realize that for my Safari search it was going through Yahoo, not Google. Sorry about that. So I ran both Yahoo and Google. I came up with a total of 185,700 for Yahoo and a total of 47,000 for Google. I copied them here for you to see:</p>
<p>Yahoo search:</p>
<p>"1 - 10 of about 66,700 for Michael E. Arth - 0.17 sec" "1 - 10 of about 119,000 for Michael Arth - 0.24 sec. (About this page)"</p>
<p>Google search:</p>
<p>Web Results (Michael E. Arth) "1 - 10 of about 18,900. Search took 0.10 seconds." (Michael Arth)Web Results 1 - 10 of about 28,400. Search took 0.29 seconds.</p>
<p>Anyway, my point is that Arth is at least somewhat notable. I reduced the size of the bio to reflect his somewhat notable status. For that reason, I say DO NOT DELETE! 13:20, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Counting Google hits is not research</b>. If you want to make an argument for having a biographical article on this person, please demonstrate how he satisfies one or more of our <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:01, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Uncle G, the Google test IS listed as an "alternative test" for inclusion as a biography. I agree it should not be the only test. So, in addition to passing the alternative test (as has been demonstrated above) Arth has these points in favor of inclusion:</p>
<p>1. At least 30 articles written about him that can be read online</p>
<p>2. Coffee table art book, Introspective 1972-1982 published in 1983, and still available online. This book has an impressive amount of work, but doesn't even mention that he was also a rock concert poster artist for a while in the early 70s (the t-shirt connection cited above by Metros232 above was actually a link to Michael Arth's poster art, not another Michael Arth)</p>
<p>3. Hundreds of thousands of art prints sold during the time he was a fine artist 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>4. Designer and builder of the well-known 7 story "Casa de Lila" (1993) in the Hollywood Hills, and a number of other LA area residences.</p>
<p>5. Founder of New Pedestrianism, a variant of New Urbanism</p>
<p>6. Writer of many articles and the text of Introspective</p>
<p>7. subject of two documentaries currently in production: The Labors of Hercules: Modern Solutions to 12 Herculean Problems, and another one about building a new town in Kenya being produced by Canadian mutual funds expert Duff Young.</p>
<p>8. He rebuilt 30 slum homes and businesses in DeLand, Florida and received various awards for that. He's got another 92 homes and businesses in development in the Garden District. After he ran out the drug dealers he renamed "Crack Town" The Garden District. 19:53, 14 July 2006 (UTC)20:07, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>not at all! We've just established that Hellenophilia (Philhellenism) was a notable phenomenon. There can be a full article treating its (and the <i>term's</i>) history etc.; the <i>only</i> question here is, does the term "Vlachophile" have comparable notability. In my vote above, I say that I think this unlikely. "Keep 'em all or delete 'em all" is a horrible approach. Shall we delete <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenophile.html" title="Hellenophile">Hellenophile</a> because there is no such word as <a href="../../../t/o/g/Togo.html" title="Togo">Togophile</a> or <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khakas.html" title="Khakas">Khakasophile</a>?

<dd>(Edit conflict - to dab): Well Vlachophilia gets more than twice the number of Google hits than Scandophilia (back to the basics). Philhellenism was a significant political movement; can the same be said for Vlachophilia? I don't know enough about Scandophilia to comment, except that it scores low on Google. I see no problem in keeping them all - the main problem with the Vlachophile article is the edit warring is causes (and will cause more if it's anything like the article on the <a href="../../../a/r/o/Aromanians.html" title="Aromanians">Aromanians</a> it is in reference to). --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelex_3d37.html" title="User:Telex">Tēlex</a> 21:06, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>hm, this is proof that it's a <i>word</i>, meaning it can safely be moved to wiktionary.

<li><b>Delete</b> Sounds like a local news story, but not a major event worthy of an article here. I certainly don't recall any national coverage. (Don't want to sound insensitive, but a guy who witnesses the police having a shootout and decides to join in seems like a <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin_Award_2e81.html" title="Darwin Award">Darwin Award</a>). -- <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 19:17, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This Article has merit, because Mark Allen Wilson, in life and in his death, was extremely unusual. He entered into a raging gun battle and arguably saved the lives of several people, at the cost of his own. Mark Wilson did so, not as a professional rescuer or policeman, but as a concerned citizen acting in his own private capacity to help others. Because he was an American and lived in one of the many American states that allows citizens to carry concealed weapons, he could do so with a handgun. A further edited and expanded article of the incident and Mark Wilson's actions through a neutral examination of facts has a value to all view points in the hotly contested debates involving violence in our society, the ownership of firearms and their ethical use as a means of self defense or in defense of others. While the facts of the incident might led some to think Mark Wilson was a fool to intrude into a police incident, my personal feeling is that the Vikings would have immortalized Mark in song and saga, in a modern world he at least deserves a mention in Wikipedia. --Brian H 19:53, 11 July 2006 (UTC) (moved from talk page)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Even though I'm in favor of gun control, it seems like this incident might be a valuable element of the debate over gun ownership. I think it should remain for that reason. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 20:43, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This event was significant enough that the Texas House of Representatives passed a resolution of commendation, No. 740, to commend Mark Wilson for what he did. He did not "join in a police shootout." The few police on the scene were pinned down in the courthouse and unable to provide any assistance to Arroyo's victims. "Fan" should research this incident more carefully before pontificating, and I would say insulting the deceased.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 74.130.96.206 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.130.96.206_3d33.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.130.96.206">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Being released without a physical single is not uncommon. And it actually did get released as a digital download, perhaps not a special one, but then, none of the tracks on this particular album were released as "special" downloads. <b>Keep</b> as top ten single (U.S. Modern Rock) by reasonably notable artist. GassyGuy 20:17, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Exactly my point. None of the singles from this band are specially notable. As far as I'm informed, the song wasn't even released as a single digital download, just as part of the album. The other singles at least have CD/vinyl releases and music videos to "flesh out" the articles. This one, however, is complete. There is no more information that can be given on this song/single (except for maybe on what compilation albums it was released, but that's nothing to go in an encyclopedia). And charting top 5 in the Modern Rock charts is not that strong of a criteria to justify this weak article. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarryCane_57e2.html" title="User:HarryCane">HarryCane</a> 11:13, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> You see, currently, there is nothing more to add to the article. And it's a fallacy that every top 10 single on a major singles chart needs to have an article. It's a criteria for it to be <i>allowed</i> to have an article. Major difference. I'm just saying that this article is very superfluous, as it consists of random facts copied from the other two articles I mentioned, and it will never make it past stub-stadium. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarryCane_57e2.html" title="User:HarryCane">HarryCane</a> 10:41, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, legitimate commission. Disappointing that that bunch of crud was in the article for so long, but those before me have cleaned it up.

<li>I'm afraid you're mistaken, or have been misled by internet copyright fairytales (like that old "it's legal if you delete within 24 hours" chestnut). In the UK it <i>is</i> illegal to make backups of games for personal use even if you own the original, without written consent from the copyright holder (<a href="http://www.elspa.com/?l=faq&amp;cat=21" class="external free" title="http://www.elspa.com/?l=faq&amp;cat=21" rel="nofollow">http://www.elspa.com/?l=faq&amp;cat=21</a>). The "legal backup" clause is a relic from the days of unreliable floppy disks and cassette tapes, and no longer applies. And while it's not, strictly speaking, illegal to make a back up of a DVD, breaking the copy protection to do so <i>is</i> (<a href="http://www.euro-copyrights.org/index/8/13" class="external free" title="http://www.euro-copyrights.org/index/8/13" rel="nofollow">http://www.euro-copyrights.org/index/8/13</a>). Even putting those matters aside, profiting from the sale of copyrighted material most certainly is illegal, and far, far more likely to get you in serious trouble than your average joe copying his CDs to put in the car stereo. But I digress; the AfD debate is over <b>notability</b>, not legality. ~ <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus78</a> 22:58, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thank you for your detailed comment regarding the legality of copied Dvd's. When i wrote the article i was under the impression it was legal (as stated on their website).

<p>Was tagged for prod as a non-notable biography when it was just about the first entry. But now it's been created as a disambiguation page for three non-notable biographies (none of which with articles). <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 19:05, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I was the one who replaced the non-notable biography with the disambiguation page because I found the painter when I was trying to confirm notability for the actor. I think the painter mentioned on that page is probably notable. Would anyone like to try to create an article about the painter based on the web sites mentioned and reviews available on the web? See <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22David+Geister%22+review" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22David+Geister%22+review" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=%22David+Geister%22+review</a> for some reviews of both people. These reviews might also be enough to claim notability for the actor as well. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 19:53, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The only references I could find to the 'actor' were his own site and an associate producer credit on IMDb. No mention of Kerry Roop on IMDb.

<li><b>Comment</b> in addition to what DarkAudit found, the only things I really see in the "review" search is for a guy that does historical reenactments of some kind.

Also as this is an online radio show it provides access to a the music scene in a particular place that is then available to people elsewhere. A fine source of information, the spread of which is the aim, no?Thomasmuirhead 12:39, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Bands trying to promote their work routinely give interviews to anyone and everyone, whether they've heard of them or not. Doesn't make the interviewers notable, and I can find nothing to indicate this show is. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 16:33, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> What does make something notable?

<li><b>Keep</b> This deletion made me curious. I have just read What_Wikipedia_is_not and don’t really see why this is being deleted? Isn’t the main thing about Wikipedia the fact that it is not a paper encyclopaedia…and that it doesn’t have to limit its content because of constraints as to ‘importance’. There are many who would suggest that ‘scunthorpe’ isn’t notable but that’s included because it exists, and I know Paris Hilton isn’t notable well not for words anyway more pictures and she’s in. This radio show exists, so it should be included.Dt edin 16:42, 14 July 2006 (UTC) <small><b>Note</b>: First and only edit from new editor</small></li>
<li><b>KEEP</b>The constraints of an online encyclopedia are boundless, why limit what material is shown. Surely the more information is shared the more we can develop as a society.

<p>There is no doubt this article was created at the time when the cause of fire was unknown (and some suspected terrorism). But now, the cause of the explosion is, for the most part, known; it was a simple gas explosion (perhaps caused by suicide attempt). So now what makes this gas fire more noteworthy than others? The fact that it occured in New York City? Fires happen in New York City and other cities around the world all the time. Ten years from now, few are going to care about this fire; even ten <i>days</i> from now, few are going to care about this fire. And so, this is just a news event, not an encyclopedic topic. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturn</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">r</a> 21:15, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

It's not everyday that someone tries to commit suicide by blowing up a a $10 million dollar landmark building in Manhattan. In fact, suicide by house is, as far as I can tell, an entirely new twist to the business of screwing over the wife and kids after a messy divorce. In my opinion, this will be in the news for quite sometime (civil suits, etc) and will remain an integral part of NYC lore (not to mention the questions raised about divorce and suicide).

What exactly is the problem with Inquirer related entries? It's a few K of hard drive space on a server. It's not fake, it's a phrase, used by some people (number irrelevant).

<p>The result was <b>no result</b>. Nomination is invalid - this article is about an album, not an artist, and I'm surprised that not one but <i>two</i> editors managed to misread a) the word "album" in the text, b) the album infoxbox including a generic image of a CD case and c) the tracklisting. Given the low participation I cannot delete an article on the basis of an AfD where neither participant seems to have read the article, nor does it seem a good idea to relist a faulty nomination. If desired then the article on the artist (<a href="../../../o/2E/s/O.S.T.R._be83.html" title="O.S.T.R.">O.S.T.R.</a>) should be nominated, and the album article grouped with it. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 11:42, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>STATEMENT:</b> The tradition of the Egg snake has been enjoyed and continued on many establishments on the west coast, including, but not limited to, the South Western Coast of British Columbia. The page Egg Snake is an over-due attempt to bring light to this lesser-known West Coast marine history. Many coastal American establishments from Northern California and Oregon, including my own, still serve the traditional Egg Snake on the menu. The area's thriving most from Egg Snake popularity again seem to be located on the South Western Coast of British Columbia.
<p>The Egg Snake is very much so a real and current standing piece of West Coast heritage. Although not well known, it is my intent through this page to educate marine history enthusiasts to some of the finer points of history on the West Coast. Noting that it is in-fact a relatively unknown piece of history, I failed to realize that Google is a reliable generator of credible sources and in the duty of determining fact from fiction. If this were the case, my very own restaurant from which I work daily (which has Egg Snake on the menu), would not exist according to Google.</p>
<p>My Goal is simple: To educate marine history enthusiasts to some of the finer points of history on the West Coast. I wish to know what verification is needed in order for the page Egg Snake to stand.

<dd>It seems as though you do not have anything usefull to add to this afd except empty comentary. This page was created on a computer, and that should be satisfactory as to how this article was created. Once again I am stating that this article is not a hoax, and is a page identifying marine heritage. I would ask you to once again re-read what has been written, as other users have also commented on how you have failed to understand what is posted. Also, your open ended babbling has become tiresome, please refrain from it in the future, and let's remeber the purpose of this afd. Once again, thank you for your interest in marine history and the egg snake, and I hope this hasn't discouraged you from enjoying the educational information posted.

<li><b>Read the whole paragraph.</b> In response to the previous comment. You probably should have read the whole article before cracking off wise comments. The author clearly stated that the early egg snakes were molded from oriental cookware, not George Foreman grills. The modern version of the egg snake is molded using George Foreman grills or griddles with grease canals around the edges, not even necessarily George Foreman grills. I've been to many small diners on the coast of BC and enjoyed this breakfast food on many occasions. If anyone needs proof of their existence visit the area and enjoy one for yourself instead of poking holes in the poor author's article. Until now, I didn't know the full history of the egg snake (besides their naval affiliation). I found this article very educational. Once I saw it was considered for deletion, I had to make an account and side with the author.</li>
<li><b>Ichthyosaurs</b> The actual date that the full fossil was discovered is irrealevant; the name Ichthyosaurs is of Greek origin for the designation of fish lizard. regardless of the popularity of the actual animal fossil itself discovered in 1840, I'm willing to bet that the greek language would have remaind the same. And honestly, an egg snake looks nothing like the actual beast, indicating that it was merely a name and not a resemblance responsible for the term Ichthyosaurs.

<li><b>Great Breakfast</b> Last summer when I was on a cruise to Alaska, my cruise had an evening stop over in the quaint little city of Victoria. The following morning wanting to sample canadian culture I had breakfast in a local diner on a quiet corner. For breakfast I ate a local favourite called the egg snake. This was one of the most delicious dishes I had during the entire cruise. After returning to my home in Cheyenne I searched everywhere for this meal, unfortunately I was unable to find it. I am glad that a local has published this meal, and hope that he may add a recipe, so others may try this fantasic dish. Anyone who says this article is a hoax should try to leave their computer for more then 5 minutes and live a real life. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDotheymakeboth_845c.html" title="User:Dotheymakeboth">Dotheymakeboth</a> 03:18, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Yes, But</b> I was both surprised and dismayed to find this article on the "Articles for Deletion" page. Although the the cooking and preparation of Egg Snakes has dipped into one of their frequent bouts of obscurity, as has occurred throughout their history, an entry on this sub-regional cuisine is long overdue. It is true, the egg snake is not widely known outside of the southern Gulf Islands of Canada. However, I am well acquainted with them. Though I currently reside in my Ontario hometown, I lived on <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_Spring_Island_3a7e.html" title="Salt Spring Island">Salt Spring Island</a> from 1982 to 1994, and egg snakes were served at a couple of greasy diners in Ganges until at least the late 80s. In the mid-80s a close friend of mine, who also worked as a freelance reporter for the monthly Ganges newsletter, conducted some research into the egg snake's heritage and shared his detailed research with me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus I feel some of the confusion over this entry on egg snakes is due to the less-than-steller writing of this article's authors. Certainly I am not aware of any connection to the USS Spitfire, nor the practice of calling egg snakes "Ichthyosaurs". I suspect that was more popular in selected villages of the Oregon coast, if at all. However egg snakes had spread from their obscure beginnings in the California merchant fleet to US Navy ships by 1850. My friend shared with me (briefly) the journals of one Lt. David "Jesus" Cooke, who sailed with <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_Matthew_Perry_ca9e.html" title="Commodore Matthew Perry">Commodore Matthew Perry</a>'s expedition to open Japanese trade in 1852-53. Since Cooke had grown up with a pioneer family in coastal California, he was the only officer on the flagship who appreciated the egg snakes served by the stewards every Friday. Furthermore, once the expedition anchored near <a href="../../../e/d/o/Edo.html" title="Edo">Edo</a> (modern-day <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>), several Japanese traders were "inspired" by the administration to come over and offer the Americans generic trade quotes. In doing so, they recognized the smell and sight of the American egg snakes, and proceeded to trade ideas on egg snake cooking with the American stewards. This is the first known contact between Asian and American styles of egg snakes. Sadly, the journal of Lt. Cooke, held by a private collector in Miami, were lost when <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Andrew_b913.html" title="Hurricane Andrew">Hurricane Andrew</a> struck South <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>.</p>
<p>Since then the styles of American and Asian egg snakes fused together during years of tentative American and Japanese trade until the Second World War, when local authorities in the Pacific Northwest suppressed the egg snake as an unpatriotic dish (an earlier version of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_fries.html" title="Freedom fries">freedom fries</a>.) The Canadian Gulf Islands, however, remained fairly isolated from such influences, despite the anti-Japanese internment across the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strait_of_Georgia_b2a8.html" title="Strait of Georgia">Strait of Georgia</a> in <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> and beyond. Thus (my friend concluded) the Southern Gulf Islands became the last bastion of the egg snake on the West Coast, occasionally learned by transient residents (as we called everyone who lived there for less than 10 years) and spread across the country.</p>
<p>I hope this clears up some of the record, though I am sorry I could not provide any real sources. Suffice to say I have tasted it and I miss the egg snake very much! --<a href="../../../b/e/w/User%7EBewdley_685b.html" title="User:Bewdley">Bewdley</a>23:25, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Out East</b> I don't understand why this article is being considered for deletion. Egg snake is very popular in southern New Brunswick. My grandmother used to prepare egg snake for us using an iron wood stove. She had a new-fangled electric stove but preferred the wood stove. She continued cutting and fetching her own firewood until her late 70's when we had to resort to having her committed. She has dementia now and no longer prepares egg snake. Every once in awhile one of the family will bring egg snake in for her but it is not the same without the wood stove.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I recently visited Pender Island, BC (I stayed at the luxurious Poet's Cove Resort) and was surprised to find that egg snake was on the menu on the pool deck restaurant. You can actually order egg snake from the hot tub and it will be delivered to the swim-up bar. Sweet. It is not cooked on a wood stove but it is still OK. While in BC I learned that the Yag (sort of like a Sasquatch) is very partial to egg snakes so caution is to be exercised at all times. Yags don't usually go near pools or hottubs because their reflection in the water frightens them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Anyway, only a crazy person would suggest that this article should be deleted. I recommend that you busy-bodies visit either southern New Brunswick or Poet's Cove before you snap to judgement. Let he who is without sin cast the first egg snake and egg snakes who live in glass houses should be cooked with wood stoves.</li>

<li>Keep. Unless there is a specific, valid reason to delete it, I think it should stay. I've seen many entries that might be considered "not important" by some people. It's all subjective.

<li><b>Keep It</b>, and add to other Internet phenomena. It is note worthy for several of the reasons noted above and meets the four criteria for worthyness. I don't see what "funny", or "nobody will care" have to do with it, those are just subjective takes on importance which all content is subject too. Who will care the Earth even existed in 10 Billion Years? Hard to say actually, which is why deleting should be a last resort. onNYTurf 16:27, 12 July 2006 (EST)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I haven't decided either way yet, but I want to note that this story has made it to <a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2006/07/14/onion_blogger/" class="external text" title="http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2006/07/14/onion_blogger/" rel="nofollow">Salon.com</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESterlingNorth_8b85.html" title="User:SterlingNorth">SterlingNorth</a> 17:59, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: It is mean and cowardly to ridicule a person for a harmless mistake, especially a sincere person, whether or not one agrees with that person's opinions. Besides, it isn't notable.<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_L._Peterson_830c.html" title="User:Richard L. Peterson">Rich</a> 07:56, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is definitely notable for several reasons. 1) It is a great example of the peculiar power of blogs to spread information to a large number of people, 2) more generally, it is an example of how the internet has changed what information gets made public and how that information is dispersed, 3)it is a prime example of the importance of checking sources before making information and opinions public, 4) it is topical to the nature and reliability of information found on the internet, 5) it is an example of how controversial and divisive issues such as abortion are in this society (esp. the U.S.) . Comparing this to the Great Spaghetti Monster, if you look on the original keep/delete comments on that article, much the same argument of notability was discussed there as well. In additional, this topic keeps going thanks to articles such as the one found in <i>Salon</i>. I don't understand why people should be so inflexible about what should be considered "notable" in Wikipedia. This is <i>not</i> a traditional print encyclopedia with typical entries. One of the reasons I come here personally is to get the straight scoop on topical events that are difficult to find elsewhere on the net, I also very much appreciate Wikipedia's responsiveness to new information. Sure, this topic isn't earth-shattering news, OTOH I can probably find 100 articles in here in a few minutes that many would consider less notable than this, and there is no debate on the "importance" of those topics.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Toktun (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Toktun_7cca.html" title="Special:Contributions/Toktun">contribs</a>).</small><small>(This is user's second edit.)</small></li>

<li>Keep. Unless there is a specific, valid reason to delete it, I think it should stay. I've seen many entries that might be considered "not important" by some people. It's all subjective.

<li><b>Keep It</b>, and add to other Internet phenomena. It is note worthy for several of the reasons noted above and meets the four criteria for worthyness.

<li><b>Delete</b>: It is mean and cowardly to ridicule a person for a harmless mistake, especially a sincere person, whether or not one agrees with that person's opinions.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is definitely notable for several reasons. 1) It is a great example of the peculiar power of blogs to spread information to a large number of people, 2) more generally, it is an example of how the internet has changed what information gets made public and how that information is dispersed, 3)it is a prime example of the importance of checking sources before making information and opinions public, 4) it is topical to the nature and reliability of information found on the internet, 5) it is an example of how controversial and divisive issues such as abortion are in this society (esp. the U.S.) . Comparing this to the Great Spaghetti Monster, if you look on the original keep/delete comments on that article, much the same argument of notability was discussed there as well. In additional, this topic keeps going thanks to articles such as the one found in <i>Salon</i>. I don't understand why people should be so inflexible about what should be considered "notable" in Wikipedia. This is <i>not</i> a traditional print encyclopedia with typical entries. One of the reasons I come here personally is to get the straight scoop on topical events that are difficult to find elsewhere on the net, I also very much appreciate Wikipedia's responsiveness to new information. Sure, this topic isn't earth-shattering news, OTOH I can probably find 100 articles in here in a few minutes that many would consider less notable than this, and there is no debate on the "importance" of those topics.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Toktun (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Toktun_7cca.html" title="Special:Contributions/Toktun">contribs</a>).</small><small>(This is user's second edit.)</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I recognize that the article is poorly written and this particular neighborhood may be less notable than others but I think there may perhaps be a need to have a consistent policy before we go down this slippery slope. Is there a policy? This is a good faith question. I just don't see the notablity difference with many other similar articles. Note that I have not voted. It seems that Cities are notable regardless of size or location, as long as they are incorporated. Even unicorporated cities are included. Secondary schools are notable no matter what. There are thousands of neighborhood articles. This one happens to be poorly written and about <i>four days old</i>.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 23:58, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you find a policy, please point it out to us! I'll be happy to withdraw this nomination or vote to keep it if there is policy or significant precedent. It's just difficult to establish noteabiliy for such a brief, poorly written, and completely unreferenced article. There is nothing in the article even establishing the existence of such a place. I think it's perfectly reasonable to require the creator of a new article to provide some evidence of the subject's existence and noteability. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 00:22, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>merge</b> The neighborhood is not notable, I live in Richmond. A carpet store? its some mom and pop store. It should be merged into the Richmond article. Poeple throughout the bay area know of Hilltop and Point Richmond and Rockridge. Pt. Richmond? Its so nice there. Hilltop, theres that Mall there right?. Rockridge. It that by the Rockruidge Bart station? pullman is more of a neioghborhood name for the hood which people out of that area dont even know. i live 20 blocks from "<i>Pullman</i>" and had never heard of it. Allthough within the bureorcracy i do know that the city does delimit it on the garbage/reclycling pickup list and dates. but my hood has a name too, which only appears on that list and non one would know where i was talkign about if i told em. i do request people check out the article once more since it has changed since it was put up for deletion. i also think its a little bit aggressive to put up articles for deletion sop quickly, even the richmond article was a poorly qritten one sentance thingy at first. <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Richmond%2C_California_6b74.html" title="North Richmond, California">North Richmond, California</a> is a good example of this compare earliest to most recnt, night and day. and that comment about people dont know about neighborhoods in Richmond. well youre sheltered and maybe a little gentrified agrregious and ignorant. im guessing all you know about richmond is enviornmenttal catatrophes and drive by shootings and are ignorant to the fact of 2 country clubs malls department stores casinos national monuments milllion dollar mcmansions state of the art bus system and upscale cookie cutter homes bike trails ranches horticultural centers shipbuilding port funtions wildlife anbd diversity and yes even pullman. and cmon dude i know youve heard of Poitn Richmond and Hilltop<a href="../../../q/r/c/User%7EQrc2006_905d.html" title="User:Qrc2006">Qrc2006</a> 23:45, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Again I am really not concerned about this neighborhood. I just don't see that since Rockridge has "upscale" shops that it is more notable than Pullman. I clearly think that there is a bias that will creep in here. Rockridge is nothing but an old suburb that is now urban. It has fancy resturants, expensive fancy resturants. I totally agree with voting on these things but I really see a very negative bias being created here where, those places near and dear to wealthy people like Rockridege and Point Richmond, those places that are cute, are called notable. Personally I would think that a neighborhood (with some sort of official existance) in a major city would always be notable as a geographical location.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 16:40, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

The film's article certainly belongs, and I'd accept a redirect, but I don't think this even warrants that due to the subject's non-notability separate from the film--who would go looking for her unless they had the film in mind? 177 unique Ghits for '"Pauline Murray" actress,' many of which still pointed to other individuals, and only one or two of which were devoted solely to her. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 04:07, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
