<p>I have deleted this three times now, but the author keeps recreating it, so I will bring it here so that if it gets recreated again, he can be blocked. I have asked for sources of his claim on my talk page that this is the most popular segment on the most popular sports talk show on radio, but he did not do so, so I come here. I don't believe the show itself is notable enough for its own article, let alone this minor segment of it. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 07:42, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Neutral.</b> I don't feel I know enough about US radio shows to vote, but I would comment that, whilst this would not be notable in its own right, it would be appropriate as an article if, for example, the term "whiner line" has broadened to become a widely-used catchphrase. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 18:23, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>WEEI is the number one rated radio station among adults ages 25-54 in Boston. The Big Show on WEEI is the number one rated show in the afternoon drive time slot among adults 25-54. WEEI has 463,000 listeners per week. Source: <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/articles/2005/05/03/winter_puts_a_slight_chill_in_weei_ratings/?rss_id=Boston+Globe+--+Sports+News" class="external text" title="http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/articles/2005/05/03/winter_puts_a_slight_chill_in_weei_ratings/?rss_id=Boston+Globe+--+Sports+News" rel="nofollow">"Winter puts a slight chill in WEEI ratings"</a>. The Whiner line is a popular feature on The Big Show. And by the way, Aaron Brenneman, if you want to stick to the letter of the law, then you should include your reasoning in an AfD vote per <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>, which you did not do.

I <i>do</i> want to stick to the letter of the law, and often suggest to others that they provide reasonings, so this is doubly embarassing. Thanks for the citation, and I'll expand by saying "not notable in of itself" (which I did not do, as you so correctly pointed out!) Your citations all show WEEI's notability, not <i>this show's'</i>. Of course, that then raises the question "where is my evidence on non-notability?" I'd prefer to adress that on the talk page, however.

<li>sorry if that last one came off as argumentative. it was sort of written in the heat of the moment. <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/articles/2005/05/03/winter_puts_a_slight_chill_in_weei_ratings/?rss_id=Boston+Globe+--+Sports+News" class="external text" title="http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/articles/2005/05/03/winter_puts_a_slight_chill_in_weei_ratings/?rss_id=Boston+Globe+--+Sports+News" rel="nofollow">This</a> citation, which i previously used, demonstrates The Big Show's notability, as it says that The Big Show is the number one afternoon drive time show among adults ages 25-54. Perhaps you meant the notability of the Whiner Line, which is a segment on The Big Show. This i cannot verify the notability of, other than to say that it is a segment on a notable show, and to relate that I know it to be a popular segment on the show from personal experience. In that respect, I admit defeat. Thanks for staying civil,--<a href="../../../a/l/h/User%7EAlhutch_2589.html" title="User:Alhutch">Alhutch</a> 06:29, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I would say that a segment of a show, really by definition, should be noted as a segment of the article on the show. The show is notable enough for an article (per Alhutch's research), the segment enough for a redirect. I don't think either of you would disagree; am I wrong? <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 23:40, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
