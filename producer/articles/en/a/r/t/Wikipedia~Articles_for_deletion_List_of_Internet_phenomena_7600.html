<p>The concept of the article is fundamentally flawed: <i>anything</i> on the internet is an "internet phenomena", including this very AfD discussion.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is one of the most useful pages about internet memes out there. It can be a list of old and new ones, there is no need to delete something so useful, where else can you find a list like this? There needs to be some sort of list like this; there are allready wikipedia entries for every entry, there has to be some sort of master list so that people can navigate through them.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. An internet phenomenon has an accepted definition, and a large number of those listed on the page have been covered by secondary news sources (<a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeroy_Jenkins_c207.html" title="Leeroy Jenkins">Leeroy Jenkins</a>, anyone?). This is a perfectly valid list, in fact, its a perfect example of what <i>is</i> a useful Wikipedia list. More to the point, if your deletion nomination's logic is considered valid, the same justification could be used to delete every single internet phenomenon on the list. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 15:35, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>What is this "accepted definition" you speak of? And who accepted it? Most of the entries on this page speak of external events, news of which spreads on the internet - but how is that a valid internet phenomena? The article tells us that boxer <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sid_Eudy_d59c.html" title="Sid Eudy">Sid Eudy</a> got knocked from the ring and that "the footage exploded across the internet". So what? The article tells us that <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Colbert_e40e.html" title="Stephen Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> criticized Bush at a dinner and that people on the internet talked about it for "several days afterward". So what? Other entries, like <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hung_60a2.html" title="William Hung">William Hung</a>'s or <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Tilton_fced.html" title="Robert Tilton">Robert Tilton</a>'s, don't even establish what, if anything, the entry has to do with the internet. And yes, I do think many of these entries' own articles should be deleted, like <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anton_Maiden_a0a9.html" title="Anton Maiden">Anton Maiden</a>, for one. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 15:49, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The "accepted definition" is in Wikipedia's own notability policy: once a phenomenon is covered by a secondary news source, it becomes verifiable and thus notable. Thus deleting the whole list is silly: it would be much more effective to do individual AfD nominations for the articles linked from the list that aren't verifiable or notable, and then to remove them. Removing the list removes a valid source of information <i>without</i> dealing with the problem of non-notable "phenomena" being on Wikipedia in the form of articles. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 15:53, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I suggest you read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. An internet phenomenon is any unusual <a href="../../../m/e/m/Meme.html" title="Meme">meme</a> that is propagated around the internet in great volume. It belongs on Wikipedia if it fits the WP:WEB guidelines as linked before. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 16:05, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I suggest you specify what part of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> illustrates your point. I see nothing on there that is relevant to this article's POV/OR problem. And while you're at it, define "unusual" and "in great volume" for me. These are POV terms. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:11, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>A skyscraper is an "unusually tall building". Does that mean that we shouldn't have an article about skyscrapers? Anyways, please continue your comments in the below section: having two arguments at once is ridiculous. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 16:12, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're asking the wrong question. Of course there should be an article on skyscrapers. The question should have been: should be a list that includes all skyscrapers. The answer is obviously no, as it is debatable if a building is a skyscraper or not. (Of course, in the case of skyscrapers the situation is somewhat different, as you can do the following: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_the_world.html" title="List of tallest buildings in the world">List of tallest buildings in the world</a>.) -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 08:58, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. List criteria is far too broad, far too widely open to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and ultimately <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. This list has the potential to rapidly explode to an unusable, unweildy, monstrous size. Non-encyclopedic and not useful. If something is a legitimate internet phenomenon, it can have its own (sourced) page. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpiondollprincess_f1a6.html" title="User:Scorpiondollprincess">Scorpiondollprincess</a> 15:42, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Then why not narrow the criteria and delete the internet phenomena (the articles themselves) that aren't notable or verifiable? Deleting the whole list is massive, stupid overkill. Its like blowing up the moon because you don't like the look of a few of the craters. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 15:46, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, it's like deleting a POV list because it's POV. The internet is a medium just like any other, so where's List of TV phenomena and List of radio phenomena? Someone or something getting their 15 minutes of pseudo-fame on the internet doesn't establish notability. What constitutes a true "internet phenomenon" is inherently a matter of personal opinion and can never be mutually agreed on. It's POV and OR on a grand scale. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 15:55, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Notable = covered by secondary sources per the Wikipedia notability guidelines. Period. It isn't a matter of debate, nor is it a matter of POV. If an article linked from the list isn't notable by that definition, AfD it. If you <i>disagree with the notability guidelines, this is not the place to debate it!</i> <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 15:57, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Whether an article should go to AfD or not has nothing to do with whether it should be mentioned on this list. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:01, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The deletion of the whole list can only be justified if <i>everything on it</i> is non-notable. If there are even just a few things on it which are notable, the list shouldn't be deleted, instead, everything except those notable articles should be deleted. Thus, by claiming the list should be deleted, you imply that not a single article on the list is notable, and thus that everything on the list should be deleted. Since that is what you imply, you should list them all for AfD individually instead of the whole list. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 16:03, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why do you keep talking about articles? This isn't a list of articles, it's a list of incidents and persons. Their own separate articles have nothing to do with this list's fundamental POV/OR problem. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:05, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You're making absolutely zero sense whatsoever. <b>It is a list of articles.</b> The information next to the article name <b>is a summary of the linked article</b>. <b>The linked article describes an internet phenomenon.</b> If the internet phenomenon is non-notable, <b>so is the linked article, and thus the linked article should be deleted.</b> Do you get it yet? <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 16:08, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I repeat: the article tells us that <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Colbert_e40e.html" title="Stephen Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> criticized Bush at a dinner and that people on the internet talked about it for "several days afterward". This incident is supposed to be the internet phenomena, not Stephen Colbert in general. And you're telling me that if this incident involving Colbert is non-notable, then so is his linked article?? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:16, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is an exception. Most of the articles on that page are of the form "Hamsterdance: Blah blah blah summary of hamsterdance article" or also "Person who got most of his fame from the internet phenomena: blah blah blah summary." If such a claim about Stephen Colbert is uncited, you can delete it: you don't need an AfD to delete a single line on the page of an article, or even 50 lines on the page of an article. The other claims rely directly on the notability of the article they link to. To be more precise, if every single listing on the page was as you described (like Stephen Colbert) and had no citation, I would support deletion of the list because there would be no verifiable content on the list. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 16:18, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I only bring it up because you keep talking about articles. The individual articles are not on trial here, this list is. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:23, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Also, for the information of the nominator, an internet phenomenon is also known as a "fad." Beanie babies, for example, were a notable fad. Notable web fads (also known as internet phenomena) have articles about them, such as this one by CNET: <a href="http://www.cnet.com/4520-11136_1-6268155-1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.cnet.com/4520-11136_1-6268155-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnet.com/4520-11136_1-6268155-1.html</a> <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 16:17, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Then rename the article List of internet fads. By definition, "fad" is only one of many types of "phenomena". <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:22, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you google both terms in quotes, you will find "internet phenoma/phenomenon" is more widely used, and thus under Wikipedia guidelines should be the title. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 16:23, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If that's the case (and I'm not sure I agree that it is), then the term needs to be defined for the article in a manner that's free of POV and OR, and I don't think that's possible. Earlier in this thread, you couldn't define it without using POV/OR terms like "unusual" and "great". <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:44, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then I suggest you delete <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skyscraper.html" title="Skyscraper">Skyscraper</a> under that logic, because a skyscraper cannot be defined without POV terms either, such as "very tall" (what does that mean?) or "unusually high". Or what about a mansion versus a house? A mansion can only be described as "unusually large" or "very large." Do you suggest we delete the article on mansions also? <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari">Dark Shikari</a> 16:46, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per Dark Shikari. I don't see the POV claim here. The language in the article appears neutral with no glaring weasel words. Yes it is a large article but the wide range of topics invites a large number of editors to view it and help maintain it. I agree with Dark Shikari that the number one criteria here should be verification from a secondary source and you already see the editors on the Talk Page moving towards this consensus. That gives me great confidence that this article can be maintained. The list is inherently notable in the subject matter with anyone who has been on the internet for even a small amount of time being able to scan through and go "OMG! I remember that!" on numerous occassions. The very fact that Wikipedia is web based strongly gears this article towards our most common audience. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 17:40, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, no, you're making a false assumption about what I said.

<dd>There is an 'Internet Memes' category, but it might be a good idea to change its definition to include what is described here as 'Internet Phenomenon'.

She is also not above insulting people in discussions (I am beginning to suspect some of her deletions are motivated by a desire to remove evidence of her tart keyboard in anticipation of the RFC she has to know is coming) and edit summaries, and has refused to respond to reasonable efforts to resolve disputes.

<dd><b>Further note</b> - A lot of these entries are misleading if not outright wrong. The band O-Zone is not an Internet phenomenon. Colin Mochrie is not an Internet phenomenon.

GassyGuy 22:52, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Keep in mind this article gets <i>daily</i> additions (mainly from anonymous IPs), and it is very difficult to keep track of what are legitimate entries and what are not. The band O-Zone is a questionable addition, yes. They were added because their song became popular due to the "Numa Numa" video. Does that make <i>them</i> a phenom? I don't know. Probably not. Can this entry be deleted, since this is already covered in the "Numa Numa" entry? Probably. And Colin Mochrie <i>is</i> an example of an Internet phenomenon. He is the "mascott" (for lack of a better term) for the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animutation.html" title="Animutation">animutations</a>, appearing in almost every one. I didn't know about this either before reading about it on this article, but then, that's what this article is for. I do think we need to establish standards of what makes something/someone a true Internet phenomenon (it has been discussed, but nothing really set yet), so editors can immediately delete additions that don't meet the qualifications (I would LOVE this job, btw). <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 04:25, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Animutations, whatever those may be, could very well be Internet phenomena. Colin Mochrie may be associated with Animutations. That does not make him an Internet phenomenon. In the same way, Vin Diesel Facts were an Internet phenomenon - Vin Diesel is not. GassyGuy 04:30, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Correct. Article could use a reconstruction/paring down from its current state. Like you said, "Vin Diesel facts" is a phenom, but not "Vin Diesel" himself. Same could be said for animutations and Colin Mochrie. A lot of it probably stems from the "which category here should this go under?" question, which I'm sure arises whenever someone makes an addition. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 04:43, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - The concept that "anything on the Internet" is automatically an Internet phenomenon is a specious claim. If the problem is with the word "phenomenon," then change the name of the article to Internet "fad" or Internet "memes," but don't delete. Article exists for a purpose. Also, article is not original research, as many of the entries <i>have</i> been cited by second party sources (not everything is cited yet, no, but you can't expect that to happen overnight).

<dd>(Addressing the question of the articles purpose) a category is for articles. Not everything should have an article. It's that simple. Some items on the list are not important enough to have their own articles, but they can be "listed" here. If the entry has its own article, by all means, link to it. But not everything that is an "Internet phenomenon" deserves an article. I can't think of any examples except for something like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Star_Wars_droids_dcc6.html" title="List of minor Star Wars droids">List of minor Star Wars droids</a>. Not all of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> "droids" need their own articles, but should probably be mentioned <i>somewhere</i>, so why not put them here? <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 04:34, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've pretty much said all I have to say, but because you and many others have made this point, I will add - I am not of the mind that they "have to be mentioned somewhere" if somewhere means "somewhere on Wikipedia." Not everything needs to be mentioned. It's a pointless fight to attempt to delete the minor droid list, but minor droids sure seem more like Memory Alpha material than encyclopaedic stuff to me. Anyway, my point is, Wikipedia is a good resource, but it's not a one-stop shopping center. It can always include links to relevant offsite sources of information - it does not have to host every little thing. GassyGuy 05:44, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's huge and messy, and I'm sure some people have added thier own crap in the <i>hopes</i> that this will <i>make it</i> an internet phenomenon. But It does offer a good synopsis of various fads and things circulating on the internet. It just needs a huge amount of clean up, wikifying, and patroling by knowledgable people. I recognized about 60% of the list which means that at least that much is accurate. Perhaps there should be some sort of quantitative criteria for inclusion on the list, like number of downloads, reference in mainstream media, or the fad jumping from the internet into popular culture. I don't think a fad that only a very small group recognizes should be able to qualify. - <a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETiki_God_2bc7.html" title="User:Tiki God">Tiki God</a> 15:45, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This list deserves to be deleted in its entirely; it has many faults and is clearly in need of major improvement. Still, would you rather give each of these seperate pages?

<li><b>Keep</b> At the very least, this serves as a useful index of all the articles concerning influences/phenomenon in internet culture. Also, the need for references/sources for this type of subject matter is almost unreasonable, as news reporters/publishers only cover certain things, and aren't even that knowledgable about the Internet in the first place; the news is pre-biased towards events that have been traditionally covered in news that may not be more significant than internet happenings, but are what the old people from the pre-Internet generation want to hear; one can't depend solely upon publications/news for what deserves to be information and what does not. I'm a bit tired right now, so if I didn't make sense up there, just ignore it. But I still think this should be a keep.--<a href="../../../d/c/h/User%7EDch111_7169.html" title="User:Dch111">Dch111</a> 04:05, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
