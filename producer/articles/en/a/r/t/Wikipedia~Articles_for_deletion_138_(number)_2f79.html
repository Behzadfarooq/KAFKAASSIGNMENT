<li>Proof that all integers are interesting (and should be kept?):</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>1 is intersting and notable, OK</li>
<li>Assume k is interesting and notable, need to prove that k+1 is interesting and notable.</li>
<li>If n is interesting and notable, then n+1 is interesting and notable for being one higher than an interesting and notable number.</li>
<li>So k+1 is interesting and notable.</li>
<li>By principle of induction all numbers are interesting and notable, but we do not have space for that unfortunately. But then again Wikipedia is not paper; and someone has expanded this from being a silly joke article to a proper article on numbers.</li>
<li>Conclusion: <s>This article should be <b>deleted</b></s>. 138 is a notable number, not merely notable for not being notable, which would really not be very notable, but since this <i>is</i> notable I will notably change my vote to a notable <b>keep</b>. When someone now makes the <a href="../../../1/3/9/139_%28number%29.html" title="139 (number)">139 (number)</a> article, please do not let it be a silly joke however. <s><a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 08:26, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</s> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 08:42, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If the only way to show an integer is notable is by using the notable integer paradox, then it doesn't deserve its own article. That's not the case with 138. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimeFan_087d.html" title="User:PrimeFan">PrimeFan</a> 22:36, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless someone can articulate what it is prior to expiration of VfD. And I <i>don't</i> mean "138 is the atomic weight of..." or "138 is the route number of the road on which Blue Hills Ski Area is situated." Original article is basically a joke/prank. We've had others, I forget the title but we had a self-instantiating version of Russell's paradox a while back. List of Wikipedia lists that do not include themselves or something. By the way, there is a "Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers" by D. G. Wells, David Wells, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0140261494</a>, that's very good, but I gave my copy to a friend.

<li>P.

It is also the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TriakisTetrahedronStellations.html" class="external text" title="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TriakisTetrahedronStellations.html" rel="nofollow">number of stellations</a> of the Triakis Tetrahedron, which as I'm sure we all know is a nonreticulated frumuflex of the acquipotentiated foithboinder. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:42, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Dpbsmith, I'm saddened that a seasoned wikipedian such as yourself should feel the need to vandalize an article, even one up as a VfD. Just because you feel this article in its original form was unworthy does not mean all of us do. While your pseudohumorous remark was appropriate in this discussion, it is not so in an article. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 23:23, 2005 Mar 17 (UTC)

Whether it was amisunderstanding on his part or a prank I don't know, but if I had seen it I would have reverted. Apologies for having been an indirect agent of damage to an article. Next time I'll insert a smiley. For the record, I've stated above that I think it is very likely that there <i>is</i> something interesting about 138. I just wish people would <i>find</i> the interesting fact before creating an article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:48, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Dpbsmith, your remark that there are 138 stellations of the triakis tetrahedron sounded right enough. I wasn't so sure about frumuflex or foithboinder, but I figured that if it was in fact a joke it would be taken out quickly enough. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnton_Mravcek_8ffd.html" title="User:Anton Mravcek">Anton Mravcek</a> 19:20, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>(Cough) It is not considered a best practice to put material whose meaning you do not understand into an article. If you don't understand the meaning, how can you be sure that the material is accurate?

<li>Twasn't Dpb but another user who took his attempts at humor a bit too seriously.

<li><b>delete</b> - any number you pick out of a hat has an infinite number of "interesting" properties. Doesn't make it notable in any way however. <a href="../../../f/a/w/User%7EFawcett5_8093.html" title="User:Fawcett5">Fawcett5</a> 22:56, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>If that hat has only numbers between 1 and 1024, then you're absolutely right, that number will have "an infinite number of "interesting" properties." Let's say the hat has numbers between 1 and 4294967296. The probability of picking a number with interesting (i.e., non-obvious) properties decreases dramatically. You can probably name lots of interesting properties for say, 123. But how about 123356779? 123 deserves its own article. 123356779 most likely doesn't. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimeFan_087d.html" title="User:PrimeFan">PrimeFan</a> 22:36, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
