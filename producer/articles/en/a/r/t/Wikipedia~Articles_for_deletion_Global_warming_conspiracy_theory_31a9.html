<li>Some beliefs should be ridiculed, although I think Owlofcreamcheese shouldn't be using the word "retarded" since a lot of mentally retarded people have a lot more sense than conspiracy theorists. Conspiracy theorizing, except in limited cases involving limited situations where conspiracies have actually existed, is completely irresponsible and something done by trolls and the mentally unbalanced. Evergreens78 asks "Who are you to call other people's beliefs retarded?" The answer is: Someone with common sense.

<li><b>Delete</b> Per Iceage77. The article states "the claim that the theory that global warming is caused by humans is a conscious fraud, perpetuated for financial or ideological reasons" can be described as a conspiracy theory. It cannot. I've never heard it labeled as such, except in few journalistic instances in British newspapers.

<li>Can you please direct me to the policy or guideline that tells us "Informative alone suffices for inclusion". Or any variation on that phrase? The controversy surrounding whether or not Global Warming exists is very real. That there is some kind of <i>conspiracy</i> is questionable, and there are no sources to support this statement. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 23:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Wait,</b> this article doesn't assert the conspiracy theory has any validity, only that the propagation of the conspiracy theory, itself, is an ongoing phenomenon; that's what's documented.

<li>Why do you keep saying "there are no sources"? The article quotes sources including Channel 4,the BBC, and Washington Post, all of which refer directly to a conspiracy or conspiracy theory. By all means criticise the sources, but denying that they are there does not seem to provide any basis for discussion.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 00:20, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Because only one of the working links actually refer to a "conspiracy theory" (and only once, at that).

<li><b>Comment</b> To facilitate NPOV treatment of the topic, I've added a section on Counterarguments, which currently read "Because the term is often regarded as pejorative (see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a>), advocates of the view that global warming theory is a conscious fraud often reject the characterization of their views as a "conspiracy theory". <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>".

<li>That's dumb. I'm sorry, but it just is. What do you want? A scientific paper saying, "we reject AGW, but this isn't a conspiracy theory!!!" Of course not. Why? Because no one labels them as conspiracy theorists besides overzealous journalists. Scinetists are not obliged to reply to such nonsense. These are bona fide scientists making valid claims that are published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Don't confuse the two. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 17:57, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Read the article. It does not say that criticism of global warming theory (whether published in a scientific journal or not) constitutes a conspiracy theory. It quotes various people (mostly not scientists) presenting, in mass media, the theory that global warming theory is a fraud/scam/swindle perpetrated by sinister interests, and others criticising them as putting forward a conspiracy theory. If this criticism is incorrect, they might reasonably respond.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 20:41, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> By the way, I'm sympathetic to the idea that global warming has been oversold by a bunch of environmentalist hacks in concert with left-wing environmentalist loonies, irresponsible cultural elitists, government bureaucrats and scientists who want to mine this as a source of future paychecks and European diplomats looking for a way to mug the United States without leaving fingerprints. I'm not yet sure where I stand on global warming itself. <s>That said, here's why this article is wrongheaded:</s></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><s><b>Title</b> It doesn't describe a "conspiracy". At points it describes various "conspiracies." It also describes conflicts of interest as well as narrow-minded ideologues doing what narrow-minded ideologues do. <i>That does not add up to a conspiracy. It doesn't even add up to a collection of conspiracies.</i> It is unfair to call it a conspiracy or only conspiracies. That's <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> if you're drawing the conclusion that any of the items in this sorry article are conspiracies when that hasn't even been alleged. And when you pile them all up in a giant heap, you add fuel to the overheated brains of conspiracy theorists who are off their paranoia medication. Wikipedia Is Not An Asylum.</s></li>
<li><s><b>Indiscriminate</b> This isn't an article. It's an indiscriminate list of different types of things tied together because they disparage, rightly or wrongly, the pro-global warming crowd: fictional representation; the use of the word in a TV documentary that apparently just uses it in tabloid fashion to get viewers (and admits it really isn't about a conspiracy after it hooks in the viewers); and charges or critiques of various sorts (sometimes using "conspiracy" for shock value). Wikipedia Is Not Tabloid Journalism.</s></li>
<li><s><b>POV fork</b> The real subject of this article could be titled something like "Charges of improper actions against global warming activists". I have no doubt some of those improper actions exist and I'm all for covering them. But there's a place for that: in fact there are a number of places for that in proper Wikipedia articles. And when you can't find a place for a <b>specific</b> charge of conspiracy or other improper activity, you create either a specific article that meets notability standards because the subject of the article has been the subject of at least two independent, responsible sources that you can cite (<i><b>surely</b></i> not impossible to do if the charge has even an airy whiff of plausibility to it, and if not, <i>wait until it does before sticking it in an encyclopedia.</i>), or come up with an article that can link them all together in a responsible way. Wikipedia Is Not Advocacy Journalism.</s></li>
<li><s><b>Irresponsible</b> Treat the other side as you would wish to be treated yourself. Even if you just want to be an effective partisan, irresponsible charges always hurt your cause in the long run, usually in the medium run and sometimes even in the short run. There's nothing wrong with making sure political views and even noteworthy, responsible accusations of wrongdoing are represented in the encyclopedia. But your customers have a finely tuned ear for what seems irresponsible. When you toss around pejorative words like "conspiracy", "racism", "sexism", "unpatriotic" and the like you denigrate the responsible allegations against those for whom those words actually apply. You use those words only when you can offer specific proof and when you report on others who use them, you do it with specific citations. And you carefully describe the charges, showing how they've been presented and by whom and what reasons or evidence have been offered for them, if any. Yes, Wikipedia only reports what others have said, but it reports responsibily or it's not worthy of the name of an encyclopedia. Is it? Wikipedia Is Not A Pedestal For Calumny.</s></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><s>At the very least, the name of this article needs to be changed. If "conspiracies" is kept in the title, then all nonconspiracies need to be eliminated from the article. Personally, I don't have any hope at all that it will become an encyclopedic article in any form. And if any editor has added to this article with the purest of intentions, I apologize for not assuming good faith, but there appear to be very obvious patterns to the way this page has been built. That's not a conspiracy, it's human frailty.</s> <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 18:39, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I misread it. I take it back. I looked at the article again and my revised view is below. I didn't realize what the point of this irresponsible article was. But even if I'm still wrong in understanding the point of it, after looking through the sources, it seems to me that the article is using them irresponsibly.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 00:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All the references in the paper refer to the claim you describe in your opening para, namely that environmentalists, scientists and others have acted in concert to promote a theory they know to be false, on the basis of ideological or financial motives. This alleged concerted action has been referred to as a conspiracy on several occasions, as cited (three references were given - I apologise for the referencing problem that may have obscured this, and thank you for fixing it). More frequently, such claims have been described by critics as "conspiracy theories". The predominantly pejorative nature of the usage is noted right in the first sentence. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 20:54, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Oh, I get it. This is a way to attack the global warming skeptics. The more I follow the links, the more horrible this article looks; sometimes the sloppiness is evident right on the page:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>"The Greenhouse Conspiracy" documentary on Channel 4 in Britain: "It may not quite add up to a conspiracy, but [...]"</li>
<li>The quote from the Cooler Heads Coalition says of someone who criticized another skeptic of promoting a conspiracy theory: "Sounds plausible to us." That was the last line in their press release (or whatever announcement it was on their Web site). Absolutely nothing in the words that precede that statement shows that they seriously believe it's a conspiracy. The quoted statement was a rhetorical flourish (irresponsible, in my opinion, but not a claim that there's a conspiracy).</li>
<li>The Washington Post "article" is a Sunday magazine piece that engages, more than most, in rhetorical flourishes of its own and doesn't pretend to be objective. It characterizes the statement of a skeptic as a "conspiracy theory" but the quote used to back it up (shown in the WP article) could be interpreted as either describing a conspiracy theory or describing ideologues run amok. A couple of paragraphs before, the author writes that both sides have their own charges of a "conspiracy theory, of a sort." <i>Of a sort???</i>. Let's change the title of this article to Global warming conspiracy theories of a sort.</li>
<li>"The general claim that the theory of global warming is a lie promoted by members of one or more interest groups <b>secretly acting in concert for dishonest purposes</b> has been made on a number of occasions [...]" (emphasis added). The problem is that none of the citations back this up:
<ol>
<li>On its Web page, the Oregon Petition does say global warming is "a lie" but doesn't say it's a conspiracy of groups "secretly acting in concert for dishonest purposes"</li>
<li>Melanie Philips calls global warming theory (in 2004) a "fraud". An irresponsible rhetorical flourish, not a charge of a conspiracy.</li>
<li>Same with Martin Dirkin calling it "a lie ... the biggest scam of modern times." Nothing else in the article where this quote comes from supports the idea that Dirkin actually thinks there's a conspiracy of groups "secretly acting in concert for dishonest purposes." What we have is another rhetorical flourish from a filmmaker hawking his movie.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And what we have overall is an article that is full of holes and not worth keeping. Overheated rhetoric is not conspiracy theorizing. Writing Wikipedia articles is not propagandizing. Or at least it's not supposed to be.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 00:40, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There is a differences between critics of he conventional scientific view, and those who think it a deliberate internationalist ( or whatever ) plot. This is a fair documentation of the latter. The critics have every right to have their views fairly represented objectively and treated seriously. The reader can safely be left to judge the merits. The conspiracy theorists have also the right for their views to be presented fairly, and if a fair presentation leaves them somewhat silly, that's not the fault of the recorder who describes what they say. Any detailed problem of NPOV on a particular point is for the talk page. That there are such theories is real, and unfortunately the theories are notable. The possibility that they might be right is for them to prove, and we show what the say they have proved. Again, the reader can be safely left to judge. We deal with all such pseudo scientific views the same way as we do scientific ones, so we don't have to decide which is which. If they are publicly notable, we present them. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Right, leave it to the reader to judge when the article name is conspiracy theory. There's a distinct difference between theory and conspiracy theory. Saying the CIA killed JFK is conspiracy theory. Saying the Sun's variations have a real impact on Earth's climate while presenting discernible evidence is a theory. In fact, there's also a legitimate article on the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming_controversy.html" title="Global warming controversy">global warming controversy</a>, no where in which so-called conspiracy theories are mentioned.

<li><b>Comment</b> As you say, the solar variation theory is not a conspiracy theory, which is why it isn't mentioned in the article. The claim that the whole theory of global warming is a swindle/scam/fraud with many participants is (at least in the view of those accused of being participants) a conspiracy theory, and hence it is mentioned.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 06:00, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Oh no you don't, JQ. Where's the proof in the article that we've got multiple conspiracy <b>theories</b> instead of over-the-top rhetoric? It's easy to see the difference: Someone with a conspiracy theory would explain the details, try to show proof of what was going on behind the scenes, name names. Someone with a theory would get into it more. No one's doing that, at least not so far as a reader could tell from either the article or its sources. Conspiracy theorists act altogether differently from people going too far in their rhetoric. The theorists generally can't get elaborate enough; the others make a passing reference and jump on to the next point (just like they do in the source material for this article). I'm not asking for the equivalent of UFO conferences, the books on how the theory works, the intricate diagrams of the grassy knoll: Just give me someone with something more than a rhetorical tic.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 06:21, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>I see UBeR's got you literally surrounded, DGG, and he brings up an excellent point: there's no proof whatever that there's any conspiracy <b>theory</b> here. And my comments above are better addressed in a deletion discussion rather than a talk page because the problems are so pervasive in the article that they can't be fixed. Take out all the irrepairable passages and there's only a whisp of an article left. What remains is too weak to sustain what the article says exists. I'm sure that somewhere some nutcases have actual theories to go with this article. But it would have to be shown that the <b>theories</b> — the actual crackpot beliefs, not some over-the-top rhetoric — have attained enough notability for a Wikipedia article. Show us evidence that that's likely to happen and I'll change my mind to "Keep", or join us in deleting this article. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 06:21, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - As it has been pointed out above, few or even no source at all speak of a conspiracy theory per se. But I would agree that there exists enough material to introduce the idea of a "Global warming hoax". I have added some material in this regard. This title would help solve the POV issue (conspiracy theory is pejorative, as the author himself pointed out). Also, if this article is to be kept, it must focus on the fact that some skeptics or other people have found grounds to believe that climate science is not used for its stated aims or is being "hijacked" by special interests, rather than to focus on accusing skeptics of being "conspiracy theorists", since then the POV fork accusation would hold. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChildhoodsend_bd14.html" title="User:Childhoodsend">Childhood's End</a> 16:07, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>If every time some controversialist uses the word "scam" and "hoax" we have a full-fledged conspiracy being described, then: "go to hell" would always be a serious wish to see someone condemned to everlasting damnation; "I could kill you" would always be a threat; "get outta here" would always be an invitation to leave; "son of a bitch" would always be a comment on that person's mother, etc. etc. etc. JQ, you're displaying the same problem in this discussion as in the article itself: you're being slippery with terms. If conspiracies are really being alleged, it shouldn't be too hard to back that up. As I say, conspiracy nuts shout from the rooftops and post on the Web.

<li>Maybe we should clarify terms here. I have no doubt that most of the sources I'm quoting (for example, Inhofe, Melanie Phillips, WorldNetDaily) are alleging conscious fraud as opposed to applying a rhetorical flourish to a claim that people's views on this issue are influenced by their general political position. The statement has been made too many times, in too strong terms, to be a mere flourish. Are you disagreeing with this, or are you endorsing <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a>'s position that 'The article states "the claim that the theory that global warming is caused by humans is a conscious fraud, perpetuated for financial or ideological reasons" can be described as a conspiracy theory.

The behind-the-scene mastermind is named as Maurice Strong, who's described as being " best known as the godfather of the environmental movement, who served from 1973-1975 as the founding director of the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) in Nairobi. UNEP is now a globe-girdling organization with a yearly budget of $136 million, which claims to act as the world’s environmental conscience. Strong consolidated his eco-credentials as the organizer of the U.N.’s 1992 environmental summit in Rio de Janeiro, which in turn paved the way for the controversial 1997 Kyoto Treaty on controlling greenhouse gas emissions." As you'd expect, the details are far too complicated to summarise (Iraq, China, NK, SK and Ted Turner all get a run) but part of the claim is that Strong is pushing Kyoto so China can profit from trade in emissions credits.

<li>The solution to POV problems is not to suppress points-of-view. The NPOV solution is to include the POV you describe and the alternative POV, citing the overwhelming majority of scientists who point to the mountains of factual evidence in favour of AGW and say that any rational person would be convinced by it.

The latter (given the large number of people who have to be involved) is plausibly described as a conspiracy theory, especially when the article documents numerous unequivocally conspiracy-theoretic statements of the same view. However, some people (you and Noroton, for example) may want to draw a distinction between "hoax/fraud/swindle involving thousands of participants" and "conspiracy". The article mentions this and there is a stubby section where citations to this POV can be included.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 02:31, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Precisely. You explain it well: "'AGW theory is a hoax' . . . is plausibly described as a conspiracy theory." Note the word "plausibly." I'm sorry, but Wikipedia is not here for you to draw conclusions on people's thoughts. Just because you think people calling AGW a hoax is a conspiracy theory doesn't mean you get your own article to say because this person denies AGW he's a conspiracy theorist. That isn't how Wikipedia works. See <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, specifically, <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a>. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 04:40, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Which is why the article makes no OR claims and cites notable and verifiable sources who have described it quite directly as a conspiracy theory - notwithstanding your attempt to claim that a leading figure in the IPCC and journalists writing for major news sources are not notable . Of course, if you are serious about the claim that three sources aren't enough, give a number and I'll be happy to meet it, at the expense of added listiness. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 10:21, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>You have 3 people calling two documents conspiracy theories. What you're doing is turning that into anything that is critical of AGW is a conspiracy theory. Wikipedia doesn't allow that. P.S. I said or implied the founder of International Society for Science and Religion is non-notable&gt; he's a scientist, but that brings up another point: Is it a scientist's job to determining what is a conspiracy theory? I'm pretty sure that's beyond the scope of science, but that's neither here nor there. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 17:36, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, so I've added a very prominent Minister in the UK government whose portfolio covers the area in question, referring specifically to conspiracy theories. Does that change your view on this point, or (as I'm coming to believe) would no evidence of any kind change your view&#160;?<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 20:21, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>You can have all the evidence you want, but you still can't use that evidence for the synthesis. This is laid out in <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a>. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 01:26, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
