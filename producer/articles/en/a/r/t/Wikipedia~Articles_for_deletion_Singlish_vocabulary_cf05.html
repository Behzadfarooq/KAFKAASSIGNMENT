<li>I understand your argument. Nonethelss, the list does not intend to list every word in Singlish, but rather it lists only selected and representative words. A detailed Singlish lexicon can be found in <a href="http://www.singlishdictionary.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.singlishdictionary.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.singlishdictionary.com/</a> and it is hugh. The Afded-article only consists of a small and illustrative subset of the most common words. And we try to relate it to Singapore's history and culture. In addition, the etymology of some words is also provided where it would be interesting and informative. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 04:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The difference is that urbandictionary is full of made-up shit. Half the stuff that's "real" is less than 10 years old. The stuff in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singlish_vocabulary.html" title="Singlish vocabulary">Singlish vocabulary</a> existed before most of its practitioners were born, and it's well studied by linguists. My impression is that both linguists and "native speakers of Singlish" (if that concept makes sense) maintain the articles. While I don't particularly endorse the use of singlish, it's not really comparable to slang. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 06:32, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The linguists consider Singlish a pidgin. How is it relevant that it's not a formal version of English? And where was that disputed anyhow?

<li>I mentioned that it was not a formal version of English and thus a type of slang, since you stated earlier on that Singlish was "not really comparable to slang." Either way, how does it make sense that a dicdef stub can violate the <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> policy, yet a list of dicdefs do not? According to your interpretation of <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>, any dicdef could bypass the <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> policy if written longer than a stub or in list form. Also, though the article doesn't seem to violate any list <i>guidelines</i> (note there are no policies on lists), it does however violate the "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>" policy.--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 15:15, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes but a Singlish dictionary would be too specific and no one who wants to find out what Singlish is about quickly will have the time to go through a Singlish dictionary. This article is meant to give readers a general understanding of Singlish based on a representative list of words. It is not simply a list of dictionary definitions. Dictionary definitions don't usually explain how the terms came about. --<a href="../../../h/s/c/User%7EHschin_8771.html" title="User:Hschin">Han Sheng</a> 19:06, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. What does it mean to be a "representative list" of words? How were some words and phrases chosen as "representative" and others excluded? For example, I don't see what telling someone that "gabra" means "very confused" tells them other than the meaning of the word. I also think you'll find that any dictionary worth its salt <i>does</i> explain how a term came about; see <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/confused" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/confused" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for example. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 19:17, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Whether words are representative or not are not determined by just one person. That is exactly why this article is here for others to contribute. This article is still a work in progress. The words that simply list their definitions are still being worked on and I have yet to find additional information for these entries. These words are simply left-over from when this article was still a section in the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singlish.html" title="Singlish">Singlish</a> page. It was never my intention to make this page a plain list of Singlish vocab and their definitions. I'm working hard to clean it up and make it more useful to wikipedia. That's also the reason why i added the clean-up tag to the top of the list. --<a href="../../../h/s/c/User%7EHschin_8771.html" title="User:Hschin">Han Sheng</a> 19:51, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the problem is that many people who are actually proposing to delete this article don't understand what Singlish is about at all. Some might think that Singlish is something arbitiary formed from throwing together words from a few other languages. Fact is, Singlish has been around for more then 40 years, since Singapore's coloial days, and has slowly been evolving till its current stage today. It is not possible just to "work a few examples into the text of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singlish.html" title="Singlish">Singlish</a>" as it would not be representative. Furthermore, this page originated from the article on <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singlish.html" title="Singlish">Singlish</a> and was split because the page was growing too long. If this page is to be deleted and a few examples were put back into the article on <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singlish.html" title="Singlish">Singlish</a>, the page would start growing too long again as more and more people add their examples. There are many similar pages available on Wikipedia, such as <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_vocabulary_8951.html" title="Australian English vocabulary">Australian English vocabulary</a>, and they exist undisturbed. I'm not sure why there is a sort of double standard being practised here. I feel that this issue should be left to Wikipedians based in Singapore to decide whether this page is representative of Singlish and will help others in the understanding of Singlish. --<a href="../../../h/s/c/User%7EHschin_8771.html" title="User:Hschin">Han Sheng</a> 15:38, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I know what Singlish is la so please don't try to insult my intelligence. I have about half a passport full of SG entry/exit stamps. Delete the examples if they get too many. It's cruft. I know the problem, we get the same problem at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> where newbies try to add every factlet under the sun about the group, but it's something we have to deal with. Singlish is an important English dialect which requires an article, but it's not so important that we have to breach <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and become a dictionary. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 16:39, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Also, no matter how long Singlish has been around, the article is still nothing more than just a list of Singlish dictionary definitions, which is a violation of the <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> policy. Other related vocabulary pages continue to exist because they describe <i>grammar, history, and background</i> , whereas this article simply <i>lists the definition every single Singlish related expression</i>, which as I mentioned before violates <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>. As for your comment stating that "that this issue should be left to Wikipedians based in Singapore", please remember that Wikipedia (being a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">Wiki</a>) is a <i>community</i> based project, thus issues are resolved among the Wikipedian community, not just a select group of users. --<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 16:49, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure how (as an example) <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_vocabulary_8951.html" title="Australian English vocabulary">Australian English vocabulary</a> differs from this page. How does it describe "grammar, history and background"? Anyway, I apologise if I stepped on a few toes while putting forward my argument on keeping this article. I'm still not too familiar about how things work around here as this is my first time participating in an Afd discussion. I see my mistake in suggesting that only Wikipedians based in Singapore should decide this matter. However, i hope that Singapore-based Wikipedians will have something valuable to contribute on the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singlish_vocabulary.html" title="Singlish vocabulary">Singlish vocabulary</a> page so as to make the information worth keeping on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../h/s/c/User%7EHschin_8771.html" title="User:Hschin">Han Sheng</a> 18:15, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, I was referring to other vocabulary articles, such as the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_vocabulary.html" title="Spanish vocabulary">Spanish vocabulary</a> or <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_vocabulary.html" title="Turkish vocabulary">Turkish vocabulary</a> articles, which do contain segments on grammar, history, background, etc. Either way though, I suggest that Australian English vocabulary be nominated as well for deletion, as it too seems to be a list of dicdefs.--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 18:56, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b>. Current state of article is appalling, but it should not be deleted just because of the lists - remove them and provide better detail.

Leet speak, a fictional language invented by online gamers, has its own comprehensive article.

If this <i>"article was nominated, not because it was a list, but because it consists of <b>only</b> <b>dictionary definitions</b>"</i>, then I must presume the 566 words in the introduction are either invisible to them or are considered worthy for deletion as well?
