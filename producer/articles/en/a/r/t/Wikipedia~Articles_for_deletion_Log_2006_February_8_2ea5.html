<dd>Just a wild guess... It's using the arabic alphabet, so I'll guess... arabic? It could also be Farsi, I think, but it's probably arabic.

<li><b>Clear Keep</b>. Plainly not a vanity article; original author contributed to many related articles and did not insert references to Winer, as would be expected of vanity author.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Actually, if you check the other edits, you should realize that they are almost universally linkspam to Lwiner's personal site. However, if you would like to rewrite the article as a non-vanity piece, feel free to do so. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 04:56, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b>. You're right about Winer being the principal author of the article, and I failed to catch that a few of the edits in the author's history went to the user page rather than the article. But none of the vanity aspects of the article outweigh Winer's lead role in a newsworthy event -- the 401(k) control controversy, which was treated as notable by several external sources. Bad behavior by the subject of an article on Wikipedia doesn't justify the deletion of an article on a notable subject, even though his notability may be in a very narrow field. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 05:21, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comments</b> - The article seems, by virtue of its content, to not be subject to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. If this holds true, then it has no place here. However, a few caveats are worth mentioning:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>We have the <a href="../../../o/e/r/Oera_Linda_2220.html" title="Oera Linda">Oera Linda book</a> with its own article at Wikipedia. The Odin Brotherhood and the <a href="../../../o/e/r/Oera_Linda_2220.html" title="Oera Linda">Oera Linda book</a> appear to be equal to each other in terms of factual content (id est, they are both fiction), according to the nature of their sources. I would not mind having The Odin Brotherhood here with its own article if <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> can be satisfied. I doubt that will happen, as Dr. Mirabello's book seems about as verifiable as <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guido_Karl_Anton_List_ebae.html" title="Guido Karl Anton List">Guido Karl Anton List</a>'s personal gnosis concerning the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armanen.html" title="Armanen">Armanen</a> runes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>

I base that judgement on having read the book itself, my education in relevant subjects, and finally on the rules governing Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../o/d/i/Odinism.html" title="Odinism">Odinism</a> is, to my POV, a valid variant of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_neopaganism.html" title="Germanic neopaganism">Germanic neopaganism</a> in our time, and to grant The Odin Brotherhood the status of being a valid academic reference, or even a commonly used spiritual source text for that religion would be quite inaccurate.</li>

<p>Tracking all mentions of an entry or link across wikipedia and deleting them before the AfD is even completed is a form of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">harassment</a>. I also perceive users placing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Odin_Brotherhood&amp;oldid=38707565" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Odin_Brotherhood&amp;oldid=38707565" rel="nofollow">7 warning templates</a> on the entry as a form of malicious harassment. There seems to be a total lack of <i><a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">civility</a></i> by many here, as well as the most severe violations of <i><a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">attacking new comers</a></i> which I have ever seen. The editor has less than 25 edits, and has only been a member of wikipedia for three days. He doesn't even know how to sign his name with four tildes (look at the top of this page). This entry was not even 10 minutes old, before it was submitted for AfD. I think we need to wait and see if he is going to add further content, verifiable sources and clean up the entry - or whether it should be merged into another article. Contrary to what has been stated here, I have heard about this alleged secret society elsewhere in print and even on a radio show. Correct me if I'm wrong, but <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">Dab</a> and myself are in fact the only editors who have voted in this AfD who have edited or contributed content at wikipedia about <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_Neopaganism_ae65.html" title="Germanic Neopaganism">Germanic Neopaganism</a>, <a href="../../../%C3%A1/s/a/%C3%81satr%C3%BA.html" title="Ásatrú">Ásatrú</a>, <a href="../../../o/d/i/Odinism.html" title="Odinism">Odinism</a>, <a href="../../../o/d/i/Odinic_Rite_ba67.html" title="Odinic Rite">Odinic Rite</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polytheistic_reconstructionism.html" title="Polytheistic reconstructionism">Polytheistic Reconstructionsim</a>, etc. and I feel that those who have not contributed to these subjects <i>do not know if it is relevant or not</i> because they don't know the subject matter whatsoever.

<li>Some well made points HroptR and I apologise to Mr Mirabello for biting... Still, as the creator of the page is clearly monitoring the debate one might reasonably expect any changes to happen quickly. We all appreciate very few among us have knowledge of this, perhaps because it is an inherently niche topic. We all want to promote our own interests (and commercial publications) but don't lose sight of whether this is really a topic for WP... It's a promo for a book, and would need to be completely rewritten to become some kind of objective article about the society, a society which you state is "alleged" to exist, and therefore doesn't sound extremely verifiable. ++<a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz">Deiz</a> 18:55, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have gone through and done a quick wikification of the article, so it is a book entry and not an advertisement.

<li><b>Comment</b> The cleanup is better, but I still have a few reservations about this article. The excerpt section is overly long, and in my opinion unecessary. See <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Jesus_Mysteries_5866.html" title="The Jesus Mysteries">The Jesus Mysteries</a> for a better example of how this article could be done. Also, the controversy section is POV, basically attempting to defend the lack of sources by casting aspersions on the sourcing of unrelated works. Most importantly, I'm still not convinced this book has reached the threshold of notability. There are no set standards for books that I'm aware of like <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, so it's a judgement call.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:58, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am planning to nominate the Mark Mirabello page for deletion this evening as it is <s>an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAuto-biography_0a7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Auto-biography">autobiography</a> of</s> a non-notable person. The book remains non-notable, it claims to be non-fictional, but without any verification and consequently not a usefull contribution to wikipedia. There is no indication that the website is from someone else than Mark Mirabello, or that any of the advertisments, or radio interviews were with anybody else than Mark Mirabello himself (there is documentation of a radio interview with him). Neither have I gotten any verification from within the Asatru or Odinist community that this group exists (some responses still pending). If he, or others provide verification for the non-fictional aspect of the book (or I get word from others within the community), I would reconsider whether there is potential of a seperate article on the brotherhood themselves. If not, it appear to be fictional work sold as non-fiction. Until then, I remain for deletion of the page as nom. --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">KimvdLinde</a> 20:13, 8 February 2006 (UTC) Edited error on my site --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">KimvdLinde</a> 14:27, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>So you are advocating <i>purging</i> all reference to him on wikipedia? You stated: <i>Neither have I gotten any verification from within the Asatru or Odinist community that this group exists</i> which community would this be? I don't think the argument is whether the group exists or not, but whether mention of <i>a book</i> should be purged because the content is questionable. Deleting the biography just seems like sheer malice. <a href="../../../h/r/o/User%7EHroptR_9ca5.html" title="User:HroptR">HroptR</a> 20:33, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep but rewrite</b> There are only about 10 University libraries worldwide that own this book. That's 10 more than any book I ever wrote, but its not a ringing endorsement either. Would it be acceptable to rewrite the article so it wasn't about the book but about the "Odin Brotherhood" as a possibly imaginery movement, listing the book as the source. That way it's not just a book advert any more. If somebody does hear about the Odin Brotherhood somewhere and tries to investigate at WP they would find an entry explaining where the term originated and why it is highly suspect. WP must have an article on Bigfoot, which probably doesn't exist either, right?<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:56, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hey AdelaMae. I don't think any recons would subscribe to the <i>Odin Brotherhood</i> just because of the occult elements and secret society bit. For what it's worth, it is on the reading list of several <i>neo-heathen</i> Asatru /Odinist groups like the <a href="http://www.runestone.org/rdgs.html" class="external text" title="http://www.runestone.org/rdgs.html" rel="nofollow">AFA</a> with a blurb: <i>"a fascinating, poetic, visionary, and many suspect, metaphorical, look at Odinic religion"</i> and is mentioned on several Asatru webistes and forums briefly like <a href="http://users.frii.com/asacat/" class="external text" title="http://users.frii.com/asacat/" rel="nofollow">this one</a>. The radio show from <i>Odin Lives</i> linked in the article goes into the works impact as well as the veracity of the order. I just think it is a poor precedent to delete fringe authors because their works or beliefs aren't seen as valuable to the mainstream. Many subcultures are not highly represented on the internet. <a href="../../../h/r/o/User%7EHroptR_9ca5.html" title="User:HroptR">HroptR</a> 20:14, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a secret society. Perhaps it will be hard to find a critical historical study of it. In answer to AdelaMae's criteria "B" the Asatru Alliance considers this work to be important enought to include in in their suggested reading list of contemporary works.

Recommended reading lists from the <a href="../../../a/s/a/Asatru_Alliance_bfea.html" title="Asatru Alliance">Asatru Alliance</a> are not particularly relevant to whether the article on The Odin Brotherhood is worth retaining here at Wikipedia. If the AA decides to laud Dr. Mirabello's work as sacred scripture/divinely inspired/whatever (which I doubt they would ever decide to do), then it would be a different matter entirely. A very small religious organisation recommending a book as being 'interesting' and 'possibly useful' does not give a book inherent credibility or verifiability.

<ul>
<li>Different retailers calculate their ranks based on <b>completely different formulae</b>. Amazon.com is an often used standard, so when an Amazon.com sales rank is quoted, it is being compared to other products with Amazon sales ranks, <b>not</b> the same product's sales rank on a completely different site. As you will see if you become a more experienced WP user, Buy.com ranks are not considered any kind of standard measure by Wikipedia editors. Your post also sounds like an advertising jingle. On those two counts you might want to strike that one. <b><font style="verdana" color="#990099">++D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#9900CC">iz</font></b> 02:00, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to prove here 146.85.127.124. If you're suggesting that new sources have come to light which will enable you (you're clearly some kind of expert) to write an encyclopedic, verifiable, unbiased and objective article on this topic then maybe you should stop piling stuff onto this AfD page and <b>DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE ARTICLE WHICH HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR DELETION</b>. The majority of editors on this page know nothing and care even less about Odinism. What we do want to see are submissions which belong in Wikipedia. As it stands the article flies in the face of several of WP's criteria for inclusion and if you tot up the opinions of experienced editors (per the warning at the top of the page and the "Notes to new editors" piece by HroptR, several "editors" opinions will be discounted due to the evidence of sockpuppetry) you'll see the article could do with less hot air and more hard work. <b><font style="verdana" color="#990099">++D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#9900CC">iz</font></b> 01:32, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm wondering if this meets the notability criteria. It is mainly a social club at a university, which is typically concerned with the consumption of alcohol??

<li>Thankyou for the compliment Blnguyen. Kino, if you had examined the logs, you would see that the edits such as <i>contact us</i> and <i>our website</i> were done by a different user to the main editor of the page (that is, me). To those who say most of the socities activities relate to pub crawls, this is partly true - they hold a single pubcrawl which is quite large, however, that is by no means the limit of the scope of this page. As the page is still being written, I ask everyone to give it a chance.

<li><b>Keep</b> 1) It's a recent article, and certain obvious elements (References page, Links page) are not yet included - still under construction, so unfair to criticize it for lacking elements. This violates the "assume good faith" part in the Wikipedia AfD Page. Also, I'm a new user, so I'd appreciate some more time to get used to Wikipedia and clean up the article before everyone decides to demolish it. 2) First two references on the page demonstrate the validity of the basic claims of the article. The references aren't well documented yet, but the pre-existence of the concepts is, if you read the first two links. 3) User who nominated this page for deletion, <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a>, seems to have both a personal problem with the article, and a history of being an extremely biased Wikipedia user in general (see his profile for more info). After a brief discussion, he refused to commmunicate further and immediately opted for deletion. See Talk:Quality Utilitarianism. 4) Concept <i>by name</i> isn't more than 5 years old, and not very strongly spread by name into most Utilitarian talks. Just like the esoteric topic "Set-Theoretic Models of Disjunctive Operators", not getting what you look for in 20 Google hits doesn't at all provide a good argument that it isn't a pre-established topic. <a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwiffy_3605.html" title="User:Twiffy">Twiffy</a> 18:25, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Articles need to adhere to Wikipedia policy from the very beginning. In particular, you need to cite verifiable proof that "Quality Utilitarianism" is a current term, and not something you made up. Relax - you have 5 days. And if you can't do it in 5 days, copy the page to your user space before then - maybe at <a href="../../../t/w/i/User_talk%7ETwiffy_Quality_Utilitarianism_3916.html" title="User talk:Twiffy/Quality Utilitarianism">User talk:Twiffy/Quality Utilitarianism</a> and keep working on it there until it meets Wikipedia policy.

<li><b>Userfy</b> is what I would have done. Andrew, consider this: person comes along and creates article on themself. Maybe cluelessly, maybe deliberate vanity.

I would say that the trivial effort in doing 2 is justified if as many as 1 in 100 people go on to contribute properly instead of just walking away. I haven't userfied my 100th yet so I don't know if that is going to happen, I am a notorious idealist.

<li><b>Dont delete</b>. ZGeek.com is a Third Party Source.

That thread has a number of "third party sources", that will verify that people have actually partaken in this "holiday". Wikipedia being the first party, myself being the second party, and ZGeek.com being the third party, thus justifiably making any form of "personal assertions" a valid confirmation. I see that this is all about a "majority", and how can you critisise this if you've never heard of it? You've all heard of Talk like a Pirate day, because people got the word out. We are trying to get the word out, so in effect, you're generating a nice big slab of hyprocracy and supression on the internet. Non-notable?

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm agreeing with ViralMonkey here. There is no reason why this should be taken off because it is not hurting anyone. An encyclopedia is a database of knowledge. In order for it to be complete it must have an article about everything. This has never been achieved and won't be for a long time but if you take off this article you are just moving wikipedia farther from that goal. And just because this is a fansite doesn't mean it should be removed. Just go to the main page and do a search on "Fan Site" and 11 pages of matches will come up. --<a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfrommars_b33d.html" title="User:Edfrommars">Eddie</a> 23:06, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>As I've said, Google hits are very unindicative of a person's notablity when based in Australia. For example, search for "Mark Doran journalist", and of the 300 hits there you will find very little related to <i>the</i> Mark Doran who is a very big sportscaster in Australia. The fact that Mark Doran is a common name boosts his hits, it's unfortunate than Jantzen has a unique name&#160;;)&#160;:p <b><a href="../../../a/f/l/WP%7EAFL_72f6.html" title="WP:AFL"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rogerthat_2a3b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rogerthat"><font color="red">o</font></a><a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerthat_6fee.html" title="User:Rogerthat"><font color="darkblue">gerthat</font></a></b> <i><sup><a href="../../../r/o/g/User_talk%7ERogerthat_5be9.html" title="User talk:Rogerthat"><font color="black">Talk</font></a></sup></i> 10:13, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm Australian and I'm unconvinced by that argument. There aren't that many more Canadians that Australians. I follow sports fairly closely in Australia and I've never heard of Mark Doran. I hadn't heard of Jantzen either. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 11:13, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Not hearing of Jantzen, I'll give you some leeway, although most sports fans should certinaly know him. But not hearing of Doran makes me question your interest in sports because he is a big name in journalism, radio and TV. That was just an example the Max Walker one, but there are many American journalists you could search for that are as notable or less notable than Jantzen that would get a much higher number of Google hits for the simple fact they are based in America where there is information on everyone. Australia doesn't have a huge presence on the Net compared to America. Search for "AFL DVD's" and the game's huge popularity does not give the expected amount of hits. <b><a href="../../../a/f/l/WP%7EAFL_72f6.html" title="WP:AFL"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rogerthat_2a3b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rogerthat"><font color="red">o</font></a><a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerthat_6fee.html" title="User:Rogerthat"><font color="darkblue">gerthat</font></a></b> <i><sup><a href="../../../r/o/g/User_talk%7ERogerthat_5be9.html" title="User talk:Rogerthat"><font color="black">Talk</font></a></sup></i> 10:34, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Personally, I think the profile of Christian should stay there as he does virtually everything from down here in Melbourne and he does a good job at it as well. His general knowledge of sport is great and he isn't afraid to have a go at reporting on lesser known sports, for example he did a gret job covering the World Gymnastics Championships including an exclusive interview with Western Australia gymnast Olivia Vivian and her parents. --Ben.carbonaro 10:45, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia doesn't need comments like that either. Obviously AfD can be heated, but it's not a count of votes.

<p><s>Delete for two reasons. One, this is definitely already a promotional article, no matter how one salvages it, and wikipedia is not a promotional tool. The corridor is not even notable. There are so many tech facilities spread out all over the country, the whole country is a corrider? The Philippines also does not have a <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_technology.html" title="High technology">high technology</a> district, that can be compared to <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_Valley_c36d.html" title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a>, even just in notability. Two, part of its title "cyberservices" is not used in technical or mainstream in any language, other than by its marketing inventors, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cyberservices_32f3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cyberservices">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Cyberservices</a>.

<p>If we were to pursue logic of Noypi380, we would have to delete all other entries in the category High-technology_business_districts as well. The reason why Noypi380 has targeted this entry is his/her anti-Filipino attitude, as can be seen from his/her other posts.</p>

<p>You may be right about Noypi380. For this person to say "the corridor is not even notable" is a contradiction to the Philippine president's statement that over 100,000 people are employed in the corridor. It seems this person is biased against the Philippines, and I would not be surprised if this person comes from a country that competes with the Philippines for offshore work.</p>
<p>Why target the Philippines? Why is Noypi380 silent about other corridors in other countries?</p>

<dd>What is going on is the government is taking credit for those over 100,000 tech workers. Those over 100,000 are being employed in tech-related enterprises, spread out all over the country. The government conveniently credited themselves, by calling it all a "corridor", as if the government planned it ahead of time. That is why it is not notable, and it would be more politically correct to remove it. <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_Valley_c36d.html" title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a> is definitely a corridor.

<p>Although President Arroyo mentioned about a "cyberservices corridor" in the speech cited on the page, it is only but a mere concept. The Philippine Cyberservices Corridor does not even exist yet in reality as of yet. Also, the chosen resource in itself is faulty. If President Arroyo talks about the concept of the Philippine Cyberservices Corridor, that does not mean that the corridor exists, even if she tries to promote <i>forming</i> a corridor by the end of her term. As of now, while cyberservices are booming, there is no concrete proof that the corridor even exists.</p>

<dd>For the moment let us all call the corridor "PCC". There are two PCCs in question here. One is the planned future PCC, which is based on a source, (only the presidential speeches). The other one is the "current" PCC, (subject of the article before you edited it). That "current" PCC is not sourced, is not planned, is not a district, and it does not exist, never mind about the area. That is why I argue against its notability, because there is none. Speaking in an NPOV way, it violates <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">this policy</a>. The one who started that article is also a government official in our country who is responsible for promoting the local industries. I apologize that he is promoting <i>now</i> something that is not there, and is also in doubt. On the future planned PCC <i>which is not the subject of the article</i>, that I concede is notable. However it is just a plan. Over 50% of long term government plans in the Philippines do not push through, even elections, and on that regard, that is why users Noelle, and Akira, and Coffee, all Filipinos, voted <b>delete</b>. We only start important Philippine-related articles only when we are already sure it is almost built, as too avoid <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">this violation</a>. That is how we do things in order to accomodate wikipedia's policies. The future PCC is a long time away, and "PCC" is certainly not the correct name in the future, and that is assuming we are using the PCC as defined in the speeches. The article was deliberately misleading, sourcing the "planned" PCC, and saying that is already here to a "current" PCC, which does not exist, and I was vehemently against. That is basically all of it in NPOV. That is why I urge everyone to <b>delete</b> it already. It can be brought back anyway, in perhaps 5-10 years time, assuming all goes well.

<dd>What I question is that why would an article talk about a concept that is only a concept and does not physically exist. It is concedable that the Arroyo administration is pursuing the corridor, but pursuit of a concept does not mean that such a concept exists in reality. In fact, there is still no hard evidence that the PCC even exists except for the concept. Note that the first line of that quote mentions "The development of the Philippine CyberServices Corridor which shall provide a variety of cyberservices at par with global standards was pursued". Pursuit, as mentioned earlier, is not tantamount to formation. President Arroyo herself did not even give a timeline on when the PCC concept would finally take shape and when it would be completed. Because of that, it's still a non-existant concept and I still stand by my decision to <b>delete</b>. --<a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkira123323_37f1.html" title="User:Akira123323">Akira123323</a> 07:51, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your considered responses and explaining the distinction between the current vs proposed PCC -- the Wikipedia article definitely confuses the two (I have not yet checked to verify your claim that the two are indeed distinct). If indeed "over 50% of long-term government plans" are empty "electoral promises" then that should be mentioned in the article. I did not previously see the article <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_process_outsourcing_in_the_Philippines_2dfe.html" title="Business process outsourcing in the Philippines">Business process outsourcing in the Philippines</a> - that is a very appropriate article. <b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_process_outsourcing_in_the_Philippines_2dfe.html" title="Business process outsourcing in the Philippines">Business process outsourcing in the Philippines</a>. Again, let me remind you that the existance of a Wikipedia article (or section of an article) on a subject does not make it "better" or give it more credence, it can also be bad. Corporations often advertise on Wikipedia, only to have their article become a description of all its horrible business practices rather than a description of the things it sells. For example, if President Aroyyo has made promises in regard to the PCC / PCC proposal that she does not hold, then this could serve as documentation for future reference that she failed her promises. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_12.html" title="February 12">02-12</a>&#160;13:40<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span>

With regard to crystal-balling, this is not acceptable as the $10B high bandwidth telecomm backbone already exists and can be verified physically, as well as the call centers and other companies mentioned in the article. There is actually going to be a MOA signed between the governors and mayors within the next 60 days to formalize the existence of such corridor on a local/regional level (it is already part of national policy on a country level).

<dd>Yes Mr Commissioner, but the work you are doing now in office is not equal to the "corridor". Telecom backbone + call centers + contracts is not equal to a "present" corridor (subject of article, non-existent) and is not equal to a "future" corridor (based on vague speeches of president who can be deposed even tommorrow).

<dd>That's an unfair comparison. Read the text above again, particularly my discussion with Quarl. This is clearly not like <a href="../../../2/0/0/Category%7E2007_films.html" title="Category:2007 films">Category:2007 films</a> or <a href="../../../2/0/0/Category%7E2007_elections.html" title="Category:2007 elections">Category:2007 elections</a>. Those things are almost certainly going to be done in 2007. The films have definite release dates, even down to the hour in so many countries. The elections have poll voting and counting schedules planned beforehand, with contingencies. The future "corridor", <i>assuming the sources</i>, does not even have a deadline, and has so many other uncertainties. There are so many plans but no completions in the Philippines. The "future" corridor is not even the subject of the article, for the subject of the article is a "present" corridor that does not even exist, read Akira's earlier comments. That is why there is no apparent NPOV dispute. No corridor, no dispute. You're confusing the future uncertain, unfinalized, <i>plan</i> with a corridor <i>that is not there</i>. See? That article has already been proven to be blatant act of deception through wikipedia. The planned 600 mile "stretch of land" does not automatically present itself as a corridor <i>now</i> unless the thing is fully or nearly built, <i>if it is built</i>. I urge you to reconsider you're vote to <b>delete</b>. Of course, all of this assumes were not kidding...&#160;:) --<a href="../../../n/o/y/User%7ENoypi380_7d93.html" title="User:Noypi380">Noypi380</a> 00:06, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A proposed neologism - by a Nobel winner, yes, but it doesn't appear to have caught on. Wikipedia is not a crystal ball.

<p>Smacks of non-notable vanity page. It was tagged for dubious notability, but after some investigation I decided to elevate it to AfD. Article was created by User:Hank21 (note the surname). One notable Google hit indicating subject did indeed graduate from Germantown Academy. Other than that, the rest of the article appears to be fictional or exaggerated. User:Hank21's other edits were to upload Image:393008325 l.jpg (Alexander M. Hankin with one of his many girlfriends.) and an initial edit to <i>remove</i> a reference from the article <a href="../../../c/a/p/Caprice_Bourret_a83a.html" title="Caprice Bourret">Caprice Bourret</a> claiming that Ms Bourret was dating Mr Hankin, presumably added as anon user 69.136.79.245 the previous day, before Hank21 decided to create an account and this article. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 13:00, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dimes - I am afraid I completely disagree.</p>
<p>This is a real game. and whilst the rules written in a slightly tongue-in-cheek manner (i.e very verbose language was used) it was the best way to describe a relatively complex game.</p>
<p>I agree it is unreferenced, because we invented the game! How else will it get referenced without a start point at which to document it?</p>

<li><b>People need it</b> Sorry, if we made any insertion or correction in a wrong way having no real ideas how it had to be done.

It would be pitty to leave people without the name of their hobby (try on eBay or other places the search for "caps" and you will see how many colectors of plastic caps are in the world).

It's hosted on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Genesis_e932.html" title="Comic Genesis">Comic Genesis</a>, which if you don't know is like the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geocities.html" title="Geocities">Geocities</a> of the webcomic world. Although the main author of the article keeps on insisting that the webcomic is popular in the article, I see no evidence of this. The alexa report for Comic Genesis do not even mention this comic, as seen <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=pokemonx.comicgenesis.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=pokemonx.comicgenesis.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

"How is this random website notable? How is it more notable than a typical blog, geocities personal or random fan fiction?" - Random website? Wow, really reaching there, aren't you? First off this isn't anything like a blog, it's an established webcomic that's been around a pretty good amount of time. Geocities personal? You of all people should know the difference between a geocities personal (You've posted enough) and a webcomic. Random fan fiction? Well let's see here, first off.. it's not a fan fic, it's an adaptation, definitly not a fan fic, so if these are the reasons that notorious webcomic basher Hahnchen, has to delete this article, and these are the reasons behind this whole AFD, doesn't it seem a bit pointless, I really don't think Hahnchen has even checked out this website to verify anything.--70.185.237.167 03:31, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question:</b> - How is this comic similar to copy and paste material, I don't see any evidence of that at all. Unless you're refering to how the frames of the comics are the same everyday so he must be cutting the images from his own source and pasting them into a template or something with each page. And what exactly did you think was crude, was it when Brendan said "I'm going to go on deck and play with my rod?" Yes, Brendan is a bit crude, that's how he is as a character. --70.185.237.167 03:31, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> I went to go read this comic after seeing this dispute, it doesn't really qualify as "fan fiction" as for popularity, since everyone knows Alexa doesn't list individual comics hosted by keenspace or comic genesis, you can't really check through them, this comic has been around a long time, updates frequently and has a pretty big fan base according to the amount of people registered at its forums, I think before you condem this article, you should work on better ways to prove it's not notable, rather than Hahnchen going off his hatred for all webcomics.--70.185.237.167 07:58, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't delete:</b> I see no evidence supporting that this ISN'T popular. All I see in support for deleting this page due to it's so called lack of popularity is this Alexa rankings page, which has been said by multiple commentors to not be an accurate ranking of a comic's popularity. I also see one commentor saying that Hahnchen, who appears to be the creator of this delete motion, has a hatred for all webcomics. Isn't this a bit biased? I believe one should have to provide more proof than an inaccurate rankings page and his/her hatred of webcomics. And just because YOU haven't heard of Pokémon X before doesn't mean the comic isn't popular. I feel more proof should be provided as to the status of popularity (and on that note, popular to who? The entire population of the earth? Wikipedia users? Web comic readers? Please clarify this.) before a deletion occurs. Mjc0961 13:22, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I'm a fan of these comics. This comic is running for two years and a half now, and even has its own small cult following it around. Nevertheless, I don't see many claims of notability provided on the world wide web...I actually don't see any at all, apart from some minor webcomic-lists, such as Top Web Comics. It received 67 votes last week..that's not enough to justify a keep in my opinion.

<li><b>Question:</b> - How many votes did Megatokyo recieve last week?--70.185.237.167 01:24, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Answer:</b> Considering that Pokémon X is rated 36 and Megatokyo is rated 43, I'd have to say less votes. I can't actually find where SoothingR got the number of 67 votes for the week, but if Megatokyo is lower, Megatokyo got less votes. Mjc0961 12:52, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - That's not because of popularity though, Pokémon-X probably can't go into print because pokémon holds the copyright, and also because it's a sprite comic, I don't recall a sprite comic ever going print, even if it has original sprites like A Modest Destiny.--70.185.237.167 19:31, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Point:</b> - I don't think it really matters how popular this webcomic is, the point is this, it's an established comic, that much is obvious, it's been around almost 3 years. It has over 400 pages, and it has a lot of history behind it. It may not be mentioned all over the web like some webcomics, but it does have a rather large following. And if some of you would take time to read it, it's actually a quite inventive adapataion of the games.--70.185.237.167 01:25, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> — Seems to me there's just a lot of arguing going on both ways without anyone giving any actual proof of anything. Alexa's rank means little, as Comic Genesis hosts many extremely popular comics, meaning a comic could actually become quite popular without getting a mention on Alexa. What this page actually needs is some reference to notability, and possibly a report of how many members reside in their forums. The only things I've gathered from this discussion are that it's not mentioned on Alexa, and it's been around for 3 years with a large archive. I took a look at it myself and while I'm not a fan of sprite comics it's certainly on the higher end of the quality spectrum. I will vote upon further proof of notability but for now I'd lean toward keep. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZaron_4a89.html" title="User:Zaron">Zaron</a> 18:48, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Answer</b> In my experience only about 1/3rd or less of the people who become fans of a comic actually join the forum, but I went to check for you, Currently the Pokémon-X forums at Proboards has <b>807</b> members. --70.185.237.167 01:04, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I've vaguely heard of it, somewhat well known, at least, within the pokemon sprite comic community. But dear god, please get rid of the midi on the site! Having a midi automatically play on your site is something of an automatic decrease to your notability, I'm afraid. -<a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhymeless_6a19.html" title="User:Rhymeless">Tim Rhymeless</a> <a href="../../../r/h/y/User_talk%7ERhymeless_4dd3.html" title="User talk:Rhymeless">(Er...let's shimmy)</a> 09:48, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> This webcomic is of great quality, has a consistent plot, and owns a reasonable fanbase who cares about the comic and its author. I began reading it four days ago under suggestion from a friend, and I was surprised to look it up here and see that it is in danger of deletion. This comic has been in the works since 2003, and although I know there are people like myself who are willing to read though the whole archive, a Wikipedia aticle will benefit those who want to just start at the current page, by providing the in-depth information on the characters and plot the site itself cannot produce. For those who have been reading it for a long time (and from I have seen, there are quite a few), an article can also provide any information they might have forgotten. I find it ironic that for a comic that is "unpopular," its article is quite a bit longer than say... <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverloch_%28comic%29.html" title="Inverloch (comic)">Inverloch</a>, which nobody dares to challenge. I am aware that there are WikiCities or the like specifically tailored for webcomics, but in my opinion those are more aimed towards those who read a large number of comics and/or have the patience to even find those sources. Finding the article on the main Wikipedia site is quick and easy. -<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarranduin_ddbe.html" title="User:Sarranduin">Sarranduin</a> 23:52, 14 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The quality or consistency of the comic is <i>absolutely irrelevant,</i> and I see no evidence that the fanbase is significant. If the author wants a description of the plot or characters to bring readers up to speed, the author can do so on his or her own site; being Cliff Notes for webcomics is beyond WP's scope. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:30, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Copied from Article's Discussion Page:</p>
<p>With the exception of one small book of short stories in Hebrew, which may have been formally published some time ago in Israel, he is entirely self published ("Narcissus Publication" is registered in his wife's name and produces Sam Vaknin's works exclusively, always in soft cover).</p>
<p>It seems to me that, if there were an Hebrew Wiki, there might be a case for his inclusion in a Hebrew Wiki. There is certainly a case for his inclusion in <a href="http://mk.wikipedia.org/wiki/" class="external free" title="http://mk.wikipedia.org/wiki/" rel="nofollow">http://mk.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a> where regular users are better placed to assess his real validity, but apart from that, it seems to me that if there is a place to draw the line between valid articles and vanity this is it, as Sam Vaknin would seem to me no more than one of the droves of people who use vanity presses and self promotion on the internet to chase their "15 minutes of fame". --Zeraeph 10:05, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Narcissism is all about superfluous vanity, and attention-seeking. It is in keeping with the nature of the behavioral disorder to simultaneously utilize and attack a source of narcissitic supply; in this case, Wikipedia. This site is simply another object to exploit for the sake of self-gratification. The deletion of Sam Vaknin and his tiresome reposting of innumerable links to his articles would be tantamount to doing the world (and Wikipedia) a great service, high Amazon sales ratings notwithstanding. --72.16.41.16 06:52, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I can't believe that just because one of his columns involves Wikipedia it's given a separate section. How is it more notable than any other column he's written?! This is the kind of self fetishisation that Wikipedia doesn't need, I'm sure that if he had published a critique of Britannica, it'd be absolutely ignored. Anyway, this isn't a vote from me, he has a phd, so I'm guessing he's published some books.

<li>I know, in one sense, the article (that really IS more a blatant attack than a critique) shouldn't matter, but it really is extreme, and is open to charges of being some kind of "reaction" to<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Narcissistic_personality_disorder" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Narcissistic_personality_disorder" rel="nofollow">[45]</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Most of the delete votes seem to be based on the idea that the subject doesn't deserve to be notable. That's not an encyclopedic criterion. If applied evenly, next up on the deletion list should be Paris Hilton, Ann Coulter, a fistful of serial killers, and most of the US Congress. Informally, the real "notability" criterion here ought to be "Is this a person who someone might reasonably want more information on, and look up in Wikipedia?" By that standard, it doesn't matter how much of the subject's prominence comes from self-promotion, or whether the number of unique Google hits out of the 150,000+ is 3, 300, 3000, or 149,999. If somebody rummaging around the web can find him in 150,000 places, that's the relevant number for assessing notability. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 02:01, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>He's a funny man, that article was quite a nice read, although the ending was off: <i>In the absence of such third party accreditation, the Internet risks both irrelevance and disrepute.</i> Now, I don't know about standards at Mr Vakin's social circle, but where I come from, the Internet already <b>IS</b> irrelevant and disreputable, and justly so. --<a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgamemnon2_ee6b.html" title="User:Agamemnon2">Agamemnon2</a> 08:15, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> "Is this a person who someone might reasonably want more information on, and look up in Wikipedia?" With 150,000 self produced and promoted, frequently duplicated hits, on Google WHAT ON EARTH would anybody want further information for? Seriously? Since it was posted this article has remained a promotional stub, almost identical to his user page, so there can't be very much more anybody wants to know or say about him, including himself. There are some nasty (in various senses) people who are "notable" but they have all actually achieved some aspect of that notability offline, the only thing Sam Vaknin is notable for is artificially generating an huge internet presence under his own name. There are several MLMs that have done the same thing and we don't have entries for them? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 10:15, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>FYI. I'm the person who removed the "Prod" template. There is no obligation on the person who removes the the prod template to improve the article. I have engaged in discussion. What do you mean I "don't deserve to survive AfD?" This is about the article not me. Whether Wikipedia should have an article called "defeat in detail" has nothing to do with anything I do or don't do. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 23:46, 8 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, improving the article is "optional", but I agree where the template reads "If you can address this concern by improving, copyediting, sourcing, renaming or merging the page, please edit this page and do so." The "Defeat in detail" talk page is blank, so you didn't discuss it until after the nominator brought it here for proper process. Removing the prod template without doing something proactive to advance the discussion isn't grounds for "don't deserve to survive AfD", but it's likely to cause other editors to discount your assertions. It looks more like edit-warring than consensus-building. Despite this, I'm modifying my vote slightly given the further citations. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:06, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree with Barno above. At least leave some kind of comment when the prod tag is removed to explain why the article deserves to be kept. Furthermore, if you feel strongly about keeping an article that, at least in this case, is little more than a dictdef, why don't you feel strongly enough to improve the article a little bit? Just coming in here and voting to keep and improve doesn't seem to get these articles impoved in any way; thus, leaving a hoard of bad articles. BTW, I would like to point out that the reason that I nominated the article for deletion is legitamate and until the article is improved it remains legitamate. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames084_3305.html" title="User:James084">James084</a> 01:07, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm afraid I know <i>just enough</i> about this term to know what it means, and to know that it is a very common and important military term, and consequently to know that this topic deserves to have an article on Wikipedia. However military strategy and history is not my field of expertise, and without going to the library and doing some research, I am unqualified to make any real improvements to the article. That an article needs to be improved is not a legitimate reason for deletion, see <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 02:44, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes Wikipedia is not a dictionary. And I'm well aware of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which says "if you come across an article that is nothing more than a definition, see if there is information you can add that would be appropriate for an encyclopedia." Thus, that an article only contains a definition is not a legitimate reason for deletion. A lot more can be said about this topic than just a definition. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 03:58, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Please dicuss this issue in detail before deleting it. Things I wanted to know (in case a deletion is decided upon) are:
<ol>
<li>Is there any other platform over wikipedia where it would be suitable to write.</li>
<li>Should it be merged with some other title.</li>
<li>Where exactly should one ask before writing such articles. I hoped Esperazna would be a good forum, but even after a positive reply, I am faced with the challenge of defending my article.</li>
</ol>

<li>After reading the wikipedia guidelines for deletion and the meaning of tags, I admit that the page is a listcruft (a list of interest to a specific group of people), but its possible to de-cruft it by removing items that are specific to IIT Kharagpur(i.e. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia's</a> suggestion). This way, it can become quite general article on IITs in general and can be kept(IITs are the most famous engineering institutions in India, and hence will have a lot of relevance to groups outside). About <b>Neologoims</b>, I am not very sure as this isn't about just one word. While some fall into the category, others don't. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.saxena_5aa8.html" title="User:Ambuj.saxena">User:Ambuj.saxena</a> <small>formatting edits by <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 12:05, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd>To take up some of your points. The external source happens to be the IIT Foundation itself, and the main problem with your dictionary is that it is merely of interest to students of the IIT Foundation. You may be aware that many schools and colleges develop local slang. It serves no purpose for the general community if every school in the world made lists of their own slang and then used their own school website as a verifiable source.</dd>
<dd>You point to the internet slang list which you feel is comparable with your own list. It may help you understand why people are rejecting your dictionary while accepting the internet slang dictionary if you consider how many people use the internet as compared to how many people attend the IIT Foundation.</dd>
<dd>It would seem that a reference on the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Institute_of_Technology%2C_Delhi_b87c.html" title="Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi">Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi</a> page linking to <a href="http://www.iitfoundation.org/iit/life/slangs.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.iitfoundation.org/iit/life/slangs.shtml" rel="nofollow">the page on slang</a> would be sufficient in this case. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 00:36, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now to address the point raised by <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a>, I would like to add that just by knowing that there's a word <i>faccha</i> in the lingo of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_ce5f.html" title="Indian Institute of Technology">IITs</a> is not sufficient unless you know that it refers to a first year student, which the IIT Foundation's site doesn't quite do. About the Internet slangs article, I feel that we should compare the utility of the article and not the scope. What I mean is that instead of comparing how many people use the internet, we should see for how many people this page would be helpful. Obviously you can't include those who use the internet for only e-mails and googling into the audience of the article, but definitely include those who use usenet groups and discussion forums. Compare that to the IIT Slang page which makes the social fabric of the IITs. If you are inside the IITs, you have to know what these words mean to really be able to talk to any student. I am not saying that the student are rude, but many a times they don't realise that they are using the slangs. At any point of time, there are 25000 to 30000 IITians studying in the campus. Add to that the 4000+ students who pass out every year. Seeing from an alumni's point of view, suppose you are an alumni from a batch that passed 30 years back and you want to get nostalgic about the student life you had, then each and every word will be invaluable (<b>this work is not made up in class one day, but is a tradition of over 50 years</b>). Take a look at the statistics that the IITs have been functioning since the early 1950s and you will understand the target audience I am refering to is enormously huge. For those who still don't understand the importance of IITs, take a look at <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-721133053692899260&amp;q=60+minutes+IIT" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-721133053692899260&amp;q=60+minutes+IIT" rel="nofollow">this video</a>. I know that giving examples is not quite relevant as some might say that they are exception, but I take the liberty of quoting one for those who might be interested. This incident took place some 15 years back in an auditorium in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. There was one IITian who was sitting in it and was not very happy with the movie projector's focus. He became increasingly irritated and blurted out <i>Tarapado, focus</i> as he used to do in his IIT days. Within a few seconds, a voice came from 2 rows behing that said <i>Which Hall?</i>. 203.110.243.21 07:41, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the point is that it is sufficent that we are aware that a particular school, website, village, hobby, etc has developed local jargon. We don't even need to know any of the words, let alone the meaning of them. Once involved in a school, website or hobby you might need to know the meaning of <i>faccha</i> for IIT or <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/Lexicon.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.ratebeer.com/Lexicon.asp" rel="nofollow"><i>lege</i></a> for RateBeer. But the rest of the world doesn't need to know. That the IIT website does not have a glossary itself is even more argument against including one on here as this is not the place for original research. I suggest you approach the IIT website with your work. I am sure they would find it of value. And that is truly where it belongs. You may notice that I am not voting against your article. I am only here to engage in the debate you requested. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 09:25, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You don't <b>need</b> to know most of the stuff in Wikipedia. Including the material in Internet Slangs, marijuana slangs, or in the Jargon file, all of which have entries here. Nonetheless, they may be of use to some people. <a href="../../../a/r/u/User%7EArundhati_bakshi_6df5.html" title="User:Arundhati bakshi">Arundhati bakshi</a></dd>

<ul>
<li>The argument pointed by <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> will lead nowhere. I can apply the same thing to the Internet Slangs article and say that we only need to know that the internet users have developed a slang of their own. So let all those websites/discussion boards that have users frequently use these slangs maintain their own listing of such slangs. I will now give a gist of what I believe should be debated upon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the fact that the Wikipedia community considers the atricle on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Internet_slang_772f.html" title="List of Internet slang">Internet slangs</a> worth keeping, then it can be concluded that the claims that the page under consideration is <i>non-encyclopaedic</i> and <i>no brainer</i> do not hold. The debate should actually be on whether it is a listcruft or not. That is, whether the people who might be interested in this article big enough to grant it a place in the encyclopedia. Furthermore, if its not, will merging it with an article on IIT_Lingo or something equivalent will make it satisfy the criteria. When deeptrivia suggested that I go ahead with making an article general to all the IITs, I considered it well before deciding to start an article on Kharagpur's Jargon alone. This was because it will require significant editing and morover will discourage people from other IITs to start such page. Even now I feel if the article is deleted, it should certainly be made a part of a larger article involving all the IITs. The reason why I felt that IIT Kharagpur itself merits such an article is that the IIT community (comprising of students, professors, workers, etc.) is 20000+ strong at any point of time. And since the culture of this jargon dates back half a centruy, a lot many non-students have also started to adopt to a good part of it. The only argument that feels that can go against it is that most of the workers here don't use the internet. But I feel that this should hardly be the reason for not allowing this article to be posted. This is because if it doesn't get posted, when these people WILL start using the net, they will refrain from making such a page because they would come to know that such a page was not allowed to be hosted before. Unfortunately I will not be around for the next 3 days, the time when the fate of this page will be decided. It that happens, and is decided on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Polls_are_evil" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Polls_are_evil" rel="nofollow">polls</a> rather than merit, here's my choice sheet for the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_transferable_vote.html" title="Single transferable vote">single transferable vote</a>: 1) <b>Keep</b>.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, too specific topic, and more importantly, <b>Wikipedia is not a slang or usage guide</b>.

<li>Of the articles you listed, while I feel all are more notable than this IIT Kharagpur thingy, <b>none</b> meet my criteria above. So my opinion is that if this article is deleted, then the first three should also be proposed for deletion (I thought the list of sexual slurs would be fairly long and complete, but it turns out it's far from it), and the last should be stripped of its slang section. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 23:26, 10 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's one of my points. Why is this list being singled out and the others not? And why is British schoolboy slang more notable than Indian IIt slang? <a href="../../../a/r/u/User%7EArundhati_bakshi_6df5.html" title="User:Arundhati bakshi">Arundhati bakshi</a>
<ul>
<li>Pointing to examples of bad use of Wiki is a very poor argument. I would be more inclined to vote to keep if I was shown a good argument for the value of this particular dictionary of school slang. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 09:50, 11 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And why is it a bad argument? If the rules of Wikipedia apply to one article shouldn't they apply to others as well, or is that only for certain users to decide? I would prefer to see the list incorporated into an aticle maybe of IIt culture -- then it would make more sense -- but if this one goes, why should not the same criteria for deltion not be applied to similar articles of no greater value? <a href="../../../a/r/u/User%7EArundhati_bakshi_6df5.html" title="User:Arundhati bakshi">Arundhati bakshi</a></li>

<p>I have nominated this article because of the use of the word "trivia", which is defined by wiktionary as <i>insignificant trifles of little importance, especially items of unimportant information</i>. This puts the article in direct conflict with my understanding of the following Wikipedia guidelines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Articles title assumes that the information therin is trivial, violating <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a></li>
<li>If we are to assume that the articles information is indeed trivial then it is violating <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Imporance</a>.</li>
<li>Finally being that a trivia list is inherintly a list of random facts, this article is in violation of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some or all of the information in this artile may be good however, it should be integrated into proper places within established articles. For advice on how this may be accomplished you might want to look at: <a href="../../../t/r/i/Wikipedia%7ETrivia_16ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Trivia">Wikipedia:Trivia</a> and <a href="../../../g/k/2F/User%7EGK_On_adding_trivia_to_the_main_body_of_an_article_ae34.html" title="User:GK/On adding trivia to the main body of an article">User:GK/On adding trivia to the main body of an article</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_stuart_c99c.html" title="User:The stuart">The_stuart</a> 17:48, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think HansTAR was trying to say that the trivia shouldn't go on the Amazing Race pages because there is too much and it would create clutter.

A lot of the trivia is good and <i><b>most</b></i> of it is true and should stay. Like I said, most, so it does need a little clean-up. Also, the reason this page was AFD'd was because it is "The Amazing Race <b>Trivia</b>.

<li>If I may say this: what may be non-notable and unimportant to some might be perfectly well-fitted in an encyclopedia for others. I, for example, could care less about a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_performed_on_American_Idol_a4cb.html" title="List of songs performed on American Idol">list of songs performed on American Idol</a> (which, to me, seems just as "fan-ny" as this article). However, if ever I need to do research for American Idol, I know that good ol' Wikipedia contains just the list I need. Same with Amazing Race trivia. I'm all for changing the title and trimming any completely unnecessary details, but, again, I cite that this is not merely a random assortment of facts, but an organized list in the same manner as that American Idol list. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansTAR_ef6a.html" title="User:HansTAR">HansTAR</a> 05:08, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hello, if KimvdLinde has read the books in question then I am happy to retract my comments but as I suspect she hasn't then surely her comments that the subject in question's works are not notable and nothing worth mentioning are, as you say of another user's comments (hypocrisy eh, gotta love it) pretty lame. Not having heard of something cannot possibly be a verifiable reason for deletion in a worldwide encyclopedia.

<dd>Several arguments here are <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominems.html" title="Ad hominems">ad hominems</a> directed at me (primarily by new editors), but whether I (or the new editors for that matter) have heard of the person is irrelavant. Arguments should be independent of that. The argument that there are other comparable articles is irrelevant (they might indeed qualify for deletion as Not Notable), inclusion in Wikipedia should be based on more objective criteria, as outlined in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability_(people)</a>. Based on the criteria as a professor, I should be able to find at least a substantial number of references to his work from other scholars, such as in Web-of-Science (zero hits) or google scholar (1 or 2 hits) or google itself (found one, missed maybe some, but likely less than 5 hits). Notability as a writer, even for a subculture (who especially interact at the web) should result in substantial mentioning of the author at the web beyond book reviews, sales lists etc and that is fairly limited. I surely believe he is a nice person (based on what people write about him and from his email), and that he is liked by his students and such, but that does not make someone of encyclopedic value in my opinion, who's main entry at the page is the courses that he teaches. --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">KimvdLinde</a> 14:23, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: My reason for voting <b>keep</b> earlier was due to the fact that in order to become published, the professors work needs to have undergone peer review and as such this makes him notable within his field of work.

<li>Dudes, seriously, he's a non-notable professor who writes non-notable books and none of the arguments for or against can distort those facts. Fails professor test and author test. The simultaneously hilarious and sickening newbie / sockpuppet / meatpuppet fest going on here, the total failure by more experienced users who are apparently independent of Mirabello and claim expertise in said field to show why any of this is notable or wikify the articles plus the huge amount of spidering these pages are currently getting (ka-ching!) leave me exactly where I started with the Odin Brotherhood. <b>Strong Delete</b>. If people want to nominate other articles just because something they have an interest in was deleted, <b>go ahead</b> and they too can be judged on their merits. Just because you think extreme ironing is nn but wouldn't be deleted is not a reason for keeping any other article, nominate it and see what happens.

<p>There appears to be many editors who have edited anonymously or have created a username solely to vote on this issue. While we appreciate your concern and passion about this issue, unfortunately the input of new users does not have much weight in these matters, because you are not yet a contributing member of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Also, it is expressly against Wikipedia policy to create more than one user account to affect the outcomes of <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">deletion discussion</a> or <i>AfD</i>. This is called <i><a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_sock_puppet.html" title="Internet sock puppet">sock puppetry</a></i>. This practice is highly frowned upon by your fellow Wikipedia editors and is expressly discouraged by <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, every computer on the internet has a unique <a href="../../../i/p/_/IP_address_6ed9.html" title="IP address">IP address</a>, which in most instances, can identify the specific computer and the physical location used to make edits. If numerous editors in a vote all have the same IP address, this is evidence of sock puppetry, and your votes will not be counted. You could also be blocked from editing in the future. <i>You are not completely anonymous!</i></p>
<p>From <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia:Sock puppetry</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html" title="WP:RFAr">Arbitration Committee</a> has ruled that, for the purpose of dispute resolution, when there is uncertainty whether a party is one user with sockpuppets or several users with similar editing habits they may be treated as one user with sockpuppets.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I encourage you to stick around Wikipedia and contribute to the project, regardless of the outcome of this vote. - <a href="../../../h/r/o/User%7EHroptR_9ca5.html" title="User:HroptR">HroptR</a> 22:54, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Note</b> I should add that some of the votes considered <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_puppets.html" title="Sock puppets">sock puppets</a> are from <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shawnee_State_University_dd8a.html" title="Shawnee State University">Shawnee State University</a>.I do not know much about IP address but I think since all 4,000 students are on the same network at the school, and there are only so many computers on campus, some may log in at different times from the same terminal. I ask that you consider this. stege1</p>
<p><b>Note</b> I would like to add that I am neither a sockpuppet or a student of Shawnee State University, if the above user would like to check my IP address he/she will find that I am resident in Europe at the moment. I stand by every point that I made.</p>
