<li><b>Keep</b> but trim the end of Naruto II mainly because the end of that article is usually a complete in depth summary of an intire chapture including a deep analysis. Dangerdog</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> atleast everything and continue updating the plot, it's important to understand what's going on and is basically the name the plot, everyone is just explaining the plot, keep the articles. if erased, it should be considered censorship....

<li><b>Delete</b>, excessive amount of information, especially the latter. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 14:40, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> both articles. This is a tricky issue. Prior to September 3, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> said that plot summaries were appropriate "as part of a series of articles per <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_series_3a8d.html" title="Wikipedia:Article series">Wikipedia:Article series</a>". That phrase appears to have been deleted inadvertently during a series of edits and reversions, and I have added it back in. (See <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_79ff.html#Plot_summaries_as_part_of_article_series" title="Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not">here</a>). The upshot is that IMHO, both of the plot arc articles should be shortened as a style issue, but aren't properly a subject for deletion, as the overall plot allows readers to put the other articles in the Naruto series in context. (Although I agree that the articles are too long, that is a {{sofixit}} issue, not a reason for deletion). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 14:42, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Shorten</b> per TheronJ.

<li>How about this... <b>rename to history of the Naruto world</b> (or whatever the world is called), shorten it a bit, and reword to account for this slight shift in focus. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 15:46, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> there is nothing wrong with this part, it helps to get details we miss when reading.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per TheronJ's statements. These articles are necesary in understanding the Naruto universe, but in need of shortening. *Detailed* plot summaries are overkill, but merging the articles in a single <a href="../../../p/l/o/Plot_of_Naruto_59ec.html" title="Plot of Naruto">Plot of Naruto</a> article and cutting them down to a shorter summary would work better and fit Wiki's guidelines. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">[<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">contribs</a>]</font> 17:43, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> both articles. Both articles definitely need to be trimmed down in size, but these are no different from the episode synopses for television shows on Wiki, among other things. Djseifer 18:44, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> both articles, the plot summaries to many other shows, anime and not, are far greater than the Naruto articles put together. As was said above, plot summaries are allowed, and many people who can't read the manga or watch the anime can use these pages to catch up. We already limit speculative theories about characters and plots, and that should be enough. However if a merger is done and we must shorten the articles then it would be in everybody's best interest to eliminate trivia sections and the filler material, in fact the entire filler page could be done away with before any changes are made to these articles, as it does not harm the plot too much.67.85.70.232 18:48, 28 September 2006 (UTC) A fan of Naruto looking out for other fans' interests.

<li><b>Comment</b> If/when we do merge the article, we have to note the events of the anime filler.

<li><b>Comment</b>, my guess was way off. I figured at least a few more people would vote delete. Oh well.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This seems to have touched a nerve with the Naruto fanboys. The rules say wikipedia is not for plot summaries, and this is clearly a plot summary, as indicated by the title. AmitDeshwar 00:54, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Split</b> by arc. This page is much too large and already omits quite a bit of information (eg: the other fights during the Chunin Exam arc), and filler arcs are ignored altogether. This will leave a lot of small articles, but it will be a lot better than the massive, cramped page we have now. Fillers can be grouped by season (of course, keeping together arcs that have the season break between episodes). This is by no means worth deleting. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYou_Can%27t_See_Me%21_320d.html" title="User:You Can't See Me!">You Can't See Me!</a> 00:58, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
