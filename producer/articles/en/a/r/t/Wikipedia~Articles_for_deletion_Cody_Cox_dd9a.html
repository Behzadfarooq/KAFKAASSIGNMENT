<li><b>Keep</b>. Why delete it? it hardly takes up any space on their servers and ill never see it unless iam looking for it. I cant think of any reason why anyone would care to post this but whatever, if someone wants too let them.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Agreed, this is no place for obituaries.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree! I understand the purpose and it noble, however I beleive it in appropriate. Entries such as these are ok now, but allow this, and you must allow all</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. there is no conspiracy here and it's sick to crawl all over it when none of you actually care what happened.</li>
<li><b>What?</b> Why should it be deleted? What if it was your kid?</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. encyclopedias are not a place for obituaries</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. just another person dead, sorry but it happens everyday</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The photo is a family photo, no copyvios, and I don't see why a good person cannot get an entire Wikipedia page when an off-brand computer game from the 80's can. Johnroberts 12:01, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a memorial site. No evidence that this person's death has had widespread influence or media interest.

Not only that, but it contains copyrighted images! Here's a list of people who want this article kept and think this had significant influence on their community and lives: Kayla Stultz, Reagan Allison, Britney Bullins, Justin Ingold, Kenny Johnson, Brandy Dillard, Robbie Bennett, Donna Swain, Meredith Walch, Holly Byerly, Karen Cline, Maggie Summey, Brandy Osborne, Zig, Andrew Martin, Michael Ring, Matt Poindexter, Brittney Imam, Jessica Mays, Luke Basinger, Ryan Friddle, Ashley Brown, Cody Brown, Clint Basinger, Codie Calloway, Gena Cox, Jared Branch, Sarah Winters, Samantha Swink, Kristen W, and Amanda Mikles <small><i>Unsigned comment from User:Johnroberts. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a></i></small>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The link you've posted is a character from a game. As the game in question has been released worldwide and is a large part of pop culture and gaming culture, it is of widespread interest and worthy enough to have its own article. Cody, however sad the death may be, is neither an icon of pop culture, nor of any widespread interest outside of his hometown. <small>dpkonofa</small></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Not a notable person. Does not fit with article guidelines whatsoever. <small><i>Unsigned vote from User:67.171.230.147. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a></i></small></li>
<li>What is wrong with it?? <small><i>Unsigned comment from User:65.94.135.170. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a></i></small>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Clearly, Cody Cox was very important to the people who knew and loved him and his death is tragic. To be encyclopedic, though, there needs to be some indication that the story is more notable than many similar stories. This story does not seem to have been picked up by news sources outside of North Carolina, indicating that, at this time, it is still a local story. Sadly, killings are sufficiently common place that they are not, in themselves, notable. Additionally, the last section (The Conspiracy) appears to be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. This is doubly inappropriate for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 04:46, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete:</b> This is an information database as it should always be, free from personal opinions and feelings. If his death has a noticable impact, then it should be kept and Cody wil be put up there with Martin Luther King and Abraham Lincoln, and the other important historical figures, until then.. sorry. On the otherhand, I'm sorry for your loss and may you try to find another way of keeping Cody's memory alive. <small><i>Unsigned vote from User:216.58.17.167. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a></i></small></li>
<li><b>Abstain</b> At the moment, I do know what significance this has on any matter, but it does give me an interesting idea. I will return to change my vote in a few days if I feel it is necessary. <a href="../../../s/w/e/User%7ESweetfreek_088b.html" title="User:Sweetfreek">Sweetfreek</a> 05:40, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree that wikipedia is not a memorial site. If one obituary is allowed then it'll open the floodgates to all. Noone would expect to find this story however tragic in any other encyclopedia. <a href="../../../o/r/c/User%7EOrcus_7f43.html" title="User:Orcus">Orcus</a> 05:50, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>tion on the life of one young man. He died young; who he may have become will never be known, but this is a website for information, and I want it there. I don't think that many people are going to put shit up for a "memorial" so that's a stupid point anyways. And this website is not completely free from personal feelings. If it were, you would not care whether or not this was put up. User:Colin D. Fee 05:50, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

"And this website is not completely free from personal feelings." -&gt; that's one of the fundamental ideas of the project, a vast user base reaching a common consensus in a joint effort (learn/ look up def: objectifying / objectification). "If it were, you would not care whether or not this was put up." -&gt; it is cared for because information has to be confined herin to objective criteria. If somethings not cared for, it is neglected by definition, resulting in prematured decay ( Also see <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermodynamics.html" title="Thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entropy.html" title="Entropy">entropy</a>). You right in that personal feelings are involved in keeping this project running! Hope i could help in clarifying some points for you, and showing you that no-one here wants to work against you.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'm sorry but Wikipedia is not a memorial and this is a non-encyclopedic article. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamw_c58f.html" title="User:Camw">Camw</a> 07:16, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Same reasons others have mentioned.</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> - Of Course this should be kept for reference if someone had to do a report and wanted to reference this incident. Having items like this makes WikiPedia a good source of information. If something with this entry is incorrect it can be changed.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - To the person above, please figure out how to format. Your argument is also difficult to swallow, since ANYONE can change this article. If I wished to insert a comment that distorted the events that led to the death, (ie given how there are different viewpoints, someone inserted writing in support of the person who stabbed Cody Cox) then how is it a reliable reference? This is not the appropriate place to remember someone, therefore I must support deleting.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Wikipedia is an encyclopedia... not the obituary section of the newspaper. <a href="../../../t/e/z/User%7ETezkah_e594.html" title="User:Tezkah">Tezkah</a> 08:15, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - This is a local news story.</li>
</ul>
<p>Delete, there are thousands and thousands of people murderd every year why is this one special? I do have sympathy for the family, however I don't see the relivance on Wikipedia.</p>
