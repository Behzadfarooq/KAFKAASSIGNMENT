<li><b>List should stay!</b> There already exists a Category:Vegetarians, but people prefer the List_of_vegetarians and post there much more and also visit the List_of_vegetarians more often!</li>

<p>The Wiki Page "List of vegetarians" is great as it is! I esp. like the many different categories and side categories! All these categories and side categories make the Wiki Page "List of vegetarians" different and special from other "Lists of vegetarians" that you can find on the internet!</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>To deal with those points in order, and bearing in mind the conventions of <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a> (which is a must-read on category vs list vs serial box issues):</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>large - could be split if necessary, there are several ways to do this (splitting lists is perfectly common)</li>
<li>incomplete to an unknown and probably unknowable degree - doesn't matter. Sometimes a selected list - even slightly arbitrarily selected - is more interesting. Look, if the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations (okay, bad example, but bear with the logic) contains <i>everything anybody had ever been recorded as saying</i> there'd be no point reading it. It's fine for a list to be a work in progress, no different to any of our other articles.</li>
<li>may include entire religions with all their adherents - indeed, just stating the religion would save space without losing information. Indeed a link to the appropriate category could be provided.</li>
<li>hence, unmaintainable - there's a risk of it degrading, but I think once it's cleaned up, the periodic cull of unreferenced articles will keep it tidy enough. If needs be it can be split.</li>
<li>largely uncited - cleanup, not afd. Yes, needs culling to the barebones, but remember that (a) categories themselves don't have any citations and (b) articles will only give references for the vegetarianism of their subjects if you're very lucky! With most articles you're lucky to get a reference on <i>anything</i>, let alone something like that. The most straightforward place to find references about people's vegetarianism is probably a secondary reliable source list of vegetarians</li>
<li>no better than a category would be - no. Just no. There are things that this list is much worse at (categories stay up to date) but here are some things that this list does <i>far</i> better:
<ul>
<li>It's actually an article. You could print it out and show it to your vegetarian/meat-eating friends; you could take it for your bedtime reading. It's actually quite an interesting read! Why? Because when I see all those names in a category, I have no idea who they all are. In this article, there's some brief contextual details, which I for one found rather interesting.</li>
<li>It's sorted in quite a good way i.e. people who you would associate with one another appear quite near each other. The categories are only sorted alphabetically (other than the fact that there are subcategories for nationality). They're purely arranged you can find stuff. You'd have to be even more anal than I am to actually print out page after page of category listings for your bedtime reading. There's no context to it. (And as for the "associated" aspect, <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> would break down in howls of laughter at the sight of Category:Vegetarians by occupation and subcats - that would be a ridiculous cross-cat in terms of our category system; yet on the other hand, it seems quite natural, indeed the way most books would do it, on a listings page.)</li>
<li>You can also check the references. Here of course, there's basically nothing, so you know straight away not to trust anything included so far&#160;:-) On the category system, you could load up a page of listings and find that only a couple of the articles actually had references for the vegetarianism - and that would only be after loading up and reading through 200 articles! That hardly makes verifiability a piece of cake; you're just left trusting that there's enough editors taking tender care of those articles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sometimes used to push a POV (e.g. Shakespeare, Hitler) - the list's not inherently POV-pushing so that's a matter for cleanup, not AFD. It's also quite a neutral thing to report that Hitler was vegetarian - I'd be more worried to see a list of vegetarians that deliberately left him out as an "unrepresentative example" than one that put him in.</li>
<li>contains real and fictional characters mixed, always a bad idea - cleanup matter, not AFD. But good point nonetheless.</li>
<li>contains contemporary and historical characters in no kind of balance - cleanup matter, not AFD. Again a good point, though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Basically, the thrust of the objection here is based on <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a>, which actually makes perfectly clear that there are both <i>advantages</i> and <i>disadvantages</i> to a list, many of which have been listed (between JzG and myself) above. It's not a case of finding a "winner" but finding whether it's useful for them to sit side by side. As far as I can see, they may be useful complements to each other. (Suppose, for instance, you did want to source a claim about a person's vegetarianism in their article - this list would be a perfect place to check whether it's already covered by a general vegetarianism reference.) I'm not going to shy away from the fact that the list at the moment, while a rather interesting and definitely quite offbeat read, is basically substandard and shouldn't go anywhere near "magic 1.0", but most of these concerns are cleanup ones being used to bolster a one-side-of-the-argument-only CLS case. If this is deleted (and given its current shoddy state I can understand that) may I <b>request that it be userfied</b> in its final, pre-deletion state to User:TheGrappler/List of vegetarians? Once the organization, inclusion criteria, and most importantly the references get sorted, I can't see why the list shouldn't be put back in article space. There's no clear policy against such lists (in fact, it's closer to the reverse), and a well-referenced, humanly readable (rather than purely intended for "eyeball searching") list would have additional (not "alternative") benefits to the categories. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 09:00, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have no problem at all with that. My favourite kinds of lists are the ones which add something encyclopaedic beyond the bare list of names. Here one could have a group of people named by <i>foo</i> source as following certain diets, for example. There's lot that <i>could</i> be done with it. Starting with sourcing it and removing the possibility of ioncluding a third of the world's population&#160;;-) Maybe people noted for advocacy? People who have publicly spoken out about vegetarianism or against the eating of meat? Something a bit more than "does not eat dead animal" anyway. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:59, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I can see perfectly well the problems with the list in current form. At the moment, I'm too busy to commit personal resources to it but on the other hand, having seen it, I'd definitely like to over the next few weeks/months. If it does end up userfied at least it will give me chance to slash and burn with impunity... as anyone who has encountered me on <a href="../../../g/a/n/WP%7EGAN_e8d4.html" title="WP:GAN">WP:GAN</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> may be aware, I take sources and references seriously, and this list's in trouble at the moment, especially given the ambitious claims of pro-vegetarianism groups. Nevertheless, I still think it should be kept in article space so that other people can have a bash at knocking it into shape. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 12:17, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
