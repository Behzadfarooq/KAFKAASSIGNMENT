<p>This organization is not notable. A Google search brings up nothing regarding this organization other than the Wikipedia page itself: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=Ago&amp;q=south+azerbaijan+national+liberation+movement&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=Ago&amp;q=south+azerbaijan+national+liberation+movement&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It was obviously created to promote this organization and not for the sake of an encyclopedia entry. The User who created this article simply registered for one day to edit the page of the founder of this organization and to create this page and made no edits afterwards: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Aztap" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Aztap" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, which makes one believe that this User was working on behalf of the organization itself.

<dd>Most of those <b>minor</b> hits are Azerbaijani pages. This organization is not notable enough for a Wikipedia article and was obviously created for promotional purposes. Secondly, your comment about Iran is pure speculation and should not influence any vote in anyway. Also, we are all anonymous here on Wikipedia, this user simply created a one day account so he could promote this organization, one which he could possibly be working for. Furthermore, the Iranian government has no way of acting upon any user on Wikipedia in any way.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 21:53, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that it is impossible to write this article according to Wikipedia standards, as there are no third party reliable sources that discuss this organization. I have never heard of this organization, which leads me to believe this is not as big as the other major one (GAMOH), and is probably a competing organization. Again, this seems like it was created for promotional purposes only.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The Users who are voting <i>keep</i> with such reasons as this organization being notable and that the article should be re-written still have not shown in what way this article is notable (again, Google search brings up close to nothing) and what third party reliable sources can be used to even re-write this article (so far, the only source provided as been that of the organizations own website!). There is no basis for this article not to be deleted, as it is not notable, and it is impossible to re-write.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 17:18, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don’t think that the info about irredentist movement in Iranian Azerbaijan should be suppressed in Wikipedia. Regardless of what you think about this organization, the reader has a right to know about it. The current state of the article is not a good reason for deletion, and google search is not the only criterion for establishing notability. The info could be available elsewhere. This article should be improved, and not deleted. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 19:07, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So far, no one has brought up anything to show the notability of this organization, nor has anyone brought up a means to re-wrtie this article (i.e third party reliable sources). No one here has brought up any means of fixing this article. This article was created for in order to promote a relatively unknown organization, simple as that, which is against Wikipedia policies.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 19:41, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The page needs wikified and other works required by Wikipedia. But it should stay and expanded. google search actually gives some links, unlike the claim of <a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">user:Azerbaijani</a>. For example this UN source <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/home/RSDCOI/3df4be444.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unhcr.org/home/RSDCOI/3df4be444.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> and here is the blog <a href="http://southazarbaijan.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://southazarbaijan.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> Since this organization is involved in human rights activity in Iran it is not coincidence that pro-Iranian circles try to suppress information about it. As a relatively young organization its notability perhaps will gain more attention in the future.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 19:13, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - This is hilarious! You present a blog and say it can be used as a source to write this article? And the article from the UNHCR says nothing about the organization, it mentions it once. <b>How do you expect us to write an article on an organization such as this, when it isnt even notable enough for other third party reliable sources to have already written about it?</b> There is no information that can be found (and I searched) that can be used to write this article. Again, the users voting <i>Keep</i> are obviously not taking into account any of these factors. Furthermore, this users <b>personal attack</b> that says the only reason this article was put up for deletion is because we are part of a "Pro-Iranian circle that tries to suppress information" is ludicrous, as there are many articles that "Pro-Iranian circles" may not like on Wikipedia, such as <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Iran_21d6.html" title="Human rights in Iran">Human rights in Iran</a>, along with other anti Iranian seperatist and terrorist groups.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 19:22, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Who are you calling a pseudo scholar? Dr. Kaveh Farrokh is a world renown Iranian historian who gives lectures at many famous universities and published many intellectual articles and books. I have even seen him on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_Channel_2ce1.html" title="History Channel">History Channel</a>. Secondly, two sources are not the basis for notability, and thirdly, <b>we still have not seen any sources that we could use to create such a article.

<dd><b>Comment</b> My comments that pro-Iranian circles try to suppress information about this organization is not related to Wikipedia users per se. It is general comment about Iranian government policy and those who supports it. If you take it personally then it is your bussiness. And obviously, even if you, me or someone else don't like article as <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Iran_21d6.html" title="Human rights in Iran">Human rights in Iran</a>, nothing can be done about that. It is notable fact. Actually, many countries has problem with that, including US and others. Here, in Wikipedia our role - editors - to give as much as possible accurate and verifiable information. Definitely, if such notable organization like UNHCR mentions the organization in question - then it is accurate. And there is a nubmer of links in Azeri language Google about this organization, for example <a href="http://bizimasr.media-az.com/arxiv_2002/yanvar/17/ic.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://bizimasr.media-az.com/arxiv_2002/yanvar/17/ic.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, <a href="http://www.voanews.com/azerbaijani/archive/2006-09/2006-09-16-voa6.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.voanews.com/azerbaijani/archive/2006-09/2006-09-16-voa6.cfm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, and article in Azeri Wikipeida about it <a href="http://az.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCney_Az%C9%99rbaycan_Milli_Oyan%C4%B1%C5%9F_H%C9%99r%C9%99kat%C4%B1" class="external autonumber" title="http://az.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCney_Az%C9%99rbaycan_Milli_Oyan%C4%B1%C5%9F_H%C9%99r%C9%99kat%C4%B1" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacy69_b62d.html" title="User:Dacy69">Dacy69</a> 22:09, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Like I said before, the UNHCR mentions it once, thats it (further showing that it is not notable organization). And you said it right when you said that <i>our role - editors - to give as much as possible accurate and verifiable information.</i>, exactly, by that basis, this article must be deleted, as there are no third party reliable sources that can be used to create such an article. And please, do not use an Azeri Google search to try and show notability, this is English Wikipedia. The article you posted from Azeri Wikipedia is about GAMOH, not this SANLM! Are you trying to trick people now?<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 22:54, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> It already has a wiki entry: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SANAM" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SANAM" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>]. Why create two!? Looks like a one man organization made for ethnic provocation (dismayed to see it was Baku based). Many false and baseless claims too, like Azerbaijan extends to Khuzestan or Western Azerbaijan which has large number of Kurds is all Azeri or .. etc or Bahmanyar ibn Marzaban who was a Iranian Zoroastrian student of Avicenna predating turkification of the region as a Turkic person(I guess Bahmanyar needs an article)). If this article stays of course all these points should be responded to as well. There are some Iranian based organizations in Iran called "Irani-e-Shomali" (Northern Iran) who also claim the territory of the republic of Azerbaijan. I am wondering what the limits are and if these organizations can get their own wiki article? I do not think think any of these organizations are noticeable enough to be mentioned in Wikipedia. In fact, anyone can create a small one man or few man organizations and then state their political goals. An organization should have at least some weight and be mentioned like the Tamil Tigers or PKK. Also I note that the user who created this article commited a major violation of Wikipedia rule by erasing the delete votes of some users. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FSouth_Azerbaijan_National_Liberation_Movement&amp;diff=117937506&amp;oldid=117937360" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FSouth_Azerbaijan_National_Liberation_Movement&amp;diff=117937506&amp;oldid=117937360" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>.

<dd>Oh wow, I did not even notice that Delete votes were removed by Aztap (the same person who created this article), which again supports the fact that the intention of this article was to promote this very small and unknown organization, rather than to create a beneficial article for Wikipedia.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 00:05, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> Google search becomes more relevant when the right keywords are entered, such as the URL of their website or proper name, including in Azerbaijani language. The name itself is too long for most Western or otherwise journalists to reproduce, so most would go by an abbriviation or just the name of the leader or main spokesman of the organization. None of the organizations are really Baku-based (Chehregani can't even visit Azerbaijan, or Turkey, without being asked to leave), but they have of course chapters there, with regular press contact. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">adil</a> 05:53, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
