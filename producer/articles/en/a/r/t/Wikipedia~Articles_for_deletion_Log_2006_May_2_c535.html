<li>Hello, I'm the creator of Mythos -- a young man in a youth group I mentor pointed this out to me. The webcomic has been taken offline in preparation for the new one to appear, ideally later this year. The game is TBA, pending some internal negotiations with hardware manufacturers, but is in production. Understandably, Wikipedia is not for advertising so if because of the game this entry needs to be deleted for now I can see that, though I hope it can be reinstated in the future. --Cwboyer 14:53, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I believe the main issue here is that this article does not meet the policy of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. For information on inclusion standards more specific to webcomics, see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a>. Briefly, in order for wikipedia to be useful it must be reliable, and it does not appear that this webcomic is one that has been covered by reliable sources such as The New York Times, The Comics Journal, Wired, etc. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 15:27, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It does look likely that it will be deleted for now, as we try not to have articles that don't have a good deal of proof. The criteria of proof for webcomics is pretty high, but when you get the game released and reviewed / commented upon, an article on it will be most welcome.

<p>I recognize the fact that you doubters are unfamiliar with frizbeer, and I would venture to say you are older than the targeted age for this game. It's popularity is growing exponentially and there is no reason it should not be permitted on Wikipedia.

<p>I searched "frisbee drinking games" on Google and came across more than a dozen games that have rules either identical or undeniably similar to those listed on this page. I think it is the word 'Frizbeer' that is getting everyone so uptight. Chances are that when the "houston skyline" was listed on wikipedia, the actual name was not as popular but I sure as hell bet the drink combination was wildly popular.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Latani6 (<a href="../../../l/a/t/User_talk%7ELatani6_9d16.html" title="User talk:Latani6">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Latani6_4b4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Latani6">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p>This article is an informative article explaining to people how to play a very fun and popular drinking game. Drinking games are like ancient oral history; you're not going to find out how to play them in the newspaper, but from friends and family.

<dd>It would be nice if it worked like that, but we can't allow people to just add anything if there's no way to verify it. We can't just take your word for it, we need concrete evidence. Otherwise we'd end up with more hoax articles than real ones. It's not ideal, but that's the way things are. If you can't provide verification, the article has to go. If there is evidence of it under a different name, prehaps you should request that the article be moved instead, but it's not going to be kept under the current name. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 22:22, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Look, this is great and valuable information, sure. But it's <i>not encyclopedia material</i>.

<li>If the article <a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Bigger_Bang_Tour_fcbd.html" title="A Bigger Bang Tour">A Bigger Bang Tour</a> had been started in early 2005, with reliable sources, it would have been kept, or at least merged into the Rolling Stones article (This is still future events anyway, as the tour will not conclude for another four months. "Predicted Academy Awards nominations" would be (form where I see it) deleted as original research. I'm not even going to try and defend "Tomorrow's weather" as an article, as that would be a maintenance nightmare. Also, from the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> policy section on crystal ballism <i>"Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place."</i>. We have organisations that know what they are doing (at least in the case of NASA and the ESA, I truly hope so), saying that "We will launch this vehicle into Earth orbit, to perform this role, on this date". It is never going to be the case of *insert national leader here* waking up and ringing *insert national space agency here* one morning and saying "By tomorrow night, I want a rocket in space". These missions take time to plan and establish, and they leave a paper trail that can be used to reliably sourced this list. That's "certain". As for "notable", I don't know about you, but I personally think trying to put things such as environmental observation equipment, scientific projects, global communication transfer stations, and <i>people</i> into a location removed from the Earth's atmosphere is, if not notable, <i>pretty damned significant</i>. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 09:27, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- I wouldn't have as much objection to it if we set some criteria like "list of orbital spaceflights" and then made yearly lists for those from 1957-2006, or possibly by decade if there aren't enough to justify individual years. The problem with it as it is now is that it makes explicit reference to the fact that its events must be in the future, so it <i>will</i> become out of date without regular updating. A list by years can simply state the date and at the end of the year we can move on to the next one. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> 01:12, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong, all 'serious' rocket launchers exit the atmosphere (i'd avoid making the criteria "orbital flights", as if something goes further than Earth Orbit, ie probes to other planets, future moon landings, they won;t be covered) If someone is willing to convert this to a List of extra-atmospheric vehicle launches (2006-2010) or somehting, I will support it.

<p>This woman doesn't exist except for on WP and through the fringe "monarchist" who seems to have created the article and has littered the internet with mention of a rightful Imperial Family for Mexico. The woman in question, if she exists, is totally non-notable and has not submitted any claim for the throne. The basis of the weak argument is that a "Habsburg" of a different line from Maximilian and not one of his descendants, blood or otherwise, can claim the throne when he adopted two descendants of a previous Mexican Emperor? Strange and far-fetched. This seems to be a joke article or one written by someone along the lines of those supporting "The Imperial College of Princes and Counts" (fake). <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 00:15, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I would like to add that Mexico does not allow any open claim to the throne, and therefore I do not see why the fact that she is not known by many is synonym of non-notable. The adopted children of the previous Emperor renounced their rights to the throne of Mexico after the revolution took over the country, therefore I do not see why you are even considering them. With this Mexico is left without an heir, and therefore monarchists might quite rightly consider more collateral family members of the Habsburg family in Mexico, and from what I read Ana Victoria was very closely related to Maximilian. Thinking that Wikipedia is for the public, we must remember that that means different opinions. I am not a monarchist myself, but I have to say that the thing that distinguishes Wikipedia from other encyclopedias is the fact that you can find everything, and it’s always helpful to have both sides of a story. I definitely do not think that this article should be deleted on the basis of the above argument that seems to be more like a personal comment. I would be very disappointed if Wikipedia loses that balance by deleting a perfectly acceptable article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by FERS (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_FERS_474d.html" title="Special:Contributions/FERS">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>If it is a pseudonym, it does not exist in use. If this woman existed, she could not claim the throne as a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine for two reason: 1) She would be a descendant in the female-line and therefore not a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine and 2) she would be the descendant of a morganatic marriage and therefore not a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. There are other dynastic, collateral branches of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine who could claim the throne of Mexico if there were provisions to do so. Since there are not, either the Habsburg-Iturbides (Goetzen-Iturbide) are dynasts or no one is. Non-dynasts (especially ones that do not exist) cannot be listed as pretenders since there is no ambiguity on their claims. They down-right do not exist. Wikipedia is not here to wave around hoax claims. By the way, isn't it peculiar that your first and only edit is on this page? <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 17:04, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In answer to your last question I have signed-in just because I wanted to post my opinion in this discussion. The reason? I am just doing what I think is fare, especially after your insinuations that that woman does not exist. I am Mexican by birth and I have heard of Concepcion Heredia before, so this will hopefully make you drop the idea that she doesn’t. One of my best friends belongs to a society or something similar that gathers to discuss the role of the monarchy in Mexico. From this friend is that I heard of that woman and according to him she is the heir to the throne, but she obviously does not promote herself openly because she lives in Mexico and it is illegal. I commented to my friend about this article and read him your last post and argument. This is was his answer:</p>
<p>1 - In effect, she is not claiming the Throne of Mexico in name of the Habsburg-Lorraine family. 2 - It is not correct to refer to the Goetzen-Iturbide family as the Habsburg-Iturbide, because they have no blood claim over the last emperor, and their dynastical claim was renounced with the abdication of both adoptive children of Maximilian. Therefore that line has no claim whatsoever, and this has been ratified several times. 3 – In conclusion, Mexico has no possible legal claimant to its “Throne”. What the imperialist group of the Mexicans now did was look for the most appropriate Habsburg family member to offer their support. That woman in the article was chosen because, according to them, she is the Habsburg with the longest history in Mexico and is direct descendant of Ana Victoria who was the closest family member of Maximilian and supported him in the south when he was ruling. The claim does not involve the Habsburg-Lorraine family, nor any other claim, it is just a new offering of the Mexican crown to a new royal by the modern conservadores that offered the crown to Maximilian nearly 150 years ago. I knew how passionate this group is about this, and since I study history I thought it would be interesting to let everyone know that it is a major claim (it has its own centre and around 100 members) and not one to be ignored. I wish to contribute and help improve wikipedia in the future, and I am glad to have started with this discussion.</p>

<dd>You have cited no proof of the existance of this woman, no proof of the existance of any organization and have not cited any laws making the promotion of a claim to the defunct Imperial throne illegal. How can this woman claim the Imperial throne, given that she is not descended in any way from the last Mexican emperor? There are absolutely no children of Archduke Louis mentioned anywhere. You say that this claim is based on her being an appropriate Habsburg family member, then say it has nothing to do with the Habsburgs at all. She is not the Habsurg with the longest history in Mexico. She is not a Habsburg at all. There was no offer of the crown onto any other line to a new royal, one who doesn't exist and would not be royal in the first place. This article is merely a means to try to discredit the adoptive Iturbide line. Your "friend" apparently lacks credibility when it comes to whether certain people really exist or not. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 18:44, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is certainly not illegal to talk about the claim to the Mexican throne in Mexico. I remember, for instance, when <i><a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Universal_f9e9.html" title="El Universal">El Universal</a></i> published an interview with Agustin Goetzen-Iturbide a few years ago. The confusion may arise by an article in the Mexican Constitution that bans citizens from accepting titles or honors bestowed by a foreign sovereign without permission from Congress.</dd>

<dd>That aside, I cannot say I've heard of this woman or her claim before. A person that touts herself as the "Lady of Campeche" would be notorious even if only as a folk curiosity. It would be interesting to check if the <i>Almanach de Gotha</i> has/had any mention of the purported members of this family line. -- <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERune.welsh_2e22.html" title="User:Rune.welsh">Run</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#339900">e</font></a> <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERune.welsh_2e22.html" title="User:Rune.welsh">Welsh</a> | <a href="../../../r/u/n/User_talk%7ERune.welsh_7599.html" title="User talk:Rune.welsh">ταλκ</a> 20:44, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b>. Even more weirdly, the website is <i>about</i> Joe but not <i>by</i> Joe, and it appears he doesn't even know about it. I don't imagine he'll be super pleased if he finds out. QUOTE: <i>"He shows a particular interest to the aesthetics of his property, as he is commonly seen watering and raking his lawn, cleaning up his yard, and washing his car."</i> This would not be encyclopedia information if about Napoleon, let alone some old dude in Toronto. Sadly I think we must consign Joe to the sad, lonely anonymity of his random, pointless life and no-doubt-imminent death and decomposition. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 21:47, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Also, the numbers given relate to the accomplishments of the Nebraska defense, and not specifically to those of Smith.

<li><b>Keep</b> Yes, he was drafted, but he was drafted in the sixth round. If he were to make the Patriots' (or some other team's) squad, then obiously, this would be a very strong keep. As it is, he (like every other draft pick) hasn't played a minute of NFL ball. But the article clearly shows notability, so it's a worthy addition to WP.

<li><b>Very weak keep</b> I was tempted to nominate many articles for deletion after stubs were created for almost every player taken in the first five rounds of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_NFL_Draft_cb20.html" title="2005 NFL Draft">2005 NFL Draft</a>, inasmuch as many were non-notable for their collegiate achievements and will not necessarily, as CrzRussian well explains, ever play professional football. The proper disposition, I think, is "keep", where one's being drafted typically leads to one's playing the league (though this is surely a bit of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">crystal ballism</a>), with the proviso that we ought certainly to revisit in September the articles created subsequent to the draft, with a strong tendency toward "delete" where players have not made NFL squads and are non-notable for their collegiate accomplishments. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:38, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The NFL, which is of course the highest level of American football, holds a draft every year during which teams select players who (almost without exception) spent the previous few years playing for a <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_I_94db.html" title="Division I">Division I</a> university football team. The person in this article was selected in the draft last week but he is not really part of the team yet, as NFL teams hold training camps prior to their seasons during which they choose which players will be on their roster. So at this point the level he plays at is possibly the highest (NFL), or possibly nothing, depending on how good of an impression he makes during training camp this summer. However, he was drafted in the sixth-round and without looking it up, I would guess that the majority of players drafted that late do not end up making the team. — <i><a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a></i> 10:20, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Much as I despise the guy, I'm not sure this merits an article. I doubt Bush is the only one considered to have been the worst president ever (and there are many presidents besides the POTUS). I don't think the article qualifies for Speedy deletion as an attack page; WP does have similar sorts of articles like <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="Films considered the worst ever">Films considered the worst ever</a>. Possibly smerge some content to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> but without a redirect; the Rolling Stone article is mentioned there already but I think the HNN articles are more significant. Keep a mention in <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miserable_failure.html" title="Miserable failure">Miserable failure</a> but unlink it. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 05:43, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Nowhere in the aricle is it asserted that Bush is the worst, so the "attack page" argument is as bogus as is the POV argument. The article addresses the origins and usage of the phrase, a phrase which gets 519,000 Google hits, and is backed up with several articles from professional historians. <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="Films considered the worst ever">Films considered the worst ever</a>-- obviously and inherently POV-- gets an article, as does <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miserable_failure.html" title="Miserable failure">miserable failure</a>, but a discussion of the history and usage of <i>this</i> phrase doesn't?

<li><b>Strong delete</b> as inherently POV. Some people have called Clinton, and Bush Sr., and Reagan, and Carter, and other presidents the worst president ever. While the article as currently written does not assert that George W. Bush is the worst president ever, it discusses the belief that he is the worst president ever without considering any other possibilities. And as soon as the next president is inaugurated, some of his or her political opponents will call that person the worst president ever. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 06:29, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Another possibility (e.g. the "great president" Google bomb which redirects to the Bush biography) <i>was</i> in the article until just before it was recommended for deletion. Also, there is nothing to prevent further possibilities from being discussed, including discussions of any and all other presidents who have been, and still are considered the worst, if that is seen as the article's offense. As a matter of fact, it sounds to me like a very interesting area to investigate, though ultimately a futile one for a Wikipedia article if such thoughts are to be censored here. I came onto this article as a little, obviously POV stub, but thought it had informational value and hoped to shape it into a NPOV discussion of the phrase and its history. If a discussion of who professional historians consider to be the worst president is taboo, how about the best? <a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 06:46, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm still one of those confused newbies at Wikipedia referred to above, so I'm trying to wrap my mind around the intricacies of the NPOV policy. Apparently an article on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_rankings_of_United_States_Presidents_9992.html" title="Historical rankings of United States Presidents">Historical rankings of United States Presidents</a> is neutral, but an article on which presidents are ranked worst is an "attack article" and inherently POV. I'd be tempted to look at this historical ranking article in depth to see how the rankings are achieved with there being no best and no worst... But it dawns on me that I came to Wikipedia to avoid exactly this sort of nonsense in political forums. Guess I'll stick to film, cartoons and music articles. <a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 16:14, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Your implication seems to be that since all presidents have been disliked by <i>someone,</i> we must ignore the considered and educated opinions of non-partisan professional historians. Apparently objectivity and neutrality have long since been abandoned in the decision to delete this article. But allow me to point out that the article does <b>not</b> present just <i>someone's</i> opinion, but the opinion of professional historians, supported by articles eloquently explaining the reasons for their opinion. The article is open to present further opinions of professional historians on <i>other</i> presidents who have been legitimately considered the worst. <i>NOT</i> presidents considered worst only by partisans on the other political side. For the record, here is the quote from the article this morning (anyone is free to modify, improve, and add to it as they see fit): <i>This article will go on to discuss the history of the term "worst president ever," which Presidents <b>professional historians (not bickering partisans)</b> have generally considered the worst, and their reasons for doing so.</i>-- <a href="../../../r/i/z/User%7ERizzleboffin_0ecb.html" title="User:Rizzleboffin">Rizzleboffin</a> 17:59, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You make it sound as if this article is some lofty and scholarly historical analysis. In fact, it's an three-paragraph-long article entirely devoted to George W. Bush and a Googlebomb. And regardless, why do we need a history of the term "Worst President Ever"? What's next, a history of the term "Worst Senator Ever"? "Best Coffee Ever"? "My head hurts"?

<li><b>Delete</b>. I can't see how it can be saved from the POV hole it's in.

<p>Keep. I disagree with the deleters. This event was pivital on the development of a competitve advantage the Red Wing's had with Denver, which eventually resulted in the Wing's defeating them in the WCF. Prior to this event, the Red Wings were effectively at the mercy of Denver's advantage in the area of physical play. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.142.130.39 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.142.130.39.html" title="User talk:67.142.130.39">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.142.130.39_8d58.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.142.130.39">contribs</a>).</small></p>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>fuddlemark:</b> The suggestion that this information is out of date or unreliable is erroneous and without foundation. I update this article regularly and in advance of all changes released by TransLink. Wikipedia is intended to be dynamic and not static. Further, other articles use the route data, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_South_East_Queensland_railway_stations_c468.html" title="List of South East Queensland railway stations">every railway station</a> and some other minor pages. This is not a mirror as you suggest, but a reference source by which the appropriate TT can be found at a glance. <b>Aplomado:</b> None of this information is indiscriminate - it is logically ordered and does not meet anything in. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, except potentially a travel guide and that is pushing it. This is an highly accurate list of public bus routes, not mere phone numbers or a FAQ. <b>Sendai:</b> The actual TransLink page is linked in the first sentence. <b>Capitalroadster:</b> See above, it is very easy to keep this up to date, and I am willing to do so. Wikipedia is not non-changing.</dd>

This is a functional and useful article which I and other refer to on a regular basis. Wikipedia encompasses a broader concept of what is encyclopaedic than that which is traditional, and thus incorporates articles all over the world about public transport services, such as an analogous page for every Australian urban rail system and one for every line and station. Most importantly - the previous incarnation of this article (renamed from (Brisbane) to the more accurate (South East Queensland)) was permitted to survive.<a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">SM247</a> 11:43, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> This page and its predecessor were singled out. Why not also list for deletion the equivalent pages in other cities? Melbourne has an actual page for each of its tram <i>routes</i> for goodness' sake. I think there is ample and substantiated precedent for keeping this page which has apparently been disregarded by some, or if not disregarded then in being acknowledged has resulted in an uneven application of policy. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">SM247</a> 07:34, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

With apologies to <a href="../../../j/c/w/User%7EJcw69_dff3.html" title="User:Jcw69">User:Jcw69</a>, who appears to have put a lot of work into this mess, this appears to be a colossal collection of useless information documenting every mundane event that took place in every year of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South African</a> history for the past 500 years.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I disagree with Aplomado, timelines are important, it links the history and supports the History of South Africa. I based this article on the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Canadian_history_e2ab.html" title="Timeline of Canadian history">Canadian</a> one. The indiviual articles off it are still growing.

<li><b>Keep</b> per, well, everybody above. As I understand it, we vote based on the <i>potential</i> for encyclopaedicity (is that a word?) of the articles, not necessarily just on their current contents. Since it seems to be accepted that articles like <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Australian_history_17b1.html" title="Timeline of Australian history">Timeline of Australian history</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1902_in_Canada_233c.html" title="1902 in Canada">1902 in Canada</a> (and so on) are encyclopaedic, I can't see why similar articles about South Africa should be any different. Although it would probably be better if it used the format of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Australian_history_17b1.html" title="Timeline of Australian history">Timeline of Australian history</a>, there is precedent for how it looks now; see <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Canadian_history_e2ab.html" title="Timeline of Canadian history">Timeline of Canadian history</a>. - <a href="../../../h/t/o/User%7EHtonl_fb13.html" title="User:Htonl">htonl</a> 22:24, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Wikipedia is not running out of space. The article could do with some improving, but it would serve absolutely no purpose to just delete it.

<p>This has been around for a while but loks to me like a hoax.

<li><b>Comment</b>. There are a few non-trivial martial art related ghits for Kushindo, Koshindo, or Ku Shin Do, but they're all as badly written and unverifiable as this article. I can say with certainty that it's not an ancient art as claimed, if it's at all related to <a href="../../../a/i/k/Aikido.html" title="Aikido">Aikido</a>. The name fits the format of modern martial arts (<a href="../../../b/u/d/Budo.html" title="Budo">budo</a>). There is a <a href="http://www.kusindo.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.kusindo.com/" rel="nofollow">Kusindo</a> in Japan (same pronunciation, different romanization) which appears to be an art dealer (as in visual arts), and there seem to be many uses of Koshindo (a village name, a name for a number of Shinto shrines, company names, etc).
<dl>
<dd>Korean <a href="../../../t/a/e/Taejonggyo.html" title="Taejonggyo">Taejonggyo</a> is likely unrelated, as it's based on a reconstruction of pre-Buddhist Korean thought (Korea's first contact with Japan in historic times would be the transmission of Buddhism to <a href="../../../y/a/m/Yamato.html" title="Yamato">Yamato</a> from China via Korea). The name Koshindo for Korean shamanism would seem to be either coincidence or possibly a remnant of the Japanese occupation (Taejonggyo could have been seen as a threat and thus renamed to appear a part of Japanese mythology). But that's neither here nor there. — <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKADriver_8b44.html" title="User:AKADriver">AKADriver</a> <a href="../../../a/k/a/User_talk%7EAKADriver_2c54.html" title="User talk:AKADriver"><font color="#FF0000">☎</font></a> 22:16, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It does not discuss the reasons for errors, the different theories of why they happen, and the example it gives is poor. ...

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>. Smerdis is right. I am reasonably sure that syllogistic errors were in the logical fallacies list originally but I can't easily find them after the refactoring that seems to have gone on recently (which is, incidentally, generally for the better). <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 14:54, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>FWIW, we have a small stub, essentially a list, at <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllogistic_fallacy.html" title="Syllogistic fallacy">syllogistic fallacy</a> as well. This perhaps could be profitably merged (or re-merged) into "logical fallacy" as well. I rather like the notion of introducing some kind of intro on <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_bias.html" title="Cognitive bias">cognitive bias</a> into the logical fallacy article as well, though I tend to think that extensive discussion of psychology would be a sidetrack. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 18:46, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>These are all fine ideas, but the original intent of this page was about the psychology of syllogistic reasoning. That has nothing to do with the topics just listed. (BTW, I have edited the quote from what I thought was a personal email. I will certainly watch what I say in the future.) "Logical fallcies" are a different sort of thing. The theory of interest her is that of Philip Johnson-Laird, and the alternatives to his theory, and older theories such as those of Woodworth and Sells, Chapman and Chapman, Henle, etc. And I am not a "brand new user." This is just the first time I tried to delete anything. I have now tried to fix up the page so that it isn't so misleading and so that it points to what else is needed, so it is OK with me to leave it. It is still insufficient, but it isn't wrong.

<li>I just wanted to weigh in here about this page. I suspect I'm not entirely privy to all the details about the project that apparently led to its creation, or about your research into the psychology of syllogistic reasoning. Let me extend a personal welcome, even if you aren't a new contributor, and say I'm fairly sure I can speak for the consensus of the contributors that we are glad to have an expert on board who has researched this stuff.
<p>My suggesting that the page be merged or redirected to <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">logical fallacy</a> was suggested almost entirely by the title. The current title does suggest that it is about formal mistakes and invalid syllogisms. I'd now suggest that the page be <i>moved</i> to a title like Psychology of syllogistic reasoning, or better yet, to a page such as Psychology and logic, under which all the various sorts of interplay between psychology and logic could be handled, at least until one or another grows to the point where it should be spun off. Back when I was an undergraduate, I wrote about Schopenhauer, and I would definitely be interested in a page about the psychology of logic and of logical errors. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:24, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While I'm sure Ben 10 is a great animated series, it seems unencyclopedic to me to have incredibly long articles giving a blow by blow recap of <i>every single show in the series</i>, especially when <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ben_10_episodes_8ee3.html" title="List of Ben 10 episodes">List_of_Ben_10_episodes</a> <i>already</i> has a summary of every episode.

<p><b>Delete.</b> Universist Movement no longer exists, it's now a Foundation with a different mission that is not reflected in this article. The importance of the current Universism article derived from an ongoing membership organization that is no longer there. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">Universist</a> 15:04, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep.</b> The Beatles are no longer a band, but does that mean their entry here should be deleted? No. The Universism entry should remain for historical reasons. Certainly the founder of this now defunct movement (or "religion") himself, aka Universist, aka Ford Vox, should not be trying to cover up the history of the organisation by deleting this article. <a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigitallion_552e.html" title="User:Digitallion">Digitallion</a> May 3rd, 2006</p>

<li>Digitallion is a former member of the Universist internet forum. His post is prime example of why this article should be deleted. Universism is only of interest to a few hundred people who populated its discussion board, and it is a controversial topic even among them. Wikipedia can manage well known controversial topics just fine, but something microscopic like this is ripe for edit wars and no one can say who is right, because there is too little information about this short lived organization in the first place. Why is that? The Universist Movement was always a nebulous idea and different people had different ideas about what it was, and as reflected in the media stories about it, they were all over the map as well. Universism is a story of internet miscommunication and Wikipedia shouldn't be junked with every internet controversy. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">Universist</a> 16:04, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This article is really about the Universist Movement, not Universism. Regardless, both Universism and the Universist Movement were important to the extent that there was an active and large membership organization currently in existence. Therefore this article is no longer important enough for Wikipedia. Anything the Universist Movement has done in the past warrants a footnote in another article at best. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">Universist</a> 15:50, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> As in previous nominations, I have been unable to find and have not been presented with convincing, verifiable evidence that Universism currently has enough adherents to warrant an article. This is a personal judgement on my part. I note that Universists obtained several thousands of <i>signatures</i> on a website but this is not in my opinion equivalent to several thousands of active <i>members.</i> I note that the Universists were able to get some half-a-dozen press mentions in mainstream news publications, but I was not convinced that the actual content of these articles (mostly features rather than news) amounted to more than successful publicity-seeking. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:54, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Dpbsmith. I am suspicious of the nominator's claim that this used to merit an article but no longer does, but I can agree with the conclusion that there's no decent evidence it ever deserved one in the first place. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 16:02, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> If I recall correctly, Universism was small enough that they met in a coffee shop and had somewhere around 6-12 people regularly show up at meetings. They had a larger following online, but not large enough: at the time that their forums closed, they claimed 2639 forum members (of course, not all of that number were actually Univerists, and like every forum I'm sure some accounts were duplicates, inactive, lost password, etc.). Nobody's denying that there was some press attention, but still: this is a "religion" with a congregation of about a dozen, which did nothing of consequence during its short life, and is now gone. Even its creator wants it deleted. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 16:38, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Their website still mentions the Montreal meeting September 14, plus one in New York City: Tuesday May 23rd" @ Corner Billiards, 110 E. 11th St., New York, NY 10003 (8PM)." Corner Billiards??? And, if it's no longer "a membership organization," then who, exactly, attends these meetings on May 23rd in New York and September 14th?

<li>If you check on what those articles actually said, it's not so clear. There <i>was</i> an actual <i>local</i> news item about cops coming to eject some dozen Universists from a coffee shop when the proprietor objected to their views. The big-name media articles were features, columns, think pieces, interviews with Ford Vox, etc. They were <i>not</i> straight news items documenting an established, growing religion. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:22, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>In the context of what we're discussing,</i> and what <i>these particular</i> stories say, sure. I'm saying "it was in the NYT," without discussing <i>what</i> exactly was in the NYT, isn't automatically convincing. An appearance in a column demonstrates only that the writer thought the idea was interesting. And "interesting" could mean nothing more than "colorful" or "offbeat" or "curious." The publication of such material could be part of a process that could lead to a movement's becoming notable, sure, but does not speak to the question of whether Universism is notable <b>yet</b>... that is, whether it is a religion practiced by a substantial number of people--or just the religious equivalent of a <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">micronation</a>. If, come September, a mainstream news source reports that a thousand or more Universists showed up in Montreal for the September 14th International Meeting, then, sure, I'll grant that it's become notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> AfD is intended to judge the suitability of a topic for inclusion, not the content of the article. If Universism ever achieved the consensus criteria for an organization, then I feel like the article should be kept and updated to reflect the current status of the organization. It appears that verifiable information on that current status is more difficult to come by than the profiles of the group that have appeared in the media over the last few years. It may be that Universism as a topic becomes obscure to the point that it only merits mention among lists of obscure religious movements. I'm not sure that's the case yet, and it would be helpful, I think, to people looking for encyclopedia coverage of what is known and verifiable about the group to still have a Wikipedia article to turn to. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 21:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> See <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Elephant_1ae8.html" title="War Elephant">War Elephant</a>: <i>A reportedly effective anti-elephant weapon was the pig. Pliny the Elder reported that "elephants are scared by the smallest squeal of a pig" (VIII, 1.27). A siege of Megara was reportedly broken when the Megarians poured oil on a herd of pigs, set them alight, and drove them towards the enemy's massed war elephants. The elephants bolted in terror from the flaming squealing pigs.</i> Not quite the same, but it does give you pause. I don't think that one reference supports the .. um.. "depth" of article portrayed here. It certainly doesn't seem to be a widely used "weapon". - <a href="../../../v/e/d/User%7EVedexent_74b8.html" title="User:Vedexent">Vedexent</a> 00:02, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Hi Folks,</p>
<p>Robert Byrne is indeed an entertainer from the North West of England. I fully read the license when creating the article, and feel it should remain purely for the fact that, in the local area, Robert is quite well known. However, if this is disagreed with by the majority, please delete as you will, as I do not wish to violate any ruling that stands.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: My motive was to encourage adding information about Zeus to the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_server.html" title="Web server">Web server</a> article rather than this small article which is out of view. As it is now, it likely doesn't tell readers anything they didn't know yet. However knowing about ZWS can be useful for people looking for web servers generally.

<dd>I appreciate that my first entry was minimal and could be seen as spam (the idea of contributing to the wiki just suddenly struck me as I was going home so I put something up as a placeholder), but it takes time to build up a decent entry, not to mention get familiar with the system.</dd>

<dd>As it says in the article, okova stands as a business concept which we are developing with real world experimentation - i.e. making real products to see if OSS can be used commercially in this way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I certainly don't know exactly how you define notability. We are known about by our customers - from famous photographers and artists, to successful consultants, teachers, and also by our those good causes to whome we donate our software. We also have ongoing interaction with UK universities who think what we are doing is interesting enough to warrant it. I suspect that we are more notable, and becoming more notable, (we certainly are developing more impressive technology) than many other entries on Wikipedia such as WinLike.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The bottom line is that the okova concept has been around for a couple of years and is not dying out. It represents a method for doing business which generates interest in others and is worth recording on a non-paper encyclopedia. -- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.158.128.44 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.158.128.44_8bb0.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.158.128.44">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p>The song "Weekend" was uploaded to Janet Jackson's website and led many to believe that this was her new single. However, the website has since confirmed that i) Weekened will not be the new single and ii) that it will not feature on her up coming album. Therefore the track is not note-worthy (as its a "taster" track with no intended purpose other than to entertain fans until the single release), in the same way ordinary album tracks do not recieve their own pages. <a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimmers_934f.html" title="User:Rimmers">Rimmers</a> 19:26, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. I actually started to userfy this thing, and then changed my mind. First of all, I think Doc glasgow's right--we have no obligation to host people's bios. Second, since this user obviously edited from an IP <i>after</i> making his one edit from his username (to create this article), the account should not be considered active, so what's the point of having content on the userpage. Third, since all of the userfy votes are tentative and paired with delete votes, and Doc's is an emphatic don't userfy, there's no real consensus to userfy anyway. QED!!! If any non-admin wants the text I'll fish it out for you. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 05:07, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> While this event was sad, but the fact is, it is a one missing persons case. One. Uno. Thousands and thousands of people go missing each year, and just because this one person goes missing they instantly get a long page about them. What about all of the others? Where is their page? It can't just be me who thinks that the only reason this page exists is because person was a white teenage suburbanite. I would bet anything that if this happened in another country, or if this person was another race. I don't see this as even one bit fair. Where are the other missing people's wiki sites? It's simply not just, and I find it intresting that this person was seen leaving, not being dragged out kicking and screaming, but leaving under her own will. And so I ask once again, why have this page here, why have this pie in all of the other missing person's face here?

<li><b>Comment:</b> I do fail to see how this is a recent news article, as it was almost a year ago. And also, yes, there was another case like this one. I am also not saying that either page earned the attention they recieved. And shouldn't there be a page about the sensationalist American media, not stated in an unrelated article. And about the Elizabeth Smart case. First, she was abducted, she didn't leave willingly with three males out of a bar. And second, it's very uncommon for these stories to have a happy ending, so I'm in favor of keeping the Elizabeth Smart page. Bottom line, if it wasn't for all of the media attention, which is the main aspect of this page, then the page wouldn't even exist. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChange1211_cdfe.html" title="User:Change1211">Change1211</a> 02:04, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, that isn't following the same logic. George Bush already has an article so an item like that would simply be added to it. It wouldn't require a separate article.

<li>Should speedy keeps that have been closed as such be re-opened, then?

I know these are absurd things to suggest, but I'm not convinced that an absolute rejection of essays and/or summerized common arguements in AfDs is the best way to go. Regardless of our differing takes on wikilogisms, however, is there anything in this AfD that requires it to not be a speedy keep? <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">talk</a>)</small> 15:13, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

However, all of the sub-pages on this topic should be merged into it, with the distant possible exception of the Van Der Sloot family page, although I would be in favor of merging that too. There is no reason to have individual pages for Natalee's parents, or the police officials in the case. The only notoriety for those people comes from this one incidident, and the disappearance of one woman is not historically important enough to warrant a tree of articles. Perhaps this article should be renamed "Dissapearance of Natalee Holloway", and all other articles merged. We also need to consider the possibility that this story will become an unsolved mystery forever, and not an emerging news article.</li>

<li>I love Jalopnik as much as the next guy, but right now having Jalopnik in the Wiki would be little more than advertising. <s>Perhaps when the J site gets mentioned in the automotive press.</s> The mention in Time Magazine helps, but a few more reviews, and any awards Jalopnik might have won would make the article eligible for keeping according to the guidelines. <b>Weak delete</b> --<a href="../../../p/c/1/User%7EPc13_2b27.html" title="User:Pc13">Pc13</a> 22:38, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree that Jalopnik should probably not be a part of the Wiki, as I think that all the relevant information is on the Jalopnik website. A Wiki entry would simply be a form of advertisement.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.99.122.36 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.99.122.36_1f05.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.99.122.36">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>Jalopnik gets mentioned in the automotive press all the time, not in the mags but on the other online sites. There is a lot of shortsightedness here. Automotive media is changing and Jalopnik amongst others is the new wave of things to come. By the time one gets AutoWeek which, as its name would imply, comes out weekly the news is already old. I would argue that Jalopnik is a leader in cutting edge automotive content even though it is in its nacent stage. The ability for users to enter commentary adds to its content. Deleting Jalopnik would be a mistake.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Sebrock (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sebrock_9981.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sebrock">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>Gawker Media has a wiki page, so why shouldn't Jalopnik have one? Gawker Media is arguably the leading online provider of edgy, obsession-feeding daily content, catering to several different interests by individualizing different blog sites (a lot like Time, Inc offering all of its different magazines). Jalopnik is the one for cars. I guess when Time buys Gawker, then it will be worth noting? Okay, then wait three months. Anyone who dismisses an entry about a Gawker Media site must be completely out of touch (which is pretty impressive for a wikipedia user).<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.158.223.86 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.158.223.86_61fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.158.223.86">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>How about some hard statistics about how popular this site really is? If it can be proven popular then it may be influential and noteworthy.

<li><b>Keep</b> As Jalopnik is an "entity" or in effect a noun, inclussion in Wikipedia does not seem to be unjustified.

Personally I'm interested in how Jalopnik came to be, How does it operate, what is special about it vs other online autoblogs (things that I think are already in the article).

<li><b>Keep</b> This article reads a tiny bit like an add, however, that should be cleaned up and is not a good reason to delete the entry. There is nothing in any wikipedia policy that I can find that says this entry should be deleted. Admiral.Ackbar 17:39, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've really hesitated to get involved in this discussion as I'm one of the site's editors. I agree that the current post is somewhat advertisey (note that I had no hand in writing it). That said, there's an entry on Screeching Weasel's song "My Brain Hurts," and I'm guessing less people know that song than read our site. Deleting an entry on Jalopnik is frankly, somewhat silly, even from an outside perspective. Editing it so it conforms to standards? Sure, I'm all for it. I'd personally like to see it be more neutral, broad and wikified. But when editors I have a lot of respect for at major car mags tell me that our site is part of their morning must-reads, I know that we're not inconsequential. I certainly agree that the post right now isn't as neutral or fact-based about us as it should be. But give people a chance to rectify that, rather than deleting it. Isn't that what Wikipedia's supposed to be about? -- Davey G. Johnson, Associate Editor, Los Angeles, Jalopnik</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>, Romeo Carey has not only been a notable and positive asset to the independent film world, he has worked hard to preserve the legacy of his father and his studio.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Has Carey won any awards, or achieved other objective benchmarks of notability outside of the independent film world? If so those details would help estabish the notability of this subject. Lastly, no ill-will should be assumed.

<li><b>Delete</b>, No instructor, even if he or she is the son of a person who has notable distinction, should be deserving of their own Wikipedia page, without proven evidence of his own achievements that are, by Wikipedia's standards, worthy of being publicized as an entry. Mr. Romeo Carey certainly doesn't fit this criteria, as his accomplishments are, according to the Internet Movie Database and the Wikipedia entry, which lack sources, limited to minor roles in undistinguished movies and unremarkable standings within the entertainment industry.Honoring Mr. Carey's claim to a Wikipedia entry will validate that nearly all the thousands of success starved hopeful producers, directors, and aspiring actors and actresses, should deserve an fully biographical and glowing article which, as I quote Will Beback, will not determine their personal worth through Wikipedia. One may look through the list of Beverly Hills High Schools and find the names of those who have left a mark in society and continue to do so, for the honor of, not only their high school, but the world. Mr. Carey doesn't compete in the strata of <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Tufte_68d8.html" title="Edward Tufte">Edward Tufte</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelina_Jolie_ff96.html" title="Angelina Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a>, or even <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Morris_930f.html" title="Frank Morris">Frank Morris</a>, who in fact, is a <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmy.html" title="Emmy">Emmy</a> awarding winning film editor and whose Wikipedia entry is limited to three short, yet powerful facts, compared to Mr. Carey's long list of trivial self-success.

<li>This AfD stood for 27 hours. It is supposed to be up for <i>at least</i> five days before being opened up for admin action;</li>
<li>Cyde protected this discussion on top of his improper closure;</li>
<li>Cyde does not explain how he came to the conclusion that the article should be cleaned up when their was a clear consensus to delete. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 03:29, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Feel free to move this comment if it's in the wrong place, but I don't see how 32 deletes and 14 keeps is a "clear consensus", at least not if you're using the word <i>consensus</i> the way I understand it. It's just about 70% which is borderline for AfD, and barely describable as <i>supermajority</i>, much less <i>consensus</i>. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 03:44, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Be that as it may, I wrote that before I realized that this was inappropriately closed after just 27 hours, so the point is now moot until five days have passed. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 03:47, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>On that ground, I agree with the reopening. Perhaps this didn't turn out to be a good occasion to bypass process... -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 03:54, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm not too sure about the closing early, but vote-counting as a reason to overturn another administrator's close is bloody stupid. You'd be better off taking it to DRV, where (hopefully) they'd tell you to pull your head in for promoting the incorrect view that the tally is in any way meaningful. <i><b>AfD is not a vote.</b></i> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 04:13, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Have you read anything that I said above? I did not reopen this because of the vote count, I reopened because it should never have been closed since the closing was clearly against policy. And if the vote was properly closed, Cyde needs to have explained <i>why</i> he ruled as he did. Does this kind of thing happen often at AfD? I would have had my head handed to me for such cavalier action at RfA. Ah, which brings me to "pull my head in". Oh my, do you think that could actually happen? I think perhaps you are a little fuddled, Mark.&#160;:D -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 04:47, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is merely a soapbox for Wikipedia editors who want George W. Bush impeached. We already have an article called Movement to impeach George W. Bush, which in my opinion is informative and NPOV. It should also be of note that some editors who want this page here and are frequent editors to this page initiated a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Merecat_3be5.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Merecat">bad faith RfC against Merecat</a>, who was trying to make the page conform to NPOV. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueGoose_a607.html" title="User:BlueGoose">BlueGoose</a> 21:09, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>A vile and very not good faith assertion. You are well aware Merecat kept deleting things that were well sourced material. To say the RFC was an attack is ridiculous. All he has to do is stop deleting sourced material, and start discussing!<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" class="image" title="Holland"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png" alt="Holland" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" /></a> <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a>
<ul>
<li>Didn't you also call something I wrote "vile"? I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt because you're not a native speaker of English, but calling something or someone "vile" is fairly extreme, and in the context of a human being is a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 00:55, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 18:25, 3 May 2006 (UTC) Actually, merecat is the one who was operating in bad faith, and the RFC against him was founded on totally cogent grounds. Merecat was being abusive, was using ad hominem and straw man arguments, and was otherwise nitpicking over Alternet, despite the fact that Alternet is in this case and for these purposes a completely valid reference, due to its membership in the group of people at large who are making rationales for impeachment. Blue goose, you are just spewing bile ignorantly. You have made no edits, and are factually ignorant as far as i can tell about anything to do with the article. Your comments below to the effect that this is mostly from a "single book" are further evidence that you simply aren't paying attention and don't know what you are talking about. The facts are that millions of people think Bush should be impeached, and the article reflects a very broad set of citations to reflect this. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 18:25, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

As a side note, I am surprised that you would want a page of noise showing that you are being a manipulative nitpicker using ad hominem and straw man arguments to be used as any kind of evidence. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 18:25, 3 May 2006 (UTC) I am sorry if i failed to follow some protocol.

<dd>My point is to draw attention to the concurrent arrival of that editor and all the anon IP editors who caused havoc there tonight. I make no assertions and I draw no conclusions, but I think that the correlation in the arrival times is worth looking at. Is 205.188.116.13 actually one and the same as the IP vandals of tonight? I don't know. To me it seems likely, but others here can decide that for themselves. Are some editors who are opposed to this AfD making edits as anons towards the aim of messing up the pages to obscure the edit history?

<li><b>keep</b> Merecat and etc are just pov pushers of the republican agenda, and this is driven by that agenda. This article is a reasonable exploration of the factual rationales to impeach, which are now noteworthy enough to warrant an article. The idea that anybody arguing for impeachment needs to "read and study" is an ad hominem and silly; There are dozens of cogent reasons to impeach, and this is just a petty invalidation of those facts.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 22:32, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

Fine, I apologize for including you, since i don't know enough about you to know whether or not this is partisan antics. Merecat and Bluegoose on the other hand are known to me to be simple obstructionist republican game the system trolls. This is NOT a soap box, it IS a REPORT on the factual rationales of literally thousands of people in the USA and millions of people Globally on why Bush and Co should be impeached. That is a factual movement, and it is factually noteworthy, and it is not a soap box. If it were a soap box, it would be a very large soap box, it would have to be an intercontinental sized soap box. "Soap Box" is an invalidation and an ad hominem, and has no substance. So give me a REAL reason why you want the article deleted.</dd>

It is a long page, by all means feel free to be more specific. I have copied and pasted one section here. "Not a Soapbox." This article is not a Soap box. It is a factual report about the rationales used by the movement to impeach. You have made no valid point. Nobody has offered a single cogent reason why the article should be deleted. Again. What is the REAL reason you want the article deleted? ANSWER; There is next to no way to defend against it. The rationales are grounded in fact. You don't have an argument, so you are gaming the system. I'd be happy to help you generate a defense argument. I can't promise it will be cogent, but at least it will provide a POV balance. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 20:35, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You are thinking of the article <i>"People suggesting impeachment of Bush."</i> Clearly, this is not what this article is about. It offers several <b>arguments</b> in favour of impeachment, and to address the inevitable demand for censorship based on POV-OR allegations, numerous sources have been used to substantiate what is being presented. To object to sources is to invite a new AFD and it violates wikipedia policy.<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" class="image" title="Holland"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png" alt="Holland" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" /></a> <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a> 10:58, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not objecting to sources. What I am objecting to is the bloating of <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a> (and the article under discussion here) with such excessive detail that the editors can't even fit the reasons why some people want to impeach President Bush into the "Movement" article. Note that <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Johnson_4b5c.html" title="Andrew Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> covers that president's entire life from birth to death, including not just his impeachment but the rest of his presidency as well, in half the space used by <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a> -- and Johnson actually <b>was</b> impeached. I recognize that there is a movement to impeach President Bush which is sufficiently notable for a Wikipedia article, so I'm not calling for the deletion of <i>that</i> article, but I am saying that the pro-impeachment movement does not need <i>two</i> articles each twice the length of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Johnson_4b5c.html" title="Andrew Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> to be described and explained. Therefore, as a second choice, I would support a merger of <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationales_provided_by_advocates_of_the_impeachment_of_George_W._Bush_8ea4.html" title="Rationales provided by advocates of the impeachment of George W.

<p>"Wikipedia is not a soapbox Wikipedia is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not:</p>
<p>Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a "sympathetic point of view" for every article."</p>
<p>The article is NOT a soap box, it is in fact a report about a factual movement, and that movements factual rationales. If it was a soap box, one or two persons and their socks would be writing it from their own heads.

In fact, my opinion is that Mr. Bushes personal page should be treated in some senses as if it were his own virtual "user" page, and that information in that article should be confined to the facts as he might present them himself, were he the sole author. However much i may disagree with Bush or the admin, He is still the President of the United States Currently, and is deserving of a certain amount of respect.

<dd>His relentless comments regarding my person are tiresome. Needless to say he once again misrepresents his actions. When Merecat deletes referenced material I object, which everybody else would. When he continues to delete and then refuses to discuss, I object. This editor undoubtedly has the best intentions, however it seems he has problems argumenting his case and therefore resorts to assertions, ad hominem attacks, and other behaviour not helpful. Regarding the links, it is a fine example of Merecat refusing to discuss. Further, for an editor that uses rightwing sources it is utterly hypocritical to object to leftwing sources. Beyond that, nobody prevents him from inserting rightwing sources. Last, nowhere in wikipedia can we find anything about how many references can be used. Alleging it does, again shows the technique of making misleading assertions.<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" class="image" title="Holland"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png" alt="Holland" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" /></a> <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a> 11:08, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>strong keep</b> This article only claims to be exactly what it is titled: Rationales to impeach George Bush. And goes on to give exactly that, stated rationales to impeach George Bush. It is clear and easy to follow, it is thorough, although I could add some more reasons myself, and will after some research to substiantiate my claims. It states facts, something essential to an entry to an encyclopedia. It is well referenced. I say please keep it. It is one of the few politically oriented or controverisial articles I've seen on Wikipedia for a while that is not biased, just plain factual. <b>However, if any of you use this as an excuse to further harrass Merecat or anyone else, I will oppose you openly and relentlessly.</b> Let's all behave ourselves now and continue to work on this great article. <i>Maggie</i><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewolfstar_d89c.html" title="User:Thewolfstar">thewolfstar</a> 09:28, 3 May 2006 (UTC) (I corrected my grammer above and boldified some text) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewolfstar_d89c.html" title="User:Thewolfstar">thewolfstar</a> 09:32, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Reasons: i agree with Thewolfstar - my general impression is:
<ul>
<li>it's a list of well-referenced, externally documented facts, and claims of facts NPOV-presented as "claims"</li>
<li>the nature of the content <b>is</b> political, but so is the article about any politician - s/he is important because s/he has political power - all the more importantly that ordinary citizens can work together to document facts (except for personal data like address and sex life) related to that politician</li>
<li>BlueGoose wrote: <i>This article is merely a soapbox for Wikipedia editors who want George W. Bush impeached.</i> The same argument could say that <b>any article on a politician is a soapbox for electing or reelecting that politician to office</b>. We do not delete articles on Bush, Clinton, Clinton-Rodham, Kerry, Blair despite the fact that these articles, in some sense, constitute soapboxes. Instead, we NPOV individual sentences and the page structure, if needed, in order that we have NPOV presentation of externally documented, "verifiable", no-original-research facts.</li>
<li>My impression from the discussion page is that the people objecting to the article are unable or unwilling to find externally documented claims that individual "rationales" for impeaching Bush are false. Rather than deleting the page, i would suggest that people unhappy with the page <b>do the work of finding externally documented facts such as, e.g., source X [reference] notes that the invasion of Iraq was legal under US law because it only consisted of "forceful operations" and did not legally constitute a "war"</b> - (this is just a fictional example).</li>
<li>the <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a> article is too long to include the rationales there - people involved in that movement may be morally and/or legally justified, they may be morally and/or legally wrong, but the fact is that they are active in the movement - splitting their reasons (rationales) into this article makes sense</li>
<li><b>NPOV title change</b>: look for <i>Ad 1 The title</i> on the discussion page - IMHO the present title "rationales to impeach George W. Bush" <b>could</b> be interpreted to mean that the rationales are correct. IMHO the following two options should remove concerns that the subject may be POV:
<ul>
<li><b>Reasons cited for seeking George W. Bush's impeachment</b> - <i>reasons</i> is a more common word than <i>rationales</i>, we're not doing neo-postmodernist-poststructuralist reading of hermeunistic narratives here</li>
<li><b>Purported impeachable offenses of George W. Bush</b> - except that a simpler word than "purported" would be better, see previous point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both of these make it clear that wikipedia neither asserts that the rationales/reasons are valid nor that they are invalid, only that various people (listed in the "movement" article) have stated or cited these reasons. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 11:44, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> this ridiculous article. As I said in the first Afd, there is no way this can be NPOV.

<li>I voted "keep but rename and cleanup" in the last AfD. The name has remained the same, and is fatally problematic - sounds like Wikipedia thinks these are reasons to impeach. It should have a neutral title, e.g. <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationales_provided_by_advocates_of_the_impeachment_of_George_W._Bush_8ea4.html" title="Rationales provided by advocates of the impeachment of George W. Bush">Rationales provided by advocates of the impeachment of George W. Bush</a>. Unweildy, but clearly assigns the positions to identifiable individuals.

</li>
<li><b>Attempt at synthesis so far.</b> It seems to me that there would probably be consensus that:
<ul>
<li><b>Reasons cited for seeking George W. Bush's impeachment</b> or <b>Purported impeachable offenses of George W. Bush</b> is a subject which should be <b>somewhere</b> as part of a wikipedia article, provided that it is written in an NPOV way and properly referenced to external sources.</li>
<li>some people suggest that relevant content from this article should be salvaged and merged into <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a></li>
<li>some people suggest merging into <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush%27s_second_term_as_President_of_the_United_States_8ad5.html" title="George W. Bush's second term as President of the United States">George W. Bush's second term as President of the United States</a> or similar</li>
<li>A necessary criterion for merging into another page is page length - but the present page source text is <b>42 kbytes</b> long right now (according to mediawiki), so would require removing a huge amount of material, especially since there would also be the material of the page into which this would be merged. i don't see any easy NPOV way of condensing the article by such a big factor.</li>
<li>Given such a sensitive subject - after all Bush is the president of the world's most powerful military State - surely any claims of reasons why Bush should be impeached need to be referenced, so removing the references - which are a big part of the article source text - would be dangerous for any chance of consensing on NPOV.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a> mostly concentrates on the <b>people</b> and groups or organisations who are trying to impeach Bush - dividing this up from the actual reasons they allege are valid to impeach Bush seems reasonable to me - i don't see any other obvious solution</li>
<li>pages like <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush%27s_second_term_as_President_of_the_United_States_8ad5.html" title="George W. Bush's second term as President of the United States">George W. Bush's second term as President of the United States</a> are bound to get longer in the future since (even if an impeachment process gets going) he's going to be president for quite some time yet - i don't see how there's room to fit in an extra 42 kbytes somehow thinned out without removing relevant material.</li>
<li>So maybe it's worth asking these questions to both "keepers" and "deleters" and people not-so-easy-to-classify:
<ul>
<li>Does anyone claim that <b>Reasons cited for seeking George W. Bush's impeachment</b> or <b>Purported impeachable offenses of George W. Bush</b> should <b>not be documented in any wikipedia article</b>?</li>
<li>Can anyone explain (with some level of detail) how <b>Reasons cited for seeking George W. Bush's impeachment</b> or <b>Purported impeachable offenses of George W. Bush</b> can be merged into another article without removing relevant content and state which other article that is?</li>
<li>Does anyone object to renaming the present article to <b>Reasons cited for seeking George W. Bush's impeachment</b> or <b>Purported impeachable offenses of George W. Bush</b>?
<ul>
<li>BD2412's suggestion of <b>Rationales provided by advocates of the impeachment of George W. Bush</b> seems like a good idea too - long, but clearly NPOV. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 22:14, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Personal additional comment modifying my earlier comment - i think that <b>some</b> of the article needs to be more NPOV-ed - there are some statements that are POV or borderline POV. But this is not a reason for deleting the article, it's a reason for making small appropriate edits, doing things step-by-step and discussing them on the discussion page if there's any chance that they'll be controversial. And it's something which can probably happen more constructively if there's agreement on an NPOV title of the article. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 22:08, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> What is going on? I put up an article and don't understand why there's (1) a problem and (2) people being a accused to socking / meating activity. Aren't you jumping to conclusions based on the 4 paragraphs I've posted? Look at my history here, I've never even entered an article before and I've been on wikipedia for a while. Strange that we're being accused of questionable behaviour by people who aren't using their names, unless your parents named you DV?RS?, Irishguy, Aplomado and Accurizer. Why is it the aggressive behaviour is coming from people who are posting under usernames? Can we resolve this? <a href="../../../m/t/d/User%7EMtdierbeck_b805.html" title="User:Mtdierbeck">mtdierbeck</a>

<dd><b>Reply</b> I can elaborate for you the reasons why I nominated the article for deletion. It appears to be a neologism, which should be avoided on Wikipedia. See the guideline: <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms</a>. Also, it does not appear notable, as evidenced by the absense of google hits. See the essay: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>. Because of the lack of corroborating sources, it is difficult to verify whether the information presented in the article is accurate. See the policy: <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. It is also quite possible that the information contained in the article could be original thought, which cannot be posted in Wikipedia. See the policy: <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. I hope this helps explain the reasons for my nomination. <b>You should not take this nomination personally.</b> We would be happy to accept contributions from you that falls within Wikipedia policies. If you have other questions or wish to discuss further, please leave a note on my talk page rather than continuing the discussion here.

<dd>The article is apparently so misleading that people think he is Aruban. He is Dutch, and has not reached any notability beyond being accused of a crime by the mother of Natalee Holloway and the subsequent vitual lynch posse that went down on him. The accusation itself is notable, he himself is not at all. The fact that there is a whole article on him is related to accusations by the mother (the judges have released him because there is no (not enough) evidence), not anything else. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">KimvdLinde</a> 12:58, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per above -- and no, Aplomado, I don't think so; a quick check around Google reveals that at least the six or seven games on that list that I picked out randomly indeed exist and enjoy popularity. There's no indication that the same can be said of Bizu-Bizu. And really, a phrase like "common in Europe" doesn't quite inspire confidence. What, it's played from Helsinki to Amsterdam to London to Berlin to Barcelona? Really? If it's that popular and well-spread and capable of crossing national borders with ease, it's certainly keeping itself rather well-hidden. Similar drinking games are not unheard of, of course, but at best Bizu-Bizu might be mentioned as an alternate name under <a href="../../../f/i/z/FizzBuzz_031d.html" title="FizzBuzz">FizzBuzz</a> -- if someone can indicate that it actually enjoyes any degree of appreciable popularity under that name. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 22:12, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>First of all, this would be better for Wiktionary, since this is a definition, not an encyclopedic entry. Furthermore, it's not notable -- only 122 Google hits. <a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadren_9a46.html" title="User:Gadren">Gadren</a> 21:53, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article is so badly written, I regret to say, that it is impossible to really understand what the author is saying. I think the only important point that the author is making is that the absorbance is the sum of terms for each absorbing species. This is of course well known. For example, it is discussed on page 745 of "Physical Chemistry" by Ira N. Levine, 5th Ed (2002) and is probably discussed in every Physical Chemistry text. Note however, that this only holds if the different absorbing species do not interact with each other. This generalisation to several species is not covered in <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer-Lambert_law_32e1.html" title="Beer-Lambert law">Beer-Lambert law</a> and should be, but by an editor who can write more clearly than the editor of this article. Otherwise there is nothing worth keeping. I'm sorry if this is rather harsh on the author, but he has been given plenty of time to improve matters. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 01:52, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>CONGRATULATION</b>, You document the absolutely highest spectroscopic background of all who voted on this page, and you did it with quite a big gab in-between!!

<li>As you have worked out absolutely correct is, that everybody is able to find at least every part of "<b>General Beer Lambert Law</b>" in several publications, not only the one you cited, but that can only mean, that <b>there is nothing left, that's NOT according to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a></b>.</li>
<li>Even if it ever could happen, that your Note: "that this only holds if the different absorbing species do not interact with each other" should come true, it must miss all the power to validate your vote, anyway. Why? If we generate an Interim Balance Sheet:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1.) The terminus technicus is well known, and so it is allowed, according to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, that <b>Wikipedia</b> may contain an article with this particular headline.</dd>
<dd>2.) The content of the article is also well reported, even if mostly not correct, so it is still according to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.</dd>
<dd>3.) There is an absolutely significant difference between "<b>Special <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer-Lambert_law_32e1.html" title="Beer-Lambert law">Beer-Lambert law</a></b>" and "<b>General Beer Lambert Law</b>", which cannot be closed by the "<b>Special <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer-Lambert_law_32e1.html" title="Beer-Lambert law">Beer-Lambert law</a></b>", - what surprise!!!, so it is only legal, that both article exist within harmony.</dd>
<dd>4.) Also 'your' quite excellent citation is anyway presenting several mistakes, that's why I can't use it on the article page, but for a discussion page, it will be all time "adequate". But the citation situation is with it not really solved (<a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>). Please allow, that I will respond a little later to this problem.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Now you have to accept,</b> that the note of 'your' citation is completely <b>wrong</b> for the "<b>General Beer Lambert Law</b>", is it a surprise to you? What you think, where the name is coming from? And be told, that’s not the only lack of the "<b>Special <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer-Lambert_law_32e1.html" title="Beer-Lambert law">Beer-Lambert law</a></b>", that is lost, on the way to the "<b>General Beer Lambert Law</b>". But that's only for you, and for sure, not a theme for this page.</li>
<li><b>Finally for you:</b> Even if it is hard to accept, you can not correct the "<b>Special <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer-Lambert_law_32e1.html" title="Beer-Lambert law">Beer-Lambert law</a></b>" in the way you think, and I think you have already realized it, because you will affront any professor and any student, any industry, and who ever else in a very bad way. Think only as an Example what 'your' correction must have for consequences for <b>ISA</b>! So the coexistence of both articles makes live much easier!!

<dl>
<dd>1.) We all know now, that absolutely every peace of the "<b>General Beer Lambert Law</b>" article is published thousand times on different places, as I told, and as <i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyZ_5810.html" title="User:AndyZ">AndyZ</a></i>&#160;<sub><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndyZ_665b.html" title="User talk:AndyZ">t</a></sub> and <a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> have shown us.</dd>
<dd>2.) But we know too, that all citations contains at least one or more ERRORS, except one cite, but that cite is for me not allowed to use.</dd>
<dd>3.) Such a situation is not covert by any statement of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, so the problem must be solved outside of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, but must be kept as congruent as possible to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>.</dd>
<dd>4.) Citation would not be any problem, also for <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, if we would drop all ethic and all politeness, too, because we could use best citations and correct them with other citations, which are also wrong, but correct in the part we need to correct the first citations. I have to admit, that this procedure has not enough ethic and even not enough politeness, at least for me.</dd>
<dd>5.) Now the question is, but on the other hand, is it ethic, to delete a legal page (<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>), because the whole science in this field has gone wrong, and penalise all students, and everybody, only to be formalistic more then only correct?</dd>
<dd>6.) Could it be possible to fulfil the last 'letter' of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> ONLY to 98.9% and expose at the same moment an article with a known correctness of exactly 100% to everybody who is interested in knowledge? I think that's the final question we all have to solve/vote, because we know with the same true, that merging/correcting the "<b>Special <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer-Lambert_law_32e1.html" title="Beer-Lambert law">Beer-Lambert law</a></b>" cannot be any solution with accordance to anything called ethic.</dd>

<dd>Is it really true, that absolutely no specialist in spectroscopy is a member of <b>Wikipedia</b>?</dd>
<dd>Is there also no student of chemistry/physics of a really higher semester known as a member?</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I've read the article (in several versions), the author's comments here and on the the talk page, and I'm still not quite certain what this is all about, but it's now a little clearer. My original opinion stated at Talk:General Beer Lambert Law that it's <i>original research at best</i> still stands. I'm not a physicist, chemist or expert in spectroscopy myself, but I've consulted some who are and they all agree with me on this. The suggestion that Wikipedia will lose prestige by rejecting this clearly unsuitable material leads me to revisit my earlier suspicion that it may even be a prank. I've now a strong hunch that it is. Proof unnecessary, delete as OR in any case. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 13:29, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If they're "nationally recognized", they should indicate how they are so recognized (for example, the American Lawyer's AMLAW 100 or a similar national industry periodical); if they want to draft an article on collection law, that might be useful. It looks like they've parrotted much of a California statute in the article; that's certainly not worthy of anything more than a link to the California code. Not useful. <a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmawnmahlau_bb67.html" title="User:Smawnmahlau">Smawnmahlau</a> 01:55, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
