<li><b>Nominator withdraws nomination</b>. Article has been edited so that it is sourced to radio program. That works for me, even though the archive of the radio programs is hosted on the AYP site. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefferson_Anderson_066f.html" title="User:Jefferson Anderson">Jefferson Anderson</a> 18:05, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Hi Jefferson Anderson. I was just wondering if you happened to read the discussion page on the article before applying the AfD. It may help to explain why the article had been deleted in the first place. Also, I made a note to please let me know any problems with the article so that I may create it to better suit Wiki standards. I'd think it would be in Wikipedia's best interest to improve on the articles as opposed to quickly deleting ones which could be fixed to comply. This is my first article so I will be the first to admit that I may need a bit of help, but it doesn't help at all when someone comes by and adds an AfD without explanation, apparently without even taking a look at the discussion page. I hope we can work together to solve the problems with the article as opposed to the deletion of an article which should have a home on Wikipedia. I will be looking forward to your correspondence. Thank you and have a great day. <a href="../../../m/d/y/User%7EMdyogi_4405.html" title="User:Mdyogi">Mdyogi</a> 21:36, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Maybe I should go ahead and start the discussion regarding your problems with the article. Yes the books are published by AYP, but I see little reason why this would be a problem. As a matter of fact, I can list 10 spiritual teachers off the top of my head (with current wikipedia articles) who publish their own books. Let me know if you'd like me to do so. Meanwhile, you haven't seemed to take notice that all the books are consistently (and often significantly) within the Amazon 100k rank level in the USA, Canada and Europe, and are in the process of being published in India as well. Regarding references, I wasn't sure exactly what needed references so I just did my best with what I thought might need it. It would be helpful if you could point out what exactly needs references and I can take it from there. I am willing to work with you on this, and I hope you will do the same. Thank you and have a great day. <a href="../../../m/d/y/User%7EMdyogi_4405.html" title="User:Mdyogi">Mdyogi</a> 21:53, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - And one more thing. What was the problem with the quotes section? The subject is widely known for that quote which is the basis of his teaching. <a href="../../../m/d/y/User%7EMdyogi_4405.html" title="User:Mdyogi">Mdyogi</a> 22:07, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Speedy Delete</b> db-repost. There should not have been a second AfD.</s> <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 23:44, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (I was the one who 1st marked it for speedy deletion) -This is a young article, give it a change to find some sources so it can prove if it is verifiable or not (Template accordingly). This is obviously a completely different case from the first time the older article was nominated for eletion, and we should assume good faith. <a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfacets_25b2.html" title="User:Sfacets">Sfacets</a> 06:13, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, that is precisely why I AfD'ed it rather than speedy it. I really don't think the sources are there, but certainly if reliable third party references can be found... <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefferson_Anderson_066f.html" title="User:Jefferson Anderson">Jefferson Anderson</a> 15:56, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hi Jefferson Anderson. I plan on working on the sources this weekend, but why AfD the article in the first place instead of a tag which would serve as a warning? The article is less than a week old. I have no arguments with the article needing some work, I just don't understand the need to pull the trigger on the AfD so quickly. Now that I have a better understanding of what needs to be done, I will be happy to update the article according to Wiki standards. If you wouldn't mind explaining exactly what you feel needs sources, it would be of even greater help. Thanks and have a great day. <a href="../../../m/d/y/User%7EMdyogi_4405.html" title="User:Mdyogi">Mdyogi</a> 18:12, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless reliable sources can be added to the article, per WP:RS. Otherwise it is hard to judge whether he is notable. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 17:47, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
