<p>I'd like to nominate this for deletion for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The list is so long that both Firefox 1.0 and latest IE hang for a long time while trying to display the page (on a 3GHz PC with 1GB RAM). This is extremely annoying and makes Wikipedia appear unprofessional.</li>
<li>If this was addressed by splitting the page into many smaller lists by letter, it becomes even harder to maintain. If this AFD fails I think it should be split in that way, though, to at least address the browser issue.</li>
<li>There is very little encyclopedic value to this article.</li>
<li>It is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. I'm aware of the arguments that the entries are easily verified, but show me another list on the subject and I'll accept it's not OR.</li>
<li>It is unknown how many songs are actually missing that should be included.</li>
<li>I find it hard to see situations where this would be useful.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm not a deletionist or inclusionists. I don't like such labels and I don't think they have any place on Wikipedia. But I do think that this article is plain silly. I acknowledge that people have put a fair amount into compiling this list, but frankly this fact does not make the article any more useful.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are many articles on Wikipedia in which I have no interest. That doesn't mean they should be deleted. Mosts lists are incomplete, and it's not ideologically unsound for this to be the same (if it were a 'serious' topic, then the incompletedness would be an issue). Its size suggests that there are sufficient people interested in it. If it is unmanagable, then split it up. If you feel you wouldn't like to attempt that, then leave it to someone else. It has already survived twice: accept consensus. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS">The JPS</a> 15:33, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Wikipedia is not a data mining operation. There are an infinite number of ways we could divide up the sum total of all songs ever written - how about the songs whose titles do appear in the lyrics, the songs whose titles appear N times in the lyrics, etc? Obviously we can't have them all, so we have to just pick a few. But who decides which are the most important ways to divide up and list songs by arbitrary criteria? I think Wikimedia projects should provide the raw material for researchers to create their own custom lists along these lines, but leave the original research to the researchers. A wiki-datamining project would be interesting, come to think of it... but this isn't the place for it. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowersofnight_dd24.html" title="User:Flowersofnight">flowersofnight</a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFlowersofnight_468d.html" title="User talk:Flowersofnight">(talk)</a> 18:47, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per The JPS. Moreover, why does the phrase "original research" pop up every single time a list is NfD? Wikipedia articles are not supposed to be carbon copies of existing works of literature, either in content or in concept. And anyway, it doesn't take much research to discover that a given song doesn't contain the title in its lyrics. -- <a href="../../../s/m/j/User%7ESmjg_a789.html" title="User:Smjg">Smjg</a> 19:42, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the OR claim is that the characteristic of being a song whose title does not appear in its lyrics is somehow notable. That claim could be established by citing, say, a journal article that discussed such songs.

<li><b>Keep</b> for the following reasons.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Everyone is saying this list is arbitrary, however, isn't much of the less "official" stuff on Wikipedia the same? For example, many songs by many bands somehow merit their own encyclopedic entry, with seemingly no "encyclopedic value" to back them up. I cite <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Final_Cut_%28song%29_077b.html" title="The Final Cut (song)">The Final Cut</a> and <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smile_Like_You_Mean_It_4352.html" title="Smile Like You Mean It">Smile Like You Mean It</a>, among others. On a similar note, I will cite <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, and all of the year entries, which were seemingly created just for the hell of adding an entry that tells us what happened in that year. Arbitrarily done.</li>
<li>In reference to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> and the years, as mentioned above, these are similar lists. Extremely long, ridiculous to read in one sitting anyway, and serving no purpose, just as people say about this list.</li>
<li>Also on the same note, articles on dates, such as <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_10.html" title="January 10">January 10</a> are the same ridiculous pointlessness.</li>
<li>Who can feasibly manage any large article? If you are going to be on that bandwagon, who can manage an article such as <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number.html" title="Number">Number</a>, which is large, and yet still there. And it is also split up, and yet it's there.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In conclusion, I just don't get deleting the article. Especially, as per above, if the consensus has kept it on for two times already.--<a href="../../../l/j/l/User%7ELjlego_3be3.html" title="User:Ljlego">Ljlego</a> 02:26, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To address Ljlego's points:</dd>
<dd>1) Saying "We have an article on Crappy topic A, therefore Crappy topic B is fine" is not good enough. Digging up any old junk on Wikipedia and using it as an excuse to let more rubbish in does not do the 'pedia any good. Perhaps "Crappy topic A" should not be there either, just nobody's got around to deleting it yet.</dd>
<dd>2,3) If you're looking for examples of long, boring lists to illustrate your point, you could not have made a worse choice than the year and date entries. They're featured on the main page, occasioanlly quoted in newspapers, and are clearly interesting.</dd>
<dd>4) The <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number.html" title="Number">Number</a> article is large, but it's of a very high standard and is well maintained. It's also not likely to get much bigger. The song list is extremely large, it's just a dumping ground for essentially identical info, and there's no indication that its growth is slowing. And the bigger it gets the less meaningful the contents. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyk_0a6a.html" title="User:Reyk">The El Reyko</a> 03:34, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm confused. This *is* a list of songs with titles not in the lyrics. It would be kind of pointless to include instrumental songs in the list, as they do not have lyrics and all of them would qualify. Kotepho 16:24, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>: How or why is this list useful in any way? I have not yet heard a single good argument in support of it. Certain trivia can be of interest (even useful) but these aren't. The list of arguments to delete it is endless (see above). --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteerpike_44bb.html" title="User:Steerpike">Steerpike</a> 21:48, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> As a music lover and fanatic, this is just the type of random information I come to Wikipedia for. It offers tremendous value for people who organize and collect music. This is what makes Wikipedia so powerful. Where else could we find a list like this? Absolutely nowhere. This article needs to stay. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.74.168.177 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.74.168.177_23d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.74.168.177">contribs</a>).</small></li>
