<p>Is every single fictional battle in the Star Wars universe notable and encyclopedic, or is this just far too granular?

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> part of a well-documented, interlinked series of articles on Star Wars events. 12 different articles link to it (not counting the VfD) so deleting it would just make lots of redlinks and it would eventually be recreated anyway. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 23:45, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><strike><b>Keep</b></strike>. This is a major thing, and Episode III will detail it. And Kappa, you're right, this is a "cruft purge". -- <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 03:02, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Man, you really shoulda taken it slow with the cruft nominations. I mean, Or at least stuck to the more minor of the stuff. Like people have been saying, this is pretty damn major.-<a href="../../../l/t/n/User%7ELtNOWIS_fcfd.html" title="User:LtNOWIS">LtNOWIS</a> 03:11, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure how I feel about this. Can supporters give some examples of notable fictional events, especially battles, that would have their own article outside the coverage of the piece of fiction? Something outside geekdom (Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Star Trek and the like) would be more convincing. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> 03:40, 2005 Mar 10 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, thanks for classifying us already, Demi. This article is about the killing of the Jedi during and after Episode III. Since III has not come out yet, no one can automatically confirm what will be seen and whatnot, not to mention a spillage of spoilers that I would not want to see myself. I know that the end of the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clone_Wars_%28Star_Wars%29_b249.html" title="Clone Wars (Star Wars)">Clone Wars</a> and the Purge are related, in the way that <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a> takes over as Emperor using deceit and betrayal. So I'm a geek. Sue me. -- <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 03:51, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry if you construed what I said as insulting; I didn't mean it that way. I'm a geek, too, but what I'm saying is this: is this applicable outside its narrow constituency? There are plenty of works of fiction as notable or more notable than Star Wars; do we enumerate and examine their plot points <i>in articles of their own</i>? So far, I think not, but I'm willing to be convinced; and you didn't answer my question. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> 05:48, 2005 Mar 10 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For one thing, the Purge didn't have any established battles. They just took everything over and executed like the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazis</a> did. That's where real-life parallels are made. -- <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 06:15, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Interesting thing just happened. A Star Wars Wiki just popped up. We will then probably move all this over there. Also, on another note, I often wonder why every Star Trek episode is allowed to have an article. Refer to <a href="../../../e/n/t/List_of_Star_Trek%7E_Enterprise_episodes_a335.html" title="List of Star Trek: Enterprise episodes">List of Star Trek: Enterprise episodes</a> for an example. -- <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 06:39, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Probably because there are large numbers of Star Trek-loving wikipedians. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 11:38, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Skywalker keep</b>. Oh, the irony. This one is just too good to pass up.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Can I be clear here - is this an article about a fictional event that we don't know about because the film hasn't been released yet? <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 10:02, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This has always been known about, however Episode III may be the first movie to show this in action. Then again, it may remain purely <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expanded_Universe_%28Star_Wars%29_acd4.html" title="Expanded Universe (Star Wars)">EU</a>. (But what do I care now when we have a Star Wars Wiki that this can go into). -- <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 10:32, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Surely Wikipedia does not need an article on a fictional battle in a movie that hasn't been released yet. Maybe when Episode III is released, we can come back to it and see if it really is something worth writing about seperately. (Although probably even then I'd favor just including it in the article on Episode III.) <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemes_f03e.html" title="User:Remes">Remes</a> 20:43, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Whatever is ultimately decided here, can it be moved <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Precedents_e2a3.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents">/Precedents</a> to help with criteria for the notability of fictional phenomena and events? <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> 22:01, 2005 Mar 10 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I don't think individual plot points or phenomena from a work of fiction (no matter how notable the work is), is notable unless it has greater usage outside its own fans. I can't see The Trial of Alice from <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> having its own article. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> 22:07, 2005 Mar 10 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hastings_16cc.html" title="Battle of Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a>, yep, this, nope. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 02:11, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Provided that it's given the proper context, etc. If we have an article on <a href="../../../e/w/o/Ewok.html" title="Ewok">Ewoks</a>, then I don't see why we can't have one on this. <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinadot_5292.html" title="User:Binadot">Binadot</a> 05:48, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. If this article is moved to the Star Wars wiki, what will happen to all the other articles concerning anything about the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expanded_Universe_%28Star_Wars%29_acd4.html" title="Expanded Universe (Star Wars)">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a> and films of Star Wars? There certainly are a lot and it would be a major project to move them all. Is it necessary to partially or completely purge a subject if its own wiki pops up? <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeolien_3143.html" title="User:Aeolien">Aeolien</a> 03:36, 2005 Mar 12 (UTC)

<li>Ask GRider. He was unaware of this Wookieepedia until very recently, and still he submits articles for deletion based on their Google hits.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I certainly don't think that we should remove info from Wikipedia just because a different wiki opens up. All info available on Wikipedia is available somewhere else be it on other websites or in books &amp;c b/c there isn't supposed to be any original research, the point is we want to create a free <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> here... Unless there is a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia.html" title="Wikimedia">Wikimedia</a> project established or there is a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Meta</a> policy established to link Wikipedia and the Star Wars wiki, I think info should stay, even if it is copied over to the SWW. -- <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochaber_a720.html" title="User:Lochaber">Lochaber</a> 13:03, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd just like to point out that "Transwiki" means "move to another wikimedia project," not "let's put this in some other wiki."

<li><b>Keep.</b> Events of this magnitude in any universe that is covered in Wikipedia should have their own article. Basic facts have already been covered as backstory to the later works.
