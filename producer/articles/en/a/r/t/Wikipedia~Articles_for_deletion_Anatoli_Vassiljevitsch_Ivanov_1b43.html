<p>This is a yet another multiple-Wiki contribution by Djiggy / 84.113.1.108.</p>
<p>This person's notability seems to be impossible to verify (<a href="http://www.google.pl/search?hl=pl&amp;q=%22Anatoli+Vassiljevitsch+Ivanov%22&amp;lr=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.pl/search?hl=pl&amp;q=%22Anatoli+Vassiljevitsch+Ivanov%22&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">0 in Google</a>), which is odd for a modern, acclaimed composer of international fame, and a <s>head</s><span style="color:blue">noted member</span> of several professional organizations; if you Google for him without the middle name, <i>Anatoli Ivanov</i> yields a couple of film producers and other possibly notable persons, but nothing that would match this bio.</p>
<p>The ISBN referenced in the article seems to be bogus (<a href="http://worldcat.org/isbn/5926802954" class="external autonumber" title="http://worldcat.org/isbn/5926802954" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.google.pl/search?hl=pl&amp;q=isbn+5926802954&amp;lr=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.pl/search?hl=pl&amp;q=isbn+5926802954&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>).</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> For what its worth, I did a search on rambler.ru, a russian search site and found very little, maybe 173 hits. Keeping in mind of course that Ivanov is about as common as Smith, this is underwhelming. The Russian percussionist assocation (Российской Ассоциации исполнителей на ударных инструментах) pulled up exactly one hit and its to Russian Wikipedia. I wouldn;t say its a hoax, but a polyglot vanity piece for an unknown Russian musician. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 14:38, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, sorry but this is not a hoax, please buy his book and read all this, you can go to your state library, im sure that you will find it there, and also in russian wikipedia, this article was editied by the students of prof. Iwanow. This article was also translated in all the languages by my firends, so that i can post it in the different wikipedias. I PERSONNALY know prof. Iwanow. So i dont understand, why should it be a hoax. And now i also do not know how should i verify my posts in all other wikipedias, which decided to delete this article, becuase i dont understand all of these languages, hmmh. And i dont understand why if this article has been verifyed in the german wikipedia, whould it be veryfied in all oithers? it is a translation guys 1:1!!! --<a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjiggy_e06f.html" title="User:Djiggy">Djiggy</a> 22:38, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> He is not "head of a couple organizations", just a member; he only heads the sadly ungooglable Russian Percussionist Association, which is a shame but it does not necessarily mean the whole thing is a hoax. Remember that Google is somewhat less effective as a verifying tool if you can't handle cyrillic and/or don't know Russian. I don't know your notability criteria guys, so I'm not going to vote myself, but let me give you a few addresses as a basis for whatever you're going to decide.

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree that verifying information about him is difficult, but this is something different from a hoax, and deleting the article need not be the best cure for that -- research is. Regarding google: Russian is a heavily inflected language and you have to search for him also in cases other than the nominative. Another thing is that while in the English part of the Web, you can sometimes find info even about your neighbour's dog, this isn't so for Russian, although the Russian web is much better developed than, say, its Byelorussian counterpart. Information is simply not so readily available on that side of the globe. Now about the ruwiki article: while you are correct that Galrashe started it, her self-promotion has been <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%98%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%2C_%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%92%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87&amp;diff=1101826&amp;oldid=1098394" class="external text" title="http://ru.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%98%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%2C_%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%92%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87&amp;diff=1101826&amp;oldid=1098394" rel="nofollow">removed by another user</a>, to whom I already wrote asking for sources on Ivanov. So there is some hope we'll learn more about him from an objective source. Once again: his notability is not that of a film star, he seems to be just a guy doing his job a bit better than others, in several respects. Whether to keep him or not will be your decision, all I'm asking is for him not to be treated on a par with the person who used him as a ladder, that just wouldn't be fair. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBansp_7ee9.html" title="User:Bansp">Bansp</a> 12:16, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Can't help adding that I share Lcamtuf's suspicion that we are looking at a rather massive advertising campaign of the Rashe gal. I think part of it was posting an article about someone real and reasonably notable, and hooking the gal's bio to it. As a result of bad timing and thanks to the alertness of our plwiki colleague, <a href="../../../../pl/z/i/e/User%7EZiel_1a9b.html" class="extiw" title="pl:User:Ziel">pl:User:Ziel</a>, the wannabe-star is now falling down still hooked to her ladder (i.e. her teacher).

<li>Regarding Yandex, the search results need solid sifting, cause there are several people by this name, including at least one pretty well known musician (like, <a href="http://kgamit.narod.ru/rus/sotrudniki/ivanov/ivanov.htm" class="external text" title="http://kgamit.narod.ru/rus/sotrudniki/ivanov/ivanov.htm" rel="nofollow">this isn't our guy</a>). While I agree with the general spirit of your comment, I'd suggest pointing at more specific sources (which of course we might need to delegate to Djiggy, as probably the most fluent in Russian among us here; finding a Russian speaker not involved in this campaign would be even better).

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes it was me who added information about Iwanows presidency of the association on ruwiki. I dont think that it possible to find any links which can confirm this at the moment, so i wasnt able to find any. The reason for this could be that the association was created only one year ago and Iwanow was one of the grounders. My source of this information was Iwanow himself. At the moment he is travelling much mainly in Russia to rucruit the members. I will search further, but i think my search for facts wouldn't be very successful because at the moment this organisation is simply to small. The publications in austrain shop are the same as <a href="http://www.las-knigas.ru/?ware=388671" class="external text" title="http://www.las-knigas.ru/?ware=388671" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.las-knigas.ru/?ware=388731" class="external text" title="http://www.las-knigas.ru/?ware=388731" rel="nofollow">here</a>. These two volumes are the guide for the starters, who want to play percussions. But his main work is the transcription of <a href="../../../p/y/o/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky_36db.html" title="Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>'s "Children's Album". <a href="http://www.artis.spb.ru/index.php?day=24.03.04&amp;lang=rus&amp;kat=&amp;teatr=" class="external text" title="http://www.artis.spb.ru/index.php?day=24.03.04&amp;lang=rus&amp;kat=&amp;teatr=" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a link to the announcement of his concert in St. Petersburg's Phillarmony on 24.03.04.--<a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjiggy_e06f.html" title="User:Djiggy">djiggy</a> 15:43, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I just want to correct - These(<a href="http://www.las-knigas.ru/?ware=388671" class="external text" title="http://www.las-knigas.ru/?ware=388671" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.las-knigas.ru/?ware=388731" class="external text" title="http://www.las-knigas.ru/?ware=388731" rel="nofollow">here</a>) two albums are not cds or vinyls. These two volumes are collections of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Note.html" title="Note">notes</a> of Iwanow's compositions, which are based on famous russian <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folklore.html" title="Folklore">folklore</a> meldies, and have been composed for percussionists-beginners. --<a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjiggy_e06f.html" title="User:Djiggy">djiggy</a> 13:30, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. The guy may be for real, and has made at least one recording with the Leningrad Phil as a featured percussionist does not make him notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> It' not only a recording, where you should look at. Moreover, do you really think that in his 23 years long carreer at Leningrad Phillarmonic Orchestra - the most famous orchestra in Russia - he has made only one reording? The reason for this, that you cannot find his name on other cds is just because that it is not usual to print a cast of the whole orchestra(About 200 Members!!!) in the booklet or even in the internet. --<a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjiggy_e06f.html" title="User:Djiggy">djiggy</a> 09:33, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
