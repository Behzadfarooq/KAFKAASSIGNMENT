<li><b>Comment</b>: In regards to claims of vote-stacking, their are large amounts of people who beleive well-written articles for schools are inherently notable. Merely bringing an article to someones attention is no more votestacking than providing a link for someone is. If you'll notice, GRider's contributions were far and wide and not concentrated on any bloc or mailing list group. Speaking for myself, I evaluated the article and voted to keep it out of sincere belief that it deserved to be kept and not out of any votestacking motivation. I have faith that the majority of the other voters did as well.

<li>I believe there <i>was</i> something going that could fairly be called vote-stacking. I don't think this activity helps Wikipedia. But it is an obvious way in which it has always been possible to game the VfD system. It's also nothing new; the members of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AIW" class="extiw" title="m:AIW">m:AIW</a> have never made any secret about their intentions to act as a bloc, and have often publicized school VfD discussions on their page in Meta. I also believe there is absolutely no cure for this than wouldn't be worse than the disease. If I were the acting sysop on this I would count all the votes made by people to whom GRider sent emails, as I don't suspect any of them of being socks. GRider should not be surprised if this sort of activity engenders mistrust on my part, but perhaps he feels he will never have occasion to seek my cooperation. Meanwhile, I intend to continue to read VfD, vote in those discussions where I think I can contribute or have strong feelings, cast my vote, and move on, and I advise others to do the same. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:59, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> makes a compelling point. (The school that I went to is just shy — no-one is completely sure about the founding date — of being 1100 years old at this point.) Being 150 years old may make a school stand out from the crowd in the United States, but it does not <i>in India</i>.<br />
There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of schools in the world. An encyclopaedia is not simply a directory. It contains knowledge, not mere information. To be worthy of an individual article an entity in a crowd of hundreds of thousands or millions has to stand out from that crowd. For a school, there has to be something more than can be inferred from the fact that it is a school (and thus has all of the acoutrements that that entails, such as enrollment, teachers, songs, crests, buildings, sports teams, and so forth). As <a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> points out, this one has nothing.<br />
Furthermore: It is both saddening and amusing to see the block votes above. It's saddening to see <i>identical</i> votes being cast across all of the <i>different</i> articles, giving the impression that the voters have not in fact read the actual articles that they are purporting to be commenting upon. It's amusing to see the votes being cast in this case, given that <b>this school doesn't actually exist</b> by the name given. There is a Mahajana Pre-University College in Erode, which has gone by that name since 1971-1972. But even before that its name was Mahajana Higher Secondary School. The only <b>Mahajana High School</b> is in <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mysore.html" title="Mysore">Mysore</a>, not <a href="../../../e/r/o/Erode.html" title="Erode">Erode</a>.<br />
