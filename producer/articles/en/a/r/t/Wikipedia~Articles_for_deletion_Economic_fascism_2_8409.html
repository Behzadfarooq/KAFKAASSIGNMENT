<p>The article was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Economic_fascism_ed0f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Economic fascism">deleted before</a>, only to be ressurected again. It is unencyclopedic and has no hope of ever being anything other than a stub or a description of the views held by some <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">libertarians</a> on the issue of state intervention in the economy. The definition of fascism is highly disputed; the existence of a separate economic system called "economic fascism" is not supported by the majority of economists and historians. The idea that state intervention in the economy is inherently fascist would be seen as utterly absurd by all but a handful of authors, all of which are economic libertarians. The term "economic fascism" does not appear in any encyclopedic sources. At this point, the article does not contain any information which is not already present in <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a>, and I believe that that article is the appropriate location for discussing fascist economic policies and the various interpretations given to them. A separate article for one particular such interpretation is not only unneeded, but positively harmful given the controversy and POV surrounding anything related to fascism. <b>Delete.</b> Mihnea Tudoreanu 07:21, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment to voters from author of article</b>: The statement above: "The idea that state intervention in the economy is inherently fascist would be seen as utter absurd..." is misleading. The article does not say that. It clearly says it's an overall economic system including a "<a href="../../../p/l/a/Planned_economy.html" title="Planned economy">planned economy</a>" and "<b>heavy</b> coordination of the means of production, among other characteristics. Mere economic intervention is <b>not</b> "inherently fascist." The article says no such thing nor gives any such impression (This message left 5 days after voting started, unfortunately). <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 15:57, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment to Administrators</b> I'd just like to note that Minhea Tudoreanu is going around spreading false information in campaigning to get this article deleted. He's writing to various editors' talk pages the following: "There is an ongoing attempt to define state intervention in the economy as inherently fascist through the creation of an article entitled economic fascism..." This is false. The article clearly says that economic fascism includes a "<a href="../../../p/l/a/Planned_economy.html" title="Planned economy">planned economy</a>" and says the means of production are "<b>heavily</b> coordinated"; it obviously does not say that economic fascism is mere intervention. Of course people are going to vote to delete if that's what it said. *I* would vote to delete in that case or edit the article to say otherwise. Tudoreanu placed this message in the Talk pages of users such as <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">user:El_C</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/s/User%7ESesel_cc8a.html" title="User:Sesel">user:Sesel</a>, and <a href="../../../r/u/y/User%7ERuy_Lopez_187d.html" title="User:Ruy Lopez">user:Ruy Lopez</a> who then voted to delete. <b>Administrators please take note of this in your analysis.</b> <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 05:42, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As one of the users receiving a notice from Minhea Tudoreanu, I reject the claim that he has sent me false information. Even if he were sending false information, the point would be moot. I respect Minhea Tudoreanu; but I do not vote based on how he tells me to vote. I am certain that the same is the case with the other editors receiving the notices... Since RJII has metioned Minhea, I will use this thread as a chance to offer him a belated thanks for the message. I would not have seen this AfD had it not been for his note on my talk page. I hope that he continues to send me similar notices so that I can better stay informed of important discussions on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 09:07, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So that explains your confusion over what the article is about. In order to give this some semblance of being fair. I'm going to have to leave a few notices on the Talk pages of others. But, unlike Tudoreanu, I'm not going to misrepresent the article. I'm just going to let them know a vote is going on. This won't fix the damage that has been done by Tudoreanu, because obviously he has misled several, but it may help alleviate the injustice. <b>Administrators</b>: Please give me time to do this. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 15:45, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> <i>Economic fascism</i> is a notable term that deserves its own article. It has over 11,000 hits on a Google search. Scholoarly papers are written about it, use the term, etc. Minhea Tudoreany, who put this article up for deleteion says "the idea that state intervention in the economy is inherently fascist would be seen as utterly absurd by all but a handful of authors, all of which are economic libertarians." Well, the article says nothing of the sort so I don't know where he's getting that. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 14:58, 2 December 2005 (UTC) (author of the article)
<ul>
<li>The number of google hits can tell you whether a term is widely used, but it cannot tell you whether it deserves its own article. Given the way "economic fascism" tends to be used, I would classify it as a <a href="../../../p/e/j/Pejorative.html" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> term and mention it in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_epithets.html" title="List of political epithets">list of political epithets</a>. -- Mihnea Tudoreanu 22:43, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry but that makes me laugh. That's totally bizarre. It's not a "pejorative" term ..it's just a term. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 00:11, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Google hits tell us nothing about encyclopedic standards.

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a>, agree with Capitalistroadster. An article on economics under fascism, if there were enough material to justify a separate article, should be entitled economics under fascism or something similar. "Economic fascism" implies fascism through economics. Almost all those google hits for "economic fascism" are from economic libertarians. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 17:41, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What does the fact that "Almost all those google hits for "economic fascism" are from economic libertarians" have to do with anything? The fact is, the term is used and is notable. Anyway, most economists today are economic libertarians so it's no surprise the most usages of the term are by laissez-faire advocates. It's POV of you to want to get rid of the article because laissez-faire advocates use the term. Totally unjustified. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 18:18, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Most economists today are economic libertarians"? That is a bold - and, I would argue, ridiculous - claim. But that's not the point here. If only (or mostly) laissez-faire advocates use a term, then <b>that term should clearly be presented as such</b>. I would not object to an article entitled Libertarian perspectives on fascism that included all the information currently found in <i>Economic fascism</i>. -- Mihnea Tudoreanu 22:43, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I should have been more clear. When I did the Google search, I primarily saw paranoid pages talking about how the United States was practicing economic fascism, or was on the way down the path to doing so, which is unrelated to what you've written about. I think what you've written is good, and non-POV, but I think it's redundant and should be merged with and redirected to fascism. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 19:16, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That still doesn't negate the fact that the concept and term is noteable in and of itself. If someone wants to know what economic fascism is, after coming across it, they should be able to go direct to an article on it instead of having to wade through the desultory generalized fascism article. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 20:26, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The problem is that no one agrees what economic fascism is. All the definitions you've found are hopelessly vague. -- Mihnea Tudoreanu 22:43, 4 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Everybody agrees that economic fascism is the economic system practiced in fascist nations. Sure, there is some variations between definitions but they're in general agreement. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 00:13, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, let us base an article on hearsay. [/sarcasm] On a more serious note, it has been my experience that whenever the term "economic fascism" is used neutrally in academic circles, it tends to be used as a synonym for "the economic policies of fascist governments".

<dd>Look up capitalism, buddy. Merriam-Webster (unabridged) defines it as: "an economic system characterized by private or corporation ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision <b>rather than by state control</b>, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are <b>determined mainly in a free market</b>."

<li><b>Strong delete</b> In and of itself the term "economic fascism" is a non-encyclopedic neologism. Yes, the term gets 11,000 hits on Google; but that tells us nothing more than the fact that the term gets 11,000 hits on Google. A Google search is a terrible indicator of anything, especially encyclopedic standards. Just about any non-encyclopedic neologism will get literally thousands of Google hits. For example, compare the number of hits generated by "economic fascism" to the number of hits generated by "American fascism," another unencyclopedic ahistorical term used in polemics. "American fascism" gets 78,000 hits. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22american+fascism%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22american+fascism%22" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> (BTW, if a misguided user were ever to start an article on "<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_fascism.html" title="American fascism">American fascism</a>," I suspect that some of the "keep" voters here would join me in supporting an AfD on such an entry.) Nevertheless, the term "economic fascism" has a place in a certain context on Wikipedia; a self-standing entry, though, is defiantly not the proper context. Most references to the term online are inspired by a fairly well-known essay among libertarian circles (and even some academic circles that have done some interesting comparative work on the notion of a 'welfare-warfare state' and its relation to the political economies of the European fascist regimes-- though academics never use the term themselves) by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_DiLorenzo_2abd.html" title="Thomas DiLorenzo">Thomas DiLorenzo</a> entitled "Economic Fascism." <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo85.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo85.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> RJII's work would thus have a proper place in the Thomas J. DiLorenzo article under a section summarizing his essay "Economic Fascism." Since the term "economic fascism" is so strongly associated with DiLorenzo, the Wikipedia page "economic fascism" can even be redirected to the DiLorenzo article. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 00:48, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree for you in the most part and although I haven't voted here my reason for not voting delete is that in an encyclopedia where we have an article for <i><a href="../../../s/l/a/Slanted_and_Enchanted_60df.html" title="Slanted and Enchanted">Slanted and Enchanted</a></i> (non-notable album) why not have an article for economic fascism which seems to be more notable than many of our album pages. I suppose the issue with this is that it skews all of the work on economics to a POV rant when every little epithet gets an article. So, because of those views I can only be neutral. Your reasoning was pretty sound, but, when our notability standards are so low is there reason not to create this page? I really don't know the answer. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 01:12, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You have a point in that there have been occasions with little political epithets creeping into Wikipedia and getting their own article. But I consider that trend on Wikipedia quite unfortunate and worrisome overall. If we can't spot all the problems, the best we can do is not allow the ones that do get listed on AfD to get by, and draw a line in the sand for encyclopedic standards whenever we get the chance. IMO this entry is somewhat more problematic than most epithets that get listed on AfD for a reason that is quite subtle. The term "Economic Fascism: is most notable as an essay by DiLorenzo. As an essay, "Economic Fascism" is a proper noun and thus capitalized and put in quotations. However, the article subject to the AfD at the moment is an article on "<a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_fascism.html" title="Economic fascism">economic fascism</a>" in the lowercase, which gives the impression that the term is not primarily notable as an essay (referred to in uppercases) but rather as an accepted historical term not in need of attribution. In this sense, giving the impression that a neologism is an established historical term is subtle, but can have a very powerful propaganda effect. IMO, AfD voters should be especially sensitive when it comes to spotting neologisms, as they may not be too noticeable at first glance, despite being as egregious a violation of NPOV as any. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 02:10, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Gren, it's not that it's a non-notable term, it's that it's not really a term at all. Economic fascism is more of a smear than a scholarly term with a defined and accepted meaning.

Nearly all sources that talk about economics under fascist governments talk about <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporatism.html" title="Corporatism">Corporatism</a>, which was the principal economic theory developed by Italian fascists and proto-fascists.

<li>DiLorenzo is not the only person that has talked about economic fascism. What are you talking about it's a "neologism"? It's not a neologism. What if the article was called "fascist economics"?; would that be a neologism? You'd probably say "no" unless DiLorenzo titled his article "fascist economics," in which case you would be claiming it was a neologism. There has to be some way to refer to the economics practiced in fascist nations. "Economic fascism" seems to be the most common way of referring to it. It's not a "neologism." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 02:56, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>DiLorenzo is the most notable. He is not the only one using the term in the sense that other libertarians have been influenced by his work and now use the term themselves. The term is a neologism in the sense that it is use of a new term based on historically established terms to describe the patters that DiLorenzo is attempting to sketch. There's nothing wrong with that. A neologism can be innovative while unencyclopedic at the same time. As for "fascist economics," the term "economics" refers to the study of the economy. For now there is no school of thought among economists describing itself as "fascist." For now the term "fascist economics" only seems to have meaning in the lexicon of the <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_LaRouche_df0c.html" title="Lyndon LaRouche">Lyndon LaRouche</a> cult, which published an article entitled "Arnie Rolls Out the Coming Fascist Economics in California." <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22fascist+economics%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22fascist+economics%22" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 03:18, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's still very strange what you're saying. As far back as the 1930's and 40's people were describing the economic system that was particular to fascist nations as being distinct from others systems. Whether you want to call an article "economic fascism," "fascist economics," "economic systems in fascist economies," it's all the same thing. "Economic fascism" is just the most common language used to refer to summation of the economic characteristics found in fascist nations. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:42, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If we clearly define our terms what I am saying will not be difficult to grasp. In the interwar era, "Fascism" referred to an ideological and political movement with often-changing and often-nebulous goals and tenants, particularly on economic policy. Today among historians, the argument that you just asserted-- that there was an economic system particular to fascist nations and distinct from other systems-- is subject to a considerable amount of debate. Circumscribing the topic of fascist economic thought is quite difficult because, depending on when at where you look, a different picture may emerge. Even more unclear to historians is the question concerning whether or not we can even speak of a 'fascist economic system,' a topic subject to a considerable amount of debate. DiLorenzo says 'yes' from a libertarian perspective, and popularized the term "economic fascism." The problem for Wikipedia is that turning his neologism "economic fascism" into an article implicitly means that Wikipedia is accepting his POV on a controversial debate, which, of course, goes against the Wikipedia principle of NPOV. BTW, there are many articles where you can work on the issues that interest you here. The libertarian perspective on "economic fascism" can be described in articles related to DiLorenzo. Details on the economies of Germany and Italy in the 1930 and 1940s can be found in the specialized entries dealing with the economic histories of those two countries. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 04:33, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Indeed he is not.

Given the NPOV policy, the place for a discussion of the question of "economic practices particular to fascist nations" cannot be under a title that endorses DiLorenzo's POV, which is far from being universally accepted, but rather in more general entry on fascism or economic history. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 07:34, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> No one questions that Fascism had (or has) a strong economic component, and that certainly ought to be addressed in the Fascism article. The article in question, however, makes "economic fascism" sound mor elike an epithet free-market purists sling at people they oppose. I don't think that warrants its own article. The article on the New Deal can discuss debates among Americans at the time as to whether Roosevelt was saving capitalism, or inventing his own form of communism or fascism, drawing on contemporary sources. Beyond that, the Fascism and Corporatism articles should provide full discussions of their economic dimensions. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 17:36, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're having the same confusion as a few others here. You're reading some external links and taking them as being part of the content of the article. The article does not mention the New Deal and does not even so much as speculate that the U.S. has experienced economic fascism.

<li>No. First, the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> article should have a <i>section</i> on "Fascist economics" (not "economic fascism). Second, if or when the article becomes too long, that section should be made into its own article, with a summary and link in the Fascism article. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 18:39, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you have a problem with it being called "economic fascism" but not "fascist economics"? That's ludicrous! What the hell difference make what it's called? "Economic fascism" is just common terminology to refer to it. Someone above said "the term "fascist economics" only seems to have meaning in the lexicon of the <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_LaRouche_df0c.html" title="Lyndon LaRouche">Lyndon LaRouche</a> cult." So, he's probably going to complain about that terminology. Get over it people. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 18:50, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What "the hell difference [does it] make what it's called?" The difference has to do with what is the noun and what is the adjective. In English, meaning is produced largely through different parts of speech; the rules governing these parts of speech involve English sentence structure. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 19:10, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And the noun-adjective form behind "economic fascism" goes with the convention. There is <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_liberalism.html" title="Economic liberalism">economic liberalism</a>, <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_individualism.html" title="Economic individualism">economic individualism</a>, and <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_fascism.html" title="Economic fascism">economic fascism</a>. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:16, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, not with Wikipedia's conventions-- maybe with certain libertarian authors who propose such a taxonomy, but not Wikipedia's, given the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 06:20, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So if the term is used by laissez-faire types you want to censor it. Talk about POV! <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 07:18, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I am not advocating censorship but rather proper attribution of sources. In this sense we are respecting the rights of Thomas J. DiLorenzo's to his intellectual property (such as his essay "Economic Fascism"). The "laissez-faire types" like defending private property, right? Now, once the source of the ideas underlying the contents of the article on VfD is duly noted, the content does not have to be "censored" but rather moved to an entry related to DiLorenzo. There are places where his work can be summarized on Wikipedia. However, pretending that a neologism, which he popularized in his essays, is encyclopedic, somehow transcending the need to attribute his ideas, is not the proper way to go about detailing libertarian thought on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 08:01, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Intellectual property? No one owns the term "economic fascism." The term is is pretty widespread use. And, it's not a "neologism." DiLorenzo was using the term back in the early 90's. This is almost 2006, man. Economic fascism is the economic system that typically exists in fascist regimes. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 15:31, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>According to DiLorenzo, "economic fascism" was the system that you are describing in the article. He popularized the term, and indeed others in libertarian circles have been influenced by his work. Still, his work has not come anywhere close to reaching universal acceptance in academic literature on the economic history of the 1930s and 1940s. Actually, I'm not even aware that it has had any influence at all outside libertarian circles. Others find it much more difficult to speak of such a clear-cut relation. Thus, the term "fascist" in the strict NPOV sense refers to ideology/political affiliation and regime (under fascist rule). When using the term in a less restrictive sense, in this case using it to refer to an 'economic system,' there must be a reference to the research making the connection. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 01:53, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What are you talking about? DiLorenzo might have "popularized the term" but he didn't invent economic fascism and didn't invent the so-called "term." Get it through your head, man --the article is not about DiLorenzo or nor has anything to do with his personal philosophy. It has to do with the economic system present in fascist nations. Whether DiLorenzo popularized the term "economic fascism" to label this system is not materially important, as the term is a pretty common term today. Hence, it's the proper term to title on article on the economic system present in fascist nations. If this article is deleted, I'll create another article with same information but with a different title (unfortunately, and ironically, with a less notable title). The title is not as important as the content. You have a problem with the title of the article because DiLorenzo, who you apparently have a beef with, uses that term. Your complaints are absolutely insane! <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:28, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete and Redirect to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporatism.html" title="Corporatism">Corporatism</a></b>. If you examine the References listed, and do a Google Scholar search on "economic fascism", nearly every source that comes up is explicitly talking about the corporatist form of organization. This economic theory was expounded by the Italian Fascists as an economic third way between capitalism and socialism, was implemented in Italy, and implemented in part (in parallel to a more general war economy) in Germany. "Economic fascism" itself is not a distinct term or concept, and is not used by reputable scholars to specifically denote a unique form of economic organization. Redirecting it into the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> article is not as accurate as redirecting it to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporatism.html" title="Corporatism">Corporatism</a>, since corporatism was the economic theory implemented by European fascist states. —thames 14:37, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
