<dd>AfD is not a vote. You need to give a reason why it should be kept. Bad quality is a reason. That section you linked to gives reasons why an article <i>should</i> be deleted and then gives alternative possibilities that, <i>if siuccessful</i> will keep the article from being deleted. Five months is plenty of time to see if cleanup would have saved this article. <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 00:16, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Change my vote to <b>Neutral</b>. While I don't think the reasons behind this AfD are valid, or that rallying others who are known critics of this article is a fair practise, I understand <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a>'s arguments, and it does seem that this article contains badly written versions of parts of other articles, in particular <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence_for_evolution.html" title="Evidence for evolution">Evidence for evolution</a>.

Salvageable content could easily be moved to <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence_for_evolution.html" title="Evidence for evolution">evidence for evolution</a> and other articles, if this one is deleted. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris"><b>Iron</b></a><a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_Esperanza_81b2.html" title="User:IronChris/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>C</b></font></a><a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris"><b>hris</b></a> | <a href="../../../i/r/o/User_talk%7EIronChris_59e6.html" title="User talk:IronChris">(talk)</a> 04:46, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My intention wasn't to rally them. I didn't tell tem to vote against it or in any way push them to it.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hmm, so the article needs cleanup. It's a shame we don't have a tag for that and have to completely delete entries as soon as they drop below a certain standard. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 00:29, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In less sarcastic terms, this article needs to be flagged for attention, not wiped from the face of the Wikipedia. VfD should be the last port of call for an article that's got problems, not the first. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 00:31, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As I pointed out in other responses, it had been flagged for attention for five months. It had not gotten attention in thse five months, which is sufficient time to illustrate it's nonimportance. It has been in other ports of calls. <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 01:33, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, how far did it get? If it's been sitting there with just a Cleanup or Attention tag on it for five months, it could be argued that editors simply didn't know about it (of course it would also mean that the article is seldom-visited and perhaps shouldn't be around in the first place). It needs a definite plan of action set out, and nobody's sitting down and doing so. Is there a "Wikiproject evolution" or somesuch it could go under where it would get more attention? We could try putting up requests for attention in Talk pages of the articles which link to it. I'm not convinced that deletion is the right course of action in such a situation. Of course, if the alternative's complete inaction, well, I could be persuated. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 01:41, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That it has been tagged for five months does not mean much. By the way, have <i>you</i> tried to clean it up? Before going to AfD on grounds of "impossible cleanup", you probably should have asked for help in cleaning it up by posting a note on the talk page of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwinism.html" title="Darwinism">Darwinism</a>, <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> and the other articles that link back to this one. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 01:55, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Where do you get the idea that other pages talk pages are the place for discussing cleaning up this one. There was much talk that recongnized the need for cleaning up this article on the talk page and little progress was made on a course of action to do something about it. Since it failed, what makes you think that I or anyone else would have success? <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 03:32, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Numerous" has many interpretations. The number of hits for evolution is 298,000,000. 4800 is a drop in the bucket in comparison.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I would have thought an "argument from evolution" would take as one of its premises that evolution was true and then derive conclusions <i>from</i> that. But, instead, this article consists of arguments <i>for</i> evolution. As such, it would appear to duplicate various other Wikipedia articles. (<a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence_of_evolution.html" title="Evidence of evolution">Evidence of evolution</a> and sections of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html#Controversy" title="Intelligent design">Intelligent design</a> come to mind.) --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 03:45, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Disingenuous, OR title/"subject": this is not an "argument from evolution" (the format of which implies some specific, well-established logical argument, not a disorganized assortment of various endorsements of evolution), it's a series of criticisms of ID and defenses of evolution (which might make fine pages in their own right, but this isn't it). Poor quality is not a reason to delete an article on a valid topic, but this article lacks a valid topic: "argument from evolution" is an unverified, non-noteworthy term in its own right, even if <i>related issues</i> would be noteworthy if reformated. Even if this article isn't deleted, all of its contents very clearly need to be moved elsewhere. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 04:34, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If we first accept that you truly believe that the article needs cleanup and not deletion, why over the past 5 months haven't you made attempts towards that?

<dd>To Hackwrench's points- first) I haven't gotten around to cleaning it up, but will do so now that it is on AfD. As to the second, do a google search for the phrase, one gets as some of the top hits <a href="http://www.strongatheism.net/library/atheology/argument_from_evolution/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.strongatheism.net/library/atheology/argument_from_evolution/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/atheism/evolution.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/atheism/evolution.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 07:36, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Except that those seem to be the only top hits that are not clones of the Wikipedia article or spam. It seems that the only reason it is anywhere near the top is because the wikipedia article and clones link to it and several widely linked wikipedia articles link to this article in their "see also". Also, as I noted above, the phrase "argument from evolution" isn't widely used. While Google reports about 4800 pages, you only go to 208 before Google sais that the rest are hidden due to being too similar to the ones already displayed.<a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 07:49, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The argument is not about 'evolution' at all, which simply means change - from the Latin verb 'evolare' meaning to change. Even the stupidest of fundamentalists admits that things have changed: society for example and even that change is necessary to 'bring God's plans to fruition.' As far as the natural wortld goes; the question is: by what process has that chagned occurred? One theory is the theory of natural selection as put forward by Darwin and Wallace. This is people usually mean by <i>the theory of evolution</i>. It is not the theory of evolution, but <i>a</i> theory of evolution. There is no reasonable argument against the evidence for change as evidenced by the fossil record. The question is how that change occurred. An enlightened theist might neatly solve the debate by saying that of course God created a wonderful world in which animals could evolve by natural selection. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 150.101.122.132 (<a href="../../../1/5/0/User_talk%7E150.101.122.132.html" title="User talk:150.101.122.132">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_150.101.122.132_22f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/150.101.122.132">contribs</a>).</small></li>
