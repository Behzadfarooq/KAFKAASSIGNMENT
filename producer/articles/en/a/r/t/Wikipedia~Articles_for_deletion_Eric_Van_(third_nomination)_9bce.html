<p>AFD tag placed on article by 66.134.219.52 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.134.219.52_88b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.134.219.52">contribs</a>), who may also be Worm082 (<a href="../../../w/o/r/User_talk%7EWorm082_b628.html" title="User talk:Worm082">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Worm082_46cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Worm082">contribs</a>). This is a technical nomination regarding which I have firm no opinion at this time. Paraphrasing the comments on <a href="../../../e/r/i/Talk%7EEric_Van_e697.html" title="Talk:Eric Van">Talk:Eric Van</a>, the anon user had concerns that the subject did not <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s standards for inclusion. At previous AFDs the article was stubbed and speedily kept at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Eric_Van_5c0e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Eric Van">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Eric Van</a> and kept at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Eric_Van_%282nd_nomination%29_0f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Eric Van (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Eric Van (2nd nomination)</a> because the subject is, like the song says, big in <s>Japan</s> Boston. Nice, but I'm not sure that a heartwarming human interest piece in the deepest, darkest corners of the Boston Globe is multiple, even if it is arguably non-trivial. Whatever the article has going for it, it scores well as hagiography. Some might not see that as plus point. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 21:31, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Afterthought</b>: Nothing has been said to suggest the subject meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and other issues have been raised, so my view would now be <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 21:25, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Not notable, does not meet WP:BIO. "Whatever the article has going for it, it scores well as hagiography. Some might not see that as plus point." - This is because the article was written by the subject of the article (see previous edits by user emvan). Whether he's notable is questionable, whether a biography written by the subject can have a NPOV is not.

I am a member of <a href="../../../s/a/b/SABR_0c75.html" title="SABR">SABR</a> and had never heard of this guy until I followed a link from <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sons_of_Sam_Horn_bd9c.html" title="Sons of Sam Horn">Sons of Sam Horn</a> (the Wiki article, not the site). His work intrigues me from a fan's standpoint, and he certainly seems notable in the Boston area, but is he a notable baseball authority outside of those circles? No. He's not notable in his other interests, either, and it makes the page read like a vanity. And if anyone's ready to point out <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/06/23/his_numbers_are_in_the_ballpark/" class="external text" title="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/06/23/his_numbers_are_in_the_ballpark/" rel="nofollow">this</a> as an assertion of notability, well, many local people are profiled in newspapers every day. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 02:35, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, notable statistician, very notable in science fiction fandom. I'm also quite befuddled by Ivana's comments. Van didn't create the article, he's removed large chunks of non-essential information and his edits are non-controversial and constructive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Van&amp;diff=41438350&amp;oldid=39762820" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Van&amp;diff=41438350&amp;oldid=39762820" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Nobody is disputing factual acccuracy here, so citing a POV concern (especially when Van isn't the primary author) seems like a strawman. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStilgar135_370a.html" title="User:Stilgar135">Stilgar135</a> 14:14, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Afterthought</b> Van is absolutely the primary author. See his edits from late February 2006 when he changed the page from a spoof to his own bio: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Van&amp;diff=41438350&amp;oldid=39762820" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Van&amp;diff=41438350&amp;oldid=39762820" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Van&amp;diff=41438350&amp;oldid=39762820</a>. He later edited it to add more of the current content. It now reads like an abbreviated resume. Moreover, POV has little to do with factual accuracy; articles in The Nation or Newsmax may be factually accurate, but no one pretends they have a NPOV.

<dd>'<b>Response'</b> Awesome, we're both using the same edit to try and prove different points. It looked to me like Van was removing a whole bunch of chaff and leaving in the important information. And I think you're missing my point about POV. The issue here is whether Van is notable. Your musing on whether or not someone can write an article about themselves without a POV is not germane to the debate. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStilgar135_370a.html" title="User:Stilgar135">Stilgar135</a> 23:14, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The edits Van made violate the guidelines of <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAutobiography_1f61.html" title="WP:Autobiography">WP:Autobiography</a>. His claim to inventing "combined triple average" cannot be independently verified. "Van has privately confided that he wasn't blowing smoke here and is in fact working on a major innovative advance in sabermetrics," he writes. This is obviously unverifiable and is original research. Keep in mind that he doesn't meet any of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standards in the first place, and the case for deletion grows. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 20:16, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> as notable, and note that this survived an AFD on July 17th, not even two months ago. It's a shame that articles can keep being renominated when the desired outcome is not obtained. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 21:13, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The article is being renominated because Van clearly does not meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, something which was never mentioned in the first two AfDs. In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Eric_Van_%282nd_nomination%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Eric_Van_%282nd_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">AfD two months ago</a>, the focal points of the argument were that <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/06/23/his_numbers_are_in_the_ballpark/" class="external text" title="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/06/23/his_numbers_are_in_the_ballpark/" rel="nofollow">one article</a> had been written about Van and that he was known in the Boston area. (For what it's worth, the article was in the arts section, not even the sports section.) The difference this time through the AfD process is that we are discussing actual policies and guidelines, not just vague concepts of notability. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 21:30, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
