The result of the debate was ambiguous (probably because of the way the former vote was transcluded in). SimonP apparently decided to keep for now.

<dd>Though, actually, I see this is a sneaky (note the uppercase <i>Postmodernity</i>) re-listing, since the article (barely) survived VfD less than two weeks ago. I have transcluded the previous VfD below; perhaps we should just extend it since the majority of delete votes was <i>nearly</i> a consensus. <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif"></a><tt><b>~</b><a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif">leif</a></tt> ☺ <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeif_77cb.html" title="User talk:Leif"><sub>HELO</sub></a> 20:52, Jan 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> original essay.

<li>I believe that we are being unfairly targeted for no real reason. This page gives out information and he is a large, well known mascot in videogaming today, yet you guys seem to think that he doesn't deserve his own page, yet characters like Toadette who nobody cares about aren't being targetted at all. And with how many edits, who cares? That's like saying JK Rowling isn't a good author seeing she's only written 6 HP Books and RL Stien is because he's written hundreds. And you instantly claim that every person voting keep is a sock puppet as to make sure this page gets deleted, which is unfair and is abusing the voting system. If you so badly want him out, why not go ahead and delete the page than then go through a voting process which we know has been rigged to ensure that he gets the boot?</li>

<p>I am a mathematician, with some knowledge about spectra of differential operators, which this article is about. As many people guessed, this article just gives a badly explained description of the spectrum of the Laplace operator with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. There is not much value in this article, and there will not be more if it is properly wikified and integrated with other articles. To make this article at least somewhat meaningful, one would need to talk about the physical interpretation of the laplacian, (e.g., the fact that the eigenvalues are the frequences of a drum in the shape of the set \Omega), the uses of the defintion in here, and other things. Also, one would need to put at least some justification or references for the many claims stated in here.</p>
<p>In short, this article the way it is is a worthless definition full of math lingo, and it would take lots of work to put it in good shape, which I doubt is worth it.

<li><b>Abstain</b>. Google finds few pages that hint <i>takfir</i> is indeed a concept in Muslim jurisprudence. On the other hand, article reads like a nonsense and is not usable to someone who doesn't know the concept already. <a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJni_807c.html" title="User:Jni">jni</a> 06:52, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It would seem that Takfir is a verb denoting "to declare someone a <a href="../../../k/a/f/Kafir.html" title="Kafir">kafir</a>(non-believer). So, while this brief synopsis might be POV (by suggesting this is done without evidence to support it), it nonetheless could be a worthwhile concept to be further developed by future generations of Wikipedians --Rexrexilius 10:54, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but it still needs to be almost rewritten to conform to NPOV standards; it is still largely biased and in some parts about Australian humour, not NZ humour. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonumbers_9199.html" title="User:Neonumbers">Neonumbers</a> 01:55, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but it does need some work. There is too much opinion and self-congratulation in it at the moment (some might suggest the latter is also a NZ trait, but I don't want to prod any hornet's nests). In all fairness, something should be said about the succession of failed attempts at sitcoms over the years. Billy T and McPhail and Gadsby went on far beyond their shelf life, and they were two of the more successful shows. There really were some dire efforts made by others, eg the Lloyd Scott vehicle 'Between the Lines' (wonder if anyone remembers anything about it). A mention of the Topp Twins should also be made, if it hasn't already</li>

<p>A quarter of all undergraduates at Canterbury join ENSOC voluntarily each year. For many it is a deciding factor in attending the University. It is a very memorable part of many peoples lives. It was established in 1897, incorporated in 1968 and has a turn over of NZ$0.25MPA. The biggest tradition mentioned on the University wiki entry is an ENSOC event - the "Undie 500". Please do not delete this reference to this learned society with an extremely proud history. www.ensoc.com</p>

In Encyclopedia Britannica he obviously would not rate, in an encyclopedia about Mac gaming he would. Wikipedia is lots of different encyclopedias all rolled into one.

<li>Whoa... it's odd randomly running across a series of delete votes that I strongly disagree with. Ambrosia Software is hugely significant within the Macintosh software community, and quite well known. Andrew Welch, as the lead spokesman has shown up all over the place in magazine articles and so forth. I vote <b>Keep</b> with the hope to expand it, and at the very least if you take the article away it should be a redirect and not a total delete.

<li><b>Comment</b> (Note I edited the above two comments to make them conform to the page) gaming, saying it's an "outrage" is going a bit overboard, especially on a free Internet encyclopaedia.

Also anyone looking for an article on "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch" would probably look under that title rather than "Grinch Song" so it was a bad article title, to boot. I disagree about the song itself not being culturally significant. Anyone who lives in North America who grew up on it would beg to differ!

<p>Can we please hold off deleting this until some consensus is reached at the talk page of the Abraham Lincoln page? The main Lincoln page is quite long and concerted efforts have been made for months to break it up. See, eg., <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln%27s_Sexuality_9bd2.html" title="Abraham Lincoln's Sexuality">Abraham Lincoln's Sexuality</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_on_slavery_5ca5.html" title="Abraham Lincoln on slavery">Abraham Lincoln on slavery</a>, etc. NP And it is part of an effort at breaking the article into subsections, Carnildo. I really resent this page being listed for deletion and urge a KEEP vote. NP</p>
<dl>
<dd>I listed it because, at the time I came across it, it had an odd-looking title, it had been created by an anonymous user, it was a straight copy-and-paste, and it wasn't linked to by the <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> page, giving an overall look of being a newbie test. I listed it here rather than on "speedy deletion" just in case I was wrong.

<p>Come on guys what is the problem? Why are sites like eBay and Amazon listed?? THEY are websites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, but those are <i>famous</i> websites whose influence on society has been significant. For example, those are websites that are frequently mentioned in the national and international media. However we can't just go around listing every non-notable message board, fan page and blog out there, because that is not the purpose of an encyclopedia. For every article we must ask ourselves "Is this a generally well-known topic in its field?" If the field is the Internet as in this case, then for the vast majority of individual websites the answer is no. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 22:58, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Why cant we just let this go. If you go to the site you will see it is very active and full of information, very useful. I think it should stay.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there's anything people agree on about Wikipedia policy, it's that it should be applied consistently. We delete articles on websites as non-notable as this on a daily basis, and the consensus has come to be that a website should show some signs of being especially prominent in the Internet community before it is deserving of an encyclopedia article. There are millions of "active" and "useful" webpages out there, and we've decided it's best to leave it up to other projects on the web to document them all. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 23:33, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
