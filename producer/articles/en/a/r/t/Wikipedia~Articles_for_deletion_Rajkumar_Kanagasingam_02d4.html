<li><b>Strong Delete</b> For very simple reason, He is absolutely <b>not notable</b> and <b>unheard in My country</b>.Most of the sources are in fact written by himself and contain false information, such as calling himself a columnist when he has only 4 article for a certain newspaper!!!. Does anyone know how many Sri Lankans write articles or columns to local news papers&#160;?? I guess it could be thousands, and do we need articles for every single person who write something to news papers&#160;? And there are several hundreds of NGO in Sri Lanka and anyone, even I ,can start a new one..So I am not sure how that would make someone notable. And for the google hits, both rajkumar and Kanagasingam are extremely popular names among Tamils and I am rather surprised that there were ONLY 4000+ hits. Please do tell us how many of those hits are actually belong to the author himself..finally, this person has nothing to do with India hence this debate should not be included in the india-related deletions..Thanks<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki"><font color="blue"><b>Iwazaki</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/w/a/User_talk%7EIwazaki_7b86.html" title="User talk:Iwazaki"><font color="red">会話。討論</font></a></sup> 06:58, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Whether the references are non-trivial or not is an editorial decision, but in my opinion (and that of the majority of editors commenting in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rajkumar_Kanagasingam_Archive_b4e1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rajkumar Kanagasingam/Archive">first AfD</a>) it is clear that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam30.JPG" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam30.JPG" rel="nofollow">this article</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam13.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam13.jpg" rel="nofollow">this article</a> both have the subject as the main focus of the article and are non-trivial. This is enough to satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Remember, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:N">notability is not subjective</a>. The article still needs much work, and Mr. Kanagasingam's behaviour has not helped things, but the article should not be deleted on the basis of non-notability. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcscott_e3f9.html" title="User:Ccscott">Ccscott</a> 14:54, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He is not notable because he has won a peace medal. He is notable because there are multiple, independent media reports on the subject in reliable sources (see here) and therefore this article satisfies the primary notability criterion of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Aside from the argument of <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> who believes that the many newspaper articles discussing the subject are not non-trivial (I disagree), there have been no policy-based reasons put forth to delete this article by any of the editors commenting. All the pro-deletion agruments I see are based on "I haven't heard of him" or "I don't like him", cite the apparent COI issues that surround this article or are just the lazy "per nom" (please see: <a href="../../../a/r/g/Wikipedia%7EArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_1a86.html" title="Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions">Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions</a>).

<dd>Ccscott says: <i>He is notable because there are multiple, independent media reports on the subject in reliable sources (see here).</i> Pardon me for repeating myself, but: I went there and saw a small number of short, competent but unremarkable newspaper articles <i>by</i> him. I don't see him discussed in multiple, non-trivial and independent published references. Which are they? I still haven't seen an answer to that. Ccscott says: <i>All the pro-deletion agruments I see are based on "I haven't heard of him" or "I don't like him", cite the apparent COI issues that surround this article or are just the lazy "per nom".</i> Yes, I cited the apparent COI issues. But that wasn't all I wrote. True, I hadn't heard of him, but I'm very willing to concede that I haven't heard of most noteworthy people. (Example: I haven't heard of a single skateboarder, but I'm reliably informed that <a href="../../../s/k/a/Category%7ESkateboarders_be12.html" title="Category:Skateboarders">they</a> can be noteworthy for skateboarding alone, let alone for their other achievements.) And I don't know why I should have to make such a banal declaration, but I neither like nor dislike Rajkumar Kanagasingam. Reason, I think, for deletion (from the very page Ccscott cites): <i>Subject fails to meet the relevant notability guideline (WP:BIO, WP:MUSIC, WP:CORP and so forth),</i> of which the important member is <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. But perhaps I'm wrong and he does meet WP:BIO. If so, how? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:55, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I apologize for not addressing this directly but I have provided the link several time to the off-line articles, written independent of him, that discuss the subject directly. Again, the list can be found on the talk page for this article. Specifically: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam11.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam11.jpg" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam30.JPG" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam30.JPG" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam13.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam13.jpg" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> are published newspaper articles completely independent of the subject which are primarily focused on the subject (and are therefore non-trivial). There are also numerous more marginal published articles (a few are: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam29.JPG" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam29.JPG" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Businessaward.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Businessaward.jpg" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam9.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam9.jpg" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam3.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam3.jpg" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam6.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam6.jpg" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> and more here ) which discuss the subject in a more trivial fashion. This amount of news coverage is sufficient to pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> easily in my opinion and that of the editors participating in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rajkumar_Kanagasingam_Archive_b4e1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rajkumar Kanagasingam/Archive">first AfD</a>. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcscott_e3f9.html" title="User:Ccscott">Ccscott</a> 12:04, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Neither the peace medal nor handing out an <i>unknown</i> report make this person notable..I don't see anything but pure propaganda in those pictures..In case you don't know, It is not a big deal to have your photo on a newspaper..Some people when they get married put an add on the papers, some when they passed an exam do the same, some others prefer to notify the whole Sri Lanka when they win a medal or competition(in most cases just to boast) by having their picture on the papers..So, just because one has some photos on a newspaper he/she won't automatically become notable , kinda common sense. And, no one here saying things like <i>i don't like him</i> and bla bla..People have come up with very good points and I would kindly ask you to read them instead of dragging this into a different direction.Oh,,You can always shed some light on this by showing us anything written of him in media BY others..So far i have failed to see a single article or anything reported in local media <b>OF him</b>, quite strange for such a notable person, isn't it? <a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki"><font color="blue"><b>Iwazaki</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/w/a/User_talk%7EIwazaki_7b86.html" title="User talk:Iwazaki"><font color="red">会話。討論</font></a></sup> 01:52, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rajkumar, The number of votes that you stacked doesn't matter here. If it's 1 or 1000, still you have violated the policy. You directly or indirectly violated number of policies.

Could you please bring us one or two articles written of him(by others) in the main stream news papers&#160;?

<li><b>Weak delete</b> COI issues aside (I personally don't feel COI should lead to deletion unless the article is in such a poor form it's best to start over), it's not clear if this article establishes notability.

Nothing else clearly established notability to me. Also there appears to be bad behaviour own both side. It is <b>inappropriate</b> to spam people about an AFD, especially if it's an article about you &amp; those people are ones who have previously supported you. However it does appear the nominator is involved in a dispute with the editor with some controversy. Editors involve in disputes <b>should not</b> nominate articles for deletion about the person they're involved in the dispute with. Even if the editor genuinely feel it should be delete, this raises COI issues and just looks bad. Rather, you should bring the matter to the attention of other people, e.g. via the village pump or perhaps COI notice board and mention you are involved in an unrelated dispute and don't want to cloud the issue by nominating it. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 14:34, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
