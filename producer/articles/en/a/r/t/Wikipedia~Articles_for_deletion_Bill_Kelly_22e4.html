<li><b>Delete</b> I listened to Dr. Kelly speak yesterday here in Shanghai on the Ren Min Bi exchange rate. His comments on the exchange rate between Marsmarks and Euros and Ren Min Bi's were too speculative though for a real scientist. Anyone with even a bachelor's degree in astrology would know more about interstellar economics than this Kelly guy. His credit repair book is very good though. It's been translated in Chinese and (illegal but cheap) copies can be purchased from any newspaper vendor if you ask for it. <small>(unsigned vote by Shanghaiman)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I was at the speech together with Shanghaiman (whose real name is Richard Haworth) where Dr. Kelly shared also with us his fear of deletion. But Shanghai man is a Leninist extremist, curiously in synch with the ZOG fascists on this site. Why should anyone who offers a new and different opinion be deleted immediately? No matter how famous? According to the ambassador from Zimbabwe (oh, he doesn't exist either?) who introduced Dr. Kelly, he has been twice nominated for the Nobel Prize in Credit Repair. Is his earnest and courageous defense of the working man the reason? Is the democratic party in America -etacar and her sock puppets Haworth/sundry unsigned commentors- so threatened by looming exposure as nothing more than just another tool of the MAN? HayworthEtacarScimitar brings up a good point though. Support for Dr. Kelly is global because Dr. Kelly is global and the working man is global and space is global. In contrast, the deleter (save for ingratiating Shanghai man hoping to get an American visa to study astronomology at Baker) has all his IPs in just one corner of one measly 5% of the world population. Go ahead, I challenge you, delete the good Dr. But you can't delete his dream. The work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die. <small>(unsigned comment by 218.1.141.14, user's only edit)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It is not a hoax and I find that notion offensive. Granted the man is obscure but he's an authority in his field! Just because he's not among the conventional list of experts hints that he's above the fold! I'm not looking up the same guy that Joe Schmo looks up. Besides, I have met the man.

<p>It is a hoax. Why else would it be on geocities. There is no such thing as a doctor of astrology and Bill Kelly is a common name; the guy who wrote that book and the bogus wmsp arent the same person. Delete this page now. (unsigned comment by 68.61.138.166)</p>

<li>Someone who claimed to have a PhD in astrology would be reviled by the space community. Unless you are talking about UFO people, which is something else entirely.

<dd>Want to see my diplomas? Ha! Yes, astrology IS different from astronomy, in that astronomy is a legitimate science, while astrology is considered to be a pseudoscience that has no basis in reality. I know of no legitimate educational institution in the world that offers a degree in astrology. Of course, why am I even replying to sockpuppets?

<li>Pseudoscience Mrs(?) Haworth/Etacar/Scimitar? Look at your own business you set up with ESA (European Space Agency) money (for proof for honest readers check etacar haworth's website haworthpressinc.com) and its 200 plus (?!) 'scientific' journals (all NOTABLE right?). For your convenience, here's a little sampling from the front page of your website for those trying to decide how serious they should take this well-funded lone posse (with creative differentiated names like etacar and scimitar) attacker of the esteemed Dr. William E. Kelly from Flint (you have his picture you can find his address, go look him up, read his publications in the Flint Times). Anyway, I am arguing with a paid killer posse. More important is for undecided people to understand who exactly is attacking the next/today's Einstein who is trying only to defend the working man (crucify the jew).

<li><b>Keep</b> Dr. William E. Kelly Jr. is a well known author and scholar. We mustn't censor his work. It is clear he exists. Just like how the entity has kept the reform party and constitution party out of the presidential debates, the powers that be are attempting to silence Dr. Kelly and the working man's space party. The first amendment guarentees us free speech. Please allow Dr. Kelly that right and allow him to stay on this dictionary.

<li><b>Keep</b> The self-proclaimed asttrology expert Etacar is in fact a well known Democratic Party activist on the pay roll of Shell Oil Corporation and the European Space Agency who seeks to defame the honorable Dr. William E. Kelly Jr. How does he know there is no degree is astology? Did he check every University on Earth (and beyond)? In Lithuania Dr. Kelly is known Dr. Villiam Edvard Kellios and has lectured here in Vilnius at the Department of Astrology at our University. All the corporations in the world can not stop Dr. Kelly from achieving his historic mission for the working man. ( unsigned comment by 81.16.227.227 [Vilnius])

<li><b>Keep</b> I am a bit torn on this issue but after the arguements I think I must vote to keep. We may disagree with his paleo leftist, neo fascist views but that doesnät mean he doesn't exist. As a Christian I personally disagree with Dr. Kelly's views on the existance of space and dinosaurs but just because I personally disagree with him doesn't mean he should be deleted. Another point I don't understand is why it matters if people vote from Lithuania or America. We Swedes view Lithuanians as a race of gypsies and Americans as fat slaves of israel yet we still can not deny their votes. Dr. Kelly is wrong but people must know about him. In the mean time I will pray that he realizes that space is an invention of satanists. (unsigned comment by 62.65.118.114 2005 June 28, 08:00 [Sweden])
<ul>
<li>But the voters to keep have advanced absolutely no proof of existence apart from one page in Russian. Lituania/America - I was hoping to find that all the votes to keep were from the same place. But I still think it is an hoax.

<ul>
<li>It is hard for the voters to give proof because many of these voters have met Dr. Kelly as he travels and lectures. I guess they could post pictures of him giving speeches, but I doubt that would sway you either. I guess since Dr. Kelly isn't covered in the mainstream, Jewish owned news media you don't consider him to be real. This is hogwash. Dr. Kelly is real and your attempts to delete him are hurting people. You see, Dr. Kelly is a hero to many people, especially small children. He may be an almost mythical character, like the Queen of England, but that doesn't mean that the children do not have a right to know of him. Think of the children. -Mistress Miller (unsigned vote/comment by 24.56.237.85)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Bill Kelly is most certainly a working man, a proponent of space travel, and a partier. What other arguments are needed? One may disagree with him, as I most certainly do, but the extreme anger displayed against the Space Party on this page only further demonstrates the controversial nature of the Space Party and the brewing anti-semitism against Dr. Kelly, his Space Party, and judaism. We shouldn't discriminate against others, and not suppress Dr. Kelly and the Space Party, no matter how much we disagree with it. Tolerance is a virtue.

<li><b>Keep</b> He's a fringe lunatic but he does exist. I am from Newark but used to live in the Flint area where he was well known for his almost daily protests in front of the City Hall.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am a graduate instructor at Michigan State University and I've had to deal with Bill Kelly and his followers trying to push their ridiculous propoganada on my students. I think his talk about space travel impacting economics is crazy, but he is real.

<li><b>Keep</b> Over the past three years I have gotten a chance to know Dr Kelly very well. I first met Dr. Kelly on a trip to Washington DC. as we attended a political conference in DC, we unfortunatly tuned into the news of the Columbia disaster. While this tragedy pushed many people away from space exploration, this made Dr Kelly work even harder to achieve his goal. As a graduate of a Big Ten university, and a student starting grad school in the fall, I realize that Dr. Kelly is a valueable resource to the Flint community, and an asset to any life he touches.

<li>Ectar, how can you say this man isn't notable? You have people posting from a dozen countries and several US states that have heard him speak and care about what he has to say. Is it up to you to say who is notable, or is it up to those who find him notable? Think about the children here, the little children care. - Mistress Miller</li>

Yes they would; as long as their sock puppett posse "oh please, nobody's paying me" attack dog Rhaworth/ecatar/scimitar is on the loose, no original thinker and no lone defender of gravity and time and space is safe. Question for Haworth: Are you related to obsequious deleter boy Richard in Shanghai?</li>

<li><b>Remove</b> Dr. Kelly is a pawn of jewish interests seeking to destroy the blood of the aryan peoples. IT IS TIME FOR A RACE WAR, STAND UP WHITE MAN AND PURGE THE JEWISH-COMMUNIST LIES FROM WIKIPEDIA. The admins agree, everyone agrees and is only afraid to say it. they are sick of kelly's bolshevik views polluting the white freedom-space that is wikipedia. when you look around you see the white page, it is obvious white men built wikipedia please keep it pure. The jew is a leech and will abuse wikipedia, spreading his lies. he latches on like a parasite, squeezing false fame for his degenerate lifestyle (READ: KELLY IS A PORNO-HOLIC ALCOHOLIC, RAT (READ: JEW) LOVING FREAK) - **Driving down the street in my Panzer tank!
