<p><b>KEEP</b> Fred Negro is an Aussie legend, not only for his larrikin lyrics but for his sometimes disturbing, but always hilarious column in beat magazine. His own inimitable style is the embodiment of dirty StKilda pub rock in the 80’s and 90’s. Don’t drop Fred. CS</p>
<p>I could easily be wrong, this is one of those maybe, maybe not ones. I'd say not notable, but locals may have a better perspective. The article makes a poor case for inclusion. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 12:26, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let me make a few quick comments, and hopefully others will concur. As the page has only just gone up it should be given some time to grow before a call is made on the case for continuance. However, though the page stresses FN's 'local' profile in St Kilda, Melbourne, Australia, it should be understood that that Melbourne is arguable the centre of Australia's live music scene, and further that St Kilda is the pinnacle of the Melbourne scene. Significant in St Kilda means significant nationally. Further, his influence is not restricted to music, but extends to an influential comic strip. This is not a suburben muso. thanx (unsigned - comment from 08:19, 6 November 2005 Showard)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Authors contributions are this article on Fred Negro, adding Fred Negro to article on cartoonists and to article on St. Kilda. All tie to promoting subject. Google hits (though few) on subject validate article, but don't validate notability. Local is local. Validation of his impact on the Australian music scene would be helpful/additional comments from Australians. <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> 15:33, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That was exactly my view.

<li><s><b>Weak keep</b> It looks very borderline but</s> he seems <s>just about</s> noteworthy enough and quite interesting. I agree with ERcheck and Just zis Guy, you know? that some perspectives from the locals about just how significant Fred Negro is would help. <b>Strong Keep</b> based on comments below.

<li><b>Keep</b>. He is mainly an indie music type of guy and has not made much impact on the mainstream charts.

<li>Keep - he's thoroughly well-known in Melbourne and has been notorious on the Australian indie rock scene since the early 1980s with several bands and albums. I'll have to see what I can do to flesh this one out. (Doesn't help that any reference works I would have on the subject are in Australia, but oh well.) - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 08:31, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think he's more famous for his cartoons than his music. Does a cartoon calendar-style ad for the Espy that appears in the Inpress music street press each month, doesn't he? I was actualyl flicking through a book called <i>Plastered: The Poster Art of Australian Popular Music</i>, and he has about 5 entries over 2 pages. <a href="../../../p/f/c/User%7EPfctdayelise_e220.html" title="User:Pfctdayelise">pfctdayelise</a> 13:14, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep!</b> I have lived in Melbourne, Australia for 17 months on and off over the last 3 years and spent quite a lot of time checking out the music scene in Melbourne. And YES, Fred Negro is a significant feature! A living legend in the Melbourne music scene - especially among those who still remembers the 80ties. Most facinating of all he still delivers an impressive live act. I was facinated by the first gig I saw (at the Espy, St. Kilda) and speechless after the second one (somewhere on Queen Street, CBD) - which featured a piece of Fred's famous stage act of performing naked (!) and banging his dick against the mic stand to the beat of the bass drumm (se photo below - its Fred on the right with the blue shirt).</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - notable musician with credible, provable history. Anyone who frequented the infamous Espy Hotel could write volumes. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> | <a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELonghair_0f2b.html" title="User talk:Longhair">Talk</a> 19:33, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - A WP entry would be valuable because Fred is one of those people whose work everyone (in Melbourne) has seen, but about whom most people know little. It would be good to see more biographical information in the entry; many Melbournians would be able to add some. The weekly "street press" magazines have a wide readership in Melbourne, and anyone who has read one in the last decade or more will have seen a comic or article by Fred. He has a distinctive style, very politically incorrect, impossible not to notice. The work is not to everyone's taste, but many would be curious about the author. David Nichols (who writes for Beat street press magazine amongst other things) said that when Beat polled their readers recently, they found that one of the main reasons people read the rival Inpress magazine was that Fred is in it. David thinks Fred was publishing underground comics as long ago as the 70s and appeared in a Penguin Down Underground book of comics around 1983. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregwadley_4f26.html" title="User:Gregwadley">Greg_Wadley</a> 22:01, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
