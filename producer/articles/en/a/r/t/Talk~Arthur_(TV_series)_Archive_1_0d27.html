<dd>Yes, all the characters on "Arthur" are animals. While the original books showed an occasional human, humans usually aren't seen in the television series (except the "Postcards From Buster" spinoff and maybe in Arthur's daydream about Martin Luther King and Einstein in the Christmas special)... <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Dean_d90f.html" title="User:Anthony Dean">Anthony Dean</a> 18:49, Apr 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What kind of animal is Arthur? What about his friends?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Brain is a bear. Binky Barnes is a burly bulldog. (Try saying that three times fast!) Muffy and Francine are both monkeys and Buster is a rabbit. Sue Ellen is a cat, Prunella is a rat, Fern is a dog and George is a moose. The Tibble Twins are bear cubs and, of course, the Read family appear at the front of the animal dictionary. They're aardvarks. RAMChYLD 05:04, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And Mr. Ratburn is of course, a rat. The Brain is a bear and so is Mr. Haney. Offhand, I believe Francine is also a monkey, although I could be wrong. Most of the time, the species types are not referred to on the show. It usually only happens with Buster. Agent0042 22:18 29 December 2005 (EST)</dd>

<dd>Also, I removed Prunella's last name from her entry - as far as I know it, it was never mentioned on the show. It's probably put there by a delusional troll.</dd>

<dd>There is a rabbit girl in the Arthur TV show. She does not have a official name however. Names from fanfic is not <i>canon</i>.

Then me and the group members will discuss it and if it's confirmed, we'll let it through.</dd>
</dl>
<p>you could still add her along with the boy that ges trex grr and others.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That rabbit boy has an official name. This one doesn't.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then what is the rabbit boy's name? I like to think it's Arnold Taylour. --Janet6, a Wiki user</dd>
<dd>That and one word --- *no.* Fanfic characters cannot be added. Wikipedia is not fanfiction.net, you can't just add whatever made up stuff you want. That goes for this "April," that goes for this "trex" whatever, or anything else like that. Why there is even this debate, I don't know. There is no April. There is a rabbit-girl. If you want to add something to the guide about the *unnamed* rabbit girl, you can. Otherwise, no.</dd>

<dd>The Love Ducks is based on Teletubbies for these reasons:</dd>

<p>1. This is the biggest one --- the voice that comes on that says "Hello, Love Ducks" and "Goodbye, Love Ducks" is highly resemblant of the voice on Teletubbies that says "Hello, Tinky Winky. Hello, Dipsy." etc. etc.</p>
<p>2. Another super-big one --- the individual love ducks are the same colors as the teletubbies.</p>
<p>3. The general look and appearance of the series is Teletubbies-ish.</p>
<p>Just because it doesn't say "Teletubbies" anywhere on the show itself *doesn't* mean they aren't Teletubbie based.</p>
<p>--Agent0042 16:36 29 December 2005 (EST)</p>
<p>This will still be disputed because they might say goodbye and same colors it still does not make sense to call love ducks a teletubbies based television show just my opinion!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>So what do you want the writers to do --- put a flashing screen up saying "IT'S A TELETUBBIES PARODY!" The references aren't always going to be obvious, but how many instances of proof do you need before you'll accept it? I would think the fact that the colors are the same and the entrance and exit lines are a dead give-away.</dd>

<dd>I don't think you got the point of that episode. <b>There is nothing wrong with watching so-called "baby shows"</b>. That was what the episode of the TV show was about. If you're going to continue insisting that Love Ducks is not a parody of the Teletubbies dispite all the evidence and facts presented to you and the fact that there's a majority agreeing on the topic, then you're being dense. - RAMChYLD 11:34 30 December 2005 (MYT)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have a simple explanation. It may or may not be a teletubbies parody. In the episode "The Secret Life of Dogs and Babies", they have an obvios parody to the teletubbies, complete with a face in the sun and everything.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fake info.</span></h2>
<p>RAMChYLD, that "fake info" you deleted about Molly and Arthur having a secret friendship, and you claiming that there was never such an episode. Actually, there was such an episode. It happened in "Arthur Makes Waves", from the 9th season. Of course, that bit of continuity probably won't be mentioned again in any proceeding episodes.</p>
<p>Also, Marina Detilo's last name was mentioned on the show too. In the 9th season episode "Three's a Crowd" (Prunella referred to Marina's mom as Mrs. Detilo).</p>
<p>Just wondering, have you seen any of the season 9 episodes yet? But it's still a pretty new season, so it's understandable if your TV station didn't air it yet. --Roabe 17:48, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, actually my TV station never even got past Season 5 (I get Arthur on both a local terrestrial channel called <a href="../../../n/t/v/NTV7_e8cf.html" title="NTV7">NTV7</a> and over <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney_Channel_faad.html" title="Disney Channel">Disney Channel</a> Asia. NTV7 pulled the show after Season 4 in 2002. Disney pulled the show halfway through Season 5 in 2003. Both had never resumed airing Arthur since). I've been working in collaboration with the Yahoo Arthur Group members(including Agent0042) using the ECDC(which the group considers a trusted source of Arthur episode information). Of course, since information on ECDC is pretty much incomplete when it comes to Season 9. Agent is checking out the info now. If it's confirmed, we'll put it back. - RAMChYLD 12:08 31 December 2005 MYT.</dd>

And, we just managed to scrape together enough funding to do 10 more Postcards from Buster episodes that will air next fall.

<p>Way back when, in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, I wrote a synopsis of the <b>Arthur</b> story "Arthur's Almost Live Not Real Music Festival" at the ECDC. One of the songs in there is "Leftovers Goulash," which is also available on the first album. This tune features several classical music pieces. I identified one of them succesfully as <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amadeus_Mozart_6ceb.html" title="Amadeus Mozart">Amadeus Mozart</a>'s "Allegro" and another as Liszt's "Hungarian Rhapsody #2." But can anyone help me to identify the remaining classical music in this piece?</p>
<p>These lyrics are obviosly Mozart's Eina Cliena Nacht Music:"Nothing rare and nothing soupy, nothing slippery and nothing gloopy. Nothing mashed and nothing steamed, and nothing runny with eyes and feet that smells and wiggles when you touch it, that's gross, AND NOTHING CREAMED!"</p>

<dd>Well, if the name of the dog is unknown, but it's a pet of Grandma Thora, I guess it can be put in as a pet, but giving it a name... that's misinformation imo, since the character wasn't assigned a name officially, and thus it's nameless in the Arthur canon. I think we should put it down as *Unknown stray dog* instead. As for Pepe and his brother, that could fit under the <i>Other animals or pets whose owner is unknown</i> catagory. In my opinion, as long as the character has a significance in the episode, even if it's a one-off character, it's okay. Just don't make up your own names for the character if it doesn't have an official name, or include characters or information from fan-fiction or unofficial sources. RAMChYLD 5:05 5th January 2006.

<p>Notes to contributors:</p>
<ul>
<li>This so-called "April Johnson" does not exist in the TV shows. There is a rabbit girl wearing striped shirt, but she is a backgrounder and has no name. She does not have any dialog either, and unless official sources confirm it, never will. There is no information about her officially being in Season 10, or it would've been stated in the offical Arthur newssites. Period.</li>
<li>The comic strip deal has fell through. Someone at the Arthur group has contacted the licensor about it, and they have confirmed that the idea has been scrapped. Don't keep insisting that the comic will be coming out, cause unless the licensor says so, it is considered scrapped.</li>
<li>I've noticed that someone keeps reducing the airdate of a particular season to only one month. PBS is inconsistant, and sometimes some PBS stations air programs earlier than others. Also, note that some program airs internationally before it reaches the US (Make Way For Noddy has been airing in Malaysia since 2003 but only made it over to the US in summer 2005, and Caillou has been on in Canada since 1998 but only started airing in the US in late 2000. Also, Malaysia got to see Season 5 of Franklin some 6 months prior to it airing in the US, and the Canadians got to see it even earlier.</li>
<li>Lastly, I noticed that somebody is changing the date on the first aired/last aired to the British (day-month-year) format. The original entry was in the American (month-day-year) format. Please respect the format used for the guide and do not change it just because it doesn't look right to you. RAMChYLD 15:00, 27 January 2006 (MYT)</li>
