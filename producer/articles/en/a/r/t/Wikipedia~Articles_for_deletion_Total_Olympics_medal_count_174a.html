<p>This page should be deleted because the information it contains is factually inaccurate; the combined totals of the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_Olympics_medal_count_09c2.html" title="Winter Olympics medal count">Winter Olympics</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Olympics_medal_count_0d44.html" title="Summer Olympics medal count">Summer Olympics</a> medal pages add to more that what this page shows. While this can be fixed, the fact still remains that Winter Olmypic Medals and Summer Olympic Medals should not be added together because they are two totally different things. Further, many countries who participate in the Summer games do not participate in the winter ones, and vice versa. Blatently, the two cannot be compared. --<a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035">Jared</a> 22:02, 16 February 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035">Jared</a> 22:02, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Keep but fix</b> I agree with some of Jared's points, however, I feel that this list is quite relevant given that it is part of an article entitled "Olympic Games." Therefore, the two games can be compared and seen in the same context because they are both "Olympic Games" with a difference in season and sports. Their medal counts can be added together because they have this in common, and I think some people would find such a tally interesting and I'm also sure most everyone who is interested in the Olympic Games has pondered at least once about what the all-time Olympic medal tallies would be for each participating nation. I feel that we should have separate lists for all-time medal counts for both the Winter and Summer Olympic Games and then also have a list with the two games' medal counts combined. In doing so, we must make sure that when we produce these medal rankings that they are complete, accurate, and that every Games is included so that the numbers aren't grossly miscalculated and that countries are not erroneously left out. --<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaponer_c591.html" title="User:Caponer">Caponer</a> 00:32, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Neutral</b>. I do agree with you. In a way, I think that the page should be kept, but somehow I dont think it is as important to keep because people will only look at it because they "pondered at least once about [it]." It doesn't contain information that could be used for anything but self knowledge, and even the all of the data is wrong! --<a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035">Jared</a> 00:37, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Keep but fix.</b> Caponer is right: the Games absolutely are comparable. They are run by the same organization (the IOC), and the only reason that we have separate Winter and Summer Olympics now is because of the impracticality of finding one location at which to host all of the possible events for Winter and Summer Sports at the same time. Before the First "Winter" Olympics were held in 1924, there was no such thing as 'Summer' or 'Winter' Olympic Games, they were just the Olympic Games. In fact, some of the very early Olympic Games (i.e., 'Summer' Games, but before they were called that) included events like Figure Skating and Ice Hockey. Should those medals for Figure Skating and Ice Hockey then be counted with the 'Summer' Games because that's where they were awarded, or with the 'Winter' Games because Figure Skating and Ice Hockey are Winter Sports? The point of the Olympics Medal lists is to compare the athletic nature of different Countries, and given that all of the events at every Olympics are athletic in nature, there is a totally valid reason to combine the Medal counts from Winter and Summer Olympic Games. I would also support pages comparing Medal totals for individual Sports, like skiing, track &amp; field, etc. That said, I agree that the Medal totals should be accurate. But it still leaves us with problems like whether or not to include the Intercalated Games of 1906, what to do with medals awarded to teams of people from different countries (allowed at early Olympic Games, but not in the past 100 years), etc.Bojangles04 06:09, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Using the all-time charts for both the Winter and Summer Olympic Games, I've corrected the combined chart down to #73 which is currently Liechtenstein. I would appreciate if others who would like to see the chart stay could assist me with the final count corrections and assist in double-checking the totals I have corrected (as I am very sleepy and it is possible I could have made a few mistakes). It's beginning to look more and more like a keeper! --<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaponer_c591.html" title="User:Caponer">Caponer</a> 07:11, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Keep and cleanup</b> There's some problematic historic entries and sports like boxing which give out 2 bronze medals, but these are issues that can be overcome one step at a time. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadchester_c727.html" title="User:Madchester">Madchester</a> 07:31, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, So I think that we've resolved this issue. I think that we should close this deletion, agreeing to <b>Keep and fix</b> because it is obviously wrong information. (I would do it, but I'm not an admin.) If someone from this discussion would do it (or could find someone to do it) that would be great!

<p>Total Keeper: It is totally harmless and quite informative at the same time. As long as a seperate list of Summer and Winter Games exists, there is no harm. Would like further clarification on what data is incorrect? The Intercalated Games of 1906 are not recognized by the IOC thus should not be included.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Someone was able to correct the problem. The totals here were less than the visual combined total of the winter and summer pages, but someone fixed this. There is no problem now, do this deletion discussion should be ended. --<a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035">Jared</a> 12:55, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
