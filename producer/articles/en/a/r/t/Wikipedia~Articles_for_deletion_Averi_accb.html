<p>Vanity style article of nn, unsigned band per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. I <i>prodded</i>, but an anon addded further claims of a national tour (except it wasn't national) and articles in the Boston Globe (all i can find are local concert listings). So here it is. Also listed for your perusal, equally nn self released albums below. <b>Neutral</b>. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="blue">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 17:47, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - judging from the touring schedule listed on the group's site, they appear to be touring nationally and regularly. Although their albums are self-released, their music seems to have proper distribution (available from Amazon, cdbaby and the inevitable iTunes) and sales of over 20,000 are reported in a reputable source (The Boston Globe). Plus, I would add, from <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> <i>has become the most prominent representative of...the local scene of a city</i>. If you're selling out a 2,000 seater in your hometown, I would say you satisfy that requirement. Plenty GHits for "Averi", even if you add "band" <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=averi+band&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=averi+band&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Fair points. Clearly they are regionally popular, though i have no idea whether they qualify as "the most prominent representative" of the local scene. Boston is a big place. Moreover, their 'national tour' hasn't made the West coast, so its more of a large regional tour. Nevertheless, i'm less convinced now, so will change my comment to neutral. However, I also just noticed that a fair amount of the article is a direct lift from their website, making it a copyvio. I'm not sure whether it is appropriate to blank the page during an AfD. If it stays it needs a NPOV rewrite anyway. Any ideas? <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="blue">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 19:51, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment - your US geography is clearly superior to mine, so I'll take the point on that one. I think <i>changes</i> to an article are appropriate during a AfD as they are frequently made to try and satisfy the concerns raised during the discussion but if it's a copyvio and no-one comes forward to rewrite then it'll have to go, I believe.<a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 19:57, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The sooner, the better. It might be best to do it in stages, so show the other editors that there is a bona fide attempt to rectify the problems. That's how I managed to salvage a couple of music-related articles from AfD (such as <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Ward_8bd4.html" title="Robin Ward">Robin Ward</a>). <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 06:46, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Theoretically, as a copyvio the page should be blanked immediately and started from scratch. However, i very much doubt the band would worry too much that their copyright is being violated in this manner. You should have a week or so until this AfD is resolved, i would recommend you replace the copied text by then. You could also read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for advice on how to write a verifiable article in neutral tone.

<li>Comment - I know these guys personally and professionally and based on the wording of this article I would say either a band member or a member of the bands staff wrote this. Notice the complete lack of mention of former lead singer/guitar player/front man Chad Perrone who wrote almost ALL of the songs from thier first 2 albums. It has only been 2 months since Chad's departure. (what happened to cause his departure is unclear as both the band and Chad refuse to get into a he said/they said type thing.) As for thier importance in the Boston music scene, these guys are the real deal. They may not have had a "real" national tour, but what they have done to the local pop/rock scene is no less then what Dropkick Murphys have done for the irish-punk scene.</li>

<ul>
<li>Comment - I also know them on the same level. Perrone's departure actually happened last December, almost six months ago. A member of the band or staff probably did write the former history section but didn't mention him most likely because the band has moved on and would like people who read about them to see them as the band they are in the here and now.</li>

<li>New Article(mostly) - I've made some changes that should take this article out of the deletion pool. I added a history section and took most of what was already there and moved it into the "press - growth" section. I have included mention of the previous lead singer and given what I believe to be an unbiased view of his leaving the band by providing quotations of both sides of the story.</li>
<li>I am a member of the band's staff and while I understand that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, it is also a place where unnecessary finger pointing can begin, maybe not with the musicians themselves but with supporters who unfortunately chose to take sides after the split. As long as the article stays up, it poses as a risk to start trouble, and I am sure that neither Averi nor Chad wants anything more negative to happen. Both sides have moved on. I will be putting in a request to delete this article as soon as possible. Thank you for understanding.</li>

See the bullet point "Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability."</strike></li>
