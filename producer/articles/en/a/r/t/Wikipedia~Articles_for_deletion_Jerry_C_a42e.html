<p>If you're saying the tour is not notable well it doesn't have to be, only the source of verification does and the source of verification is his website which has videos of it and I'm sure, given time, I could show other sources that are undisputable. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunder_Cat_62bc.html" title="User:Thunder Cat">Thunder Cat</a> 13:03, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. if you look on you tube he gets loads of views on his videos so he will be notable. cannon got 31,889 viewings. so he must be notable to some point if that many people are going to watch just 1 of his videos 82.118.120.209 13:26, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Having a video on YouTube is not a sign of notability.

<p>Well if he meets some of the criteria he the article remains as an article only has to meet one of the criteria to be able to remain.

<li>I'd recommend that (if they've been on significant - major or important indie - labels with a national distribution), plus touring details.

<li><b>Oppose</b>. I am not familiar with the Wikipedia submission process, but I have been asked to argue in favor of a JerryC Wikipedia submission. JerryC is without a doubt an Internet phenomenon. Youtube, Google Video, and many other video sharing sites are populated with <b>hundreds</b> of videos of people covering (copying/playing) JerryC's Canon Rock. JerryC videos became popular because of the stark contrast between his high end guitar &amp; compositional talent juxtaposed against the humble back drop of his tatty bedroom. If he had recorded his videos on stage, I'm sure few people would have noticed. However, he does currently have a huge Internet following. I run a non profit JerryC video link site: [<a href="http://www.jerryc.co.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jerryc.co.uk" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. I have no financial or contractual link with JerryC (in fact I've only emailed him twice). My site gets 40,000 Unique visitors per month, and has had 8.5 million hits in the last 5 months. I would say, that's popular. I think at the very least, JerryC should get a mention on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">Internet phenomenon</a> page, but really deserves his own link. It's not about promoting him as an artist, but more about documenting the Internet ripple his video's have caused (the Canon Rock covers). Megazoid --82.152.166.122 19:45, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> Surely if someone has tried to make an article in the past and there are so many viewings he must be at least a "notable artist". As to verifying the amount of viewings one can simply go on the websites listed. As Megazoid runs the website he can issue proof to verify the amount of hits he recieves and one can simply look at the number of hits on You Tube. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunder_Cat_62bc.html" title="User:Thunder Cat">Thunder Cat</a> 20:09, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The definiton of notable is worthy of note, remarkable or a person of distinction. Jery C is worthy of note, he is remarkable and he is a person of distinction. He is a very talented guitarist, one could easily say he is a virtuoso. Not only this but he is also a very competant drummer and pianist. Not only this but he is very distinctive as the music he plays is very different to what one would normally hear, unique even, apart from his covers of course! There is a vast amount of interest in him all over the internet so surely he is a notable artist at the very least. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunder_Cat_62bc.html" title="User:Thunder Cat">Thunder Cat</a> 20:39, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> That definition of notable is becoming out of date as there are other people who are popular and notable on the internet alone. Jerry C is an example of them and we should reform our definition of notable to accept people like him. Does it also not say if the rules hinder the improvement of Wikipedia you should ignore them? <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunder_Cat_62bc.html" title="User:Thunder Cat">Thunder Cat</a> 08:34, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This needs to be discussed at the village pump, not in the middle of an AfD, in which we must follow the established guidelines.

<li><b>Verification</b> The 15th most viewed video on YouTube, is a cover (copy) of JerryC's Canon Rock video by a young Malaysian - FunTwo. Simply titled "guitar" [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjA5faZF1A8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjA5faZF1A8" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>], it shows Funtwo playing an unaltered version of JerryC's composition in the same setting (his bedroom). It has had 4,612,731 views, and was mentioned in an article on The New York Times website [<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/03/arts/03tube.html?ex=1301716800&amp;en=ca77a5cefaee9b3f&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/03/arts/03tube.html?ex=1301716800&amp;en=ca77a5cefaee9b3f&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>]. JerryC is mentioned in both the video, and the article. JerryC's original Canon Rock video has been posted so many times on YouTube, that it has diluted its true ranking unfortunately. A Google search for the term "JerryC" produces 134,000 results [<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22JerryC%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22JerryC%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>]. It is interesting to note, that this is more results, than some of the band entries currently listed on the wikipedia <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">Internet_phenomenon</a> page. For example: "Lemon Demon" [<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Lemon+Demon%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Lemon+Demon%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>] produces 124,000 results. I personally feel the submitted JerryC page needs to be edited heavily, but some reference to JerryC is warranted on wikipedia. Megazoid --82.152.166.122 14:06, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>OK, this discussion has gone round and round. The bottom line is that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an agent of promotion</a>. This article is premature... It's time to <b>delete</b> it until <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is established. Of course, an encyclopedic article would discuss in some length his work (preferably spelled correctly - misspellings stand out when they're red links). I'd be more inclined to accept the article if it truly had significant substance besides the POV/biographical first paragraph.
