<p>This is a list that merely lumps together and explains formulas that alread exist elsewhere on wikipedia. Whoever started it only placed a few on, but if it were to enumerate every formula in the same manner it would become huge, unworkable, and entirely composed of content that exists elsewhere on the site. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 00:08, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. You're right about the article as it stands now, but what if was a more traditional Wikipedia list, and simply listed each Wikipedia article that's about a math formula? It would still be kind of odd, but then a lot of Wikipedia lists are. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 00:32, 6 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That would depend. I am not against such lists in principle, but prefer categories to lists when feasible. If a list would be a better way to accomplish that than a category, then I would be fine with it. However, if no one changes this list to function in that manner I would still wanted it deleted, as the article as it stands has issues and it would be easy for someone else to create a proper list whether this article exists or not. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 02:09, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> – A category "mathematical formulas" is NOT a good idea. Mathematical formulas have only meaning within a context, which is given in the articles in which they are presented. Only very rarely will a formula be the focus of an article. It is pointless to have a category of articles that contain an important mathematical formula. Basically all mathematical articles do unless pure definitions or stubs. Without further organization, which is much better possible in articles like the aforementioned <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_integrals.html" title="Lists of integrals">Lists of integrals</a> than using a category, the effort will be useless and wasted. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 18:29, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Can be speedily deleted because the author has removed the contents and written "delete" in the article." Also, if you have more photos, why not put them on <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="commons:Main_Page">Commons</a>. The procedure is very similar to the procedure for Wikipedia. Commons wants people to put together galleries of photos. Any photo on Commons can be used on Wikipedia in any language. It's fun to look at an article on Wikipedias in other languages and discover that they use your photos! Just be sure to grant an appropriate license like GFDL or Public Domain. Commons does not have an article named "Yokota Air Base." You can create the article and put lots of good photos in it! <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 01:04, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Sigh</b>. I have mixed feelings about deleting it myself, since it's so heavily linked to, but I spent about an hour today doing research trying to find out at least the history of the term, but to no avail.

<dd>I'm in the same position you are, honestly. I know it's something that could get a lot of traffic, I just don't know how to make it any more than what it is now. The Mexico incident is interesting, but it seems an awfully small point to pin an article on. Maybe if there's some verifiable history out there, or enough interesting notes and links to give people a starting point.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. After FGJ added other meanings, I, per the MoS and acting <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">boldly</a>, reformatted her entries as a separate dab page (even as I think one to be rather <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">crystal ballish</a>), viz., <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_points_bulletin_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="All points bulletin (disambiguation)">All points bulletin (disambiguation)</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> The main article was deleted because in the first instance it was a copyvio and has not been recreated using non copyright material since. Its deletion has no effect on this discussion, as its notability has not been challenged at all. In response to the allegations, this article does not seem to fit the criteria below indiscriminate collection of information, it is a well defined grouping of organisations. Free web host does not apply in this situation as it is a simple list of information. Propaganda relates to biased material, this article does not seem to have serious problems in this respect, and if it did the appropriate action would be to be bold and make it fit NPOV. How original research fits into this I do not know. The information just needs to be sourced, that is not cause for deletion. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#009000;">e</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User_talk%7EAnsell_90fe.html" title="User talk:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">ll</span></a> 10:49, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This and other articles nominated below are part of a larger group of articles relating to councillors and candidates in Brentwood, Essex, England, seen at <a href="../../../b/r/e/Category%7EBrentwood_14c0.html" title="Category:Brentwood">Category:Brentwood</a>. I would happily nominate all of them other than those who have been leaders of the Council or are otherwise notable. The presence of the first few seems to spawning POV articles essentially reproducing election biographies, and could get too much to handle.</p>
<p>However, those which I am nominating now are just those of losing candidates - they have not held public office and no wider notability beyond local campaigning is asserted. We cannot have hundred of articles on <i>failed</i> local politicians on top of articles on every successful one. Perhaps the other articles can be considered individually.</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Le-Surf, failed candidate, nn</li>
<li>Antony Williams, failed candidate, asserts local notability but seems vanity</li>
<li>Doris Suckling, failed candidate, nn</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Local elections are always on the first Thursday in May unless there is a by-election. I think that Brentwood is on a three-year cycle and next year is their year off, with elections for the Essex County Council level instead, so it would be two years until these seats are contested again, but that needs checking. <a href="../../../m/t/i/User%7EMtiedemann_f8b2.html" title="User:Mtiedemann">Mtiedemann</a> 00:23, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems to me like this article is pointless. If you want to note the original title of an opera, it should be on the article for that opera. Quite why anyone would want to look at a simple list of operas with their original titles, I don't know.

<li><b><s>Weak</s> keep</b> Though closed, it looks like there's a charity set up to revive it, with involvement from Bill Cosby, believe it or not. Found a few news stories on the whole mess. If anything, I'd rate this as <i>more</i> notable than most of the average high-school articles we see. <b>Update</b> After further research, I found a press release stating that "Friends of Notre Dame Inc", the charity I mentioned above, actually <i>sued the Diocese</i> and alleged that the school was closed down illegally, as well as accusations of other financial shenanigans. Changing vote to a solid keep, as the school seems to be the center of a major (if local) scandal and uproar. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 03:57, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Bibliographies certainly are encyclopedic... most if not all print encyclopedias include extensive bibliographies, sometimes even in their own volumes. The closest encyclopedia to me right now, <i>Man, Myth &amp; Magic</i>, has a full 50 pages of bibliography in volume 24. For those saying bibliographies don't belong in an encyclopedia, which encyclopedia have you been using? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 04:21, 6 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's simply a gross inaccuracy. Please point me to an encyclopedia that consists of ehxaustive bibliographies. True, encyclopedias point to principal works cited or important to the subject at hand, but they are not exhaustive repositories for sources pertaining to a subject. For example, a comprehensive bibliography of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism.html" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> runs to many <i>hundreds</i> of pages (including propaganda and "motivated" articles it could extend easily to thousands). Please direct me to this encyclopedic reference you have found that has 500 pages devoted to nothing but books and articles on Marxism. You have conflated directed references with exhaustive bibliography. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 00:29, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. We can't list every non-notable photographer in Wiki. Non Encyclopedic. The above comment is nonsense. What defines a 'serious photographer'? Are we going to start having lists of 'serious photographers you have never heard of'?

<li><b>Comment</b> The purpose of this article is not to list every photographer, notable or otherwise, but to provide information and links to photographs of one serious, published photographer. A "serious photographer" might be defined as someone who uses photography as a form of artistic expression, as opposed to someone who photographs for the purpose of recording events such as birthdays, weddings, etc. Jpojman 20:36, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> No doubt there are many "notable" books that are not listed on Amazon.com for a variety of legitimate reasons including that they are no longer available (i.e., out-of-print) or of insufficient interest to Amazon.com (i.e., they don't think selling them would be profitable enough to be worth the effort). In this case, both books were published in India (not a major market for Amazon). Also, the books are out-of-print although they are still available in a number of bookstores in India.

<li><b>Comment</b>, apparently the company is notable enough according to the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Talk%7EFreshMinds_e995.html" title="Talk:FreshMinds">Talk:FreshMinds</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> this strikes me as a case where <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> isn't useful. The article is factual and NPOV and is about a notable enough company. Just because the founder of the company wrote the article isn't in itself enough to delete it. True vanity articles are essentially POV, this is not one of them. All "IMHO" of course, <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_Esperanza_97e1.html" title="User:Gwernol/Esperanza">Gw<font color="green">e</font>rnol</a> 04:46, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As above, VAIN is not useful for articles which can easily be critiqued and made NPOV by outside editors. As long as the original information was not COPYVIO, I say that it is notable enough given its revenue and number of employees to warrant an article on it. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#009000;">e</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User_talk%7EAnsell_90fe.html" title="User talk:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">ll</span></a> 11:15, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> after reviewing the "in the news" links used to rule out <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, I believe FreshMinds still fails the test. The only article specifically about FreshMinds was an early press release that got published within months of starting business. The other articles were not about FreshMinds at all but included brief employee quotes or references to the company in articles about something else entirely. Several of the links were also dead. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 19:15, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I believe there is little doubt FreshMinds meets <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Articles about FreshMinds have been published by the Financial Times, The Times, The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph. These are the UK's leading broadsheet newspapers and the articles are about the firm, it's not a simple side mention. In addition the relevant UK trade press have all commented about the company. Evidence of this can be found at the "press" section in the website if you care to read it. I can understand the claims of WP:VAIN, however the listing exists in order to ensure simple, factual information is present about this firm. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.111.156.122 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.111.156.122_00b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.111.156.122">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I suppose what is 'notable' depends on the interests of the reader. Consider the hundreds (thousands?) of articles on appalling singers, obscure bands, and forgettable movies in this Wipipedia, also innumerable American football players and other sports people. I read one usertalk who had the ambition to see an article on every major or minor ship in the American Navy. Consult the category 'Royal Navy admirals', over 200 entries, most of whom have done no more than Admiral Prevost. Why pick on him? I hope it is not racial.

<li>Please don't do that to a small project unless you know the content is good. It might just be garbage and wasting their time too. I've asked a Panjabi speaker to check it out and see if it is worth translating, hopefully he can get to it before this vote is over.

<li>One reason Wikipedia can be great, is its potential for being timely with new, valid information, a criteria that might well be added to WP:CORP to improve it. Less than three months after coming out of stealth mode, GOOGLE now (May 8th) shows 756 links to "www.eyespot.com" and a GOOGLE search on [eyespot 'video editing'] produces several pages of references.

<dd><b>Comment.</b> The problem as i see it, is that even though i do not doubt it, there is no verifiable source that says it is fake. So if we take the OR out we have just the claims of the Pherlure people. Yet there is no verifiable source that says it is real, so we take that out and we have nothing!

<li><b>Comment</b> Sounds good to me. I'm clearly not a sockpuppet, however, since I'm the one posting the information, and the information is all easily verifiable. This is a deliberate persistent fraud which Wikipedia users need to know about.</li>
<li>Once again, I want to make the important point that this is not OR in the sense that it's my research which no one can verify from sources. The sources are all linked to and they are the websites themselves and Google. The comment that "Medline searches find no mention of this chemical" is verified through linking to Medline, again Medline is the authority, not me. So there is no real OR in this entry. All the sources are there. --Jahat 20:48, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> To be clear, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> says: "In order to avoid doing original research... it is essential that any <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a> material, as well as any generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of information or data, <i>has been published by a reputable third-party publication</i>" Jahat's material is clearly an evaluation of information, but he cannot source a reputable third-party publication, hence it is OR. As for restarting the Afd, surely the closing Admin can simply evaluation the value of each editor's justification before making a decision. A vote is pretty meaningless without a reason. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket">Rockpocket</a> <a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket">(talk)</a> 23:18, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I find it interesting that the previous user is so persistent on posting non-verifiable information and assumptions on only this subject. To quote the user's edit from the second paragraph, "study appears to be fake", fourth paragraph "The fake study reference is found at another fake site". It appears the user was not sure in the second paragraph, but had convinced himself by the fourth paragraph. Wikipedia is for verifiable information, not opinions/assumptions possibly based on personal or business intentions--Sweetb 23:13, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> It's perfectly obvious if one clicks on the links that what I state is the case. This is a fraud with fake sites set up to promote a study that never happened. The people behind this are very aggressively defrauding people with a type of fraud that resembles phishing in some ways in that fake sites are being created. When people come to Wikipedia looking to see what di-dehydroepiandrosterone is, they should be able to find the information that it is a fake. There is nothing unverifiable in what was posted, and the authorities again are Medline and Google. --Jahat 02:54, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> article verifies that the sites are fake. But if the alternatives are no entry for this fake product, or an entry which links to the fake articles with no comment, giving people the impression that it's real, then I'd rather see the article deleted. Wikipedia should be giving people helpful information, not aiding frauders. --Jahat 22:55, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Showing lack of search results by google does not verify a site is fake. If you know how to properly search a site for it's pages, you will see that both referenced sites you claim are fake do have pages that exist, but are NOT shown in Google search results. This should serve as a fine example that lack of search results in Google, does not indiciate anything other than lack of search results in Google. It also shows that the edits are mistaken and clearly not from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. I would agree that it should be deleted if there is no clear verification if the substance exists or clear verification that the substance does not exist.</dd>

<dd>I pointed out the pages that already existed. If you understand the way Googlebot works, you'll understand that there are millions of pages on the internet not indexed by Googlebot.

<dd>I looked at these sites several weeks ago, and they had no other pages in evidence other than the homepage and the articles on this imaginary chemical. Other pages gave a message claiming that a login was necessary. Why should the pages containing the fake study reference have no login but the other pages all require a login? Probably because there were no other pages until this whole sham was exposed. --69.3.233.183 09:33, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> but possibly <b>Rename</b>. The word might be a neologism (I sure haven't heard it), but the concept it describes is notable and article-worthy. What it needs is better-defined examples so it's easier to understand.

<li><b>Comment</b>. We should not set a standard based on a certain number of Google hits being enough to keep a word in Wikipedia. Over time Google is likely to index more and more content which would make it easier to meet that standard.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm a failed candidate and we're all important! No seriously this guy sounds very interesting - a conservitive candidate who is a muslim in a city that has had significant problems with relationships between muslim communities and the community in general recently. He may well figure in future debate, and it would be useful to be able to access infomation about his background quickly. Just the thing an online reference is most useful for - up to date infomation on seemingly unimportant topics that may quicky become important as things change. Michael Johnson.</li>

<dd>I'd like a definition of important. Some people are putting a lot of effort into writing articles about railway stations in Melbourne, not railway stations in general, or even the busiest, or most architectually interesting, but every single railway station. The balance of importance seems to lean pretty heavily towards unimportant here, and to be honest I don't mind that at all. A paper encyclopedia is limited by the cost of production and pure size, constraints that sure do still apply here but to knowhere the same degree. A good thing. Someone thinks he is important enough to write an entry, he is in public life in this country, so I still say keep him, untill such time as the server is full, and we have to start deleting stuff. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Johnson_75b2.html" title="User:Michael Johnson">Michael Johnson</a> 12:22, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is a risk of setting a precedent if we keep unimportant living people that doesn't exist so much for railway stations. This person is no more notable than 100s of other minor public figures - do we want articles on all of them? His claim to fame seems to be that he's a political activist that writes the odd article.

<dd>I think that the candidates of the large parties are, even if they don't have a good chance of getting elected. The "tokeness" of a Muslim conservative can actually contribute to one's notability. Of course I respect if you have different opinions, many of the items here are really border cases.

<dd>I agree that token candidates are probably more notable than other candidates, but standing in an election and losing is a single act that doesn't really effect anything. Were it a major position you were standing for (President or something) then the election campaign is notable in itself, but a single seat in a parliament is rarely newsworthy during a campaign, it's the leaders of the party that do all the big talks and things. This is rather a general issue, though, so prehaps we should have a proper discussion on the requirements for a politian to be notable (unless one has already taken place, of course - I'll go look). --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 16:49, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> per Schizombie. Yeah, I know <i>he</i> voted keep. I'm going to be a bit nuanced, so it's kind of hard to put something in bold up front, but I will explain this discrepancy. As it stands, this article is an egregious example of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and I suspect it was put here in the interests of making a couple of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINTs</a> in the light of the debate on the <i>other</i> article. Also, I'm pretty sure that the people calling this list encyclopedic didn't read very far down. This article is a mismash of fact, allegation, innuendo, and just plain insanity. Some of the entries are bona-fide sex scandals, but the rest is simply junk: several of the entries are just assertions that some person got divorced, or has had out-of-wedlock children. One more notable example is Rush Limbaugh; this article simply asserts he has been divorced three times. All well and good, but how on earth is this a <i>sex scandal</i>? One also notes with some amusement that this article insinuates that George W. Bush raped a woman and later had her killed. Somehow, I didn't hear about that on the news...&#160;:-) Seriously, guys, this is a perfect article for dKosopedia. And, hey, look <a href="http://www.dkosopedia.com/wiki/Republican_Sex_Scandals" class="external text" title="http://www.dkosopedia.com/wiki/Republican_Sex_Scandals" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.dkosopedia.com/wiki/Moral_Values" class="external text" title="http://www.dkosopedia.com/wiki/Moral_Values" rel="nofollow">here</a>! What a coincidence. Tying this all together, I would say that what needs to happen to this article is that about 85% of the stuff in here needs to go (as we come up with an objective standard of what "sex scandal" is in the first place), it needs to be renamed to a NPOV name, and then all of the analogous Democratic and other non-right-wing stuff needs to be added here as well. In short, I am advocating exactly what&#160;??????? said. But the cleanest way to do that, I think, is to just destroy this article and start over. One notes that since a copy of all of this information exists at dKosipedia, then any of these entries can be copied from over there. One also notes that exactly zero people did zero work on this article, as it is a straight cut-and-paste from another site, so we're losing no labor by deleting it. --<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 20:07, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

Paul Crouch paid $425K to settle a wrongful termination suit. Therefore, Paul Crouch must be gay.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The Bon Jovi Battle of the Bands appears to have been a one-time event to find an opening act for a Bon Jovi show in Madison, Wisconsin in November 2005 <a href="http://www.thedailypage.com/going-out/theguide/event.php?id=133256" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thedailypage.com/going-out/theguide/event.php?id=133256" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. I don't know if this particular segment on ESPN's X-Games is a particularly notable segment. But from the sound of it, it's not like it was the theme song or anthem of the entire X-Games, but rather, just mixed in during some highlights or something. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 02:11, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>KEEP</b> First of all having read through this discussion I would like to say that just because I am a new user, that people should not treat me any less than themselves, it is true I have made little contribution in the form of comment or article to Wikipedia, through no fault of my own, as I find it a reliable and well managed source, and see little need therefore to add my input. However, I have come to gain information on a local tradition which has recently come to my attention, Tunday. being new to the area I am increasingly interested in local myths and traditions, I have recently heard about Tunday from some of the local people and colleagues who have lived in the area for a long time. with the most recent Tunday just passed I decided to further my knowledge into this tradition, as I found it an interesting event. I trawled the internet fruitlessly, as it seems some of you also have, with little reference to Tunday on the internet I was beginning to lose hope in finding this illustrious tradition. I discovered this article and was shocked to find that people considered Tunday a ‘Hoax’ this fuelled an ambition to find the true roots of Tunday. I remembered the true roots of knowledge before the internet, having took the time to go to the library I found a book entitled 'Lesser known traditions of England and Wales' by Anthony Langdon, in which there was a clear article on Tunday, although small and seeming relatively insignificant compared to other lesser known traditions the article relates to a tradition which reaches back centuries, “Tunday has been an Celtic tradition since circa 230AD, the tradition was a ritual preformed by believers of pre-roman druidism, the ritual was preformed on the hour of the calendar day of the subsequent number of the month of the subsequent number” it goes on to say that “The tradition no longer includes a human sacrifice, but the custom of praying to the Celtic gods for desires has remained.” This appears to have evolved into the current practice of wishing. It appears that the tradition has been passed on through a relatively small area of Celtic ancestry to lead to today's current Lancastrian tradition along with several small Welsh communities who also practice this tradition. The old rituals of sacrifice were replaced over time, when Druidism as a religion was practically destroyed in circa 60BC by the Romans, by those less loyal to the tradition by simple good will gestures, to be in accordance with Roman rule. It would appear according to 'Lesser known traditions of England and Wales' that the tradition of Tunday has evolved to have meaning on our current calendar and as more units of time have become available as has the accuracy of the Tunday tradition. Unfortunately this source gives no information upon the origin of the partial and full Tunday, but I assume as time began to be measured in the 12 hour clock that followers of the tradition adopted the slightly easier option of celebrating Tunday, and taking a quiet moment to reflect and wish on, for instance, the 14th hour rather than the 2nd hour. Also unfortunately the book does not give any disclosure into where the current name of Tunday derives. Of course having discovered this information I was appalled to think that people were comparing such an ancient and inherent tradition to that of Crop Circles or Bigfoot, (admittedly through no fault of their own) classing it a ‘Hoax’. I hope you see the errors of your ways in wishing to delete a (until now) somewhat forgotten gem of British history, from a site dedicated to empowering knowledge to the people. To say that it is suitable for deletion because it is relatively unknown is blatant bigotry against lesser known knowledge and is a misuse of this website. I will certainly be celebrating Tunday and spreading the word of such a prestigious celebration. Upon saying this I would agree that the member who wrote this article needs to review it with relevant sourced information.</li>

<li>firstly in reply to the rather aggressive 'IrishGuy' I have been a legitimate user of Wikipedia for a long time now, although as I explained, I have had no need to comment or add an article of my own until now, having had recent interest in the subject I have joined this farce of a debate in order to protect a tradition and custom 'under attack' by a combination of ignorance and benightedness. I resent that I have to defend my identity as well as defending this tradition, as for so called ‘sock puppetry’ you yourself say along with ‘tonywalton’ admit that you have never seen this happen before in favour or against any AfD. In reply to the accusations that this book does not exist, it seems to be a reprint of a compilation of older books based upon English traditions. It seems that some of this book has been translated from original Gaelic texts. I very much doubt any of these books or manuscripts are listed on any incomplete online library catalogues such as that of the British library which goes back barely further than the 15th century. In reply to your link to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Neopaganism_10f8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Neopaganism">Wikipedia:WikiProject Neopaganism</a> this was not a Neopagan tradition, no doubt it will have evolved into a form of Neopagan tradition, but Celtic beliefs and religion precede that of Neopaganism, so therefore your link is totally irrelevant, I’m afraid. And as for “whatever "the ritual was preformed on the hour of the calendar day of the subsequent number of the month of the subsequent number” is supposed to mean” this quite obviously means that a ritual was preformed on the hour of the day (for instance on the third hour) of the day of the month which followed the number of the hour (for instance the fourth day) of the month which followed the number of the day (for instance the fifth month). Having said this in response I do see your point that the source provided seems somewhat invalid. Therefore I am willing to spend some of my time researching this subject further in order for the truth to be known. When I have collected more information I shall return to post my findings.--Dontrileme 13:20, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You claim <i>firstly in reply to the rather aggressive 'IrishGuy' I have been a legitimate user of Wikipedia for a long time now...</i> and yet your user history shows quite the opposite. Second, you claim <i>as for so called ‘sock puppetry’ you yourself say along with ‘tonywalton’ admit that you have never seen this happen before in favour or against any AfD....'</i> Wrong. We both stated quite clearly that neither of us has seen it be effective. It happens all the time in AfDs...it just rarely works. Because like this case, it is plainly obvious that Dontrileme is the same user as Guitar6strings. You both write the same. You both insist on calling this a debate even though it has been pointed out it isn't. You both write excessively long screeds and point the finger at me about this being deleted. I'm not the one who nominated this for deletion. I'm just the one who keeps catching your sockpuppets. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 17:23, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We must have different versions of "Chroniques Paysannes Legendes, Traditions et Superstitions". In my version, it appears to me (my french is not flawless) Tunday is on page 45. Is there something different in your version?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>: This whole discussion is idiotic and beside the point. This AfD is not an attack on a different religion or cult or tradition or whatever. The existence of the wikipedia article is what's in discussion here. You (the article author and all the "Tundayists" around here) say that Tunday exists, is notable in the Lancashire area and that there's a book that mentions it. Fine. Give us a way to verify it and we will promptly change our votes to Keep. Please read <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for a extended explanation on verifiability. <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources</a> has more info on what is "Reliable Source". Whining and personal attacks wont change the outcome of this AfD. 146.164.26.85 18:06, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I accept the fact that people find it hard to accept the proposed sources by my fellow Tunday believers but whether you can find those books/sources or not does not make this article a hoax; it only further emphasises your point as an article that cannot not yet at this point be verifeid sufficeintly to your strict demands. I believe notability is somewhat "proven" or moving towards it wheather you may agree with me or not but ture, the real debate between people here is on the verifiablity. However i must strongly stress that despite this topic of discussion in my motion to keep the article; it is most deffinately not a hoax.--Guitar6strings 23:01, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, notability has in no way been proven. All that has been shown are sources given that may or may not exist. How does that illustrate notability? <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 23:05, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, but the article (and the picture) make it clear that it's talking about a fictional character: "...in the anime...", "...many fans believe...", "...of chapter 254..." and so forth.

<li>Apologies for 'spam' links earlier today. This was a product of ignorance, and was overzealous and completely out of line. It will not happen again. Prod notice was removed because article was altered in an attempt to increase evidence of notability. This article is not meant as an advertisement for the website, but as a source of information about the cartoon character and strip. It was created in response to a number of queries about said character and strip. It is intended that more information will be added over coming weeks. Please, if the content can be made more suitable for Wikipedia in any way, all suggestions will be taken into account. Googergeiger 15:10, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>The person's article is up for deletion in the French Wikipedia, as well as the article for his school École internationale de chant et de respiration. There is little, or no material for this individual in Google, and nothing for "Bernardo Giotto". There are no recordings listed in any of the databases, nor was any information available for any of the awards that he has listed in Englih or in French. He lists no degrees, nor does he list ensembles that he conducts. There are also a great many references to his school and his name in other articles which have nothing to do with the subject which keep popping up in the French version of Wikipedia, as well as a great many articles about little known family members which are also being examined. To be consistent, I'm nominating this article for deletion.

<li>Someone on French wikipedia has alerted someone on Dutch Wikipedia and hopefully, he will respond. I work in the music business in Europe and no one I know has heard of him. We'll see what the Dutch have to say about this. This is the same person as "Professor Léon-Bernard Giot", per a re-direct on the French site. Looking at the edit history of the Dutch article, I see that <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> has made several edits on the Dutch version. Perhaps he might be able to comment? Musikfabrik 09:27, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi Musikfabrik, the Dutch Wikipedia is not equally strict with notability. From what I can understand LBG is a part-time musician who apparently also gives some lessons. Some of the information comes from a long-time participant at nl.wikipedia who knows him. LBG pointed out on the talk page that the title "professor" is not protected, i.e. he claims anyone can carry it. He uses the name International whatever school to describe his lesson practice. Personally, I do not believe that this is the best way to promote art, but Wikipedia is not a promotional site anyway. He has had second thoughts as well, because in the past he asked to delete the talk page for his Dutch article. It has been archived, with which he is unhappy. The article here is a promotional text, full of exaggerations. It was created, not by himself, after he had placed a request to be included in en.wikipedia. At his website there are some clippings from the local press, mostly about his ideas on better breathing. He suggests that he should become minister of breathing of Belgium (or was it one of its "states"). This suggestion attracted mild interest from the local press. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 10:20, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I'm a huge spelling bee (and, incidentally, a huge "Cheap Seats" fan), so naturally, I love Rebecca Sealfon. With that said, for pretty much any other spelling bee champion, I would vote delete. However, the pop culture references to Sealfon, in my opinion, give her enough notability to have an article on WP. She is mentioned frequently on "Cheap Seats," including in non-spelling bee episodes, and the first time I saw that "South Park" episode, I immediately thought they based the character on Sealfon. In summation, I think this should stay, but just barely. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 16:42, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

The criticism that this article is inherently <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> and largely either <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> or relying on unsound sources is a powerful one, and it's a criticism that isn't refuted here.

<li><b>Keep</b> This article is precisely about prejudices in South Asian Studies, and if you see there is "Hindu prejudice", then you could add your viewpoint into the article. An AFD is not a subsititue for a NPOV-tag. I'll be the first to concede that the article needs to be improved. The article may have too much focus on the AIT controversy, but this is again not a reason for an AFD.<br />
The topic itself is notable, the biases in Colonial Indology on the one side, and the allgegations of biases in contemporary Indology have all been the subject of much criticism, and there should be a aricle where this can be described. It doesn't look good to claim that it is "unsalvageably biased", either one is able to add his own viewpoint to an article, or one is not. --<a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESendrin_eca1.html" title="User:Sendrin">Sendrin</a> 19:22, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The external may be trash, and many of those can be deleted. However, the references (the ones that leaded me to believe the article was well referenced) and further reading sections are well documented. While it is true I don't know what kind of references they are (if they are notable books, if those books do exist, etc), I can only <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> until someone gives me links to notable sites that explicitely state those books do not exist or they do but are of little importance. The further reading section has entries to Yvette Rosser blog. A very quick google search turns out that <i>She is the co-creator and sponsor of the International Day without Violence, held annually on April 4th</i> <a href="http://www.dharmaconference.org/Rosser.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dharmaconference.org/Rosser.htm" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> That sounds like something notable enough for me. Even if you remove all the external links, the article continues to be well referenced. If you can probe those references are fake, I may change my vote. But, as I said, all I can do is assume good faith. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 12:27, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>True, we need to assume good faith. However note that most of the points that use the reputable books as references are about past Indologists including Mill - in which case the argument is more apprpriately (and already) covered in <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postcolonialism.html" title="Postcolonialism">postcolonialism</a>. The 'current' section uses opinion websites and the Yvette Rosser 'book'- which as you point out is actually a blog as well. A cursory google search of Yvette Rosser informs me that she had an accident in 2003; all her medical costs were paid by the radical <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a> organisation the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishwa_Hindu_Parishad_cb6f.html" title="Vishwa Hindu Parishad">Vishwa Hindu Parishad</a>. That is not an unbiased scholar. The 'Further Reading' section is simply a list of some of the classics of Indology without any connection to the supposed bias in their subject matter; along with some of the classics of postcolonial work - Sheldon Pollock for example, again without explanation - and of apologist writers such as Rosser and the Belgian Koenraad Elst, who writes on hindudharma.org, another parochial site. Nothing is fake; but the article is not structured in good faith, as the claims are not referenced, and the reading list is bolstered by reputable books that do not support the argument,and the specific references are from doubtful, non-peer reviewed sources. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 13:35, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your information on Rosser is taken from indiatruth.com, a political ("to put it as nicely as possible") website founded by Michael Witzel (as he admits in his OutlookIndia.com article) that describes Hindus as "Nazi", "Hitler", "Racist", "Muslim hater", "Race Traitor", "Christian hater", "Creationist", and "obscurantist murders" and of being Hiina (or lost and confused). That is not an unbiased website from an unbiased scholar. Rosser is also founder of The Global Pashtun Institute for Peace and Democracy which aims to Support and strengthen peace, democracy and stability in Afghanistan and to Improve human rights situation among Pashtuns. Rosser has been known to criticize Hindu nationalists as well, but what makes her different that her criticism is fair and not stereotypical. The Rosser link is not a blog, it is an article hosted on sulekha.com. Have you been on the hindudharma.com website that you cite above? There's nothing on this site! I admit that the article needs to be improved, and the article title maybe changed. I think however that enough could be written already only on Max Müller and James Mills, where also exagerrations or unfair potrayals and counter-bias can be discussed. --<a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESendrin_eca1.html" title="User:Sendrin">Sendrin</a> 14:39, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please try to keep up. My information about this Rosser, whatever she may have 'founded' that exists on paper or not, is simply that she is not an unbiased scholar; you claimed I discovered her links to the radical rightwing VHP through some attack site. I did not. It is available online - on the VHP's own site, where they call her <a href="http://www.vhp-america.org/dynamic/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=32" class="external text" title="http://www.vhp-america.org/dynamic/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=32" rel="nofollow">Ram Rani</a> for some reason. The Rosser link is an opinion piece, unverified, without peer review, and not published by a known publishing house. These are the points that I made originally, and nothing you have said contradicts that. If you wish to discuss only Max Mueller and this mysterious James Mills, you can do so in the appropriate article pages for them, without claiming any form of overarching narrative that is distinct from the arguments already covered in postcolonialism. And we are discussing the dubious merits of this article, not of Mike Witzel, so that entire discussion is irrelevant.<a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 15:28, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If some of the sources are not reliable, this should be discussed on the article talk page: <a href="../../../b/i/a/Talk%7EBias_in_South_Asian_Studies_127d.html" title="Talk:Bias in South Asian Studies">Talk:Bias_in_South_Asian_Studies</a>. However, many references are not websites/forums... as you say incorrectly, and books and studies have been written on some aspects of this like Chakrabartis "colonial indology", Trautmanns "Aryans and british india", Dirks "castes of mind", and more. But some of the references should be better. You say that your information is not from indiatruth.com, but you do the same thing as that site: you only bring up one rather negative (but minor) aspect about her and dismiss all her humanitary work for Afghanistan, Pashtuns, the Syed Committee, the Peace Day.. And nothing is mysterious about James Mills if you would take the time to read the article. Nothing is wrong is with the further reading section, or please say which book does not belong there.</dd>
<dd>I understand some (not all) of the arguments that the article should better be merged into Indology, or at least until there is more material. A problem is that the Indology/South Asian Studies article is a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stub.html" title="Stub">stub</a>, and the criticism section would IMO overwhelm that article. (Which is unfair to Indology, the criticism is an important part, but as long as Indology is a stub that section would overwhelm the rest). Because of this a separate criticism article would be the better solution, as it is done for many other pages. Wikipedia has articles on criticism of scientology, islam, many smaller sects and about many other things, so another criticism article is not a big deal. Maybe a better article title would be Criticisms of South Asian Studies. --<a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESendrin_eca1.html" title="User:Sendrin">Sendrin</a> 21:25, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fact that none of the sources are reliable goes towards establishing the fact that this is an unreconstructably POV-fork. The only references that are used for making the argument are online forums or opinion blogs. The other references you cite are either massive minority opinions or not quoted. Second, my opinion on the Yvette person was about her reliability as a source for this article. She has been funded by the VHP, which has a specific agenda here, and so she is not a reliable source. Whatever she may have done for the Pashtuns is thus irrelevant. JAmes Mills being mysterious was an attempted joke, as it should be James Mill. And I cant understand a criticisms article being written in the absence of information about what is being criticised. Under such circumstances the article can never attempt to be either enclyclopaedic or NPOV.

<dd>You are again wrongly saying that all sources are unreliable, while the article cites primary sources like Mill and Macaulay, and authorities like Trautmann. (and many more could be quoted). Your remarks make me think you're either not familiar with the topic or dishonest. And for example Michael Moore is biased, as is George W. Bush, but both can be quoted in an appropriate context. It is for example possible to quote Michael Moore on Bush, if it is clear that it is Moore's opinion. You claim Rosser is biased, but have you read her work? Michael Witzel, who has also published in Marxist magazines (not that I care about that) is anyway if anything more biased, and he has had many criticisms, alleging racism, chauvinism and other things. All this has not to do with the AFD and belongs to the talk page, the opinion stated by her could also be written from other sources, as she is not the only one who criticized some aspects of South Asian Studies. In many other articles the criticism section is a separate article, and this might make sense here too. But maybe the article should first evolve into a bigger text before. --<a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESendrin_eca1.html" title="User:Sendrin">Sendrin</a> 18:46, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>About the first section. OK, you have made your point about Trautmann being an authority. Nevertheless, to claim that (a) there is a systemic bias (b) that it is anti-Hindu and (c) that it was universal is absurd. 1. The criticisms of Indian culture were not restricted to Europeans - consider Derozio. 2. The people criticised are either historians - Mill - or generalists - Marx - or definitely not 'indologists - Macaulay. 3. The people being criticised for bias are those who were criticising the indologists! Grant attacking the 'orientalists'! The whole section is utter nonsense dressed up with footnotes. It cant be salvaged, has no place in the absence of an article on Indology, and must be deleted.</dd>
<dd>About the second section. I have spent a little time reading Rosser. She is absurdly biased. Further, I have got in touch with some people at UT Austin, where she was a grad student, and I discovered that in the well-regarded South Asian programme she was not permitted to finish her PhD and had to go on to submit it in the department of curriculum and instruction. (it was about the revising of textbooks by bjp state govts.) That is not an academically acceptable source. Further, you miss the point that all i needed to know was that she was funded by the vhp to make the determination that she was not an independent source either! Next! Witzel has tenure at Harvard, just had dinner with the President of India last month. Yet we have an article criticising his work before we have an article on the work itself! The rest of the section is similarly one-dimensional in both effect and intent and, indeed, structure. <i>It is unsalvageable</i>. If someone were to put this content on the Doniger and Witzel pages, then I would not demand their deletion, but leave it to be edited to NPOV status. Here the page itself can not be made NPOV, because, as nominated, it is an <i>ab-initio</i> pov-fest, completely one-sided, unsalvageably biased and unencyclopedic. Salvage the content, if you will. Move it elsewhere, to the appropriate article. But this article should only exist once the main article is written, and if criticisms of the theory tend to overwhelm that page. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 04:41, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't claime it was universal, however it exists. A historian like James Mill can be included into South Asian Studies, and the article is a stub, a lot could be written about Indologists, not only Max Müller. I haven't read much Rosser, but from one text I read I saw that she criticized/mentioned several pov's, not just one single one. Many people claim that Witzel is absurdely biased, and in any case Witzel rather only criticizes one side of pov and doesn't unbiasedly mention several pov's, his "interpretations" are often rather biased. Who is an independent source? Witzel publishes in Marxist magazines like Frontline and he has associated with Marxist historians, the president of Harvard Mr. Summers makes biased comments, and so on. The question is not wether someone is biased or not, but if a statement is presented as opinion or fact. The opinion exists as a fact, wether the opinion is biased itself is another thing and can then also be pointed out. This issued would belong to the talk page. Where is your source about Witzel's dinner from? From Indiatruth.com? As already stated, many articles have a separate criticims article, and in the Indology/South Asian Studies page criticisms of the theory tend to overwhelm that page. But I agree with your last sentence. It might be better if the text first evolves into a longer more detailled text before making it separate. --<a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESendrin_eca1.html" title="User:Sendrin">Sendrin</a> 17:45, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>From what I read of Rosser online, she criticised from a single POV. And you still havent responded to my points that she is not a reliable source. About Witzel, I dont know if he can be called biased, but I do know that Frontline is one of India's leading magazines and is not a sign of being an unreliable source any more than being published in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Spectator_0701.html" title="The Spectator">the Spectator</a> is, although the editorial board of the first is as marxist as the editorial board of the second is Tory. My source for Witzel's dinner is the harvard gazette, not indiatruth.com (to which I have never been.) We can leave the discussion here, since it is going nowhere.</dd>
<dd>However, it seems we have some form of consensus: it is too soon for this page. I would like to see the content saved, perhaps on the Indology talk page, so it can be edited and incorportated as the latter article grows. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 12:00, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, Bias in South Asian Studies is a major and hot topic, especially with the "natives" standing up for their versions of the story. One more step in making public/democratic the problems associated with South Asian Scholarship. Tarring folks as "Hindu nationalists" won't hide the serious issues involved. Of course the article should be more nuanced, but the underlying theme is spot on. Someone here called Yvette Roser "biased", I don't think there is such a thing as a scholar without a take. Objectivity in the Humanities is a debatable proposition. Let us keep the stub and hear all sides of the story. Witzel eating with the President of India in no way puts his work above scrutiny. The comments earlier about wikipedia protecting European "scholarship" from rational critiques is well made and relevant.Varahamihira 05:49, 14 May 2006 (UTC) <small><i>— Note: very new user, see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Varahamihira_14a5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Varahamihira">Special:Contributions/Varahamihira</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.165.161.115_ef02.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.165.161.115">Special:Contributions/24.165.161.115</a>. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 09:24, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</i></small></li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> but not per nom. ("<a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Rim_7202.html" title="Pacific Rim">Pacific Rim</a>" is a proper and non-POV name!) As the original prodder (this is a contested prod), I contend that this article will be better replaced with a category, since all it does is to list the capital cities, then copy the description over verbatim (see the "[1]" dangling from Singapore listing!) from the respective city articles. I had already partly populated the replacement category Category:Pacific Rim capitals when this article was de-prodded. Therefore suggest deletion as duplicate of now-existing category. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimchi.sg_9ead.html" title="User talk:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kimchi.sg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kimchi.sg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">sg</a> 18:05, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the oven article does not point out that a "baking oven" is designed for food preparation, and links to a couple of other special oven articles.

<dd>You can't ask for nomination withdrawal - only the nominator can do that. As for the various bits that you say the oven article doesn't cover - that is why merge has been commonly proposed. That way the information will be saved, but it will stop two articles on near identical subjects growing beside each other, confusing the end reader and splitting the collaborative power in half. <a href="../../../s/f/c/User%7ESFC9394_9d0f.html" title="User:SFC9394">SFC9394</a> 10:19, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The assertion that the article <a href="../../../o/v/e/Oven.html" title="Oven">Oven</a> does not mention food preparation is nonsense. In the very first sentence it says "An oven is an enclosed compartment for heating, baking or drying," and most of the content of the article describes food preparation. The major subhead is entitled "Cooking". It is true that the article is not a particularly good one, but that's why it has an expand tag. A "baking oven" is not a separate type of oven in the same sense that a "microwave oven" or a "dutch oven" is. <a href="../../../f/n/a/User%7EFnarf999_8dfc.html" title="User:Fnarf999">Fnarf999</a> 16:20, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Right, i do not insist to keep it, just it does not bug much (it is NPOV). I missed the oven article spelling the difference between industrial furnace, baking oven (for food), and well, they are also into funeral business, wikipedia is not censored not to scare minors. All that gets too much for the oven article, or it gets something like <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformer.html" title="Transformer">transformer</a>. This one is not even complete, and definetively will require a split up some day. Nothing wrong with including a few pictures, disk space has become affordable recently. <i>Consider this, and generally articles may expand quickly</i>, and split-up makes sense sometimes.<br />
By the way i browsed other deletion proposals. Probably it makes a difference <i>who</i> suggested it for Afd. If it is not myself, i am entitled (by sampling other deletions) to make defending comments. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkidd_dublin_1e95.html" title="User:Akidd dublin">User:Akidd_dublin</a> 9 may 2006
<dl>
<dd>For subjects so similar it makes more sense to have one article. As the sections within the article grow and expand then at some point the decision may be taken to split them up for easier digestion by end readers. If you wish to add more about baking ovens then go ahead and add relevant content to the oven article - then in time it may make sense to give it its own article. You are - of course - fully entitled to make defending comments for this deletion nomination, and I am glad to see that you have. <a href="../../../s/f/c/User%7ESFC9394_9d0f.html" title="User:SFC9394">SFC9394</a> 22:01, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"For anyone steeped in old-media thinking, evidence that the on-line encyclopedia Wikipedia is an unreliable source can be found in a Vancouver publisher's entry about himself.</p>
<p>Kevin Potvin writes and publishes a weekly print tabloid called The Republic of East Vancouver, full of inflammatory opinion pieces reminiscent of the ideological rants of 18th-century pamphleteers. It claims a circulation of 6,000. Yet, according to Wikipedia, Mr. Potvin is a colossus.</p>
<p>The entry says that “some hail Potvin as the latest and best resource for fair investigative reporting and independent media campaigns for truth and accountability.” It also reports that his “work has appeared in Harper's and The Atlantic Monthly.”</p>
<p>Now for a fact check. According to Harper's magazine, Mr. Potvin had a letter to the editor printed once, in November of 1992. The Atlantic could find no record of Mr. Potvin — he says he wrote “a substantial letter to the editor” in 1987, but the magazine does not archive letters.

<dd>Although I've voted keep (below), simply because this person writes regularly for a publication with a print run of 6000 or whatever, it <i>is</i> embarrassing to Wikipedia that the article referred to his "work" as having appeared in certain high-profile magazines. As someone who has done a fair bit of professional writing, editing, blah blah, myself, I would definitely interpret that as referring to paid articles, not contributions to letters columns. There is a huge difference, even if one or both of these letters were rather long. If this article survives AfD I hope it is kept accurate in future. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 14:18, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't want the article deleted just because of the Globe article. There are plenty questionable articles out there, and often we try to improve them instead of simply deleting them.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Bad example. <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_Paul_eace.html" title="Pope John Paul">Pope John Paul</a> is a disambiguation page that leads to two different people. Similarly, <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalai_Lama_3904.html" title="Dalai Lama">Dalai Lama</a> refers to 14 different people, just as <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a> refers to dozens. As for the current fight, it is not part of a "Wikipedia bias".

<dd><b>Comment</b> Good example. Correct it leads to two individuals one being Pope John Paul 1 and Pope John Paul 2 and there are mentions of 23 and 6. ALL still listed under their title and not their birthname. 'Bias' that appears on Wikipedia is 'Wikipedia bias' because it is a free encyclopedia, my dear. So an ongoing fight between people who dislike and like a person is not connected to bias or POV, is it? Look Beyond and See the Light...Hari OM217.34.121.233 19:48, 8 May 2006 (UTC)Shaninath</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> That is a content dispute, not a dispute regarding the present issue - what is the appropriate article for this subject. Paramhansa Yogananda, Sri Yukteswar, Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, etc etc are all under their titles, not their birth names. The only example Hanuman Das is bringing up is Tenzin Gyatso - the 14th Dalai lama. But the Dalai Lama is a title that is handed down through the generations to different people, so it makes sense to put his biography under his given name rather than a generalized title. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamsacharya_dan_6820.html" title="User:Hamsacharya dan">Hamsacharya dan</a> 07:59, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>The precursor to this game, Virtual Producer, was featured in Entertainment Weekly a number of years ago. Although it doesn't have a large traffic rating, this is not the only criteria the game should be judged on.

<li><b>Comment</b>The article was written in response to many requests I have fielded from presons outside of the Chicago area who have shown interest in this particular ad campaign, because it is linked to a notable, and historic sporting event (or in this case, season). While this was my first such contribution, I find Fan-1967's rather biased opinion rude and uncultured. If you believe that this is not worth an article, so be it, but I cannot believe that the management approves of such uncouth and unwarranted insults directed toward patrons and non-discriminatory content.

<li><b>Comment</b>For the record, the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurtwood_Smith_67ea.html" title="Kurtwood Smith">Kurtwood Smith</a> comment sounded a bit opinionated. If it is the judgement of he powers that be that this is too local, or too "local" to be of interest, then feel free to delete it. Considering some of the articles (as an example, I have seen articles for high schools that are hardly more researched than this, and far more local in flavor, as well as local entertainment personalities , that, at least IMO, would be far more worthy of deletion than this...though that's not my call to make.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm sorry you found the comment offensive, though I'm still puzzled at what bothers you. I thought it was a moderately well-done set of ads, and his reading of the lines made the radio commercials enjoyable.

<dd><strike>I wouldn't mind making it a category, but.. Let's discuss first. There are manga-only titles that have audio dramas. There are also a handfull of dramas and the like that are audio drama. Give it a neutral name and if someone wants a list of all anime audio dramas we can point them to category math. Also, the list is so puny. There are possibly hundreds of titles not on the list. =) There are a few other lists like this out there that could use similar converstion to categories.

<dd>The problem with an "anime and manga" style category is that there are Audio Dramas made of new material to promote seiyu. There are seires of audio dramas that have no anime or manga or "light novel" basis (most of these are yaoi/hentai titles.) There are audio dramas based off of TV dramas. There are video game audio dramas for games that have no anime or manga. There are even one or two titles released as audio dramas that have spawned anime and manga.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, After researching this a bit more, I have changed my mind. We have very very few (I can only think of one) articles are dedicated to audio drama for a specific series. Anime and manga article rarely mention audio dramas (even in the Japanese WP.)</dd>
<dd>Audio dramas are basically a by-product of the <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seiyu.html" title="Seiyu">seiyu</a> industry in Japan. (Which is not present in the west.) They're also expensive to purhcase for most fans (around 3,000¥ per disc.) Also, spoken dialogue is harder to translate for most fans. This leads to very very poor coverage in the west. (<a href="../../../s/a/k/Sakura_Taisen_6652.html" title="Sakura Taisen">Sakura Taisen</a>, for example, has released 23 radio drama CDs, not a single one mentioned in the article.) So... I think that we should list the full articles based on audio dramas in <a href="../../../r/a/d/Category%7ERadio_drama_8aa3.html" title="Category:Radio drama">Category:Radio drama</a> and leave the rest alone until the (unlikely) day when the wiki attains have better coverage of audio dramas in modern Japanese society. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 17:56, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> He is certainly well-known for his work with Ibogaine as well as organizing a world-wide Marijuana Mass Movement in many, many cities that never had one, documenting evidence can be found in many of the 17 300 hits that Google comes up with under his name. The article really does need to be cleaned up, however. Somehow the entry for "Counterculture", for instance, manages to sound decidedly encyclopedic, for instance. This entry could too. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.195.84.41 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.195.84.41_a23a.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.195.84.41">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Dana Beal is notable, the problem is AJWeberman seems to have written most of the entry in first person prose and not one of the assertions or statements made are backed up with a single reference. I don't know if there is a third option to keep or delete, but I'd pick delete and replace with something coherent that uses some refs. Delete unless cleaned up is a great choice, but reading the comments, the problem is who is going to clean it up. I would take a stab at it, except I know about Beal sideways through where the Yippies intersect with the hacker underground and unlike the hacker underground which can be researched online with links to non-internet reference material, almost everything I can find about Beal is not a "real world" ref or scan of same. Almost all of it loads pages that use html like pink letters on green backgrounds and instead of finding a NY Times reference, you find old hippies ranting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep, delete, delete unless cleaned up, notable but incoherent? I guess I stick with keep. Could somebody like AJWeberman who understands all this clean it up a little? Weberman's entry is great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.J._Weberman" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.J._Weberman" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. <a href="../../../6/a/k/User%7E6Akira7_0f7b.html" title="User:6Akira7">6Akira7</a> 14:01, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If newbie observations are not welcome on an AfD, ignore my comments. If I violate any rules or etiquette, please let me know. Most of Lorrey’s “notability” appears to be self generated. It appears he wrote both the Wiki article and the blog it is based on, sort of referencing himself, as opposed to referencing credible published articles by unbiased writers.</p>
