<p>Album by someone from a notable band, but distributed only over Myspace.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> article was previously nom'ed for speedy, and deleted as non notable.

<dd>Actually, that speedy criteria only applies if the article went through a full AFD. If the article was deletion by speedy deletion or by proposed deletion it cannot be deleted as reposted material. In the future it would be better to tag it for the reason the article was speedied in the first place because that would have a betetr chance of success. --My old username 03:16, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Question</b> I really don't understand how this article is blatant spam, other than the fact that it's about something one could conceivably purchase. Which would make an untold number of articles on albums, cars, hamburgers, etc. spam as well. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 21:21, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I was the one who speedied this first, but the claim to A7 is not strong on second look. It's an album article, not mainly on the musician or group. The musician was (is?) from a notable band. <a href="../../../a/w/y/User%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3b01.html" title="User:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh</a> 06:41, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Article adheres to notability outlines and in no way fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a>. The repost was an accedent on my part and I take full respocibility. <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Armstrong_4cb7.html" title="Tim Armstrong">Tim Armstrong</a> is a notable, and arguabley the most influencial musician in modern <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk rock</a> history. Although, the album is a virtual record, it is a record none the less. The album has a predetermined number of tracks, and possibly a predetermined order, which is as of yet unknown. This article's story, and the album is still unfolding, and it remains to be seen if the album will only be available online. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorthlessboy1420_e8ed.html" title="User:Worthlessboy1420">Worthlessboy1420</a> (Article creator) 02:45, 30 August 2006</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> for starters, the album will NOT be distributed only through MySpace, that's just where the information came from. Epitaph Records' website <a href="http://epitaph.com/artists/album/500/" class="external text" title="http://epitaph.com/artists/album/500/" rel="nofollow">has an entry for the album</a>, and you can download a song there. <a href="../../../j/o/l/User%7EJoltman_f40c.html" title="User:Joltman">Joltman</a> 12:52, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> - Separate album (assuming it is new/different material, not just a re-release) by a notable artist. Weak keep due to freeness and lack of secondary sources at the moment. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 14:22, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Please don't have this deleted. It's still an album being distributed by epitaph.com, not just through Myspace. This article is good and so is the first song off the album. Keep it.</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Armstrong_4cb7.html" title="Tim Armstrong">Tim Armstrong</a> and the bands he's been in <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Ivy_%28band%29_a2ff.html" title="Operation Ivy (band)">Operation Ivy (band)</a> <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rancid.html" title="Rancid">Rancid</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transplants.html" title="Transplants">Transplants</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance_Hall_Crashers_d8c0.html" title="Dance Hall Crashers">Dance Hall Crashers</a> are all quite famous in the ska/punk scene. Op Ivy gets 965,000 Ghits and if you check [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Operation_Ivy_%28band%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Operation_Ivy_%28band%29" rel="nofollow">here</a>] you'll see that information about this band is linked to from several articles about this period and its music. I may be showing my age here, but seriously -- Op Ivy and Rancid were <i>huge</i> in the late 80's early 90's alternative music scene. And, as others have stated, the "distributed over Myspace" in the nom was based on a misread. I think a new solo album by a member of several notable bands is in no danger of violating of WP:MUSIC. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 21:18, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, or failing that merge. I think we can all agree that <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Armstrong_4cb7.html" title="Tim Armstrong">Tim Armstrong</a> is notable, and bear in mind the following from <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>: "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such." -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 04:09, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> based solely on the notability of the performer if nothing else. A lot of artists are self-releasing music or doing so in "non-traditional" forms. Just because it's being issued solely through MySpace, or a personal website, or iTunes can no longer be used as criteria for disqualifying such releases, I'm afraid. It's 2006. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:02, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I have reopened this debate because it did not meet the speedy keep criteria (still one delete vote). <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 20:21, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, album does not exist yet, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a crystal ball. If you want, merge to the only song on the album that exists so far, and make a full article later. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 20:29, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. He's notable, album seems to be new songs coming out by the month, I don't think WP:NOT:crystal ball applies. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 20:45, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article could be better (e.g. sourced), but albums from notable artists are generally notable, and I do not want to delete simply because the album is being distributed through non-customary channels.-- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanntm_9b62.html" title="User:Danntm">danntm</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanntm_6305.html" title="User talk:Danntm">T</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danntm_aafb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danntm">C</a></sub> 02:18, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, albums by Tim Armstrong are always noteworthy, not a speedy candidate. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:57, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Tim Armstrong doing something off the wall again, what a surprise. He's never gotten scads of mainstream media coverage, but it would be nice to get some references outside Epitaph.
