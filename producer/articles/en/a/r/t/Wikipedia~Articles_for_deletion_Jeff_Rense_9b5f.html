<dd>I listed many articles for deletion today and not all of them may be found on his userpage. As I stated earlier in another discussion, I go with what the article gives me. If it violates, WP:NN, WP:NOR, WP:CITE, I nominate it. I don't rely on outside resources, just what's in the article. If it's not encyclopedic and if that fact isn't supported by references, citations, and firm research then it's junk. I'm sorry if that upsets you but there's nothing I can do about that. It's not against Wikipedia's standards to have high standards for an encyclopedia. Wiki itself promotes the use of good, sound research in its articles. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 03:01, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The line between vote and discussion here is opaque. Those two guidelines weigh in with regards to standards that all articles should strive to adhere to, if necessary by incremental improvements, or preferably by sweeping clean-ups. Deleting substandard articles wantonly however I find discouraging and demoralizing and a poor excuse for not finding better methods to influence the quality of the project. Proposing deletion likewise, however to a lesser degree. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 14:37, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I will note the idea of proposing deletion to a lesser degree although it's not like I commonly put of so many AfD's at once. They are typically spaced out over a greater period. I will also consider any demoralizing impact that AfD's may have although I believe that they serve to create impetus for the initial designing of better articles. Wikipedia is a majorly used source for the common public and poorly researched articles on Wikipedia for any amount of time risks severely contributing to disinformation. Articles should be created after research while being improved upon and expanded over time. Anyway, if you wish to continue discussion about the nature of AfD's we should do so on my user talk page and not in the AfD discussion about this article. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 14:49, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Could the proposed removal of the Jeff Rense article be linked with the proposal to remove the "What Really Happened" entry? Both are conspiracy web pages. This proposal stinks and does infact give more credence to Rivero and Renses web sites.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 194.200.29.108 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_194.200.29.108_e4b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/194.200.29.108">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Rense is certainly one of the foremost conspiracy/UFO people in the world and that alone should warrant this article to escape deletion. Also, Rense is a very controversial individual and there is no doubt that this has won him much fame/notoriety.</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Jeff Rense is a talk-show host distributed by <a href="http://www.gcnlive.com" class="external free" title="http://www.gcnlive.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gcnlive.com</a> including archives. This meets the following test: "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person". I consider Jeff Rense passing this alternative test as well: "Google Test -- Does the subject get lots of distinguishable hits on Google or another well known search mechanism?" This AfD fits with my overall sense that a growing number of Wikipedians are interested in destroying Wikipedia content more than they are interested in writing new content. Rather than debating how to write a good Jeff Rense article, we are debating how best to destroy it. I find it very telling that <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisonplanet.com.html" title="Prisonplanet.com">Prisonplanet.com</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Rense_351f.html" title="Jeff Rense">Jeff Rense</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infowars.com.html" title="Infowars.com">Infowars.com</a>, and What Really Happened are all the same political movement and all up for deletion at the same time.

<li><b>Delete</b> have to agree with Strotha on this one. Article has inaccuracies (eg. Rense doesn't live in Santa Barbara and he has two brothers not one), also contains non-neutral POV (eg. "popular", "famous"). I read through <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and he does not fit any of the main criteria for inclusion in Wiki. Nor does the article contain "a good deal of verifiable information". Where are the sources? And I would have to disagree that he passes the Google Test. The Google hits he gets are NOT about RENSE. Can anyone give some links where we may read information about Rense himself? Or perhaps an interview in which HE is the subject of the interview? DanHSmith</li>
