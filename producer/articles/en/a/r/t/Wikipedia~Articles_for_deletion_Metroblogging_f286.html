<p>I believe this article is just vanity material. Almost all of <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Bonner_8bfa.html" title="User:Sean Bonner">User:Sean Bonner</a>'s contributions (under his name and IPs) appear to take the form of advocating himself, or his sites by inserting links to his name or externals to the blogs he runs. In the vast majority of cases editors have simply removed his additions without paying attention to the systematic nature of his changes. Because of the nature of interlinking blogs, I feel I am not qualified to judge the merit of this article (I can't gauge the site's popularity because its linkspammed all over the internet), but Sean's pattern of self promotion make me strongly suspect that this article is just more vanity material. <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 02:19, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, first off, let me say that I'm a friend of Sean's and write for a Metroblogging site, just to be up front about it. I think that a good argument can be made that Sean hasn't added this for vanity reasons since he doesn't even have a page about himself on Wikipedia. I also think that various Metroblogging sites have become sources for up to the minute news during some disasters. The current devastation in New Orleans from Hurricane Katrina and the two attacks on London's subway system are good examples. They are sites that are linked to and quoted from major publications and some of the biggest sites on the web. The page needs improvement, but it is defiantly Wikipedia worthy.--<a href="../../../g/m/h/User%7EGMHenninger_3c6c.html" title="User:GMHenninger">Grant</a> 19:14, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> nn website, vanity. Alexa ranking is nowhere near what <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> wants. Having a blog is about as notable as having a goldfish.

<li><b>KEEP</b> Metroblogging is notable. It's a large community that spans many hundreds of authors across the world. They cover most of the major cities in the western world.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article appears (mostly) verifiable and NPOV. The participation of notable bloggers speaks for the notability of the network. Mr. Bonner's appeal to the "blogosphere" does not appear to be in bad faith. New users are to be treated with civility and their comments considered, even if their votes are not tallied (per VfD precedent). <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 23:40, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - Blogging, the most overrated thing ever, now everyone has their 15 minutes of fame, from other bloggers who read yours, it's like your opinion is important!. At least Sean Bonner actually cares about this entry, unlike that Cyrus guy, who keeps on claiming he doesn't care, yet constantly blogging about it all the time. But if it really has had the international attention like the article says, it's probably worth keeping. But remove the links to individual blogs, and just link to metablogging. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 00:57, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. If there is to be any debate it should be on why we are wasting our time on Wikipedia, which allows anyone to goof up your words rather than on Metroblogging. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ospheric (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ospheric_5edd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ospheric">contribs</a>) 22:09, 30 August 2005 (UTC).</small></li>
