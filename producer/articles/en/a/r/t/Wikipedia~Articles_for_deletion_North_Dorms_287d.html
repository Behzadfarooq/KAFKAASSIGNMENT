<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>: First, there are multiple copyright violations on the page. The template on the upper right contains an image that is a copyright violation. Much of the texts of the article are direct or very near direct copy/paste work from <a href="http://www.lasalle.edu/admiss/dorms_albert.php?sect=fresh" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lasalle.edu/admiss/dorms_albert.php?sect=fresh" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and other halls in the list on the left of that page. Second, from <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_bad_article_ideas_6658.html" title="Wikipedia:List of bad article ideas">Wikipedia:List of bad article ideas</a> "Please think twice before creating an article about any of the following: ...Your dormitory (unless it's on the Historic Register)". There is nothing remarkable about this dormitory that is highlighted by the article. The creator of the article has been asking for time to flesh out this article (and a number of other articles from the La Salle University Campus). The inception of this article was a week ago. That's enough time. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 12:16, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I admit that while I did generate the article a week ago, I really haven't worked on it until yesterday. I would like more time to complete it.</li>
<li>Also, the picture <i>was</i> a copyright violation (I'm fairly new in regards to pictures, sorry), but it has been removed and hopefully I'll put a new (legal) one up soon.</li>
<li>This article was certainly <b>not</b> copy/pasted. I did take information from the site Durin mentions, but those are the facts of the structure. You can't do anything about that.</li>
<li>There is precedence for this article, as many universities have buildings listed on Wikipedia. I understand that doesn't necessarily make it right, but it's at least of note. Ther are <b>a lot</b> of residence halls on this site.</li>
<li>I have already received some feedback in support of others on my talk page. Durin HIMSELF actually noted previously (and I think this is an important point), "My own personal take is that if we can have articles on obscure <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html" title="Pokémon">Pokémon</a> characters, certainly it is worthwhile to have articles on buildings where literally thousands of people have lived over the years, such as residence halls." <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">user:Uppland</a> added "I have nothing against good articles about buildings at your campus provided they are of some historical or architectural interest".</li>
<li>What Durin is not grasping, in his move to make this an AFD, is that to students, alumni, and prospective students, this complex is very important and has a long history. Even more importantly, people involved (or who want to be involved) with these buildings can <b>find this information extremely helpful and relevant</b>. Just because individuals outside the univeristy/city don't <i>KNOW</i> of the building, doesn't mean that it isn't notable or important.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>In general, there are a lot worse articles online than this one, and this is notable and informative for many people Lasallefan 12:56, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>I do not like being misquoted</b>. I did <b>not</b> write "I have nothing against good articles about buildings at your campus provided they are informative" What I <i>did</i> write was: "I have nothing against good articles about buildings at your campus, <i>provided they are of some historical or architectural interest</i>".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lasallefan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65774845" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lasallefan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65774845" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> What you left out makes all the difference. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 13:51, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>COMMENT</b>You are also misinterpreting me. I am not asserting that <i>since</i> we have article on minor Pokémon characters, we can have articles on non-notable residence halls. I don't think we should have individual articles on minor Pokémon characters either. This also goes to what you mentioned above; the mere presence of other articles on Wikipedia of similar nature or of articles with subjectively less importance does not grant status to the existence of another article in a similar vein.</li>
<li>Further, you can state facts about a place, but you are not permitted to use direct verbiage from a copyright holder to represent those facts. Taking the St. Albert Hall element of the article we're discussing, I'll bold all text that is a direct copy of <a href="http://www.lasalle.edu/admiss/dorms_albert.php?sect=fresh" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lasalle.edu/admiss/dorms_albert.php?sect=fresh" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>:</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: some of the above was corrected, but I put back in the removed comments for clarity.

Yes, the existance of buildings is verifiable to anyone with a phone book, but the mere existance of a thing does not mean it belongs in an encyclopedia. There have been attempts to discuss what would make a particular building notable, but we have no guidelines on this that I'm aware of. If historians or architects heavily write about a particular building, reliable sources demonstrating this should be abundant. In absense of anything like that, delete. Let's let universities do their marketing on their <i>own</i> websites. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:17, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>More comments</b>: As for the "it's important to <i>some</i> people", I heard this exact argument the other day. A woman made an article saying that her husband was the greatest person in the whole world. It was speedy deleted, and she was insulted that someone would say her husband is "not notable"- after all, he's the sweetest, most lovable man in the world. My house, my car, and my dog are all imporant <i>to me</i>, but they're very clearly not suitable subjects for encyclopedia articles. As a general rule, things that are considered "local interest" only are not included. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:31, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>COMMENT</b> Yes but that woman is <i>ONE</i> person were talking about tens-of-thousands of people who have LIVED in this complex, hundreds of thousands who have had direct contact with it, and certainly millions of people who at least know/knew about it.

<ul>
<li>The only evidence that they deemed it notable is if they created and wrote non-trivial published works of their own about it. If this university building is notable, there will be non-trivial works about it that were created and published by someone <i>other</i> than the university. Please cite one or more such works.

<li><b>COMMENT</b> I see what your saying Durin. I will reference, AND completely go back and re-edit each portion of this article (if this article passes on its other merits). But there's too much random talk here...let's get back to the main point of this article here. Let's try to limit comments to "should this article be deleted?". This is a discussion of three people regarding problems that need to be addressed Lasallefan 15:26, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: but rename to La Salle university! Because more than one university has a north dorms. I mentioned this in the discussion page (which has already been deleted, thank you so much). <b>Moderator:</b> As for the paraphrased context and stolen pictures, simply revert these additions that got the article into some scrutiny. I do live in the area and would be more than willing to upload some pictures that are not in violation of any copyright. <b>Lasallefan:</b> why ADD content that is already summarized on other websites? I don't think it's what wikipedia is about, to imitate already existing websites, pictures and text and all. If not illegal, it certainly is not constructive. It serves no purpose. If you rely less on the copy and paste functions, and more on the creative side, your pages will not be deleted. There certainly are unique aspects of north dorms community life that can be explored here. delinodeshields 3:43, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unique aspects of the community? You're saying there are things people who live in this dorm do that nobody does in any other dorm anywhere? I really, seriously doubt it.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I have never thought school buildings, except for rare exceptions, to be notable.

<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable building. Seriously, only 50 years old, no major architectural awards, no well-known cultural references, neither the setting of nor set of any major films, not the subject of any publications... so far as I can see, it's just another dorm.<br />
If there are lots of other articles like this, then they should be deleted too.
