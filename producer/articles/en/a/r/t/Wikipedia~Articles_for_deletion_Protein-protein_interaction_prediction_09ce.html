<li><b>Massively rewrite and cleanup.</b> Tim@, to be honest this looks like a college project or a first attempt at writing a review article for a journal. It's not original research but it is highly inappropriate for Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not <i>Bioinformatics</i>. Articles here should be intended for a general audience. Ideally you would explain in terms a high schooler or college freshman could understand, 1) what are protein-protein interactions, 2) why it is useful to be able to predict them with a computer, and 3) the general principles involved. The only wikipedia article I have ever seen with 150 references was on <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rathergate.html" title="Rathergate">Rathergate</a>, and that because it is so controversial. You should aim for no more than a dozen, preferably review articles from easy to read journals like <i>Current opinions in ______</i>. You also need to review the Manual of Style and become more familiar with writing wiki-like articles. My recommendation is that you voluntarily withdraw the article and copy it into your user space (see <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a>.) User pages are a great way to work on a complex article or figure out how to write a wiki article and they are not subject to (most of) the content guidelines of main article space. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 05:23, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Thatcher131, who didn't vote delete, but I agree with the principles, if that makes sense. Tim, it looks like you have a broad perspective on the literature for a field that isn't covered by Wikipedia well enough. Rather than try to add all your knowledge at once, why don't you start with smaller articles on individual methods? The narrower the topic of an article, the easier it is to avoid original research while tying it together. Once you've built such a foundation, it would be relatively easy to write an article named "Protein-protein interaction prediction" that links to the more specialized methods and draws on only a couple of secondary reviews. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 06:19, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>note:</b> Zargulon the article states that folding docking methods are currently unworkable on a <b>genome wide scale</b> because the best algorithms from CASP are given a month to find one fold. Taking 50,000 months to fold the proteins of a genome and then 2500000000 months for docking (assuming the same time frame for a single prediction) after only 7 days to sequence it is to slow for use.--Tim 02:54, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is not because the CASP experiments give a month that the servers take a month to make a prediction, with the threading techniques a model is built in half an hour to a few hours, this varies with the length of the target sequence and whether homologues are known or not. If there is no known homologues, only <i>ab initio</i> techniques can be used and are restricted to small sequences, although the fragment approach is being developed with promising results. In addition, you are assuming that the genome wide experiment would be done on one machine, whereas this would be a massively parallel work. The servers involved in CASP are often clusters that are able to work on several targets in the same time. The limitations are more from the theoretical point of view, e.g. better potential energy functions, better detection of remote homologues... By the way, I can't find where the article states that folding docking methods are unworkable because of the time used for folding prediction algorithms, there is no mention of CASP either? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlastwizard_4fdf.html" title="User:Blastwizard">Blastwizard</a> 05:48, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am staring at that section of the article, and it does not state what you just said it states. Rather, its implication is that folding and docking <i>will always</i> be unworkable. In fact is so badly written that I cannot begin to suppose what the intended meaning may have been. It also incorrectly categorizes docking and folding as "dynamics methods" - short for molecular dynamics? or dynamic programming? either way it's wrong. Most docking and folding methods do not use either technique. Even if you felt that truly representative literature search was beneath you, how much trouble would it have been to inform yourself by taking a quick look at the Wikipedia articles on protein structure prediction and protein-protein docking? <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 04:19, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They don't. All you did to the docking/folding section was wikify it.. how is that supposed to make it "more clear"? I have already contributed a solution. Deleting the article is an excellent solution, because it will disabuse people of the wrong belief that there is a meaningful entry on protein interaction prediction, so that maybe some people will write one. It is not constructive to take an important page and fill it with gibberish. If you can't do any better, you should wait patiently for someone else to. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 17:55, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well I agree to disagree with you on that point because I believe nothing is ever perfect and everything is a work in progress and should be respected as such until updated with a better version. I believe this article provides at least some hints as to what PPIP is, how it works and how to find more in-depth information on the topic. I can not see that a blank page (however perfectly blank) is better than what information is provided. --Tim 07:37, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article is full of errors, inaccuracies and dreams from the author. <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protein-protein_docking.html" title="Protein-protein docking">Protein-protein docking</a> does not work with predicted models but with structures solved by <a href="../../../x/-/r/X-ray_crystallography.html" title="X-ray crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a>, if the rest of the article is the same type of fantasy, there is a lot of cleaning up. The description of <a href="../../../t/h/r/Threading_%28protein_sequence%29.html" title="Threading (protein sequence)">threading</a> for protein folding prediction is a bit funny. The sequence method described assumes the contiguity of residues involved in interactions, if patterns were to be found. I also object the wrong use of many terms, for example the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Active_site.html" title="Active site">active site</a> is certainly not the site of interaction between two proteins. The best we can do is predict the residues that may be involved in interactions, providing that both the structures are known the rest is pure speculations. So far I don't know anyone who knows about proteins who would venture yet in such a hard problem. What is the point of an article on a method that is unworkable? Wikipedia is not for original research, there are peer reviewed journals for that <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlastwizard_4fdf.html" title="User:Blastwizard">Blastwizard</a> 01:03, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless it undergoes <b>major revisions</b> per Blastwizard. The use of references is rather odd. A lot of the papers seem to be completely unrelated, remove every thing that doesn't relate directly to the text (e.g. the first 3 papers listed). Tim, I think the first thing you want to look at is to make specific citations in the text, to references you think support your claims. I might want to have a look at some of the things I think look sketchy, but I don't want to read 30 papers just to edit this page. I think you have to be careful not to confuse docking of experimentally determined structures with docking of proteins without a known structure. I would be highly critical of results from the latter, so this requires good references! Kjaergaard 06:44, 17 March 2006 (UTC)
