<p>4400 has an individual article for each episode. The articles each contain a single quote from the episode, and a brief summary. The articles contain nothing else but an episode summary.</p>
<p>At worst, the articles are just repeating the 2-line summary from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_4400_episodes_0947.html" title="List of The 4400 episodes">List_of_The_4400_episodes</a> (for example, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Home_Front_%28The_4400_episode%29_ef5e.html" title="The Home Front (The 4400 episode)">The Home Front (The 4400 episode)</a>. All articles for season 3 are like this). At best, the articles contain a scene-by-scene synopsis (which is something that's supposed to be <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">avoided</a>).</p>
<p>They contain nothing about the episode's relevance in the ongoing story arc, nothing about how the episode was received, its impact on popular culture, or any other commentery or real world context. All the broadcasting information can be added to the table at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_4400_episodes_0947.html" title="List of The 4400 episodes">List_of_The_4400_episodes</a>. The summaries there can be expanded a little, or an article could be created for individual seasons when there's actually something to say about them.</p>
<p>We certainly don't need an individual article for each episode if the article is just summarizing what's happening (and there's really nothing else to say about them). <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes</a> does say to create episode articles "<i>Once there's enough independently verifiable information included about individual episodes...</i>" which really isn't the case here.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Could you give an indication for the kind of info and source you would use for any of them (well, perhaps not the pilot, that one should be easier, but some episode in the middle of the series)?

<dd>Unverifiable = criterium for deletion. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> = criterium for deletion. When you remove the plot summary, there is nothing left. IF no one can give me even an indication of what sources can be used to add some kind of external, verifiable information about a specific episode, then this means that there is nothing to fill an article with at the moment. Stating that "each will have enough information" as a reason to keep it is baseless crystal ballism, similar to "my band will one day be famous". Not one of the keep voters have given reasons within the policies as to why the articles as they stand should be kept, and not one has given a shred of evidence that they can be remade according to Wikipedia policy. While "uncomplete" is of course not a reason for deletion, it still is a huge non sequitur from my comment. Please indicate how and where you'll find more out-of-universe info for these articles per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, instead of just stating that they have "good quality content" (which ones?). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 11:45, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, without going back and watching the episode and tracking down additional verifiable information, I have little doubt that it could have a references to other stories section and a trivia section, similar to several of the Doctor Who episodes (e.g., <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Girl_in_the_Fireplace_e30d.html" title="The Girl in the Fireplace">The Girl in the Fireplace</a>). For example -- and I'm making this up, but bear with me -- "This episode marks the first appearance of a 4400 outside of NTAC's direct supervision," or "The pain Lily suffers on her eldest daughter's doorstep foreshadows the attack on her daughter in <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_Fate_Would_Have_It_%28The_4400_episode%29_fa65.html" title="As Fate Would Have It (The 4400 episode)">As Fate Would Have It</a>" or "This is the first episode in which Mickey Mouse appears in the opening credits."</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which you've quoted yourself, states, "Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot." I concur. The solution, however, is not to delete the skeleton onto which this analysis and detail will hang, but rather to flesh out the skeleton and give it life.</dd>
<dd>As for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, I'm not sure what you're getting at here. Could you clarify? <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETravisl_9999.html" title="User:Travisl">Travisl</a> 01:14, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>What I mean with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is the examples you give (and I know you made them up, but you'll get the idea): "The pain Lily suffers on her eldest daughter's doorstep foreshadows the attack on her daughter in <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_Fate_Would_Have_It_%28The_4400_episode%29_fa65.html" title="As Fate Would Have It (The 4400 episode)">As Fate Would Have It</a>": is that an idea you have, fans have on a forum, or is it an idea, an interpretation given in some reliable source (a newspaper, a documentary, ...) as defined in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>? I fear that most of this kind of info would come from not-reliable sources (not meaning that it wouldn't be true!), and thus should not be included in Wikipedia. In the end, if all you have is such info, then you don't have an article, and it should be deleted until such scholarly info is available. Since it seems that not much of such info is available, the best idea seems to me to get an article per season, and delete the individual articles. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 05:28, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What is verifiable in an episode is an interesting subject. As a normal viewer, I am aware of various things the director can do to advance the plot non-verbally. They'll linger on someones eyes, while they have an angry look, to show that person's displeasure over something that was just said, for instance. I think a case could be made that these things are obvious to a normal viewer and therefore verifiable by watching the episode. I can also hear objections to a "normal viewer's" existence. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 05:43, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, that is original research (<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Even if "everybody knows" something, if it isn't written down (or said out loud) in a reliable source (as defined in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, so no primary source), then it isn't acceptable. Again, it is not about truth, but about verifiability. Now, a plot summary is verifiable (look at listings in TV magazines and so on), but an article which is only or even mainly a plot summary is not acceptable either, per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. So in the end, it doesn't matter how many people have an opinion about an episode, or even if they all agree: if no "scholarly studies" (reviews in reliable, reputable magazines, books about the series from an outside perspective, ...) exist, then no article following Wikipedia policies is possible, and they should be deleted (I have no problem with an article about a whole season as a compromise: I don't dispute that the series exists, has been shown in many countries, and has gotten a lot of viewers and so on). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 08:06, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not saying it's 100% <i>impossible</i> that those can turn into decent articles. But just that...given there is currently nothing to say about them except summary, why should we bother to keep the articles around for the off-chance that they may be expanded in the future? I mean...wikipedia has information about tons of TV (including cartoon/anime) series. Does that mean if someone went out and created articles like <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrible_Swift_Sword_%28The_4400_episode%29_e391.html" title="Terrible Swift Sword (The 4400 episode)">this</a> for each and every episode of each of the more popular TV/cartoon/anime shows, we would keep them all? That'd be thousands of articles, many would never be expanded. I mean, i understand this "<i>Generally, articles on episodes of television should not be listed for AfD (unless they are completely unverifiable, original research, etc.)</i>", but the same page also states to create articles for each season (or other logical division) when there's enough <i>independently verifiable information</i> and THEN create articles for each episode "<i>independently verifiable information included about individual episodes</i>". In this case, i'm doubtful there's even enough independently verifiable information for season articles (lenght isn't a concern. Seasons in 4400 are only 13 episodes long, or 6 in the case of season 1), so why give individual episode articles a chance? --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 07:54, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b> - Some of the pages are only a few months old. They seem to be growing quickly.

<dd>On the contrary, AfD is a discussion by arguments intended to reach a consensus, not a vote. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_Deletion_f620.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for Deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for Deletion</a>, section "How to...", which says (first line): "The debate is not a vote; please make recommendations on the course of action to be taken, sustained by arguments." That is why I ask people voting keep to show us some evidence that their arguments are based on something more than wishful thinking. If you can't convince other people that there are for the moment (not in the future) ways to make the articles good enough (with regards to the Wikipedia policies) by providing good sources, then a thousand people can say <i>keep</i> and it still will be worth nothing. When there is discussion if the sources given are good enough, then you can have a no consensus (defaulting to a keep of the article in reality): when there are no arguments for keeping (only "votes" with unsubstantiated claims), then the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 11:42, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes. Wikipedia isn't supposed to be an indiscriminate collection of information. To quote "Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary <i>may</i> be appropriate <i>as an aspect of a larger topic</i>." The problem with these articles is that they often end up being merely episode summaries and nothing more. Once there's enough to say about a TV series beyond the main article, we expand into smaller articles, including articles about plot and seasons. That should come <i>before</i> expanding into individual episodes. There's no point having articles for individual episodes if all they're going to do is repeat a two-line summary from the main episode-list article. If a dedicated fan wished to expand the articles about that TV series, they can start with decent season articles, then expand into episode articles when season articles get too big. Albums are different, because you can't sensibly group them into larger articles. I suppose something like "all albums by X" is sort of possibly, but doesn't seem to work. Where as "season X" instead of many "episode X" articles seems to work fine. --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 12:28, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Let's add all 6409 episodes of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation_Street_d8ea.html" title="Coronation Street">Coronation Street</a>, all 5000 or so episodes of <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsnight.html" title="Newsnight">Newsnight</a> (before someone accuses me of focusing on soaps), and so on... Artists make one album a year (on average), not 26 or 200. Every album by a major artist gets tons of professional reviews: I don't think many episodes of Neighbours have gotten even one professional review or analysis. The Simpsons, to come back to the argument, are one of the most discussed long running TV series ever, and even so, the article referenced (the very first long episode) is after three and a half years still pretty bad (though a lot better than the 4400 episodes we are discussing here). When there is really enough independent, out-of-universe, verifiable material to write articles about any episode, please do so: until then, why bother? Those articles are only describing what you see when you watch such an episode, and aren't giving any insight, and more importantly aren't acting like a tertiary source reproducing and condensing the comments of secondary sources, <i>which is what all Wikipedia articles should do</i>. I don't see a reason why TV episodes would have different rules than all other articles on Wikipedia which are defined by policies. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 12:29, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>(resetting indent) Jeff, do you have any evidence to back up your claim? Because without evidence all it is is your personal hope/opinion. Fram cites evidence to show that the articles do not and currently <b>CAN NOT</b> meet various criteria, your counter-argument rests on the fact that future third-party resources will become available (i.e. "someone will write a review someday").

<dd>I don't have any readily available to present that can be Googled, sure. The problem is twofold - one, as a sci-fi show, it's certainly covered in sci-fi magazines, which can be useful to epxand these if the right editors come along. Secondly, they don't violate WP:V now or do they have to violate WP:V later.

<dd><b>Reply</b>: I don't know where you have heard that "good info doesn't exist for this show", I certainly haven't read that in this AfD. What I (and others) say is that for many individual episodes (e.g. "The New and Improved Carl Morrissey", the one which started all this), there is for the moment not a shred of evidence that there is enough reliable, non-trivial coverage (i.e. reviews, analysis, ...) to write individual articles. I have also explicitly stated that I assumed that an exception could be made for the pilot, as those often do get more attention (although the link you give is not an acceptable one, as this is just a kind of Wiki, the opinion of some reviewer, not a peice written by any journalistic standards or published by a reliable publisher). No one is arguing that we shouldn't write about the show, in fact I think everyone here agreed that an article per season was quite acceptable. You are just using a strawman. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:29, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't have a problem with individual episode articles, provided the information is verifiable. They can be useful. On a related note, though, in examining this I did put <a href="../../../t/h/e/Category%7EThe_4400_7bb1.html" title="Category:The 4400">Category:The 4400</a> up for cfd, since the unique parent category for the show doesn't appear to be necessary, and generally it's a bad idea to have a seperate unique category for individual shows and films. Since this discussion is related, I'd recommend taking a look at the cfd for that category and giving input, one way or another. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:29, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete all</b> These episodes will most likely never contain enough real-life information to ever be considered more than a summary.

<li><b>Keep all</b>. Though I agree that we shouldn't have individual episode articles on every television program out there, Wikipedia should follow the lead of how outside sources are handling it. In the case of shows such as <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost (TV series)</a></i>, there are definitely individual discussions going on about different episodes, and fans routinely refer to the episodes individually, rather than as a grouped set (such as with a soap opera like <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Hospital_da91.html" title="General Hospital">General Hospital</a>). In the case of <i>4400,</i> the show has millions of viewers <a href="http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_6980.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_6980.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and is clearly notable. It has garnered multiple Emmy nominations, survived multiple seasons, and has a substantial fanbase. Further, it appears that the fans discuss not just the show as a gestalt, but individual episodes by name. As such, it makes sense to have a separate article on each episode. However, I will add a caveat, that I do see a difference between <i>current</i> notability, and <i>longterm</i> notability. <i>4400</i> is definitely popular and notable now, but 20 years from now, it may be little more than a footnote. As such, it would make sense to me that Wikipedia learn to adapt to these changing levels of fame, such that a show which does deserve dozens or hundreds of articles today, might in the future (a generation from now?) be better served by merging these articles into a more concise general summary of the entire arc of the show. But for now, while interest is high, I say keep the articles separate and let the information flow. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 21:44, 26 October 2006(UTC)</li>

<dd>This is a weak argument. As others have mentioned above, some articles only exist because they haven't been nominated for deletion. Per [WP:NOT], Wikipedia is not a dumping ground for inormation, and that includes plot summaries <i>that do not reference the episode in the context of the real world.</i> That is, unless these individual episodes have garnered the attenetion of significant third-party sources -- forums and fan bases do not qualify as such -- there's nothing worth writing about. We can't have the articles on 4400 Episodes because they're only plot summaries, and offer no [WP:V|verifiable] discussion on their motifs, symbolism, themes, technical achievments, controversies and so on. The burden to prove their verifiable notability and connection to outside discourse lies on the "keep" voters. That the show is popular and generates major amounts of notable discussion is a good reason to keep <i>the main article.'</i> But the same level of interest must be discovered for an individual episode if we are to allowe them to propegate. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 22:28, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, two months seems like it would be plenty of time to find an article -- any article, even -- that offers the kind of information that we're asking for. With the show's popularity, finding an issue of Entertainment Weekly or a similar publication that brings significant information to light shouldn't be an issue. The problem that's popping up here is that such information <b>doesn't exist.</b> People seem to think that we write an aritcle and slap what we "know" into the pages, and then come back to source it later when we find something that backs up the claim. That's completely wrong. If you can't source it per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, then it <b>shouldn't</b> be in the article.

<dd>Googling <i>"the 4400"</i> returns millions of hits, so someone is talking about it. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 05:18, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This, my friend, is a straw man. You're misrepresenting my argument. A Google search for "The 4400" does in fact return a few million hits, but a Google search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22The+4400%22+%22The+New+And+Improved+Carl+Morrissey%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22The+4400%22+%22The+New+And+Improved+Carl+Morrissey%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">this episode</a> generates only 414, with the first five being IMDb, Amazon.com, Wikipedia, TV.com, and a fan-run 4400 site. This only supports my original statement: the series is noteable and deserves its own article, this individual episode does not. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 05:24, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And it's the second time you used the same straw man in this AfD, Peregrinefisher. Please don't. 05:27, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, just the Carl Morrissey episode. A quick google search brings up things like <a href="http://the4400guide.com/2006/10/23/behind-the-scenes-jj-bean/" class="external text" title="http://the4400guide.com/2006/10/23/behind-the-scenes-jj-bean/" rel="nofollow">where parts are filmed</a>, <a href="http://www.tv.com/the-4400/the-new-and-improved-carl-morrissey/episode/294839/summary.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tv.com/the-4400/the-new-and-improved-carl-morrissey/episode/294839/summary.html" rel="nofollow">what songs are featured</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0502807/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0502807/" rel="nofollow">geographic errors</a>, on the first page. Now I'm not saying use these as sources, but this is stuff you can easily come up with by viewing the episode and doing a little research. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 05:53, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The first link is to a blog with a non-notable author. The second link is to a wiki-style fan site, with no references of its own. The third link provides <b>one</b> piece of trivia, which, while interesting, is by no means encyclopedic. I pointed that out in my last response to you -- the one that used this same search. Fan-run sites and the TV.com wiki do not count as reliable sources, and IMDb should be used on a case-by-case basis. Are suggesting that each episode is notable because it has a piece of trivia attatched, or that its covered by a 4400-specific fan ring with no journalistic credentials?<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 06:03, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I said "I'm not saying use these as sources." I'm just saying that there's enough info that it is best formatted in single pages. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 06:09, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>But there <b>isn't.</b> Each season of The 4400 has thirteen episodes. If we assume the kind of content you're suggesting, that gives us roughly five sentences per episode. Multiply that by the season, and you get a list that is somewhere in the neighborhood of sixty-five sentences long. Nothing unruly or horrible about that, and again, that's if we assume that trivial content is worthy of inclusion. I already disagree with you there, as does <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIVIA_c4e2.html" title="WP:TRIVIA">WP:TRIVIA</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a>. One list is better than thirteen stubs that, due to a limited amount of acceptable reference material, will never be expanded. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 06:19, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The real world context is it's a tv show episode, X people were involved in making it, X songs were featured, it was filmed in X and the significant features of the plot were X. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 07:03, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The first two points can much better be included in a season article / episode list (since the TV show info stays the same, and most of the people involved don't change between episodes): featured songs seems to be a very minor point (and the theme songs are usually the same for every episode anyway), location usually as well (and will often be the same across most episodes anyawy, so again better suited for a list), so the main discussion is the length of the plot, which seems in the current articles way too long for the amount of other info available, the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> attention these episodes have received, and per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. The plot summaries as they stand now are hardly comprehensible for someone not familiar with the series, so should either be way longer (which is totally unacceptable per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>), or way shorter (not focusing on particular details, but giving a very general story line). So I don't see why your previous post can be adressed by a season article? <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 09:01, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Maybe a large part of our disagreement centers on formatting. Our goal is to answer a users questions, and I think we should make them do the least amount of scrolling and clicking as possible. An infobox with complete cast and crew info just won't fit nicely on a season page, and that's verifiable info that we can all agree is important, and it changes episode to episode. You could make it 1 click away, but why not 0 clicks away? As far as the level of plot detail, the best way I've seen to do that is in the Buffy pages, for example <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightmares_%28Buffy_episode%29_fad5.html" title="Nightmares (Buffy episode)">Nightmares (Buffy episode)</a>. A shorter summary answers very general questions, and a longer one explains the context. Another thing that doesn't go well with season pages are external links. Imdb and tv.com have individual pages that should be linked to. You could link to their lists, but then you've added maybe two clicks and some scrolling/reading. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 16:25, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Or, conversely, if a user is trying to learn more about the series and wants to see what information we have on individual episodes, they'll have to make at least 27 clicks to read the same sixty-five sentences per season. Many of those sentences will be duplicate information, as per <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram's</a> comment above. Less scrolling, more clicking. And that's if we grant that navigational concerns are grounds for keeping an article from being merged. There is no Wikipedia policy to support that belief, especially when it conflicts with other needs. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 19:31, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
