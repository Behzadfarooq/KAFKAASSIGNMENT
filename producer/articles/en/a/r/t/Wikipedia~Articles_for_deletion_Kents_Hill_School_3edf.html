<li>Er... isn't a reason merely an assertion that supports a perticular action (such as voting "keep")? Dr. Zen clearly believes all schools are notable, but wishes to save time on typing. I don't see how this is any more against "the spirit of vfd" than keyboard shortcuts. Should we avoid using copy and paste in the future, just because you have somethig against convenience?

<li>It certainly shows he's taking the flip-side of a "zero tolerance" policy, which amounts to a "zero intelligence" policy: no judgement, no refelction, no consideration of the issue, no question of actual notability -- just push the <i>keep</i> button.

<li>Sorry, I got lost in the screeching there. I'll try to give you a reasoned answer. I voted against Hodge the Cat because I genuinely believe there is nothing to say about the cat. I do from time to time vote to delete articles. I think people <i>should</i> be scolded for biting the newbies. If you do that, you won't hear a word from me, Geogre. Did I say I didn't like voting by template? No. I said you would be taken more seriously if you directed your ranting at deletionists, among whose sins is voting without reason and by template, which is, after all, what you accuse me and others of doing, mindlessly.

<li><s><b>Delete</b>, no evidence yet presented of notability. Encyclopedia means "comprehensive course of study;" encyclopedic "knowledge" means "knowledge" in the sense of "4. Learning; erudition."

<li>I'd like to see some follow-up and verification if that's its claim to notability. The school's site includes that same vague "one of the oldest..." claim, <i>but no date,</i> and the picture illustrating that claim... well, I'm not a costume expert so I won't say any more. Lowell, Massachusetts supposedly had a coeducational high school back in the days of the mill girls (1830s), and <a href="http://www.bu.edu/sth/archives/cah/trails.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.bu.edu/sth/archives/cah/trails.htm" rel="nofollow">Wesleyan Academy</a> in then-Newmarket, NH was coeducational in 1817. It <i>would</i> be interesting to know why the Methodists apparently pioneered co-education. If someone establishes that this school was coeducational <i>when it was founded</i> and provides more details I'll change my vote to "keep."

<li><b>I</b> haven't found a place where it says it was <b>founded</b> as coeducational. The picture is obviously an old picture, but it doesn't say it's an <b>1824</b> picture. I'm saying I'd like a see a bit of fact-checking and research and verification. Question #1: on what date did it become co-educational? Reading their website I can <i>assume</i> it was 1824, I can <i>guess</i> it was 1824, I can <i>interpret an ambiguous sentence</i> to mean that it was 1824... but I don't see anything that <i>says</i> it was 1824. Question #2. Assuming it was co-educational in 1824, does that make it notable? Does "one of the oldest" mean one of a handful? Or does it just mean "part of the first wave?" I'm prepared to change my vote to keep, but not on the basis of a vague statement about its being <i>one of</i> the oldest. If it was founded as co-educational and there were less than ten coeducational high schools in the U. S. in 1824, I'll say it's notable. If it became co-educational after the Civil War and if most states had a couple of coeducational high schools by then (don't know, this is hypothetical) than I'd say that doesn't make it notable. The facts matter, and the article in its present state does not yet present facts that convince <i>me</i> that it's notable. Yes, I understand that the same facts convince <i>you</i> that it <i>is</i> notable. Difference of opinion is what makes horseraces...

<li>(Replying to GRider) OK, I'll abstain, but, no, it does <i>not</i> say in <i>either</i> of those places that the school was coeducational when it was founded in 1824. You use the word "is" to mean "one alumnus says 'maybe.'" There's no doubt it was founded in 1824. There are vague statements that it is "one of the oldest" and "might be the oldest continuously operating." The Encyclopedia Britannica Eleventh has a longish article on "co-education" that does not mention Kent Hill or the other early Methodist schools, and does say that "Meriden, Connecticut, seems to have made common provision for the elementary education of boys and girls in 1678. Northampton, Mass., did the same in 1680. Deerfield, Mass., in 1698 voted that all families having children either male or female between. the ages of six and ten years shall pay by the poll for their schooling presumably in the common school." With all the "mights" and "seems" and "presumablies" that doesn't mean much either, of course.
<ul>
<li>(Replying to Dpbsmith) Thank you for withdrawing/abstaining while this is discussed. The question is now raised though: Where do we, the Wikipedia community, draw the line? Clearly, without a doubt, this is a historical school. It is a fact that it was founded in 1824. It is a fact that <i>they believe</i> they are the longest continually operating co-educational institution in the U.S. Not even Samuel J. Howard's excellent research refutes this given that Deerfield Academy has excluded both sexes throughout their operation, even if due to mitigating circumstances.

<li>In my opinion any public institution that has existed for more than a few years is "notable" (I'm seeing that word used a lot around here). If it's important enough to be mentioned in a local newspaper then its important enough to be recorded in a global electronic encyclopedia like Wikipedia, because you can bet your bottom dollar someone, somewhere, sometime, somehow is going to look it up - even if its just a journo from the local paper checking facts for a story featuring his local high school. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 22:18, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>Yes, well that's just the point, isn't it? For a lot of the school articles—especially the kind that land on VfD—that "journo" is likely to find that the basic database-type facts are much better obtained from a school database site like like <a href="http://www.greatschools.net/" class="external free" title="http://www.greatschools.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatschools.net/</a>, while the blather about encouraging individual potential in every school can usually be found at greater length from the school's own website. This wouldn't be a problem <i>if</i> high-school articles really <i>were</i> in a state of continuous expansion, improvement, and fact-checking by devoted editors with intense interest in schools. But the evidence suggests this is not the case. We do get good school articles: the good school articles don't land on VfD. I think a journalist would be unwise to "fact-check" a school by consulting Wikipedia, since I don't think most of these school articles get much fact-checking when they go <i>into</i> Wikipedia.
