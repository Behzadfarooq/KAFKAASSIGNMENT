<li><b>Delete</b>. This is yet another article in the <i>Cambridge, Massachusetts</i> category that fails to convey the notability of the retailer in question.

<dd>Continuing, with a reality check: a search of a database of the Boston Globe and Boston Herald for about the last twenty years for exact phrase "Pandemonium Books" gives ten hits, <i>none of which are articles about the bookstore</i> or mention it other than in passing, in lists of bookstores or retailers. Eight are book signing announcements; one is an article about a locally produced magazine, "New Genre," with Pandemonium mentioned at the end as one of five retailers selling it; one is in a long list of places selling First Night buttons. Compare 289 (!) hits on "Brattle Book Shop" (a redlink, you'll note). The most recent, "Downtown Crossing is Losing Its Essence," December 1, 2005, p. 6, laments the loss of local institutions but rejoices that "Thankfully, some venerable Downtown Crossing destination establishments still thrive. The jeweler E.B. Horn, the Brattle Book Shop, the newly renovated Paramount Theatre, Lambert's open-air fruit and flower stand, the pinhole camera-sized Bromfield Camera." "Brattle Book Shop" appears six times in headlines; "Brattle Book Shop's Kenneth Gloss to speak in Manchester," "From across America: Offers of Help for the Brattle Book Shop," "Brattle Book Shop Reopens." "WordsWorth books" (in Harvard Square) gets 623 hits, and a quick check suggests that most <b>are</b> about the store, not the poet, and "Kate's Mystery Books" gets 192. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:17, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm not arguing that it's notable because of its status in the Boston-area market, but its status in the specialty fantasy/science fiction/horror market. It's a regular stop for notable authors on book tours, for example <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=pandemonium+cambridge+signing&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=pandemonium+cambridge+signing&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Here's a reference, from an author's blog, about the store existing, under a different name, in 1980 <a href="http://pointsman.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://pointsman.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (It's in the January 23, 2006 entry, just in case something pushes it off the front page). It goes back, probably under other names, even further, although I'd have to dig out some old magazines to find listings in their mail order book ads. It's been mentioned fairly regularly in <a href="../../../l/o/c/Locus_%28magazine%29.html" title="Locus (magazine)">Locus</a>, the most significant trade magazine in the field. <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?q=pandemonium&amp;sa=Google+Search&amp;cof=T%3A%23000000%3BLW%3A152%3BALC%3A%23009999%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.locusmag.com%2Fgraphics%2Fcorneronline0.gif%3BLC%3A%23003399%3BLH%3A36%3BBGC%3A%23ffffff%3BAH%3Acenter%3BVLC%3A%236666cc%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.locusmag.com%3BAWFID%3Afe4b6f95fb44dfff%3B&amp;domains=locusmag.com&amp;sitesearch=locusmag.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/custom?q=pandemonium&amp;sa=Google+Search&amp;cof=T%3A%23000000%3BLW%3A152%3BALC%3A%23009999%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.locusmag.com%2Fgraphics%2Fcorneronline0.gif%3BLC%3A%23003399%3BLH%3A36%3BBGC%3A%23ffffff%3BAH%3Acenter%3BVLC%3A%236666cc%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.locusmag.com%3BAWFID%3Afe4b6f95fb44dfff%3B&amp;domains=locusmag.com&amp;sitesearch=locusmag.com" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> (and that's just pages that have escaped periodic housecleaning).

<li>Hey, what happened to "going back roughly 50 years"?! Now it goes back to 1980? Be fair and cross out that 50 years claim above --- sheesh.

<ul>
<li>Nothing happened to "going back roughly 50 years"; that's just one of the older web references I've found so far. Web references aren't everything. It's well-known in its field; its activities have been frequently reported by the major trade magazine covering its field; and it hosts a relatively large number of notable-author events, indicating it's viewed as significant (especially for an independent bookstore) by publishers in the field. Hey, what happened to those "two dozen bookstores" in your area? I'm not sure there are two dozen bookstores this notable in Manhattan any more (which is pretty sad, but that's another story . . . .) <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 02:57, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

The actual hits are for book signings where about 20-50 other book stores are also listed - and none of them have articles except the standard mega-chains like Barnes &amp; Noble.

Not great for Google. "Pandemonium" is too common a word to include it alone in Google searches. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 02:22, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now what's your argument? That an independent bookstore which has hosted scores, probably hundreds of signings by notable authors over the last few years isn't notable enough, and the only bookstores that deserve entries are the "standard mega-chains"? It's treated as a notable enterprise in its specialty field, by relevant publishers and authors, and by the major trade magazine covering its field. And that shows notability under Wikipedia criteria. That Wikipedia covers a particular field badly (as with your reference to possibly notable specialty retailers without articles) is hardly a reason to make its coverage worse. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 03:21, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The links you yourself provided show that dozens of independent bookstores host book signings every day of every week. That means none of them are a notable enterprise even in their own specialty field. I need something to set this apart from what I'm guessing must be thousands of other bookstores. The reason all those other bookstores don't have articles is simple - every article would be the same! Just the name and location would be different. If you'd like to make a list of every such bookstore, that's another story (I think it would get Afd'ed as well...), but don't put the whole Wikipedia world to sleep by acting like each one of them is worth its own article. That would - as one clever guy said recently - turn Wikipedia into the Yellow Pages. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 04:17, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can't tell if you're being silly or malicious now. Arguing that a business can't be notable unless it's unique is so plainly contrary to Wikipedia policy that it's either bad faith or completely unreasonable. Let's try the argument out in a different context. "Dozens of actors appear in movies every day of every week. That means none of them are notable, even in their own field." Let's get busy; where do we find the SAG/AFTRA membership lists?! <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 04:42, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Huge difference. Every actor has a high degree of uniqueness. Do you think Silence of the Lambs would be unaffected if you swapped Jack Nicholson in for Anthony Hopkins? Of course not. Bookstores are cookie-cutter. Bookstore X is 95% the same as bookstore Y and 97% the same as bookstore Z - and quite often X, Y and Z are all on one stretch of road. How boring would it be if you just copied and pasted the same article from X to Y and then to Z - with only a sentence different? And there was nothing else you could think of to distinguish them? And then you did the same for the other 40 bookstores in the city and then again for the 80 or so more in the rest of the county, etc., etc... Then, you have ---- the Yellow Pages. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 05:11, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Every actor has a high degree of uniqueness"? That's ridiculous. You want to take a personal position that bookstores can't be notable, fine, but it's a position a large number of authors disagree with, based on informed experience. Especially in specialty markets. You want Wikipedia to be a tool listing only successful corporate enterprises, fine, hold that opinion. But it's not, and shouldn't be, Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 19:16, 8 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not sure what's ridiculous about that. Every actor has a different list of TV shows or movies or whatever. What is supposedly interesting about this bookstore? Do they have a different set of books? A unique brand of games? Have they made the news for anything except for being the 93rd stop on a book-signing tour for some author I've never heard of? I'm not saying bookstores can't be notable - just that this one isn't. I'm also not saying that only successful ones can be notable - just interesting ones. I figure either you have an affinity for this place because it's nearby - which means you want the article for vanity reasons - or you're a general inclusionist - which means there's no point in me arguing further. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 20:06, 8 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Do they have a different set of books?" Yes, that's pretty much what specialty market retailers carry. Where the standard local bookstore might carry 1-2% of the genre titles in print, and a chain superstore 20-25%, a top-tier specialty market store would aim at carrying 75-90% of the available mass market titles. It would typically carry books from 50-150 small press/specialty publishers that aren't made available through general retail channels. At the market's peak, the top-tier SFFH stores would carry 100-250 independent magazines that didn't have general distribution; that number is smaller now, since many of them were subsidized enterprises that have moved to the web. They're typically run and staffed by people with expertise and influence in the specific field. "Have they made the news for anything except being the 93rd stop on a book-signing tour for some author I've never heard of?" Who really cares? Unless you can accurately claim that you're familiar with virtually all the significant authors in the world, you're just declaring that <b>Wikipedia promotes aggressive ignorance</b>, and that's just bad policy. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 23:29, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
