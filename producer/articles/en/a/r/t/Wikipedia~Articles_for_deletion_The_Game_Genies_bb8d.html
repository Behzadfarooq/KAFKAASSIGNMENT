<li>Hey I know plenty of notable bands that have no record label and no press. What's with the exclusivity, I thought wiki is about free information and complete knowledge. It's not a poorly-written article or a shameless "click here for our myspace" plug either. <b>Keep the article.</b></li>

<dd>Here's some information about the exclusivity: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>. I agree, it's not a badly written article.

<dd>Yeah, I did read those too. It just doesn't seem right to discount a band based on what those who have never heard them play think of their notoriety. They are a local band, yes, but they deserve the page, if for nothing else besides wikipedia standards, their radio airtime.--168.122.227.8 21:59, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>One quick point about the radio airtime. I went to the link from the article for Long Island's <a href="http://radiox.fm" class="external text" title="http://radiox.fm" rel="nofollow">Radio X</a>, which reviews a lot of bands in their music guide. No mention of the Game Genies. A search on another link, WTBU, found nothing for the Game Genies. The third link is a push--the website's under construction. These external links in the article are asking the reader to take it on faith that these radio stations are playing the Game Genies, instead of verifying in any way the notability of the band. The only external link, besides the band's own myspace link, that purports to verify the <i>existence</i> of the Game Genies is the link to <a href="http://gamemusic4all.com" class="external text" title="http://gamemusic4all.com" rel="nofollow">Game Music 4 All</a>, which allows anyone to submit a band listing and does not appear to verify the information that's given to it. It provides no information about the band except a link back to their myspace page. I did a google search for ("game genies" band) and came back with <i>nothing</i> except myspace hits, and the gamemusic4all.com link, which isn't verified. And a blog about a Canadian band called the Game Genies. And a link to <a href="http://216.250.247.110/teenbandnights.htm" class="external text" title="http://216.250.247.110/teenbandnights.htm" rel="nofollow">The North Shore Youth Council Teen Band Nights</a>.

<dd>In response to the radio airtime arguement, if you actually looked into the Northeastern Radio Station's playlists, you would find that they were played on air. Their Spinitron.com Radio Playlist account verifies this. <a href="http://www.spinitron.com/public/index.php?station=wrbb&amp;month=Oct&amp;year=2006&amp;plid=1875" class="external text" title="http://www.spinitron.com/public/index.php?station=wrbb&amp;month=Oct&amp;year=2006&amp;plid=1875" rel="nofollow">Here</a> and <a href="http://www.spinitron.com/public/index.php?station=wrbb&amp;month=Oct&amp;year=2006&amp;plid=1903" class="external text" title="http://www.spinitron.com/public/index.php?station=wrbb&amp;month=Oct&amp;year=2006&amp;plid=1903" rel="nofollow">Here</a>
<dl>
<dd>I think that it would be worthwhile at this point to say that this deletion discussion is about both the band and the article about the band. It would strengthen the article if these links were included in it; however, the article links to quite a few websites that do not mention the Game Genies at all. On the google search that I did, the Game Genies' show at The North Shore Youth Council (based in <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocky_Point%2C_New_York_5301.html" title="Rocky Point, New York">Rocky Point, New York</a>) Teen Band Night on July 20, 2006 made it to the first page of hits, and was the only outside link that I found about this band, so I mentioned it in this discussion. The spinitron link is several pages deep and I missed it. The point is, the article could have made sure that I didn't miss the spinitron link by including it, not an under-construction website. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 20:08, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That could have been done, but it would seem that the point of the radio station link was to display places the band 'was played rather than showing off the exact time and date. Putting the spotlight on the exact instance in which the music was broadcasted serves as nothing more as an advertisement for the group, which this website is vehemently against, with good reason. The point of an encyclopedia is to provide knowledge or information, not to appease standards through providing extremely specific hyperlinks. On the other hand, I would agree that this discussion has extended far beyond the actual article itself. While I do believe the article could be greatly strengthened, it is not a shamless plug for the group in question, making it difficult to decide on the issue of deletion.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The radio station airplay counts in their favor, as does the band's overall coolness.

<p>I Think they should be allowed to keep their atricles spot because they clearly have music in circulation that people might be curious about. They should keep their spot because The Game Genies is a good band and people should hear them! they have the right to an article and you, wikipedia, should allow them to give their fans more information on your so-called free encyclopedia. what damage could it do to add an article on a band, a good band in my opinion. that's my point.</p>

<dd>The point of an encyclopedia is to learn about something.....to look it up, to read about it and to have the information on a certain subject. if thats "a publicity vehicle" then maybe you should think about how you run this website or even have it at all. If somebody wanted to read about this band(or any other band) why should they not be able to do so in an encyclopedia?</dd>

<dd>No I'm saying two separate things: (1) the band is unnotable and the article should be deleted, regardless of what their genre is and (2) while I'm here, I might as well point out that the existance of bands dedicated to video game music is surely a sign of the imminent collapse of Western civilization, if not indeed the very End Times, although this observation has no bearing on whether the article is deleted or not. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:53, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Now you're just making yourself sound biased about it. Way to support your point. <a href="../../../a/f/a/User%7EAfacini_7251.html" title="User:Afacini">Afacini</a>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sure if the music was all about kickin back, watchin a football game and drinking a nice cold one you'd be all for it....or maybe if the bands songs were about family guy, i know you people nowa days love quoting that show...
<dl>
<dd>"...the existance of bands dedicated to video game music is surely a sign of.....[the] very End of Times." - That's a very intellegent statement, it must be very tough for you to have to deal with the inferior masses that frequent this site. Obviously you are far above such lowly forms of expression, judging from your classically inspired user name. I suppose if composers such as Wagner and Mozart were being covered it would live up to your expectations, although any sort of original interpretation of such works may be considered blasphemous. Change is indeed a frightening thing, I suppose it would be best if we were all xenophobes. It's one thing for you to dislike a genre of music, but to compare it to the degradation of society is just plain biased. (By the way, I recall learning of similar reactions when rock and roll came about...)</dd>
