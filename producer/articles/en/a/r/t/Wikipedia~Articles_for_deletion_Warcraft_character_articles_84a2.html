<p>I am retracting this nomination as it seems to be spiralling towards a brawl. I doubt any good faith consensus can result from this discussion. I'll approach this from another angle later. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 10:52, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have reverted your close. Nominators have no special rights to close an AfD after a second person has supported deletion, and this one seems to have been headed fairly close to a delete consensus when you changed your mind. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 01:51, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fine, but I am then striking out all my comments as I do not support this nomination any futher. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 02:01, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is my parting message for this Article: I'm going the same way as Kaustuv, he knew what he was doing when he jumped ship on this one... This list is a mess and doesn’t even begin to encompass all the good/bad character articles related to Warcraft. The only thing this will lead to is: At best, a purging of a <i>few</i> bad articles. At worst, a complete annihilation of a slew of good <i>and</i> bad articles. I started some heavy research into these articles; an Excel document where I tried to at least organize this heap of articles. Through this process I discovered at least twice again as many articles that fit into this category better than Medivh! One didn't even exist ("Blackhand")! Some of the propositions stated below are very intelligent and the sadly failed objective of this article (to set a standard for AfDs brought up by WP:FICT) was a noble cause, but this is <i>not</i> the place that that is going to happen. My advice is to scrap this page before someone gets hurt, and try again with a more specific organized and comprehensive list. For crying out loud, the originator of this nomination left! <a href="../../../o/r/c/User%7EOrcShaman42_2110.html" title="User:OrcShaman42">OrcShaman42</a> 20:22, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Old discussion</b></p>
<p><s>This is a group nomination of a series of Warcraft character pages. My deletion rationale is as follows, in bulleted form but not necessarily in order of importance.</s></p>
<ul>
<li><s>None of the characters are <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">notable</a> outside the Warcraft fandom. None of the articles provide a clue how to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> why the nominated characters are notable except as elements of the Warcraft plot.</s></li>
<li><s>There is already a page, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Warcraft_characters_df5f.html" title="List of Warcraft characters">List of Warcraft characters</a>, that has encyclopedic summaries of all of these characters. One might argue that <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> recommends splitting off articles on major characters to keep the list sized properly, but that does not obviate the need for individual notability of such characters.</s></li>
<li><s>Many of the character articles have long and detailed plot and biographical exposition. They skirt the boundary of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">game guide</a> territory, although they are for the most part not instruction manuals (i.e., they do not say how to kill the mobs for phat loot). I think this amount of detail is wrongly placed in Wikipedia. The common epithet for such articles is <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">gamecruft</a>, i.e., information that is only of interest to fans of the game.</s></li>
</ul>
<p><s>The information in these articles is freely (in the GFDL sense) available in a much more comprehensive form in <a href="../../../w/o/w/WoWWiki_90d8.html" title="WoWWiki">WoWWiki</a>, which I have linked using the legend "ww" for comparison purposes. Many of WP's articles are word-for-word duplicates of their WoWWiki entries (eg. <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Placeholder_29ba.html" title="Captain Placeholder">Captain Placeholder</a>), cite their counterpart on WoWWiki (eg. <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakkar_the_Soulflayer_0d5a.html" title="Hakkar the Soulflayer">Hakkar the Soulflayer</a>), or are completely unsourced (eg. <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grom_Hellscream_8165.html" title="Grom Hellscream">Grom Hellscream</a>). There is even a template, {{<a href="../../../w/o/w/Template%7EWowwiki_511a.html" title="Template:Wowwiki">wowwiki</a>}}, designed to help citations of WoWWiki easier. I should hardly have to point out that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Bulletin_boards.2C_wikis_and_posts_to_Usenet" title="WP:RS">wikis do not qualify as reliable primary or secondary sources</a>.</s></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Guess I'll be the first. First and foremost, wikipedia is not an indescriminant collection of information. It is not a game guide. Such things can be promoted and listed on other, more in depth websites, such as, in this case, <a href="../../../w/o/w/WoWWiki_90d8.html" title="WoWWiki">WoWWiki</a>. As its already word-for-word copies. Delete them all. We even have an interwiki link for it, <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/" class="extiw" title="wowwiki:">wowwiki:</a>. Add to that the nom's notes about verifiability. Is this interpreted material? If so its original research on wowwiki, and is not a good source for information here. Is it paraphrased from a game manual? Its copyvio then. I see so much wrong with this set of articles as a result. A list would be a much better place for this. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 02:25, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Relist separately</b>: There are simply too many articles with too many different variables here for us to consider them all together. Some characters obviously need to be merged back to the list or another article (such as captain placeholder). Other characters are obvious keeps (such as Grom, Jaina, Uther Sargeras, etc).
<ul>
<li><strike><b>Comment</b> it would be better if you point out which characters are "obvious keeps" and why, so I can withdraw the nom for just them. I hardly think most, a majority, or even many of these characters are major characters. I personally have no taste for 49 separate AfDs on Warcraft characters. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 04:34, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</strike>

<li>Separate AfD's runs the risk of inconsistent outcomes. Propose subsections for those articles where a special argument may be made. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 04:41, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

And yes, separate AfDs do run the risk of inconsistent outcomes, but if you want to make a policy page, go make one and debate it and achieve consensus.

<li>As I said before, these articles deserve <b>separate</b> nominations so that they can be deleted or kept on their own merit, and not because someone wants to establish some sort of precedent. Also, it should be noted that we don't delete articles simply because they don't cite their sources, many articles are kept so that we can take the time and effort necessary to source them properly. --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetar_0d92.html" title="User:Hetar">Hetar</a> 05:38, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><strike>I think you are misreading the nomination. That this AfD will be cited as precedent is a statement of what I expect will be the case, because of which I warn participants to carefully consider their votes. The reasons for the deletion were clearly specified in the nomination; nowhere have I listed establishing a precedent as a reason for deletion. As to unsourced articles, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) is a core policy here. The week long AfD process will give interested editors plenty of time to add support for the keep votes with proper sourcing, which will increase the objective quality of these articles independently of the outcome of this AfD. I suspect we have an irreconcilable difference of opinion on the means used in this AfD, so let us agree to disagree as long as you accept my reasons for what they plainly state, not as a cover for a hidden motive. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 05:54, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</strike></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Non notable?

And they are all good articles, stating non notability seems to be the only weapon you deltionists have against these articles. As I have stated a billion times before, even if you don't see pressidence for notability, does not make it any less notable for everyone else who have even a remotly idea what this is. And also, they are here to educate people who want to know more about the Warcraft universe.

<li><strike>Note that this was not an indiscriminate list of all Warcraft character articles. See, for example, <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrall_%28Warcraft%29_91b4.html" title="Thrall (Warcraft)">Thrall (Warcraft)</a>, which was not nominated because the article asserts that he is a main character, and my brief perusal of the articles in <a href="../../../w/a/r/Category%7EWarcraft_books_ad1b.html" title="Category:Warcraft books">Category:Warcraft books</a> convinced me that he was a major character. Please also note that notability is not the sole reason: amount of detail, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> of the contents of the articles are others.

Observe the amount of attention in the latter paid to citing a wide range of sources, and assertions of notability outside the Zelda fandom. I am willing to accept that some of the nominated (but not a majority or even a large portion of them) might meet the threshold of "major character", but short of becomming a seasoned Warcraft player overnight I have no way of verifying it. The articles certainly give me no clue how I might verify if some character is a major character or not. Of course, if you still choose to see this as an attack on gaming articles, i.e., a bad faith nom, then I am sure your opinion will be noted by the closing admin. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 07:07, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</strike>

<li><b>Comment</b> Umm... Archimonde is a major character.. And why do you AfD when you have no knowledge of the subject at hand? Shouldn't it be up to the editors who actually work on these articles to decide if they are verifiable or not? Deleting them won't give us any chance to state reliability, verifiability or even work with the articles. And yes, I do see it as a bad faith nomiation, because you state yourself that you have no knowledge of the subject. I have no knowledge about anything relating to LotR other then what I have seen in the movies, does that mean I can go and AfD every character bio on Wikipedia for that lore, stating "<i>I have no knowledge of this, so therfor it must be right of me to delete them.</i>" Hiding behind <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is all good, but not if you have no chance yourself to state WHY the characters are not major. From the list you compiled I see most of them as major characters in the lore of Warcraft, which is also the reason they have their own article, and deleting them would be foolish. What you could have done instead of this AfD was to go to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Warcraft_4592.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Warcraft">Wikipedia:WikiProject Warcraft</a> and ask us to verify them before you nominate them, you could have started a dialoge with the community behind these article, and not just outright AfD them. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 07:43, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If these articles are deleted on the basis that <i>you</i> don't find them to be anything <i>major</i>, it so absolutly gives me the right to do so with other "lesser known" characters, places etc. from other lores. This AfD for me will set precedence for other articles of the same type. If the nominator can state "I have no idea what this is about, but I feel myself that X, Y, Z, is not a major character and should therefor be deleted from Wikipedia." why can't I do the same? It's all in the eye of the beholder, he dosn't see this as anything major, but it is for many of us, and AfDing it in my book is just disrespectful if you have no grasp on the subject matter. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 07:50, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

What, is owning the game and being immersed in the whole atmosphere a requirement now to edit and make informed decisions about the status of the articles? He should, as an outsider, be able to discern from the article why the subject of the article is notable, and if he can't, then it should either be reworked to make it notable or be deleted. He has chosen the latter path. Hbdragon88 08:03, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, the fact that the articles are not currently sourced properly is no reason to delete them. The Warcraft universe is propably the most notable universe in computer gaming. Many published books have been written about this universe which could potentially be used as reliable sources. The nominator states that he has no knowledge of this topic and the thing to do here would have been to start a dialogue with the WikiProject, not dump everything in this AfD. This is just further evidence that there are many Wikipedians who look contemptuously at video game content and what they consider "fancruft". This is not fancruft, this is not "gameguide".

<li><b>Keep</b> - Once Kaustav's comments are gone, I don't see how this discussion could possibly have been considered to be "heading fairly close to a delete consensus". If these articles are simply deleted, then it opens the door to deleting pretty much every fictional character from wikipedia. This is a compilation of the major and supporting characters from an extremely notable video game series; the precedent this would set would be chilling. We might as well say goodbye to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_%28character%29_66bc.html" title="Harry Potter (character)">Harry_Potter_(character)</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Skywalker_d1fc.html" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke_Skywalker</a>, if fictional characters are not worthy of the attention of wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> is pretty clear - major characters get their own pages, and minor characters should be merged into a list. And yes, video games fall under those guidelines, unless we want to have a discussion on if video games are an inherently inferior medium. Even if some of the characters in this AFD are believed to be relatively minor, AFD is NOT the appropriate medium to debate their notability relative to one another in preparation for a merge. That can be done elsewhere. If the quality of the articles is a problem, then please, help fix them - but there's no reason to set a precedent of deleting every fictional character from wikipedia.

<p>In the interests of full disclosure, I should say that I, a very long time ago, worked on several Starcraft-related pages which were later deleted.

No, I'm not going to do that, because I resepct that people do find that interesting, and the whole point of an Encylopedia is to teach people new things, and if only one person learns something, or get's some re-newed knowledge about the subject, then it's all good. Simply having your attitude <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> would only pull Wikipedia down.

<li>First of all, this is not a "vote". Secondly, whether or not my opinion is "void" is not at your discretion. In fact, you clearly missed my point: the examples you gave are more valid not because they are older but because they "have a much more established place in literature and culture as a whole". Yes, that established place in culture can come with age, but age was not my reason for deleting these articles. These are characters from video games, and nobody else is interested in them. Six million people (the supposed number of Warcraft players, according to your entry above) is a drop in the bucket compared to the readership of Lord of the Rings and Marvel comics. That's what makes this cruft. This is nothing personal; I vote the same way on articles about minor Star Wars characters, Dragon Ball Z characters, etc. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 13:36, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>These characters reaching 6 million people is more notable then the names of most towns we have articles on in Wikipedia oddly enough. Also you still have not shown that any of these characters are not known, some of them are main characters and as per WP:FICT specifically get their own articles when they do not fit in the main article. The minor characters get merged into one article, further making this the wrong place to seek merging and making deletion wrong all together. Again, please read the very frist two points of WP:FICT. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 13:43, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Reduce</b> Just some ideas. I think most of the characters on this list, in all actuality can be deleted. Most are just extra information that can be found on WoWWiki (as stated above). There are a few that, in my opinion, should be kept. Capt. Placeholder for example is a very unique character in WoW and borders on meme status. If only one out of the whole list was to be kept, he would be the one. Another possible criteria for deletion could be "stub status". Any of the above mentioned characters that are marked as stubs should be deleted, but the others left. Seeing as most of the articles on the list are stubs, this would reduce its numbers, but keep the prevalent articles. Finally, I think all city/race leaders’ articles can be kept as they are important characters not only to WoW, but to the entire Warcraft universe. Their individual histories are important to the canon of Warcraft. On top of that, they are not "enemies" and therefore would not merit sections based on strategies or loot tables. <a href="../../../o/r/c/User%7EOrcShaman42_2110.html" title="User:OrcShaman42">OrcShaman42</a> 13:50, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

<li><s>Capt. Placeholder lies <i>outside</i> of Warcraft lore.

If your gonna delete those entries then you might as well delete the entries for the characters of Harry Potter or Lord of the rings.

<li>You have not given clear reasons. All you've done above is describe the articles as "cruft" and then claimed non-notability, without saying what standards of notability are appropriate, except that every random stranger should have knowledge of the subject (not a widely held view of what should be inclusive in a good encyclopedia). You're not being bullied - all that's being asked for is specifically citing valid policy for deletion. <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a> is not, and never has been, and never will be, grounds for deletion.

<li>I will not. That would blatant bad faith on my part - if you feel that these articles are bad, it is *your* responsibility to AFD those articles. Your attempt to get me to do it was an attempt to catch me making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and be chastised for it. My reason for the comparison is that while I think that these articles and the Snape article contain some OR and need cleanup, the existence of a Snape article is not a problem in and of itself. But, AFD is not the place to say that articles need cleanup or merging - it's a judgement on whether wikipedia should cover certain subjects.

<li>Actually, Josh, I specifically told you <i>not</i> to violate POINT, and even put in the link to it. You're all giving me other examples of crappy articles and saying, "Well, if we have that one, we should have this one". Your logic is flawed, though, because I never said I thought we <i>should</i> have those other ones. You're making the assumption that I think Snape is worthy of an article, when I never said I did. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 17:08, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>What exactly is your opinion then? Should fictional characters be covered at all on wikipedia? If the answer is no, then I think you'll find that your opinion is supported nowhere in wikipedia policy or precedent. JoshWook 17:12, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Some should, yes. It largely depends on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, both of which this article fails. I think you will find that your opinion is supported nowhere in policy either, as <b>there is no official policy regarding notability</b>. There are guidelines, but not policies. As for precedents, those are set here. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 17:19, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Believe me, I've read it. I've done a lot of work on fiction articles (and videogame articles, for that matter) and I'm well aware of the guideline. But it's a guideline, not a policy, and any user may choose to disregard it if he or she feels an exception may be made. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 17:42, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Can you show me the policy that states fictional characters need to meet WP:V and notability independently from their own main article, even though they are being split because they size of the article not their own notability. See what you fail to understand is that WP:FICT states to give them their own articles, not because they are notable characters to the world, or that they deserve their own articles without an article on the main story but, because there is no room in the main article and we work with article size contraints. So notability and WP:V are not applicable here, these arent really articles on their own because they meet policy, they are articles on their own cause they do not fit in the main article. Which is why I keep telling you to read WP:FICT. Because it states you can off shoot articles for main characters when the main article gets too big, and states nothing of them needing to be article worthy on their own, because then there would be really no point to stating you can create seperate articles for them, cause that would be common sense if they were already notable to the world and verifiable outside of the media in which the fictional character exists. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 17:49, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I will say again, <b>there is no policy on notability</b>. There are guidelines. And what the guideline actually says is that characters can be broken off into their own articles <i>if</i> the information is <b>encyclopedic</b>. I contend that this is not encyclopedic, because in order for information to be encyclopedic at Wikipedia it must be notable, verifiable, and obtained from a trustworthy source. What the guideline recommends is combining them on one page, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Sopranos_in_the_DiMeo_Crime_Family_bd4c.html" title="List of characters from The Sopranos in the DiMeo Crime Family">List of characters from The Sopranos in the DiMeo Crime Family</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 17:59, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>That is for minor characters, again read WP:FICT, this is my last reply to you as it seems you are just refusing to acknowledge WP:FICT at all which is odd since your example is a list of minor characters being put on a page as per WP:FICT. Again they are minor characters, which is point 2 of WP:FICT, now just acknowledge point 1 and we are all done. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 18:03, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And I will say to you <i>again</i> that WP:FICT is not a policy. It's a suggestion. There are no hard and fast criteria to decide which characters are major and which are minor. Who decides that? Fans of the genre? Fans of that particular universe? Fans of that specific character? The Sopranos list came to mind because the Sopranos community had a problem with a fan who absolutely insisted that a certain character was "major". The line is not black and white as you are trying to make it seem. In cases such as that (and such as this), whether or not a character is "major" is subject to consensus, which is what we are trying to reach here. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 18:19, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I think you have everything mixed up then, this is not the appropriate venue for you to find out who is a major character, and putting them all up for deletion in an attempt to is completely against the purpose of AfD. Perhaps you should read up what AfD is used for, but its not for merging, or for finding out what characters are major and which are not. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 18:25, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>You</i> seem to be mixed up, because I didn't put any of these up for deletion. You managed to bully that poor guy into silence. I just happened to agree with him, and I was willing to put up with many kilobytes more bullshit than he was. AfD is actually used for merging <i>quite often</i>. You'll know that after you spend a bit more time here. I do agree with you, though, that it's not for determining whether characters are minor or major. I think they're minor, therefore <b>cruft</b>, and that's really the end of it as far as my stance is concerned. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 18:45, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Comment</b> I hate to have to be the nanny, but can we keep stop the flaming/trolling and get back to the real issue please? Correct me if I'm wrong, but we are not debating definitions of article types or WP essays, we are debating <i>specific articles</i> on the AfD list. There is no reason to drag this page on and on with selfish and wasteful personal attacks. Let's just get this over with, I know there are other things we would all like to be doing (maybe).<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by User:OrcShaman42 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EOrcShaman42_7b7f.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:OrcShaman42">contribs</a>).</small></s></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'd recommend closing this AfD and <b>relisting</b> the less notable ones for deletion. Consensus seems to be that we can't categorically delete each of these entries, so far as I can tell. Especially since the relevant deletion arguments are "<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>," which certainly can't be covered for every article at once. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcewolf34_9af8.html" title="User:Icewolf34">Icewolf34</a> 20:02, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>A little more support for this stance: "In cases such as that (and such as this), whether or not a character is "major" is subject to consensus, which is what we are trying to reach here" is Kafziel's (very reasonable) position, which is again better served through discussion on individual pages. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcewolf34_9af8.html" title="User:Icewolf34">Icewolf34</a> 20:04, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Completely agreed. Kaustauv was right in predicting a drawn-out, uncivil no consensus that would lead to nowhere. Any time more than a dozen articles of varying quality is put up for AFD, we're going to end up with nothing more than shouting matches. The reason for that is that trying to delete big portions of wikipedia en masse is an attempt to circumvent the policy-making procedure. If policy is to be changed, do it, because right now there is no policy that justifies deleting every one of these all at once simply because they are game characters. Otherwise look at each article one at a time and decide on its own merits. JoshWook 20:33, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Leave it alone</b> until someone decides they have time to merge it or care enough to merge the "minor" characters in to the main article they should be in. That entire "these other things have cultural importance, warcraft doesn't" seems a little weak. It's probably just that people have different levels of exposure to different sections of "culture". I think its better to leave this "cruft" if some people find it useful. <a href="../../../c/a/c/Cackalacky.html" title="Cackalacky">Cackalacky</a> is an example of this where Wikipedia having something minor was useful to me, even though some people on the discussion had never heard of it.<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustbobdanish_d593.html" title="User:Justbobdanish">Justbobdanish</a> 21:05, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
