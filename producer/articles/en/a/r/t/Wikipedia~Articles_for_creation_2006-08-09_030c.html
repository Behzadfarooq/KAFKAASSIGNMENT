Arse 2 Mouth are a band based in Edinburgh, UK. They were formed in September 2005 and according to the band's myspace page their music is a blend of Rock, Country and Comedy(1). Arse 2 Mouth's music is viewed as misogynistic and offensive by many as songs on their self-released 'Respect' EP, such as 'Bring Me Another Woman' and 'To Beat Another Man's Wife', make numerous references to sex and domestic violence(2). The Members of Arse 2 Mouth also regularly make entries into the band's myspace blog(3).</p>

<p>Ben Rowe is probably the coolest person in the world. He was born on a glorious spring day and from that day on, people knew he would be awesome. He has definitely exceeded those peoples expectations. On an awesomeness scale on one to ten, one being not awesome, and ten being crazy awesome, he is like an infinity. He is just amazing at all aspects of life and no one can ever come close to his level of awesomeness.</p>

CcMmYK is a six color printing process used in upscale inkjet printers optimized for photo printing. It extends the customary four color <a href="../../../c/m/y/CMYK_faa6.html" title="CMYK">CMYK</a> model by adding light cyan (lower case c) and light magenta (lower case m).</p>

<p>Cyan and magenta inks are both dark colors. Inkjet printers may have difficulty printing light shades of cyan or magenta with dark ink. The necessary <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halftoning.html" title="Halftoning">Halftoning</a> pattern may be unacceptably large. The gap between the lightest printable shade of cyan and the second lightest shade may be too great.</p>
<p>Light yellow is not used in CcMmYK printing. Yellow ink is not as dark as cyan or magenta, so the benefits are not as apparent.</p>

<p>Many HP Photosmart, Epson Stylus Photo, and Canon PIXMA printers use the CcMmYK printing process. The printers in these families that use the CcMmYK printing process can be identified by their six separate ink cartridges.</p>
<p>Many Lexmark printers also use the CcMmYK printing process. These printers accept the Lexmark #31 photo ink print cartridge. The Lexmark #31 cartridge contains light cyan, light magenta, and photo black ink. When this optional cartridge is not available, compatible printers fall back to the CMYK printing process.</p>

<p>In 1916, twelve women of Marquette University began a great undertaking--the foundation of the first sorority on Marquette campus. These twelve worked enthusiastically toward their goal and on January 22, 1917, Kappa Beta Gamma was founded at Marquette University. Their purpose was to unite the members in the bond of sisterhood; to develop friendships among the members during their college days, to improve the members morally, socially, and intellectually, and to perpetuate the support of college university, alma mater and of God and country. The first officers of this group were: Tess Germaine (President); Myra Thewalt (Vice-President); Jeanie Lee (Secretary); and Mary Weimar (Treasurer). Mary Weimar was also the designer of the Kappa pin.</p>
<p>Kappa Beta Gamma grew socially, morally, and intellectually throughout the years. As a local group on the Marquette campus, the members of Kappa Beta Gamma were first in intellectual pursuits and social activities. However, many of the members expressed interest in expanding onto other university campuses. On May 14, 1947, Founders Day, the dream of many years became a reality when Alpha Chapter was installed at Saint Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri, and Kappa Beta Gamma became a National Sorority. The Chapter at Marquette University became known as Beta Chapter. National Headquarters were set up at Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and the first National Officers were chosen from the Beta Chapter. These officers, elected to a two year term, were: Georgia Klein (President); Ann Calla (Vice-President); Gertrude Cobbeen (Secretary); and Gloria Oberst (Treasurer).</p>

<p>The Basrard or hand and a half sword is a double bladed sword thats use became popular in the late middle ages, at about the same time as the broadsword, longsword, flamberg, and other traditional weapons commonley associated with the age. The sword was used mainly by a mounted warrior, such as the knight, who had to have the versitlity of a one handed weapon, but if dismounted had a two handed sword, that was light ublike a longsword or flamberg, but sturdy unlike a raiper,or sabre. The sword was also commonly used with a shield because if the shield was lost, our shield arm wasn't defenceless. A bastard sword was not a poor mans sword though, it was usulally a well decorated or ornate sword, and used by the wealthy. A hand and a half sword was although one of the best arms a warrior could carry in the dark ages.</p>

Their purpose was to unite the members in the bond of sisterhood; to develop friendships among the members during their college days, to improve the members morally, socially, and intellectually, and to perpetuate the support of college university, alma mater and of God and country. The first officers of this group were: Tess Germaine (President); Myra Thewalt (Vice-President); Jeanie Lee (Secretary); and Mary Weimar (Treasurer). Mary Weimar was also the designer of the Kappa pin.</p>
<p>Kappa Beta Gamma grew socially, morally, and intellectually throughout the years. As a local group on the Marquette campus, the members of Kappa Beta Gamma were first in intellectual pursuits and social activities. However, many of the members expressed interest in expanding onto other university campuses. On May 14, 1947, Founders Day, the dream of many years became a reality when Alpha Chapter was installed at Saint Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri, and Kappa Beta Gamma became a National Sorority. The Chapter at Marquette University became known as Beta Chapter. National Headquarters were set up at Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and the first National Officers were chosen from the Beta Chapter. These officers, elected to a two year term, were: Georgia Klein (President); Ann Calla (Vice-President); Gertrude Cobbeen (Secretary); and Gloria Oberst (Treasurer).</p>

<p>The tuna boat is the greatest thing in the world. It incorporates two of Gods greatest creations, females and sex. It begins when two girls decide to get naked and explore each others wonderful bodies. They then jump on each other and slide their legs together so there is vaginal contact. This contiunues until ORGASM. Need I say more.</p>

<p>Ira North was a church of Christ preacher. He was born in 1922 and was baptized in 1932. He preached for several years at the Madison church of Christ in Madison, TN, starting in 1953. He always wore this bright red coat. He was a preacher during the Amazing GraceBible Hour that was played on television nationwide. He died in 1984 and is buried in Etheridge TN. I attended church there with my grandparents several times and I would watch the Amazing Grace Bible Hour to see my grandparents sitting in the front. It was a nice way to hear him speak and to see my grandparents. See this website for more information.</p>

<p>Azar Lawrence is a Saxophonist born in Berkley CA. Azar put out several sax instrumental albums including "Bridge Into the New Age," "Summer Solstice," and my personal favorite, "People Moving."</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Http://ag5.net/~dje/fabdiscs/img h n/lawrence pic.jpg">Image:Http://ag5.net/~dje/fabdiscs/img h n/lawrence pic.jpg</a></p>
<p>Azar Lawrence showed a great deal of potential during his period with McCoy Tyner's Quartet (1973-1977), but has not made that strong an impression since. A fine tenor and soprano saxophonist (which he took up in 1970 and 1972 after a few years playing alto), Lawrence performed with Horace Tapscott in Los Angeles. He toured Europe with Clark Terry in 1970 and in 1973, joined Elvin Jones' band. After three months, Lawrence decided to switch to Tyner's group and he recorded several impressive albums (on Milestone) while a sideman with the great pianist. Azar Lawrence also recorded three albums as a leader for Prestige during 1974-1976, but has not had further opportunities to head sessions and has maintained a low profile ever since.</p>
<p>He often worked with Skip Scarborough, Paul Jackson, and Mtume, and Lee Ritenour.</p>

<p>--64.30.99.160 06:45, 8 August 2006 (UTC)MarketStir was developed as a place to gather and discuss the markets while also learning what is driving the market's day to day actions. The markets are extremely volatile and will swing up or down depending on many factors. Some of the most common factors that swing the markets are news related whether that be economic, stock specific, or current events. This site hopes to lay out some of the factors that cause the markets to move and then show how they are affecting our current market. With a personal customized portfolio and ticker package, message board, chat room, and annual stock competition, MarketStir is the place to be! All this is absolutely free of charge and for educational purposes only.</p>
<p>Justin Winters a recent college graduate, created this site to teach others about the market and trying to tame its capricious nature. He also wanted to be able to learn more and expand his own knowledge. He encourages all of you to teach and learn from others on this site and make your experience in the markets one of great success. So far he has made 20% annually and I hope to keep that up and share my strategies with you.</p>

<p>Born in Burnley, a small northern town in England, David hails from a family steeped in the history of coal mining. As most northern lads of his age, his future in a way had been earmarked. However, with his family having a musical background, his mother also singing and his Grandmother playing piano, there was always a chance that David could adopt some of their talent.</p>
<p>Having left school at the tender age of fifteen, a succession of jobs followed. However, young Master Readman had already been bitten by the musical bug and formed various bands like Alander, Sixmyth, Splatterpunk and cut his "live" teeth playing the local club circuit.</p>
<p>At age 19, unfulfilled promise led him to Nelson and Colne Music College in 1989 where he learned the basics of what was required to become a professional singer. Two years later, it was was time for the hungry Readman to find a real band.</p>
<p>However, it wasn't until during a camping trip where he sung some Led Zep songs a friend said "Man, what you doing, you should be making records". That was it, David now had the belief and the fire in his belly required to succeed in the music business, and spent the next few months sending a barrage of demos tapes in response to adverts for singers in the cult UK magazine Melody Maker. It wasn't long before he received calls from throughout the UK. These would eventually lead to auditions and jobs with Adrian Smith (Iron Maiden), then solo, Thomas McRocklin (Vai-like virtuoso) and a move to London with Misha Calvin, who would later release the demos without David's consent.</p>
<p>The 17th June 1994 is the day that David's life, as he knew it, would change forever! He flew to Germany for an audition with European Hard Rockers Pink Cream 69, who's vocalist Andi Deris had left to join Helloween. David was successful in his audition and felt that at last he had discovered the band that he had so long craved. Pink Cream 69 were also a band that his talent undoubtedly deserved!</p>
<p>Things moved so fast for David with the signing of a record contract with Sony Music in November '94 and a trip to America only a couple of days later to record his first PC69 record "Change" with in California. The quartet returned to Germany at the tale end of January '95 and immediately set out on the road for David's first headline tour. Thunderhead accompanied on what was was a crazy time and a long way from Burnley!</p>
<p>A procession of records quickly followed - "Food for Thought", the "Live" CD and then the highly acclaimed "Electrified", a return to the bands hard rocking roots. This record began to open doors again for Pink Cream 69, that many declared they had shut with the change in direction on their appropriately named "Change" album!</p>
<p>Success in various quarters arrived with the single "Shame" and a European Tour with Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson followed, where David would again be reaquainted with Adrian Smith.</p>
<p>June 1999 saw the band flying 14 hours to Japan where they experienced an unforgettable four days playing Tokyo and Kawasaki.</p>
<p>David barely had time to pinch himself when in 2000 the band released their next record "Sonic Dynamite", again to critical acclaim, and were off to Sao Paulo in Brazil for the first time. This would become a great year for touring with a co-headline tour with Axiss also under their belts.</p>
<p>David then met Stephan Forte at a concert in France, and a partnership commenced in the studio. Pink Cream 69's EP "Mixery" was recorded in-between, which meant working with Adagio through the day, and then recording "One Step into Paradise" at night sessions at House of Audio Studios Karlsdorf. The end of June 2001 saw the release of their first collaboration, under the name of Adagio, the "Sanctus Ignus" CD.</p>
<p>"Endangered" would become David's fifth studio album with Pink Cream 69 in 2001 and carried on where "Electrified" and "Sonic Dynamite" left off. David was now firmly turning heads on a regular basis with emotional and soulfull performances and was now highly regarded as one of Europe's finest rock singers!</p>
<p>Work continued to emerge with various projects, mainly associated with David's Bass playing colleague and Producer Dennis Ward. In November 2002 Missa Mercuria, a Rock Opera, was released in Germany. David played the part of the narrator and sung on three tracks on the record.</p>
<p>Adagio's second album "Underworld" was released in November 2003 whilst Pink Cream took a long break, mainly due to health issues with their guitarist Alfred Koffler.</p>
<p>Koffler thankfully recovered and in 2004 "Das Pinkies" returned with arguably their finest release to date in "Thunderdome". The citics went wild and the album featured in many an "Album of the Year" category throughout Europe. David put in some of his best performances ever captured on record, none more so than the self penned hanuting ballad "That Was Yesterday".</p>
<p>In the beginning of 2004 David participated in his first tour with Adagio, covering the whole of France and Belgium and two weeks later, at the beginning of March 2004, would immediately set out on the road with Pink Cream 69 in support of the "Thunderdome" album. The tour kicked off in Obermarchtal, Germany on 5th March 2004 and proved to be a gruelling schedule for David and his voice. Both came through unscathed!</p>
<p>David and Adagio soon announced their decision to part amicably and is now planning the release of his first solo record. The songs have all been written and plans are well underway to making that dream a reality! Having heard some of the demos it's safe to say that fans of Pink Cream 69 and David Readman will not be disappointed when this material sees the light of day!</p>
<p>With gigs in Italy, Germany, USA and a first appearance in England for David with PC69 and The Gods, 2005 looks like being every bit as good as 2004 for the multi talented David Readman and the very underrated Pink Cream 69.</p>
<p>For all those of who have yet to discover the wonderful talents of this amazing singer and his delightful band - "Shame on You" !!!!</p>
<p>Now get yourself over the Sounds section!</p>

<p>Colonel T.G.Greenwell was, at the time of his election as the National Conservative M.P. for The Hartlepools, the managing director of the ship-repair yard, T.W.Greenwell and Co. Ltd, a Sunderland yard which had been founded by his father in 1901. He was born in 1894 and died in 1967. The by-election he won in 1943 was held according to the convention of the war years - neither the Labour Party nor the Liberal Party put up a candidate, to give the incumbent party a clear run, although an independent, a Commonwealth Party candidate and a Progressive Socialist stood. The 'swing' to the Conservatives was the largest in any by-election in the war years, largely because of Greenwell's strongly pro-Churchillian stance. Surprisingly, the post-war General Election only just removed him as an M.P. - there was a recount. His daughter, Pamela Hunter, later followed him into politics, and was Chair of the Conservative Party Conference in the year of the Brighton bombing (she was subsequently made a D.B.E.).</p>

<p>The Tombstone Brawlers bill themselves as "NY/NJ's premier Psychobilly outfit" and went through numerous personnel changes from their inception in the mid-90's to 2002. They've done the usual rtouring of Europe and appropriate festivals and outdoor shows. (They've put in the work!)</p>
<p>The Brawlers do a great job of staying true to the music at the roots of the psychobilly tree, as you'll hear if you're lucky enough to catch one of their infrequent shows in the NYC/NJ area.</p>
<p>One fantastic show was last year when Charlie was too sick to sing and Nigel Lewis fronted the band. Out-f*cking-standing!</p>
<p>Their motto is "F*ck you, Let's Fight!" I found them to be pretty personable and regular decent dudes, but I didn't cross them, either.</p>
<p>The Tombstone Brawlers are: Charlie Splatterhead (vocals), Regis &amp; Zacher on guitars, Pete on the double bass and Paul on drums.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-09_030c.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h3>
<p>Pretty soon, at the age of two and a half, Nuša Derenda made her parents aware of her singing talent. She always loved to sing and perform in front of an audience.</p>
<p>Music was an integral part of her entire childhood. She sang in choruses, performed as a soloist, attended music school and learned to play the accordion. Shortly before finishing the 9-year elementary school, Nuša Derenda joined a band of young musicians. Those were her first steps into the world of entertainment and show business.</p>
<p>Although she wanted to become a pre-school teacher and worked part time in a nursery school for one year, she continued to sing with the band and travelled throughout Europe. In 1990, the band she was with broke up and Nuša Derenda and Frenk established a new one. By that time they had already become quite professional and toured Slovenia, Germany, Switzerland and were invited to the States for three times. It lasted seven years, seven years of wonderful experiences and hard work at the same time, as they had up to 150 concerts a year. Since 1998, Nuša Derenda have been mostly working with a group called Happy Hour. They often accompany her at concerts.</p>

<p>In 1995, Frenk and Nuša Derenda got married and started thinking about setting up a home in Slovenia, and she was dreaming about making an album for some time. In 1999 her dream came true with a CD Vzemi me veter (Take Me, Wind). The song bearing the same title as the CD was written by her friend Majda Arh. That song brought Nuša Derenda the first place in the Slovene TV contest Orion (November 1998). At the Slovene Pop Contest 1999 (Slovenska popevka) Nuša Derenda received the best singer award, and at the MMS festival (Melodies of the Sea and the Sun) the second prize of the audience with the song Boginja (The Goddess; authors Urša and Matjaž Vlašič, Boštjan Grabnar). The same team of authors helped her win the Orion 2000 contest with a song Čez dvajset let (In Twenty Years). The group of authors, mentioned above, accompanied her also to the festival MMS 2000 (Melodies of the Sea and Sun). Nuša Derenda sang a song Ne kliči me (Don't Call Me) and won the audience's prize for the second time.</p>
<p>In November 2000 took place the first HIT Festival, and Nuša Derenda won with a song Ni mi žal (I'm Not Sorry). In December the same year she issued CD with the same title.</p>

<p>Winning EMA 2001 meant for Nuša even bigger media attention and popularity, which can be, as she discovered, flattering but also very tiring. The song Ne, ni res (Energy) was a really good song and in May 2001, when the Eurosong took place in Copenhagen. The seventh place was excellent, although at the beginning of the festival it seemed to be even better.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nuša Derenda and her son Matevž celebrate birthday on the same day, March 30. So does Celine Dion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In 1998 she entered a song for the EMA contest for the first time. It was accepted, but she had to cancel my performance because she was expecting a child.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When touring Germany Nuša Derenda often performed with yodlers. She likes yodelling and learned to yodel during concert breaks. Nuša Derenda still yodels at concerts from time to time and it's great fun.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When people meet her in person for the first time they're often very surprised... We guess she looks much taller on TV - but she's only 154 cm tall and she wears shoes size 34. Perhaps we should reveal also her husband's height - 192 cm...</li>

<p>Mt Pisgah is a hill in Lane County, Oregon, rising 1060 feet above the surrounding countryside to a maximum elevation of 1531 feet. It is situated between the Coast Fork and Middle Fork of the Willamette River, just two miles SE of their confluence. Springfield is immediately north of the Mt. Pisgah, and the city of Eugene is a few miles east. It hosts the Howard Buford Recreation Area managed by Lane County, and the non-profit <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Pisgah_Arboretum_fa62.html" title="Mount Pisgah Arboretum">Mount Pisgah Arboretum</a> sits at its base.</p>
<p>Recreation</p>
<p>The summit is accessible by a steep 1.4 mile trail from a parking area near the base of the hill. Several other trails wind through the adjacent arboretum and up the slopes. The summit offers a panoramic view of the Southern Willamette Valley and includes a bronze relief sculpture of the surrounding topography identifying many nearby geographic features.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Pisgah_Arboretum_fa62.html" title="Mount Pisgah Arboretum">Mount Pisgah Arboretum</a> covers 209 acres at the base of Mt. Pisgah and offers visitors 7 miles of trails through natural riverside habitat featuring hundreds of plant species. Admission is free.</p>
<p>Parking</p>
<p>Lane County manages a gravel parking area at the base of Mt. Pisgah adjacent the arboretum. The Parks Departments charges $2.00 for all day parking served from a self pay station. In 2006 fines for parking violations are $94, down from $141 in past years.</p>
<p>Geology</p>
<p>The hill consists of <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basalt.html" title="Basalt">basalt</a>, or more likely its intrusive equivalent<a href="../../../d/i/a/Diabase.html" title="Diabase">diabase</a>, and resembles many other hills throughout the Southern Willamette Valley of similar composition. Small crystals of calcite and various <a href="../../../z/e/o/Zeolite.html" title="Zeolite">zeolite</a> minerals are often found where rock outcrops, especially near the summit.</p>
<p>Controversy</p>
<p>Wildish Land Company owns 1400 acres of land adjacent to the park and has filed an Oregon <a href="../../../m/e/a/Measure_37.html" title="Measure 37">Measure 37</a> claim seeking $15 million dollars in compensation or be allowed to develop a large subdivision. Opponents of the subdivision assert that it would dramatically change the character of the park and favor local government purchasing the land rather than allowing it to be developed.</p>

<p>Iran's UAV program was launched in the wake of the 1980-88 war with Iraq. Iran has also been investing in several families of attack and multirole UAV. Over the years, Iranian officials have reported the deployment of target drones and such UAVs as the Mohajer-3 [also called Hodhod—"a hooded bird") and the Mohajer-4. The Mohajer 4 underwent a test flight on 16 February 2002. The Saeqeh UAV was tested at the same time. Minister of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics, Ali Shamkhani, said that Iran is one of the few countries to have the knowledge for designing and building UAVs, state radio reported.</p>
<p>On November 7, 2004, Hizbollah, an Islamic militant organization with close ties to Iran, flew the Mohajer-4 over northern Israel for approximately 5 minutes. The UAV entered Israeli airspace at more than 100 knots and an altitude of about 1,000 feet. After briefly flying over the seaside city of Nahariya, the UAV fell into the sea as it returned to Lebanon. An embarrassment for the Israeli government, the overflight proved to be a symbolic success for Hizbollah, which claimed the flight to be an appropriate response to Israeli incursions over Lebanon.</p>
<p>The prominent London-based Arab daily newspaper Ash-Sharq Al- Awsat quoted an unnamed senior officer with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards as saying Iran has sold 8 Mohajer-4s to Hizbollah.</p>

Milenija - the society developed with purpose to search, monitor and recognize individuals with cognitive abilities in the top one promille of human kind. The founders of Milenija believe that abstract, spatial tests are the most culture fair, most objective and representative enough to measure *g* - factor that can be compared with human intelligence. Gathering IQ-gifted people is only a short dated target of Milenija. Long dated targets are the use of its members in the service of humanity.</p>

Ongoing multivolume narrative history of the United States published by Oxford University Press. Initially begun in the 1970s under the editorship of C. Vann Woodward, the first volume, Robert Middlekauf's <i>The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789</i>, was published in 1982 (a revised edition was published in 2005). The second volume, <i>Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era</i> was published in 1988; its author, James M. McPherson, subsequently won the Pulitzer Prize in History for the book. Two more volumes followed under Woodward's editorship. The first, <i>Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945-1974</i> by James T. Patterson, was published in 1997 and was awarded the Bancroft Prize in American History. Subsequently, David Kennedy's <i>Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945</i> won the Pulitzer Prize after its publication in 1999.</p>
<p>After Woodward's death, David Kennedy took over the editorship of the series. Since the start of his tenure, in addition to the revised edition of Middlekauf's book, one new volume has appeared: <i>Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore</i> by James T. Patterson, which was published in 2005. In addition, the following volumes are currently in progress:</p>
<p>Gordon S. Wood, The U.S. from 1789 to 1815</p>
<p>Daniel Howe, <i>What Hath God Wrought: The United States, 1815-1848</i></p>
<p>H. W. Brands, The U.S. during the Gilded Age</p>
<p>Bruce Schulman, <i>Reawakened Nation: The Birth of Modern America, 1896-1929</i></p>

Dr. Joseph H. Romig, (1872-1951)</p>
<p>Dr. Joseph H. Romig was a medical missionary in Alaska. He originally arrived in Bethel, Alaska in 1894 as a Moravian Missionary. When he first moved to Alaska, he traveled by a team of dogs to administrate medical aid to the people living in Northern Alaska, which brought him close to death many times. In the 1920's he moved to Anchorage to become Chief of the Alaska Railroad Hospital.</p>
<p>Romig Middle School in Anchorage, Alaska is named after him.</p>

<p>Summer Shakespeare at the University of Notre Dame is an annual festival that seeks to combine professional productions of the works of William Shakespeare with community outreach and educational programs. Summer Shakespeare is a part of the University of Notre Dame's Shakespeare initiative entitled "Shakespeare at Notre Dame", a program that recognizes the centrality of the study of Shakespeare in humanistic pedagogy at the University. Its seventh season consists of the mainstage production of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, the Young Company performance of <i>The Brothers Menaechmus</i>, and the annual ShakeScenes shows featuring actors of all ages from South Bend and the surrounding community.</p>

<p>Summer Shakespeare, the professional theatre in residence at the University of Notre Dame, is a direct outgrowth of an experimental course called "Shakespeare in Performance" that was created in 1989 by Dr. Paul Rathburn, Summer Shakespeare's founder. The premise of this course was that Shakespeare's works are both theatrical scripts and literary texts and are illuminated best through work in both the theater and in the classroom. It began in the summer of 2000 with the program's innagural production, <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>, but has since evolved to include guest artists and productions, the ShakeScenes community program, and a Young Company production produced and staffed entirely by Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College students. Following the 2005 production of <i>Henry V</i>, Dr. Paul Rathburn retired from his role as Producing Artistic Director. The company has since been helmed by Jay Paul Skelton, Associate Professor of Shakespeare at Notre Dame.</p>

<p>Arguably the centerpiece of Summer Shakespeare's annual festival, the mainstage production consists of a professionally mounted performance of one of the plays of William Shakespeare. The production is always directed and designed by theatrical professionals, typically from either the Chicago theatre world or the University's own faculty and staff. A number of professional actors are also employed, as well as Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students and South Bend community members. The integration of professional actors and designers with students creates a unique opportunity for those students who wish to pursue theatre as a profession following their graduation.</p>

<p>Beginning with 2003's production, the student actors and technicians in the mainstage production were given the chance to perform in a production produced entirely by them (though directed by a senior company member). The roles in the Young Company performance are necessarily larger both on and offstage - the mainstage's Assistant to the Technical Director may become the Young Company Technical Director, while a student playing First Soldier may have a chance to play Richard of Gloucester. Although in the past Young Company performances have taken place on the same set used for the mainstage performance, 2006 saw the introduction of "green shows", performances in which Young Company members travelled to local parks in South Bend and the surrounding community.</p>

<p>ShakeScenes is Summer Shakespeare's community outreach program, employing local theatre troupes and schools to perform selected scenes from Shakespeare's works. ShakeScenes has been headed since its inception by Deborah Girasek-Chudzynski of South Bend's Stanley Clark School. Participants range in age from 7 to 70, and scene directors are usually educators from local grade schools, high schools, colleges and directors of area civic theatres. These individuals cast and direct their respective scenes as well as facilitate costumes, props and choregoraphy. All members of the ShakeScenes company attend acting workshops taught by local and national theatre artists.</p>

<p>A seventeen-year-old young man stooped over a rock with a sledge hammer, the pounding reverberating in his ears. From the time he was eleven years old, family circumstances had forced him to work, leaving his education behind. One rainy spring evening, the youth stopped to eat at a Rogers, Ark. cafe with a group of his buddies known as the "Lime Kiln Gang." The persistent thumping of a drumbeat aroused the curiosity of the gang, who came out to jest at the lone, wet musician. But the young man was mesmerized by the sound and followed the drummer to a Salvation Army service. It was there that John E. Brown Sr. committed his life to Christ. Soon, Brown was not only attending the services, but also preaching at them. The Salvation Army group moved on, but Brown continued to spread the gospel. He became nationally known as "Brother Brown" and fully devoted his time to evangelism as an eloquent and convincing preacher. Amidst all of his successes, Brown never forgot his earlier years, and he desired to provide youth educational opportunities that he had been denied. He began to build on his dream of a school where financially disadvantaged young people could attend tuition free. "I call them rich boys and girls, for while they haven't the money to educate themselves, they have what young people of ample means sometimes lack-the will and ambition to work and strive and look forward and climb," Brown once said. With that in mind, the evangelist, his wife Juanita and their family settled in Siloam Springs, Ark. in 1919 where Brown established the Southwestern Collegiate Institute on their property. A year later the name was changed to John E. Brown College and then later to John Brown University. Years have passed since the day that those first 70 students and 10 professors walked through the doors of the college, laying a firm foundation for future students. Yet the founder's words still serve to inspire. "The future has for each of us greater privilege, greater opportunity, greater responsibility and greater challenge," Brown said. What Brown could not have known that rainy day in 1876 when he followed the beat of a drum is irrefutable now. He was destined to lay a foundation of education and faith for the brighter futures of thousands.</p>

JaiB is a graphic designer based in Liverpool who has set out to change the perception of venue advertising, combining textual work with vector graphics and photography aiming to be bold, simplistic as well as meet the clients needs.</p>
<p>This started off a chain of other design changes in the city and if you look around at todays advertising for most nights / venues in the city you can clearly see a difference between what used to be called "advertising" to "artvertising" using simplistic bold and status valued pieces to actively describe what a venue / product / night is like rather then just the old school basic notion that adding a so called "big name" and their picture to the front would attract big crowds, Now JaiB brought about the idea of allowing the venue to sell its self.</p>
<p>His early work was what some would call shoddy, but this set the foundations for the ever increasinglu interesting pieces of work coming from this one man band promotional work horse.</p>
<p>JaiB still is active amongst the clubbing scene and his work is still to be found at most flyer outlets across the city as well as on almost every flyposter board, although rumour has it he has now moved on to bigger projects, including a prototype mobile membership scheme.</p>

<p>By some measures, Baker Neighborhood is the oldest neighborhood in Denver as it has the oldest stock of buildings in the city.<a href="http://www.bakerneighborhood.org/Denvers-oldest-homes" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bakerneighborhood.org/Denvers-oldest-homes" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. The neighborhood is also home to several homes by locally famous architect William Lang.</p>
<p>Recently, Baker Neighborhood has become a popularurban neighborhood because of its central location and its access to several commercial business enclaves. This has led to a transformation of the neighborhood, which worries some residents because of an increased density, more traffic, and the propensity of some developers to scrape historic homes and replace them with denser luxury duplexes, town-homes, or other development.</p>

<p>the mask of truth has shown many powers yet they are still not fully understood. one ability is to read minds ,though, this ability works on dogs in majora's mask. anothers is the ability to learn from the gossip stones who will give rumors they had heard. Some of the info can be helpful while other are miscellaneous.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>.

<p>The Breaking Benjamin EP was released in 2001 and is essentially the rarest CD you can find of theirs since it was before getting signed with their record label they have now. All of the songs on the EP found their way onto Saturate (2002) but these are alternate versions that sound different than the Saturate versions. It is also thought that there are only 1000 copies of this that were ever released.</p>

<p>Alfred Büchi (Born 11 July 1879; Died 27 October 1959) was a Swiss engineer born in Winterthur</p>
<p>Alfred Büchi is considered today as the founders of the exhaust gas turbo supercharge technology. He invented the turbocharger engine and in 1905 he acquired a patent for his exhaust gas turbo supercharge technology. Büchi noticed that conventional combustion engines have a bad efficiency, because two thirds of the energy is lost as warmth with the exhaust gas stream. Büchi had the idea that closes existing energy of the exhaust gas (warm and kinetic energy) for the drive of a turbine. The turbine propels then again a compressor, which compresses the sucked in air. In 1925 it created an increase in output of over 40% with this method.</p>

<li><b>Declined</b>. I feel awkward rejecting an article that appears to be a translation of an existing German Wikipedia article, but I'm going to do it anyway. The German Wikipedia article appears to have no listed sources. Since Wikipedia articles are only reliable and credible to the extent that they have verifiable sources, that means that a sourceless Wikipedia article can't be considered reliable or credible. The AfC policy here on the English Wikipedia is that articles with no sources are rejected; so an article that only refers to another Wikipedia article that itself has no sources must be rejected too. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 21:38, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Seymour has three forms that are fought after he is killed in Macalania Temple. The first form is Seymour Natus, which is the easiest of the three forms casting only Break and Flare. The second form is Seymour Flux, a form that inflicted zombie status frequently. The last form was Seymour Omnis the most dangerous form. In all of these battles Seymour used a fiend called Motiochiris to restore his health, but when its health was gone it drain Seymours health relative to health it lost, another thing was that during the first two fights with him, Seymour would cast Banish at aeons.</p>

<p>Kris Nebroso, aka Chris Osborne, was born on the 28th March 1982. He started his "DJ-ing life" back in 1997 at the Airwaves 105FM Radio Station based in Redruth. Whilst there, he met a host of other up-and-coming DJs / MCs now on the circuit, including Devinyl, Wideye, and MC Express who he keenly observed for their natural flair and faultless talent on the decks, and on the mic.</p>
<p>His love of music started way before that, and he puts his fondness for melody down to a childhood of listening constantly to various electronic music which he grew up on and was never without. He says, "Back in the old skool days when your average fifteen year old was listening to Gabber Techno, Hardcore and The Prodigy etc, I was listening to Jean Michel Jarre, Vangelis and Mike Oldfield! I was always searching for really emotional tracks and specific key / chord changes, which created a certain aura to the track."</p>
<p>Whilst at Airwaves FM, he started broadcasting in the studio live on-air and quickly became hooked on mixing CDs, but not vinyl....YET! He comments, "Back in '98, Trance was just faultless for me. I think thats why I got into it so quickly thanks to producers like, Taucher, Tandu, Marc et Claude, Lange etc. These guys put so much energy and emotion into their tunes, its unreal!" Whilst he was mixing the more commercial side of trance, DJ Devinyl was playing what Kris describes as "The '98 sound!" "It was wicked, uptempo, German, emotional brilliance" he says. "I loved it at the time but found it was also a bit too hard for me because of DJs like, M-Zone and Mark EG playing it. A bit out of my league when you consider I was buying stacks and stacks of Positiva, Hooj Choons and Multiply material etc!"</p>
<p>In the meantime, he spent his hard earned on a pair of Numark TT-1700 decks and an SSM 2040 mixer. His crossover to using vinyl came in the second year of Airwaves FM where he met good friend and production partner, DJ B-More aka Marc Blackmore.</p>
<p>"Marc and I instantly knew their was a trance chemistry going on when we used to have LONG conversations about who we regarded as quality producers, what labels we were into, and of course, what tunes we loved!" "We started going round to one anothers house and comparing tunes and found their was a certain pattern to the majority of them.. Beautiful Melodies."</p>
<p>Although now a Trance / Tech Trance DJ, he still has time for certain German and Dutch producers who make the more luscious tunes. "Back in '98/'99, Marc and I were well into both these countries top DJs and producers. From Holland we were listening to output from the likes of, Ferry Corsten, Tiesto, Vincent De Moor, Rank 1, Cor Fjinemann etc before they even became established over here!! And from Germany, it was always DJ Taucher, DJ Tandu and their Ayla productions that we thought highly of. We knew that this was the direction we wanted to take, in terms of musical style, and consequently, ended up buying lots of it!"</p>
<p>When the Airwaves FM broadcasts came to an end, Kris was ready to do his own thing and decided to take time out to perfect his DJ-ing skills and spend more time "bashing" the keyboard! "I had a brief lull where I just constantly mixed and made tapes around early 2000 because I was so desperate to succeed and compete with other local DJs, I knew I could do it, I just needed motivation" he comments. He still kept in contact with other DJs who he had met through Airwaves FM, but none more so, than DJ B-More.</p>
<p>Due to intermittent periods of ill health, Kris was unable to pursue his goal of becoming big at the time, but at the beginning of 2002, his life physically, mentally, and musically, changed totally, according to him.</p>
<p>"I had an operation for my in Jan 2002 and luckily came out feeling a new person in terms of EVERYTHING! The whole of 2002 for me was not so much of a new beginning, but more of a "getting back to how it should be feeling." "To put it bluntly, I was as high as a kite!" he says. "My enthusiasm for Trance was back to what it was in '98 by this point because I felt there was a definite lack of quality between then and now."</p>
<p>Still wanting to make a break, he waited for an opportunity to get himself known, but knew only too well it wasn't always achieved by sending in mix tapes to clubs and selling yourself to upper league promoters.</p>
<p>Just as he thought 2002 couldn't get any better, old friend DJ Lee Hedger gave him a slot at the Railway Inn. "Within weeks, all the local DJ talent was flocking to the Railway, desperate to make an impact on the local people that used the pub for a Sunday wind-down." "It was wicked though" says Kris, "because there was definitely rivalry among all of us, but it never got aggressive or out of hand. I think the main reason for this was because, out of sheer coincidence, no two DJs had an alike style, which made it a lot easier to work the nights out." In the meantime, the Railway nights were going down a storm and there were a couple of followers who never failed to turn-up for a Sunday evening, "They know who they are!", he says</p>
<p>As the winter months were approaching, Kris recalls a distinct lack of enthusiasm among the DJs, including himself, for the nights. "We all wanted something bigger, better and louder! which was understandable."</p>
<p>Around that time, DJ Lee Hedger left Cornwall, and indeed the Railway, behind, to move to London to work and live.</p>
<p>"He handed the responsibilities of organising and running the nights over to me." But one week prior to Lee's departure, an unknown face appeared in the Railway on a peak-time, Sunday night. I remember saying to Lee, "Who's that over there?" he laughs. "Lee told me some promoter was trying to take over the Railway Sunday nights, so we should all keep an eye out for what he was planning." This guy turned out to be, Mr John "Loud'n'Proud" Mulligan. "This was it!" exclaims Kris. "It seemed too good to be true what John was offering, or had planned at first, but after getting to know him, and briefly trying to suss him out, most of the DJs knew that, as a team, we were onto a good thing, and could certainly make a success of the things we had been waiting for....... Catch Kris Nebroso DJ-ing at Falmouth's MI Bar every fortnight.</p>

Escalating Density Training (EDT) is a new type of weight training, made popular by Charles Staley, which emphasizes stressing muscles with increasing density workouts in the same period of time (an example would be lifting a 25-pound weight 20 times, whereas the last workout involved lifting the 25-pound weight 15 times). The important thing is increasing stress on muscles, not doing a set number of repetitions (the traditional 3 x 12, etc.). EDT does not agree that lifting slowly is always the best way to lift, and also disagrees that one should lift a certain number of sets per workout. Workouts become dynamic and ever-changing with EDT, and it is the job of the lifter to determine what exactly to do. The idea is to emphasize quality over quantity, but also to make each session fast and challenging.</p>

<p>Dreaming of Clombus: A Boyhood in the Bronx is a memoir by Michael Pearson published in 1999. The memoir traces the author's experience in the Bronx during the late 1950's through the 1960's. It is a vivid account of both one boy's coming of age and the story of New York City's most northern borough, one famous for Yankee Stadium, Edgar Allan Poe, and the sort of blight sometimes associated with the Road warrior movies.</p>

<p>Donald Hunsberger is conductor emeritus of the Eastman Wind Ensemble, having served as its music director from 1965 to 2002. He also holds the title professor emeritus of conducting and ensembles at Eastman, where he served for many years as chair of the conducting and ensembles department.</p>
<p>Under his leadership, the Eastman Wind Ensemble continued its development as an international performance model in the creation of numerous new works for the wind band, providing a prime example of contemporary performance techniques as demonstrated on numerous recordings on Sony Classics, CBS Masterworks, Mercury Records, DGG Records, Philips, and Decca among others. In 1987 his scores and recording of Carnaval featuring Wynton Marsalis with the Eastman Wind Ensemble were nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Solo Performance with Orchestra category. His most recent recording project with the EWE is a three-CD set celebrating its 50th anniversary. Under Hunsberger's direction the EWE performed on six tours of Japan and Taiwan between 1990 and 2000, and one throughout Japan and Southeast Asia in 1978 for the Kambara Agency and the U.S. State Department.</p>
<p>In addition to performing over 100 premiere performances, Hunsberger had been involved in writing projects including the books The Wind Ensemble and Its Repertoire (Warner Bros. Pub.), The Art of Conducting (with Roy Ernst, Random House), The Emory Remington Warmup Studies (Accura Music), and numerous articles published in educational journals. He has been recognized in publications for his innovative scoring techniques for varying instrumentations of the contemporary wind band. His research into the history and development of scoring for wind bands in America has led to numerous articles in WindWorks, a journal for wind conductors, performers and composers.</p>
<p>He has been the recipient of a number of awards for research (Homespun America: The National Association for State and Local Historians), pedagogy (the Eastman Alumni Teaching Award and Herbert Eisenhart Award; Wiley Housewright Fellow, Florida State University), and performance (the Crystal Award from the Asahi Broadcasting Company, Osaka, Japan; the Ehud Eziel Award, Jerusalem, Israel).</p>
<p>He is a past president of the College Band Directors National Association and has served as a member of the boards of CBDNA, the World Association of Symphonic Bands and Ensembles, and the Conductor's Guild.</p>
<p>In the orchestral world Hunsberger has created and conducted performances of orchestral accompaniments to over 18 silent films with 50 orchestras including the National, San Francisco, Houston, Vancouver, Utah, Virginia, San Diego, Syracuse and North Carolina Symphony Orchestras, and the Rochester, Buffalo, and Calgary Philharmonic Orchestras among others.</p>

<p>Buoyant density is a common measure of size of viral particles. In addition, this method can be used to physically separate different sizes and types of viruses from a mixed population. [ref 2] Finally, this can be used to separate viral particles from other types of cells and proteins that may be co-isolated from virally-infected tissues or blood [ref 3]. This method is also referred to as "density gradient centrifugation." [ref 1]</p>
<p>Cesium chloride (CsCl) and sucrose are the most commonly used additions (solutes) to form the density gradient. (CsCl is used this description.) Briefly, the solution containing the virus of interest is mixed in a solution of highly concentrated CsCl or sucrose. The mixture is then placed in a centrifuge tube that can withstand high centrifugal forces. The tube is then subjected to ucentrifugation for (usually) 24 hours at high speeds (usually greater than 20,000 g). (This is often called ultracentrifugation). The ultracentrifugation separates out the solute into a gradual density gradient so that the high density concentration of CsCl is at the bottom of the tube, while the lower concentration (and hence lower density) is at the top of the tube. Where the viral particles migrate in the tube (closer to the top, or closer to the bottom) is an indication of their size, and hence buoyant density.</p>
<p>Other methods for density centrifugation may require the researcher to physically layer different concentrations in the tube before centrifugation (forming their own gradient), and then adding the viral mixture to the top [ref 1]. These methods are more difficult, but required centrifugation times are less, and the physical separation of the virus from other sized viral particles is more efficient.</p>

"For the last half century, Frank Frazetta has dominated the art world with his images of fierce warriors, helpless princesses, and fantastical creatures set in the most lavish landscapes. His impact upon the worlds of Fantasy Art and Film has been unparalleled.</p>
<p>Journey with us to a place where up until now, only the privileged have ever been, and witness the man behind the legend. See what hardships he overcame and choices he made that drastically changed the course of his career.</p>
<p>Share an intimate moment with this artistic virtuoso as we unfold Frazetta’s extraordinary life story."</p>
<p>The documentary was released on VHS back in April of 2003. The DVD was released in November of 2004. by Lance Laspina <a href="http://www.cinemachine.net" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cinemachine.net" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> www.cinemachine.net</p>
<p>It is literally impossible to be involved in the fantasy genre without having been touched by Frank Frazetta. His ubiquitous paintings are visceral, dramatic, and infused with emotional power. Fierce, half-naked warriors seem ready to leap from the canvas. Curvaceous sirens (who look like real women, with their paunchy bellies and full, rounded bottoms) exude raw sexuality with their piercing stares. They live in outrageously interesting settings: jungles; deserts; exotic fortresses; alien worlds a-crawl with snarling, razor-toothed beasties. You name it, Frazetta has painted it, and probably with as much effect as anyone ever will.</p>
<p>In 2003, Frazetta was the subject of a lovingly produced documentary called Frazetta: Painting with Fire, which is easily one of the best such films ever made. Painting with Fire features conversations with the artist himself (now an ailing septuagenarian living in Pennsylvania), vintage home-movie footage, conversations with the artist himself, and a veritable Who's Who in the Genre-Art World talking about Frazetta's talent and his impact on the genre community.</p>
<p>There was only one thing wrong with the 2003 release (see our original review): it was on VHS, a technology soon to go the way of the dodo. That issue has been resolved, however, as Frazetta: Painting with Fire has now been released as a stunningly packaged, two-disk DVD set!</p>
<p>Disk One contains the two-hour documentary, with optional audio commentary by director Lance Laspina and producer Jeremy J. DiFiore, and several behind-the-scenes clips. Disk Two is a mixed bag: there are several deleted scenes and a great image gallery with lots of gorgeous paintings and sketches; but the outtakes are only mildly amusing, and there's a "visual diary" section dedicated to Fire and Ice (a Ralph Bakshi rotoscoped monstrosity based on Frazetta's work, which is worse than his Lord of the Rings, if such a thing is possible). Admittedly, these criticisms are quibbles - Frazetta: Painting with Fire is a must-have DVD for anyone who's a fan of this talented artist's influential work. Decide for yourself if Frazetta's paintings can be considered "fine art" or "mere illustration."
