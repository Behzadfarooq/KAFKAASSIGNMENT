<li>This article has been deleted twice and recreated twice. So far I cannot find anything in the speedy deletion policy which states why this can be recreated even though the author is claiming ignorance of the original vote and that they are not the same person as the first article author, although the article is dicussing the same band.

<p>OK, here we go again. Despite the unanimous delete votes from the previous VfD, this article was listed on VfU, and after a contentious vote, there was a <i>slight majority</i> to Undelete. As per proper VfU procedure, the article <i>should</i> have been re-listed on VfD, but that was not done, so I have now done so. This band is not notable. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 22:12, Apr 30, 2005 (UTC)</p>

They're both pretty important labels, serving as an important "incubator" for bands like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_O.C._Supertones_e44a.html" title="The O.C. Supertones">The O.C.

If a band joins one of these labels, they do tour on a national scale, and they do get a strong fan base in the Christian circles, beyond what they'd get as a local band or as an internet-only band. A Google query for the band name now results in over 68,000 hits, and "falling up" crashings gets <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22falling+up%22+crashings" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22falling+up%22+crashings" rel="nofollow">about 5000 hits</a> (which is pretty good for a Christian rock album; it out-Googles several recent albums by the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsboys.html" title="Newsboys">Newsboys</a>, which were atop the Christian charts for a while, for example: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=newsboys+%22step+up+to+the+microphone%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=newsboys+%22step+up+to+the+microphone%22" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=newsboys+%22take+me+to+your+leader%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=newsboys+%22take+me+to+your+leader%22" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=newsboys+%22love+liberty+disco%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=newsboys+%22love+liberty+disco%22" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 02:42, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> sorry but this band still isnt that notable. BEC Recordings is not Epic or Warners - its a specialist label for mostly Christian bands many of them very obscure. A fair slice of those Google hits are by fans leaving messages on blogs about the band. As has been pointed out on vfd before, the Google Test is not a good indicator of notability for music or pornography. Their "national" tour seems to be mostly confined to churchs, religious festivals and small stadiums. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesBurns_5f2a.html" title="User:JamesBurns">JamesBurns</a> 04:12, 1 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't want this to sound like a personal attack, but... if every band that is on this site has to have a page full of #1 hits and several national tours in which they sold out every <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a> stadium, should we delete all the others (including those who started some of the more obscure musical genres)? That's a strict criterion; Christian rock basically is on the fringes of mainstream rock, so its bands don't sell a lot of records and are mainly stuck in the church culture. Pretty much any Christian artist that isn't <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Day_0bc9.html" title="Third Day">Third Day</a> doesn't crank out #1 hits in the general market or sell out a very large stadium in every show. (Also just a side note: several Christian festivals - see <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornerstone_Festival_4f45.html" title="Cornerstone Festival">Cornerstone Festival</a> for one of the examples - draw tens of thousands of guests.) Falling Up is also featured on <a href="http://www.xthealbum.com" class="external text" title="http://www.xthealbum.com" rel="nofollow">X 2005</a>, a compilation of Christian rock hits from 17 bands, most of which have articles on this site that have been accepted without question. If you'd like to go through and delete all of those bands too, go ahead and do it. But keep things standard across the site. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 05:09, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I never mentioned #1 hits. Should we make exceptions to Christian bands just because they wish to be identified in that genre? I dont think so. Notability should be across the board, not just one particular market. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesBurns_5f2a.html" title="User:JamesBurns">JamesBurns</a> 08:14, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That depends. The Billboard Christian Rock and Heatseekers charts aren't based on many tens of thousands of unit sales a week like the rock and pop charts. Making #1 on those charts would still be a little bit notable. Merely showing up on the genre charts (Top Ten albums of the year? Top 100 albums of the week?) is not notable by itself. How meaningfully they "charted" isn't shown in these comments. Having one release on BEC Recordings doesn't make a band notable; they have to do that themselves. I'm not convinced one way or the other by this discussion. No vote. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 14:44, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Apologies for going silent; my access to the wikipedia is limited (I'm only getting on at the school library) but I'm still here. You also might be able to check IPs or something if you want evidence that I'm different from the first guy to make the article... Also, as far as notability goes; with Falling Up's Crashings being ranked as 9,427 in music sales. Britney Spears' "Oops, I did it again" album is ranked at #9,591 in music sales. Granted, if you added up all of Britney's albums she'd certainly outperform Falling Up, and this is only a statistic on amazon.com, but for them to outsell one of Britney's albums probably means that they're notable enough for listing on the wikipedia. (And the article <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falling_Up_8dcf.html" title="Falling Up">Falling Up</a> is about an album by Digby. On amazon.com's music rankings, Digby's album is ranked 96,371 in sales. It seems like Falling Up the band might be more notable than Digby's album, yet Digby's album has no controversy about it). <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECookiemobsta_42f5.html" title="User:Cookiemobsta">-Cookiemobsta</a></li>
<li>Controversial to wikipedia, but not notable elsewhere - lets not get carried away with self importance here. Push comes to shove the general public doesnt give a rats behind about whats being said in this thread. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesBurns_5f2a.html" title="User:JamesBurns">JamesBurns</a> 05:19, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just for the record, I've turned the main <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falling_Up_8dcf.html" title="Falling Up">Falling Up</a> article into a disambig in order to reflect this and in order to eliminate redundancy with the article on the Digby album. By the way, I added more information to the article about the band. Turns out they've broken a sales record set by <a href="../../../k/u/t/Kutless.html" title="Kutless">Kutless</a>. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 23:43, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, still not notable no matter how much is added to the article. <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIam_04a8.html" title="User:Iam">Iam</a> 03:14, May 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As a big fan of Christian Rock, I can tell you this band has gotten heavy play on christian radio stations in the last year (as a side note, they're much better than a lot of recent bland bands like Kutless) <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKertrats_a151.html" title="User:Kertrats">Kertrats</a> 00:45, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
